BRAZIELS, MCDONALD CAN'T PLAY THIS SEASON
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   FORT WORTH _ When TCU's highly touted football recruiting class
reports today, two players will be missing and another won't be
eligible to play this season.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs Jerome and Jerrod Braziel of Dunbar High School
met with Horned Frogs coach Dennis Franchione yesterday to tell him
they didn't qualify academically and didn't plan to enroll until
January. Linebacker LaMarcus McDonald from Waco High will report
but won't be academically eligible. He will be admitted as a
partial qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed,'' said Jerrod Braziel, who along with his
brother just recently found out they wouldn't be eligible. ``We
committed ourselves to TCU. Now, we're going to work hard to get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braziels didn't make the minimum scores required by the NCAA
on the standardized tests to be eligible. They said they were close
and would spend the fall semester working to get the necessary
scores, including taking SAT and ACT preparatory classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that Jerrod and Jerome will be with it
sometime,'' Franchione said. ``I still feel really good about this
group.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU signed 21 players during recruiting, and the other 19,
including McDonald, are expected to report today. The freshmen will
begin practice tomorrow night before beginning two-a-day practices
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As a partial qualifier, McDonald can practice with the team but
is ineligible to play. He will be eligible to play next fall and
will be a sophomore athletically. The lost year of eligibility can
be gained back if McDonald is on course to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   TCU athletic director Eric Hyman said the school has a policy
against admitting partial qualifiers but reviews students on a
case-by-case basis. The case first has to be approved by Hyman and
then is passed on to the provost for approval. McDonald's case was
approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we are disappointed that the class isn't
complete,'' Franchione said. ``But this is a temporary setback.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Employers hired new workers at a surprisingly
robust pace last month and had to pay substantially more to find
them, the government reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While good news in most respects, the report underscored the
mounting pressures in the labor market and substantially increased
the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates
at its next meeting, on Aug. 24, as insurance against an
inflationary spiral in wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate in July remained steady at 4.3 percent,
the Labor Department said. Meanwhile, employers added an estimated
310,000 non-farm jobs in the month, 50 percent more than analysts
had anticipated, suggesting that economic growth rebounded early in
the summer after tailing off during the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings in July rose by one-half of one percent,
to $13.29 from $13.23, continuing a gradual acceleration of wage
growth in recent months. Earnings in July grew 3.8 percent over the
previous year, up from a 3.5 percent annual pace in May and a 3.7
percent annual rate in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor is getting more expensive per hour, and we're still
using a lot of it,'' said Donald Ratajczak, the director of the
Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, which is far more attuned to the dangers of
resurgent inflation and higher interest rates than to the benefits
of full employment and rising wages, stock and bond prices fell.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 79.79 points to close
at 10,714.03. The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond
plummeted, sending its yield, which moves inversely with the price,
to 6.17 percent late in the day from 6.04 percent on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy eight-and-a-half years into an expansion that
has kicked promptly back into high gear every time it has shown
signs of flagging, the Labor Department report showed that job
growth, adjusted to take account of normal seasonal variations, was
strong in almost all industries.
</P>
<P>
   Of special note was a jump of 31,000 in manufacturing
employment, the first increase in that sector since General Motors
workers returned from a strike last August, and the first not
related to the strike since March 1998. Manufacturers had been hit
especially hard last year by the fallout from the global financial
crisis that began in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said last month
that the central bank was watching especially intently for any
signs that the combination of low unemployment and strong job
growth was generating wage increases that could ignite inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists said that Friday's data provided more than
enough ammunition for the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark
federal funds target rate by another quarter point later this
month, to 5.25 percent. The central bank last raised the rate by a
quarter point in June, citing the potential for wage growth in a
tight labor market to outstrip the strong gains in productivity
generated by huge investments in computers and other technology.
</P>
<P>
   The economists said that Friday's numbers reinforced a trend
seen in various economic reports in the last few weeks, including
signs of a dropoff in the growth of productivity, or hourly output
per worker, and a rise in the wage component of the employment cost
index.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data confirm the reacceleration in the economy that I've
been looking for in the summer,'' said Richard Berner, an economist
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He estimated that growth is now
running at a 4 percent annual rate, up from 2.3 percent in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time they also suggest we're seeing the impact of
tight labor markets on wage setting,'' he said. ``The gentle
acceleration we're seeing in average hourly earnings confirms the
trend we're seeing in the employment cost index and means the Fed
will almost certainly tighten policy on Aug. 24.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on trading in the futures markets, investors are all but
certain that the Fed will raise rates this month. Futures contracts
on federal funds for September yielded 5.23 percent Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said the case for a rate increase this month was
not air tight, although they conceded that if the Federal Reserve
did not move this month it would probably do so at its subsequent
meeting in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed cut interest rates three times in quarter-point
increments last fall when economies and financial markets around
the world showed signs of seizing up. Many analysts now expect the
central bank to take back the remaining two of those cuts and
perhaps tighten policy a bit more over the next six months or so if
the economy remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect is already generating political pressure on
Greenspan not to squeeze the economy too hard in an effort to
eliminate inflationary pressures that so far have been more
theoretical than real. Despite rising wages, general price
increases so far have been well-contained, and some sectors of the
economy, including agriculture and manufacturing, complain that
monetary policy is too tight.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the Republican presidential candidate, began
running radio advertising this week in Iowa, ground zero in the
dismal farm sector, criticizing Greenspan for pushing rates too
high at a time when crop prices are depressed. The National
Association of Manufacturers released a pointed analysis Friday
concluding that even an acceleration in labor cost growth to four
percent would result in only a small pickup in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Greenspan has made clear that he views an ever-tighter
labor market as a clear threat to generate inflation and endanger
the stability of the long expansion, which, if it continues, will
surpass at the end of this year the record set in the 1960s. And
while the unemployment rate has hovered at 4.2 percent to 4.3
percent since March, the pace of job creation has picked up in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The 310,000 new jobs created in July ``followed a 273,000 gain
in June and was well above the average monthly increase of 208,000
for the first half of 1999,'' said Katharine Abraham, the Labor
Department's commissioner of labor statistics. ``Manufacturing and
construction employment increased over the month, and several
service-producing industries posted sizable gains.''
</P>
<P>
   The rate of job growth over the last year is still relatively
moderate at 2.3 percent, said David Orr, chief economist at First
Union Bank. But he said that even at that rate the pool of
available workers is being steadily depleted because the labor
force has been growing at only 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In congressional testimony last month, Greenspan said that ``if
the pool of job seekers shrinks sufficiently, upward pressures on
wage costs are inevitable,'' and that such wage increases ``have
invariably presaged rising inflation.''

ON BASEBALL: WIN OR LOSE, VALENTINE CARRIES A BURDEN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Years and years from now, fans of the 1999 New York
Mets will tell their grandchildren the tale of how, 55 games and
three fired coaches into the season, Bobby Valentine declared to
the world, ``In the next 55 games, if we're not better, I shouldn't
be the manager.''
</P>
<P>
   That story was related to Davey Johnson Friday night, and when
he was told that the Mets had run up a 39-15 record since the
Valentine declaration, he said, ``Those three new coaches must
really be something.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has had experience losing a job as manager, was at
Shea Stadium with his woefully underachieving Los Angeles Dodgers,
just in time to complete Valentine's 55-game cycle. The Mets' 2-1
victory even made their manager a prophet in his own time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said, `Do you want to win eight in a row?''' Valentine
said, recalling that agonizing night exactly two months earlier,
when the Mets had just lost eight in a row. ``I said, no, I'd
rather have a sustained run; something like 40 and 15 would be
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty and 15 has been terrific for the Mets. The run has
catapulted them from 27-28, in third place, six games out of the
lead, to 67-43, in first place, 1 1/2 games ahead of the perennial
champion Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confident that they'd play better,'' Valentine said
Friday night. ``That's why I said it. I'm really proud of them, the
way they've come together. It's a good team right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips is the man who made necessary the news conference
at which Valentine issued his declaration. As the general manager,
Phillips had fired half of the manager's coaching staff, including
the two coaches with whom he was the closest.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Valentine uttered his 55-game remark, some listeners
suspected he did it before Phillips could suggest that the
manager's job was on the line. Last night Phillips took no credit
for the timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my line of demarcation,'' he said. ``He threw it out
there. It does not have any special significance to me. I like
where we are today. We responded to the challenges of the season
and to adversity. I don't think we could ask for much more from
where we were to where we are today.''
</P>
<P>
   As much credit as the manager has to receive, along with the
players, for the two-month turnaround, he has not been free of
questionable and puzzling behavior during that time. A series of
incidents and comments have left Valentine's employers and others
shaking their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Will the season produce a more bizarre sight than Valentine
standing at the fringe of the dugout in a sunglasses-and-mustache
disguise after he had been ejected from that June 9 game?
</P>
<P>
   A few days later he engaged in a startling bit of revisionist
history, talking about the great job he had done cleaning up ``the
abyss that was here 2 1/2 years ago'' and about the ``placid and
peaceful'' atmosphere he had created. He apparently forgot that
Dallas Green, his predecessor, had cleaned up the mess and that
Pete Harnisch and Todd Hundley did not find peace and serenity in
Valentine's clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Valentine made a string of incredible statements,
starting with his criticism of the team's front office for filling
Shea Stadium by playing merengue music and honoring Sammy Sosa. The
crowd, Valentine complained, cheered for Sosa and not the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   (Friday night was Hispanic Night at Shea. Asked before the game
if he felt the Mets would fare better than they did on Sosa night,
Valentine said: ``It's Latin night. We have a few very good Latin
players, so they should definitely be behind us.'')
</P>
<P>
   After the Mets acquired Kenny Rogers in a trade, Valentine was
asked what it meant to manage the pitcher he once had in Texas. His
reply said nothing about Rogers but a lot about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just means,'' he said, ``that everyone who has tried to run
me out of the game hasn't succeeded. I've stayed around a while.''
Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Then a week ago, after the Mets arrived in first place for the
first time, Valentine again took an innocuous question and answered
with an eyebrow-raising response. Did it seem, he was asked, like a
long progression from the day he took over late in the 1996 season
to that day?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been obviously a progression of nonrecognition,'' he
said. ``No matter what we do, there's very little credit. And now
that we're in first, we'll still get no credit until we finish the
job. Nothing's going to change what's said or felt about our team
until it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   To a follow-up question, Valentine said the feeling was directed
mostly at him. ``But that just comes with the territory,'' he said,
the territory of being Bobby Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   It is a heavy burden. With eight more games (the eighth comes
next Saturday in San Francisco), he will go to No. 3 on the list of
people who have managed the most games without finishing first. His
1,659 games will trail only the 1,837 of Paul Richards and the
2,962 of Jimmy Dykes.
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine is only 52 games away from removing himself from
that list. ``No predictions on that,'' he said after the game. ``I
think we're going to be a good team right to the end of the
season.''

RIGHT MOVE AND WRIGHT MOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's lesson in NBA-sponsored fiscal responsibility is
provided by Eric Piatkowski.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a genius to look around the league and see
there's really no money out there,'' said Piatkowski, who seemed to
challenge his own theory Friday by noticing the wisdom in agreeing
to a four-year, $12 million deal that will prolong what has been a
five-year career with the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   His alternative was a two-year, $4.2 million contract with
Golden State. Piatkowski, it would seem, chose the smarter money.
</P>
<P>
   A genius also isn't necessary to figure out that by threatening
to sign a one-year, $2 million middle-class exception with the
Lakers, Lorenzen Wright, Piatkowski's teammate the past three
seasons, is threatening to chuck conventional economic wisdom into
the drink.
</P>
<P>
   But Wright's agent, Robert Fayne, met with the Lakers on Friday
to kick that notion around. The Lakers also contacted the Clippers
about possible sign-and-trade deals involving bit players on the
Laker roster whose unloading could provide a more lucrative deal
for Wright.
</P>
<P>
   However, despite outdated map readings to the contrary, turnip
trucks no longer take the scenic route past the Sports Arena.
According to a Clippers source, any sign-and-trade notions
involving Wright and the NBA's two L.A. teams are going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves Wright staring at the Laker exception, while his
agent hopes another interested team can make the Clips an
acceptable sign-and-trade offer. Atlanta could be back in the
picture with $4.5 million in cap room and the enticement of draft
picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still talk,'' said Elgin Baylor, the Clippers' vice
president of basketball operations. ``But I have no idea what he's
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'' is Fayne, who could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Piatkowski, when reached at his off-season home in Nebraska,
said Wright would be wise to follow his lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just have to swallow your pride,'' Piatkowski
said, ``and accept the deal that is best for you and your family.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wright, such strategy would have allowed him to grab the
six-year, $30 million deal the Clippers offered. Instead, Wright
and Fayne shopped around for a team willing to spend, oh, $8
million per season on a 6-foot-11 backup center/power forward.
</P>
<P>
   When that animal left no tracks, Fayne turned back to the
Clippers, who could have helped out his client by signing and
trading Wright to a team that would clear acceptable cap space by
sending its wretched refuse to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   But accepting a deal for draft picks is less risky for the
Clips, because they wouldn't be obligated to pay unwanted players.
So they are still listening to offers, while Fayne keeps the
Lakers, who reportedly would prefer adding Toronto free agent
Charles Oakley, on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the rush for us?'' a Clippers source said.
</P>
<P>
   But time did become an issue for Piatkowski, who responded to a
take-it-or-leave-it deadline for reasons of cash and familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the money, and there's a comfort level there for me and
my wife,'' said Piatkowski of the Clippers, for whom he provided 10
points per game last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' unfinished business includes signing draft prize
Lamar Odom (Monday), dealing with Maurice Taylor and agent David
Falk on a contract extension (Aug. 20), re-signing last season's
undrafted rookie surprise Tyrone Nesby (whenever) and mulling their
point-guard prospects.
</P>
<P>
   One name surfacing as a possible answer to the last issue is
Haywoode Workman, a free agent who played for the Milwaukee Bucks
last season.

BACKERS OF FOOTBALL FOR L.A. RENEW EFFORTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even as critics threatened a referendum to block
any public spending, Los Angeles officials rallied to save the
Memorial Coliseum as the home of a new National Football League
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas and
representatives of the competing ownership groups appealed in
private phone calls and public pronouncements that the NFL should
reconsider its decision to end its agreement to consider only the
Coliseum as a site for football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in contact with the NFL and assured them that the
Coliseum is still the most attractive option,'' Ridley-Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gov. Gray Davis withdrew the state as a dealmaker
and the NFL responded by announcing that other stadium sites in the
metropolitan area would be considered until the Sept. 15 deadline
on talks with Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's action left Los Angeles' chances of winning a
franchise in serious doubt and made Houston the favorite for the
league's 32nd team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been working on this for three years and it should not
be discarded overnight because of problems with one person,'' said
Ridley-Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   That one person is investment banker Bill Chadwick, who was
designated by Davis to be the point man for the state in the
negotiations and who drew the NFL's ire this week when he tried to
pull out of the negotiations, saying nothing further could be done.
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials, in response to Chadwick's comments, said they
would open the field of sites under consideration to any in the Los
Angeles market interested in becoming home to a new professional
football team.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick left the city on Friday and aides said he would have no
comment on the new controversy. Davis aides said all state dealings
with the NFL would continue to be through Chadwick.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials, however, held out hope L.A. could still win a
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find if you're cool in defeat, you can turn it around,''
Riordan said during an interview on the Michael Jackson show on
KRLA-AM (1110). ``And I think that's what Eli Broad is doing, what
I'm doing and what Mark Ridley-Thomas is doing. It ain't over until
the lady sings.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said he still considers having a football team at the
Coliseum as a top priority, a means of reviving the Exposition Park
area as well as attracting businesses to the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much the jobs created at the Coliseum as the
corporations that look at having a professional football team as
important,'' Riordan said. ``They move here and bring high-paying
jobs with them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Councilman Joel Wachs and Jon Coupal
of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association threatened to stage a
statewide vote over whether public money should be used to attract
a professional sports franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason tax dollars should be used to help
billionaire owners and gazillionaire athletes,'' Wachs said. ``We
ask the people to vote on whether we should build more police and
fire stations or libraries. Well, we can ask them if they want
their money to go for a professional football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachs dismissed the threat of the NFL going to a site other than
the Coliseum, saying he saw it as a bargaining ploy to try to get
more money from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Under one proposal, the state would provide $150 million from a
bond issue to be repaid with revenue from the parking structures
the money would pay for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be watching,'' said Wachs, who emerged as a critic of
public financing in the debate over the Staples Center Arena. ``I
am hearing all these words about no net cost. Well, I think there
should be no cost to the taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupal released a survey of 600 voters statewide that showed 80
percent opposed use of any tax dollars for professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the NFL understands the depth of feeling about
this issue,'' Coupal said.
</P>
<P>
   Ridley-Thomas said he will be talking with NFL officials over
the weekend as he renewed his criticism of Chadwick's handling of
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just go in there and make demands and then walk
away,'' Ridley-Thomas said. ``This is a process and there are
certain steps to be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   The councilman said he would be talking with NFL officials
throughout the weekend to try to reverse the current situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum Commission has scheduled an emergency meeting for
Monday, in part to consider a proposal submitted by Broad.
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire businessman said he remains committed to the
Coliseum, and offered the NFL a nonrefundable payment of $2 million
to give him six days to develop a final plan.
</P>
<P>
   His proposals include the $150 million state bond issue for
parking and public responsibility for any work done outside the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The owners would pay $1 million a rent a year for 55 years and
an NFL franchise fee of $550 million with half to be paid up front
and the remainder to be paid over a period to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be looking at that proposal specifically and I think
it's something we can live with,'' Commission President Sheldon
Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who serves as Coliseum Commission
vice chairman, questioned the NFL's sincerity on wanting to come to
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic case of snatching defeat from the jaws of
victory,'' Yaroslavsky said. ``It's hard to know what's going on.
If someone was trying to blow up this deal, then the way the NFL
has behaved in the last week would be the way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all blaming Chadwick, but he came up with a proposal.
If they were serious, they would come up with a counteroffer.
Instead, they publicly challenged the taxpayers of Los Angeles to
come up with more cash. It makes you wonder if all this talk of the
Coliseum was a charade.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky said the NFL could cut $200 million off the cost of
the Coliseum deal by reducing parking by half and eliminating
extras.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're talking about the owners fielding a competitive team,
but they keep adding costs to the construction,'' Yaroslavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Another official, asking not to be identified, voiced similar
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL keeps moving the goal line and we never are able to
find out what they really want,'' the official said. ``At some
point, someone has to make a decision and they don't seem to want
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL pronouncement raised many new possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Hollywood Park in Inglewood said they were studying
the latest proposal and were not sure what steps would be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Businessman Marvin Davis has an option on 100 acres on the site
for a potential stadium. That option runs through September.
</P>
<P>
   In Irwindale, City Manager Bob Griego said residents would
likely be lukewarm to any proposal to build an NFL stadium in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The residents would be very cautious about any dealings with a
stadium after what they went through the last time,'' Griego said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the city suffered a very expensive and painful lesson
when it put down a $10 million deposit for its deal with Raiders
owner Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the agreement to build a stadium in the city fall
through, but the city was never refunded its deposit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Griego, who has been following the recent negotiations,
said: ``It crossed my mind that if the NFL was to come to
California, they might have to increase their options.''

SO WHAT IS VALDES' VALUE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last offseason, Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone
locked up Carlos Perez with a three-year contract and offered Chan
Ho Park a four-year, $32 million contract that he turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Economics may keep the Dodgers from taking a similar path with
right-hander Ismael Valdes, eligible for arbitration after the
season and free agency after the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we're considering, but one thing we don't have
is payroll flexibility,'' Malone said. ``That's something that
factors into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who said he wants to remain with the Dodgers' long-term
plans, makes $4.275 million this season and is in line to make
about $6 million next season. But if the Dodgers were to agree on a
multi-year deal with the 25-year-old, it would most likely cost
them $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, that would create a further crimp in the Dodgers'
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are in the position of wanting to move a few players
with expensive, multi-year contracts to lessen the $80 million
payroll burden and create flexibility. If they can trade Eric
Young, Perez or even Raul Mondesi _ who combined are owed $42.1
million over the next two seasons _ it would ease the payroll
situation. Signing Valdes to a long-term deal could minimize the
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, seeing what in-season contract talks did to Park, said
he doesn't even want to think about a deal until after the season,
but indicated it was possible he would sign a multi-year pact.
Valdes is 8-10, but he leads Dodgers starters with a 3.31 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Honor this: The Mets have grown accustomed to honoring players
before games, but a ceremony for ex-Met Todd Hundley was wiped off
the agenda a few weeks ago by Mets manager and Hundley antagonist
Bobby Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   According to the New York Daily News, Valentine flipped when the
Mets honored Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa before a recent game.
Given the feud between Hundley and Valentine over the last two
years, a presentation honoring the ultra-popular Hundley wouldn't
go over well with the Mets skipper. Sources told the newspaper Mets
management opted not hold a ceremony because it didn't want to
agitate a delicate situation.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley was greeted by shrieking girls before the game and
received a standing ovation before his first at-bat. He then struck
out on three pitches and finished 0 for 3, his average dropping to
.216.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth in rotation: One of the things the Dodgers will
likely try to find out in the next 53 games is whether outfielder
Todd Hollandsworth can be an everyday player.
</P>
<P>
   But to do that, manager Davey Johnson will have to sit a bunch
of salary in either left fielder Gary Sheffield ($10 million),
Mondesi ($9 million), center fielder Devon White ($2.5 million) or
first baseman Eric Karros ($5.5 million).
</P>
<P>
   It was Sheffield who felt the sting of it Friday. He sat against
righty Octavio Dotel so Hollandsworth could start in left field.
Hollandsworth started in center and at first in the previous two
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this period might be, like (management) said, a trial
period to see who can play every day, and that means
Hollandsworth,'' White said. ``There's nothing wrong with trying
it. I don't worry about that. I feel if I'm going out there and
doing my job, it's going to be tough for (Johnson) to take me out
of the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Johnson and injured Mets outfielder Bobby Bonilla talked
before the game on the field, and both said the statements
regarding their feud were overblown. . . . Former Dodger Roger
Cedeno stole two more bases to set up the Mets' run in the third.
He has 54 stolen bases. . . . Approximately 6,000 fans of Asian
descent were in the stands and cheering for Dodgers pitcher Chan Ho
Park, a native of Korea.

GORE, SON REACH THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT RAINIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRACY JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARADISE, Wash. _ A weary, unshaven Vice President Al Gore and
his 16-year-old son successfully finished their climb of Mount
Rainier Friday night, striding out of a cold mist before sunset to
shake hands with well wishers.
</P>
<P>
   With exhausted Secret Service agents leading the way off the
mountain, the vice president summed up his climb as simply
``fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unbelievable experience,'' a tired looking Gore told
reporters from beneath his mountain backpack. ``It was just great.
And it's very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The two days Gore and his son, Albert Gore III, have been on the
14,411 foot-volcano have been filled with terrible weather _ hail,
wind, fog and snow.
</P>
<P>
   None of it stopped the Gore party: ``We were bound to do it,''
Gore said. As a father-son experience, summiting Mount Rainier
``couldn't have been better.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather was fierce enough to keep many climbers off the
mountain, or hunkered down in tents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thunderstorms up there are pretty mean,'' said Don
Wallace, who has been hiking since 1952 and was at the lodge at
Paradise Friday afternoon. Wallace spent Wednesday and Thursday at
Camp Muir at about the 10,000-foot level, never braving the nasty
conditions to make an attempt on the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Others who had heard rumors of Gore's attempt on the mountain's
summit praised the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad he's out here doing this kind of stuff. I think
it's important for the future of the park and the environment in
general,'' said Dave Sahms, 46, of Olympia, who mistakenly thought
he had spotted the vice president at Paradise Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's party headed up the mountain from Paradise Wednesday
morning, according to Mount Rainier National Park Superintendent
Jon Jarvis, who said only a handful of park staff were told the
vice president would be there.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Gore's staff described the getaway by Gore and his
son as so secret that even many senior White House staff and
presidential campaign aides were not informed of it.
</P>
<P>
   The secrecy was at Gore's ``specific request _ he wanted to
climb with his son,'' Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores have been running and lifting weights together at home
for months. All along, the vice president's said he was training
for a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Gore's son was hit by a car, thrown 30 feet and
severely injured as the family was leaving a baseball game at
Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. The episode in part galvanized Gore
to write his best-selling book ``Earth in the Balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, an avid jogger and hiker, told the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer last September that he was eager to climb Mount
Rainier at some point this year if he could spare the time.
</P>
<P>
   His climbing party this week did not use the park guides; Gore
and his son were led by a family friend who has climbed Mount
Rainier as well as Mount Everest, park officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The climbers spent part of Wednesday night at Anvil Rock,
roughly four miles above Paradise, then pushed onward to Ingraham
Flats at the 11,100-foot elevation. They left the Flats before dawn
yesterday morning for the summit, reaching it at about 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors on the mountain Friday spent much of the day discussing
whether or not Gore was even there. Few knew anything, but rumors
abounded about whether Gore had already left in a helicopter _ or
even hiked the mountain at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe some of the stories going through
(Paradise) _ it's a rumor mill,'' Chris Henley, a cook at the
Paradise lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Next week marks the 238,000-acre national park's centennial,
which will be celebrated with a ceremony at Paradise on the south
side of Mount Rainier on Thursday. Gore was invited to the party,
but it's not known if he will return.
</P>
<P>
   A runner who has completed the Marine Corps Marathon in
Washington, D.C., and competed in Seattle's 1998 Breast Cancer
Foundation Race for the Cure, Gore has talked extensively for years
about climbing Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many climbers, Gore reached the summit on his first try.
An online tour guide to Mount Rainier warns that half of the 10,000
men and women who attempt to climb itnever make it, turned back by
weather or exhaustion. Reaching the peak requires a vertical climb
of more than 9,000 feet over eight miles.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was taken off the mountain by helicopter to Air Force Two,
which was parked at McChord Air Force Base near Tacoma. He was
scheduled to arrive in Chicago at 3 a.m. for a speech later
Saturday to Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.

COSTLY RENOVATIONS TO KAUFFMAN AND ARROWHEAD STADIUMS CONSIDERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES R.T. CRUMPLEY and GLENN E. RICE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Civic leaders are considering how extensively
to remodel Kauffman and Arrowhead stadiums, a makeover that would
cost at least $100 million but could run up to $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some wish lists even envision building the long-ago abandoned
roof that would slide over either stadium. One concept incorporates
a St. Louis-style arch into the sliding roof.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved in the talks are saying it's more likely they'll
settle on less dramatic upgrades, such as enclosing with glass the
middle level of each stadium to create heated or cooled zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total stadium improvement, from ground level to the top
of the stadium,'' said Jack Steadman, chairman of the Kansas City
Chiefs football team.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Royals baseball team and the Chiefs have been
crafting wish lists for more than a year. But now civic leaders are
grappling with those wish lists and the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not long term. This is something for the immediate
future. I would say within the next five years,'' said Nelson
Thompson, chairman of the Jackson County Sports Complex Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Still, leaders cautioned that they've only just begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no meat on these bones at all yet. It's just ideas,''
said banker William Nelson, who heads a sports committee of the
Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson and others said they don't know what the improvements
will look like or who'll pay for them _ although taxpayers or
ticket buyers are the likely candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A renovated stadium that includes pricier seats would make more
money for the Royals, which would help the team stay in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Royals need that extra revenue to make it,'' said John
Bondon, the vice chairman of the Sports Authority, which is
landlord for the county-owned Truman Sports Complex. ``They need
more than just the price of admission and parking and a hot dog.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the Royals get extensive improvements to Kauffman
Stadium, then it's only fair that the Chiefs get similar treatment
for Arrowhead, said local leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Chiefs and Royals will be expected to sign new
leases. Current leases expire in 2015, but new leases could tie the
teams to the stadiums until perhaps 2025 or well beyond.
Plenty of discussion
</P>
<P>
   Political and civic leaders have spent a fair portion of the
summer talking and meeting about stadium improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The main meeting was called by the chamber and held June 28 in
its downtown offices. About 25 persons attended, including
representatives of the Chiefs and Royals along with state and local
political leaders, such as Jackson County Executive Katheryn
Shields and Mayor Kay Barnes. HOK Sport, the local architecture
firm, made a presentation. Nelson presided.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to get a narrowed-down wish list from each
team, figure out what it costs and then appoint a committee to plan
a way to get it financed, said Nelson and others.
</P>
<P>
   Cost estimates vary widely. Nelson figured $100 million to $150
million for both stadiums. The roof _ which he termed ``a frill'' _
would add perhaps $60 million to $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, the Sports Authority chairman, said estimates range up
to $250 million if the roof were included.
</P>
<P>
   Paying for the improvements is a big question mark. Some
possibilities that officials mentioned:
</P>
<P>
   - User fees. For example, each ticket would cost an extra buck
or two. However, the sports teams have opposed such fees in the
past, and it's doubtful that this method by itself could raise
enough money.
</P>
<P>
   - A sports lottery. Tickets could be sold periodically in
special lotteries. The profits would pay for or help pay for the
stadium improvements.
</P>
<P>
   - A new bistate tax in Missouri and Kansas. The current bistate
tax is an eighth-cent sales tax on both sides of the state line
that raises about $23 million a year to renovate Union Station. A
new bistate tax could be grafted onto the current one when it
expires, expected about the second quarter of 2002. It would
require a law change by each state because legislation currently
prohibits using bistate tax money for sports stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   - Some new tax or a combination of taxes, perhaps including one
or more of the above.
Costly ideas
</P>
<P>
   Some officials said they're a bit daunted by the price of the
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   A sliding roof was planned in the late 1960s but abandoned as
too costly by the time the twin stadiums opened in the early 1970s.
It could slide over a stadium to protect it from hot sun, rain or
snow.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, who typically have only two or three rainouts a
year, somewhat favor the roof. The Chiefs are enthusiastic
supporters. It would keep fans from suffering as they did Oct. 4,
when a game was played during intense rain that flooded the
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   And the roof could be parked between the stadiums, creating a
virtual convention center in the parking lot there, said Steadman.
It could be a shady venue for outdoor concerts as well as big truck
shows or aircraft shows and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Upgrades that appear more likely are those that improve the
stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Fans got a sample this year of the kinds of improvements
envisioned when the Royals opened the on-field Crown seats and
dugout suites, which quickly sold out.
</P>
<P>
   On the Royals' wish list is a hope to dramatically alter the
middle level, or so called club level, said M.A. Chaudry, senior
vice president of business operations for the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The press box could be moved down to the first level, and the
under-used Stadium Club would vanish or shrink. That would open up
the club level, which could be glassed in, both on the field side
and parking lot side, and the area could be air conditioned.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals would like to build glass cylinders in the now-vacant
cores of the corkscrew walkways, and place mall-like shops into
them. The team would like additional stores and restaurants, and it
wants to build roofs over the back ends of the bullpens to create
picnic areas. Team executives visualize a walkway beyond the
outfield so fans could move completely around the stadium during
games.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Santee, a senior vice president with the Kansas City sports
architecture firm of HOK Sport, said the cramped concession stands
on the first level could be dismantled and rebuilt further back.
They'd be much larger.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs visualize a similar redo of Arrowhead.
</P>
<P>
   The press box on the club level could be moved up to the third
level, said Steadman. The club level could be glassed in for
heating and air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   There would be new lounge areas, roomier concession stands,
wider concourses and more rest rooms. Arrowhead is particularly
short of women's rest rooms because it was built at a time when few
women were expected to attend football games.

FOR DOTEL, 10 STRIKEOUTS WERE WORTH THE WAIT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Octavio Dotel wanted to forget his last outing a week
ago in Chicago. Dotel had no control of his breaking pitches, so
the Cubs waited for his fastball. The result was an unsightly
pitching line: nine runs on four hits and five walks in two
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel had to wait six agonizing days, but it was worthwhile. The
hard-throwing 23-year-old rookie struck out 10 batters to lead the
New York Mets to a 2-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers Friday
night before 43,825 fans on Hispanic Night at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what place we're in,'' Dotel said, referring to the 1
1/2-game lead the Mets maintained over the Atlanta Braves in the
National League East. ``I'm just trying to keep the team there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotel, whose record improved to 4-1, allowed only three hits in
outdueling the Dodgers' starter, Chan Ho Park. The Mets' record
since the All-Star Game break improved to 17-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``His breaking balls were very effective,'' Mike Piazza said of
Dotel. ``He threw them with confidence for strikes. And it made his
fastball faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotel explained his improvement this way: ``The difference is,
sometimes you have a bad day, and you lose your mechanics in the
game. After that day, I just threw it away.'' Dotel worked hard
Friday night to keep his shoulder from flying open, something Dave
Wallace, the pitching coach, had detected in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez provided ninth-inning anxiety. Again. Struggling
with his control, Benitez, the Mets' closer, allowed two runners to
reach base when Eric Karros blooped a single to center and Todd
Hundley walked. The Mets' coaches placed a call to the bullpen and
told the newly acquired Billy Taylor to warm up. Quickly. But
Benitez struck out Raul Mondesi on three pitches, the last a 97 mph
fastball, for the second out, and struck out Adrian Beltre to end
the game and secure his 12th save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a couple of bad games, where I was in trouble because I
walked too many people,'' Benitez said. ``I had to get my
confidence back. I kept telling myself, `It's not me.' I have to be
great and let the people know.''
</P>
<P>
   If the people at Shea learned anything Friday night, it was that
Dotel can pitch at the major league level.
</P>
<P>
   In his first visit to Shea since the Mets traded him last Dec.
1, Hundley was warmly applauded as he made his way to the plate in
the second inning. Ignoring the few boos that were mixed in,
Hundley doffed his batting helmet and waved to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   That was the highlight of the evening for Hundley, who struck
out three times against Dotel.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the third inning on a two-out
single by Park (the first hit Dotel allowed), followed by a hit
batsman (Mark Grudzielanek), a full-count walk to Todd
Hollandsworth and a balk. Dotel, who had fanned the first two
batters in the inning, then struck out Devon White with runners on
second and third to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other Dodger advanced past first off Dotel. In the
fourth, Mondesi singled with two outs and stole second.
</P>
<P>
   The only other batter to reach base against Dotel _
Hollandsworth on a sixth-inning single _ was erased when White
grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets tied the score in the third. Roger Cedeno hit a one-out
infield single and stole second and third _ his major
league-leading 53nd and 54th on the season _ before Edgardo Alfonzo
lifted a sacrifice fly to right. Mondesi made a terrific throw to
the plate, but Cedeno's head-first dive beat Hundley's tag.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets took a 2-1 lead in the fourth. Robin Ventura opened the
inning with an inside-out double into the left-field corner to
extend his hitting streak to 10 games. Darryl Hamilton sacrificed
Ventura to third, and Ventura scored easily on Benny Agbayani's fly
to deep center field.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel was strong all night. He struck out two batters in the
second, the side in the third, two in the fourth, one in the fifth
and two in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Dotel threw 104 pitches, 70 for strikes. ``I felt
good,'' he said. ``And when you feel good, you want to keep on
going.'' But Manager Bobby Valentine decided to pinch-hit for him
in the bottom of the seventh with two outs and a runner on second.
Matt Franco grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   After 110 games, the Mets are still looking for their first
complete game. But they are also still very much in first place.

U.S. VICTORY OVER JAPAN IN WWII HAS NEVER BEEN FORGOTTEN IN ARMA,
KAN. 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ARMA, Kan. _ World War II is very personal for this small
southeast Kansas mining town, even though the fighting was in
places many residents knew little about.
</P>
<P>
   The community of 1,500 residents, about five miles west of the
border with Missouri, this weekend is expected to swell by a few
thousand coming to celebrate the victory over Japan that put an end
to World War II on Aug. 14, 1945. The victory also brought home the
survivors of the 629 men from the Arma area who went off to war.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six who weren't so lucky also are being remembered this
weekend, as they have been every year since 1946.
</P>
<P>
   The town traditionally celebrates on the first weekend of
August, said Steffany Peternell, this year's chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest single community event,'' Mayor Frank Blazic
said. ``It varies from year to year, depending on the weather, but
the streets are full. It still is the Arma V-J celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Peternell said the lineup included a high school reunion, a
parade, carnival rides, a horse-pulling contest, horseshoe
pitching, a women's nail-driving contest, a boccie tournament and
even mud volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Again this year, Jim Varone was to offer spaghetti dinners at
the American Legion hall. He was to make 15 gallons of sauce and
600 meatballs for 200 dinners.
</P>
<P>
   Varone and hundreds of others from Arma and the surrounding area
went into the military after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7,
1941. Some enlisted, some were drafted, but they all served.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial at the edge of the city park displays a plaque with
the names of the men from the Arma area who went off to war.
</P>
<P>
   The Varsolona, Kmetz and Kovacic families each sent five sons to
the Pacific or Europe. Miraculously, all 15 returned safely.
</P>
<P>
   John Varsolona, the next to last to go from his family, recalled
his parents' reactions:
</P>
<P>
   ``The only one who was bitter was my dad. He said: `To hell with
(President Franklin D.) Roosevelt. I'll never vote for him no
more.'
</P>
<P>
   ``All my mother would do was pray, but she was proud to tell
everyone she had five boys in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kovacic remembered when he left: ``I know my mother was
sick, I can tell you that. But as far as I was concerned, everyone
was in the same boat. They were all going the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Varsolona, Kmetz and Kovacic families all lived within three
blocks of each other in Arma, and the parents often talked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would visit about how they felt and how their boys were
getting along,'' said Andy Kmetz, who served in the Army as a truck
and jeep driver.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing their boys leave for war was a blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad felt it wasn't right, that they shouldn't take five
boys,'' Kmetz said. ``The other families felt the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his mother ``felt bad about it. She wasn't happy, but
there was nothing she could do about it. They gave us their
blessing and we all came home in good condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue-collar town where European immigrants settled to mine
the veins of coal deep underground never forgot those who died, and
the ones who returned were constant reminders of the sacrifices
that were made.
</P>
<P>
   To keep those memories alive, a homecoming party was organized.
</P>
<P>
   The first V-J Homecoming Celebration was in 1946. A handful of
veterans put together the impromptu event.
</P>
<P>
   Varsolona, who served in the Navy, was one of them:
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1946, we had our own celebration. We set up at the Legion
hall and drank beer.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, things were more formal, and the entire town got
involved. There was a parade with floats. Veterans, some in their
uniforms, proudly marched down East Washington Street.
</P>
<P>
   It's been much like that each year since.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters of the Arma celebration believe there aren't more than
a handful of similar events left in the country.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is in Moosup, Conn., which will stage its 38th V-J
Day parade Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Harris, a spokesman for the American Legion at its national
headquarters in Indianapolis, said he was unaware of local
victory-over-Japan celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems a lot of the time V-J Day and December 7th slip by
without a lot of notice,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's plenty of notice in Arma.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Jim Barone of nearby Frontenac grew up in Arma, and
as a boy he found the celebration always a highlight of his
summers. There was the candy tossed from parade floats, and there
were games to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also remember very clearly looking at the memorial to
the veterans, and there would always be some sense of pride and
patriotism when you thought about the purpose of the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it caused an early appreciation, at least for me in my
mind, of what the war was all about and how important our freedoms
are. Those World War II veterans were heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, those remaining veterans are in their 70s and 80s, and
there aren't as many of them gathering at the American Legion hall.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kovacic, a retired miner who went to war with his four
brothers, still participates in the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not as many veterans marching anymore,'' he said.
``The ones who are living can't walk, and the ones who are dead are
gone.''

TRENT'S DECISION GIVES MAVERICKS HOPE (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Don Nelson can breathe a little easier today after
Mavericks free agent forward Gary Trent turned down a three-year,
$11.28 million offer from the Seattle SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the situation said Trent wanted more money
than the Sonics were offering. Unless Seattle comes up with a
better offer, or another team steps up, Trent might wind back up in
a Mavericks uniform after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that he turned the Seattle offer down, but I'm not
surprised,'' said Nelson, who doubles as the Mavericks coach and
general manager. ``I think that was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   According to terms of the collective bargaining agreement, the
Mavericks can only offer Trent a one-year, $2 million contract, or
a two-year, $4.2 million deal. In today's market, that's not much,
but at least Nelson can cling to the fact that he's still in the
race to sign Trent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought our chances were good,'' Nelson said. ``I
think I mentioned that early on. But until he signs with us, we're
vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The source said the Sonics are still confident they can put a
package together to sign Washington Wizards free-agent guard Mitch
Richmond. They're also pursuing Mavericks free-agent forward Cedric
Ceballos, Sacramento free-agent guard Vernon Maxwell, Utah
free-agent forward Shandon Anderson and Cleveland free-agent
forward Cedric Henderson. Ceballos to Sacramento? Mavericks
free-agent forward Cedric Ceballos said the Sacramento Kings are
expressing strong interest in signing him to a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've stepped up to the plate, and it looks promising,''
Ceballos said. ``I hope it can be worked out, but we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos also said the Phoenix Suns, fresh off giving Penny
Hardaway a lucrative seven-year, $86 million deal, have called
about acquiring his services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix said once they got the Penny deal done they were going
to do something,'' Ceballos said. ``But we'll see if they have
anything left after giving all of that money away to Penny.''
Sesay's offer The Mavericks have extended a one-year, $500,000
non-guaranteed offer to free-agent forward Ansu Sesay.
</P>
<P>
   Sesay, a 6-foot-9, 225-pounder, has not decided whether he will
accept the offer. He hasn't played basketball for the Mavericks,
who selected him on the second round of the 1998 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Sesay had surgery Jan. 26 after he fractured the fifth
metatarsal of his right foot during the first week of training
camp. He spent the entire 1999 season on the injured list, and did
not play for the Mavericks' summer league team because he didn't
think he was physically ready.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson said: ``I think we're
going to see him in training camp \Rin October\S _ unless he gets a
better offer out there.''

AFRICAN-AMERICANS WAIT FOR POLITICAL PENDULUM TO SWING THEIR WAY,
AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY SANCHEZ  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In the early 1990s, a lot of political power
in Kansas City was based in the African-American community. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the pivotal roles were held by black persons: the
mayor (Emanuel Cleaver), the chairman of the Jackson County
Legislature (James Tindall), the president of the school board
(Julia Hill), a congressman (Alan Wheat), the chairman of the Port
Authority (Elbert Anderson), the president of the Board of Police
Commissioners (Bailus Tate, who later was Port Authority chairman),
the president of the Board of Park and Recreation Commissioners
(Ollie Gates), and the president of the firefighters union (Ed
Phillips). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those days are gone. These prominent positions are no longer
held by African-Americans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although African-Americans hold several seats on the Kansas City
Council, the school board and other government bodies _ and were
pleased by the recent appointment of a black superintendent for the
Kansas City School District _ the perceived loss of political power
is the talk among leaders of the black community. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you get a large gathering of African-Americans
together, it will be the discussion,'' said former Mayor Emanuel
Cleaver. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is that we are clearly going backward,''
Cleaver said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perspectives differ on the reasons why the city's political
power has slipped from the hands of African-Americans. They include
the effect of term limits, the weakening of the political club
Freedom Inc., a lack of mentoring and grooming of young
African-American leaders, political corruption, and the cyclical
nature of politics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The intentional development and planning of leadership, we
have not done,'' said the Rev. Wallace Hartsfield, a Baptist
minister and leader in the African-American community. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But I refuse to believe that this is the way it has to be,''
Hartsfield said. He believes the current structure of city
politics, wherein African-Americans are not in key power-positions,
is only temporary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions also differ on whether the reduction of
African-Americans in top positions means that less attention is
being paid to issues affecting minority communities. Some people
fear that issues of importance to the black community won't be
understood or addressed by officials who are not black. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some black persons serving in government said the power shift
has changed the dynamics they work under. They run the risk of
having their arguments dismissed as racial politics, without the
backing of other blacks to support their voice, they said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a choice: Be silent and watch things go by, or speak up
and say that it is not right, knowing that may sometimes be seen as
`playing the race card,' '' said City Councilman Kelvin Simmons,
who is one of four African-Americans serving on the council. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers Troy Nash and Alvin Brooks have joined Simmons and
Mary Williams Neal as council members. Neal is the only black
person who holds a significant chairmanship, Neighborhood
Development. Brooks serves as mayor pro tem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Discussion about the weakening in black leadership accelerated
during the April elections, perhaps triggered by the end of
Cleaver's eight-year reign at City Hall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sobering idea that the town was going to be very
different and that access would be very different,'' said Stacey
Daniels-Young, a black member of the Board of Police Commissioners.
``It was like one day people woke up and said, `Wow, this is going
to be really different.' '' &QL; 
Dwindling leadership &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How different has the political scene become? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends on the point at which the head-counting
begins. African-Americans say they feel the effect of losing many
of their top leaders within a few years. But it represents an
erosion of gains that began years ago with the election of
now-deceased leaders such as state Rep. Leon Jordan and City
Council member Bruce Watkins, and continued through the 20-year
City Hall tenure of Councilman Charles Hazley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most recent examples begin with the loss of Cleaver, Kansas
City's first black mayor. Among others: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Ken Bacchus, formerly the chairman of the Planning and Zoning
Committee, was forced from the City Council by term limits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Ollie Gates, longtime chairman of the parks board, resigned
after Cleaver left office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Rep. Lloyd Daniel left the state legislature to take a
position with the Missouri Department of Economic Development. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Tindall, chairman of the Jackson County Legislature for six
years, in July began serving a three-year sentence for making false
statements on his 1992 income tax form. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tindall was the latest person to join an infamous list of local
black leaders convicted of crimes related to their positions,
including D. Jeanne Robinson (City Council), Elbert Anderson
(former chairman of the Port Authority) and the late Ed Phillips
(firefighters union). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield said the corruption trials have had an effect on
potential new black leaders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are being frightened away from public office,'' he
said. ``There seems to be this whole matter of African-American
leadership being scrutinized to a point that I don't know who could
stand it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claire McCaskill, former Jackson County prosecutor and now the
Missouri state auditor, said that a lack of African-Americans in
leadership positions should not be viewed as solely a problem of
the black community. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority community has made it much more difficult for
young African-Americans to have the self-assurance and ability to
raise the money to run for public office,'' she said.
``Unfortunately, the political system has not made it a priority to
reach out and nurture young African-American leaders.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The black community also is discussing several recent key ``near
misses,'' wherein black persons were contenders for top jobs but
failed obtain them: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Daniels-Young stepped up from her position as vice president
of the Board of Police Commissioners to become acting president but
failed to get the post permanently. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Simmons had been vice chairman of the City Council's Finance
Committee under Cleaver. Now he is simply a member of it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - James Nunn, a deputy chief with the Police Department, was a
finalist for the job of chief but lost the appointment following a
behind-the-scenes battle over the post, which many black persons
perceived as being racially tinged. &QL; 
--MORE--
</P>
<P>
   Power shift &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many eyes now are focusing on Mayor Kay Barnes _ the city's
first woman mayor _ to assess how she handles the concerns of the
city's black constituents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barnes points to the appointments she has made so far for her
commitment to racial equity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the 121 she has made, 28 are African-Americans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very clear that by me being a white person, there might be
some ongoing concern in the minority community,'' Barnes said.
``But I do feel a responsibility to reach out and to be able to
build those relationships.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She also stressed that she knows the importance of maintaining
ties to diverse communities, because of her years of political and
government experience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, some see problems in where Barnes is opting to pick
appointments throughout the city. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, the largest bloc of selections (37) is from the 4th
District, which includes the Country Club Plaza, Brookside and
Waldo areas. The largely white 1st and 2nd districts, primarily
Clay and Platte counties, have 15 and 19 appointments,
respectively, from Mayor Barnes. The 6th District, south of the
Missouri River and reaching to Grandview, has 14 appointments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the city's predominantly black districts, the 3rd and
5th, only have four and eight appointments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get in a position that other people are picking who
is going to represent us, that is dangerous,'' said the Rev. Nelson
Thompson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he advocates the reconvening of groups such as the
Black Agenda Group, which met in the early 1990s. It was a Who's
Who of black political, civic and business leaders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our issues are important to the growth and development of the
community, so we need to get everyone together _ the Freedom
people, the Urban League, the NAACP, the churches,'' Thompson said.
``We need to do what we can do to maintain our leadership.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meetings have also been held lately to revamp Freedom Inc., the
political club that many think is sagging. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Freedom ``called the shots'' politically, said Lisa
White Hardwick, a lawyer and one of two black members of the
Jackson County Legislature. But Freedom has failed to get many of
its endorsed candidates into office in recent years, even in races
conducted largely within the urban core. Former Mayor Pro Tem
George Blackwood, who is white, lost to Barnes in the mayoral
election despite Freedom's endorsement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hardwick is optimistic African-Americans still can have an
impact politically and sees the current condition as somewhat
cyclical. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So community leaders are beginning to talk about the need to
begin nurturing and mentoring more black leaders, especially in
light of the term limits that voters passed in 1990. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to move this city forward, we have to look at
these issues,'' said Kelvin Perry, former president of the Black
Chamber of Commerce. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to develop leadership, and it doesn't get developed
if you don't have a plan,'' he said. ``And there simply hasn't been
any planning.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perry and others say it is foolish to think that simply having a
few black faces in positions within government will necessarily
translate into improved economic conditions for black Kansas
Citians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Daniels-Young thinks the situation also says much about the
status of race relations in Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if I could have access and not have to have a
person of color in leadership,'' Daniels-Young said. ``I guess that
is the next goal for us to work toward.'' &QL;

ROGUE RETAILERS JEOPARDIZE FEDERAL FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Missouri retailers' unwillingness to stop selling tobacco to
teen-agers could cost the state nearly $10 million in federal
alcohol- and drug-treatment grants.
</P>
<P>
   The money represents more than 13 percent of the state's entire
budget for substance-abuse treatment programs, state officials
said. The potential loss of funding has mental-health programs in
the state worried.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Flory, president of Research Mental Health Services in
Lee's Summit, Mo., in suburban Kansas City, said state and federal
grants paid for his clinic to treat more than 400 addicts a year.
But it is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There tends to be a lot more people requiring these services
than we have room for,'' Flory said. ``If grants were reduced, it
would only get worse....A lot of these are people trying to get
clean so they can be productive. You have to treat them when they
want it, because that's when it's most effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state officials said they are negotiating to put
together a plan to save the grant by getting the state back into
compliance with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Weber, spokesman for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration in Washington, said federal officials were
not unsympathetic to the effect of losing the grant. But Missouri
has to follow the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about tobacco for underage kids,'' Weber said.
``It's one of the highest health-care priorities set by this
administration, and the states need to comply with this.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential loss of funds stems from a 1992 law that requires
states to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco to people
under 18 to a maximum of 20 percent. Beginning in 1997 all states
set a schedule for reducing the percentage of rogue retailers every
year.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty for failing to stay on schedule is the loss of 40
percent of the state's federal grant for drug- and alcohol-abuse
treatment programs. Missouri's grant is $24 million this year. So
the federal government is contemplating whether to withhold $9.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   The violation rate is determined by sting operations in which
youthful-looking teens are sent into stores to try to buy tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide the 1997 rate of retailers caught selling to minors
ranged from a low of 7 percent in Florida to a high of 73 percent
in Louisiana. Missouri's rate was 40 percent. Kansas' rate was 63
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri agreed to lower the number of violations to 35 percent
in 1998 and 28 percent in 1999. The state exceeded its target in
1998, when 29 percent of the stores tested got caught selling to
minors. This year the percentage grew to 33 percent, which put the
state's federal grant in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The problem stems from retailers in St. Louis and southeastern
Missouri. In the St. Louis area, more than half _ 51 percent _ of
the retailers were caught selling tobacco to teen-agers. In
southeast Missouri, 44 percent were caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously retailers in those areas haven't paid attention and
are willing to sell to minors,'' said Marsha Buckner, a deputy
director in the Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse. ``We're doing
everything we can to say that is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The best performing regions were in northern Missouri, where
only 10 percent of the retailers sold to minors, and the Kansas
City area, where 15 percent got caught.
</P>
<P>
   Buckner said state officials had put up billboards urging
retailers to obey the law. They are meeting with retailing groups
to emphasize the $250 fine imposed for selling cigarettes to teens.
And they have formed a statewide network of 210 local groups
working to reduce teen smoking and alcohol and drug use, she said.
</P>
<P>
   All the enforcement measures are important, Buckner said,
because Missouri is scheduled to reduce its violation rate to 20
percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even states that already had a rate below 20 percent have had
trouble keeping it there,'' she said. ``It's called the `rebound
rate' after the initial publicity. Now it's hard to keep retailers
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber said federal officials could forgo withholding the grant
if the state came up with an acceptable plan to correct the
problems. If the grant is withheld, the state can appeal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas also missed its target rate for 1999. But its alcohol-
and drug-treatment grant is not in danger, because the state's
violation rate continues to drop, said Pete Bodyk, who oversees the
state's tobacco sales enforcement program.
</P>
<P>
   The state has cut its violation rate by more than half, from 63
percent in 1997 to 30 percent this year. Bodyk attributed the drop
to enforcement of a 1996 state law that provides fines of up to
$1,000 against stores and a minimum of $200 against clerks who sell
tobacco to teens under 18.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas teens also have the date on which they turn 18 emblazoned
in green on their drivers' licenses. Bodyk said that step was taken
after a 1998 finding that in 58 percent of the violations, the
clerk checked identification showing that the teen was underage but
sold the tobacco anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas is scheduled to reach the required 20 percent violation
rate in 2001.

CANDIDATE INTEREST IN ARIZONA GOP DEBATES AT EBB  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What if they gave a debate and nobody came?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question facing Arizona Republicans, along with those
in a handful of other states with early presidential primaries, as
planning for the political sparring matches cranks into gear.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials blame the low interest on candidates who won't
commit to the debates and on an increasingly front-loaded primary
calendar that could cause the debates to pile up on one another.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Arizona Republican Party, who want to host a
debate on the weekend before the state's Feb. 22 primary, are
worried that it might be overshadowed by a debate in Michigan,
which recently moved its primary up to fall on the same day as the
Arizona election.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the response to the Arizona debate plan has been tepid,
at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was jumping off the building to do it, but nobody told
me they were against it, either,'' said Mike Minnaugh, chairman of
the state Republican Party, who recently sent out letters to
candidates announcing the party's intent to host a debate. So far
this year, only Arizona Sen. John McCain has confirmed he will
show.
</P>
<P>
   According to Minnaugh, the response of the rest of the
candidates _ particularly publisher Steve Forbes, front-runner
Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former Red Cross President Elizabeth
Dole _ could hinge on what Michigan, a state with 18 electoral
votes, does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Steve Forbes, if he has an opportunity to debate in
Michigan, where do you think he is going to go?'' Minnaugh asked.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the state's primary debate drew four GOP
candidates and made national news when front-runner Bob Dole
decided not to attend.
</P>
<P>
   In California, officials have postponed indefinitely planning
for a debate, believing that Bush has no intention of mixing it up
with his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Bush wants to debate anybody for quite a while
and without Bush there, it doesn't get much attention,'' said Jim
Camp, operations director for the California Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a debate black-out precipitated by Bush's
absence, while unhealthy, is understandable, according to Camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, if I were with the Bush people I wouldn't
(debate),'' Camp said. ``When you are 40 points ahead in the polls
why debate?''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's GOP chief agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not do it if I were him (Bush),'' Minnaugh conceded.
``But as chairman I am going to ask for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes officials said they have every intention of debating in
Arizona, but added a caveat: Forbes doesn't want to be a part of
any event that Bush skips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple fact of the matter is that unless Governor Bush is
debating, it's not a debate of any significance in the Republican
primary,'' said Juleanna Glover &UR; Weiss, a spokeswoman for Forbes.
``We would like very much to go, and we would hope that the
governor goes.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush said he has not committed to any of the
debates because it is too early in the election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early for the debate over debates,'' said Scott
McClellan, a spokesman for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Debates in at least three states _ Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire
and South Carolina _ already have been tentatively scheduled, while
states such as Arizona and Michigan are in the process of setting
dates.
</P>
<P>
   The first debate, hosted by Florida Republicans, will come in
October. South Carolina will hold its debate on Jan. 9, followed by
Iowa's debate on Jan. 15. New Hampshire Republicans will host a
debate during the week preceding their February primary.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing jockeying for a debate that will draw candidates
can also be traced to the desire of states to bask in the limelight
thrown off by a nationally televised debate.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, party officials are crowing about plans by
MSNBC to broadcast their candidate forum live.
</P>
<P>
   The state recently vaulted over Arizona to become the nation's
second primary, holding its election Feb. 19, a move that also
allows for its early debate.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina GOP Chairman Henry McMaster said he wasn't
concerned about whether candidates would show up.
</P>
<P>
   They have little choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured they were going to come here,'' McMaster said. ``It
is a very import debate. I think the most important one.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire is also expecting to field a crowd of candidates
and national reporters. Officials are so confident that they plan
to ditch their traditional focus on local politics for a debate
that includes local and national issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one isn't a hard bet,'' New Hampshire Republican Party
Chairman Stephen Duprey said. ``We are expecting to have a major
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   But after New Hampshire and South Carolina, all bets are off.
</P>
<P>
   The field of candidates may be sliced down to two or three after
the South Carolina primary, making for a less than thrilling verbal
face-off, officials acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Republicans, who have just begun planning their debate,
said they intend to pick a date that will draw the most candidates
and create the biggest media splash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual states are left in a situation where we all
have to vie for position in the primary process and the next step
is vying for debates or rallies or events where we can get the
candidates in,'' said Sage Eastman, spokesman for the Michigan
Republican Party. `We are all sort of feeling the pains of a tight
primary schedule.'' &QL;

GENERAL CLARK'S COMMAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be regrettable if General Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme
commander, were replaced two months before his term is up because
of high-level bureaucratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   To complain about the workings of office politics in the
Pentagon is to risk seeming unworldly, and equally unworldly is any
expectation that the entire tale will be known to the public any
time soon. But one plausible reason for the decision to cut short
Clark's tenure was his publicized clash with the British commander
of ground forces in Kosovo, Sir Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   When 200 Russian troops raced to Pristina's airport early on
June 12, Clark ordered an airborne assault on the airfield by
British and French troops. Jackson would not carry out Clark's
orders. According to the London Times, when the two men met in
Kosovo on the 24th, Jackson explained his refusal by saying, ``I'm
not going to start the third world war for you.''
</P>
<P>
   During this showdown, Jackson received full support from his
government. Clark was not supported by his. And on June 24, Clark
complained to Jackson that the British commander had used political
channels to override Clark's order.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Clark managed to shepherd 19 NATO allies to a
complete military victory in 78 days and without a single NATO
casualty because of his political skill at preserving the
alliance's unity. His military decisions had to survive passage
through the political hierarchies of the European capitals and
Washington. The original constraints on NATO's tactics and the
Clinton administration's lack of foresight in the run-up to war
were not his fault. He had to win the war against Slobodan
Milosevic despite these hindrances.
</P>
<P>
   There were no victory parades for Clark, as there were General
Norman Schwarzkopf after the Gulf War, and no kudos from Congress.
Although he erred in trying to counter Russia's bravado in Pristina
airport, Clark carried out a difficult mission. He deserves more
generous recognition for his service than he has received from the
nation's political leaders.

DODGERS LOSE ANOTHER ONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Live with it. These are the Dodgers, and they will
continue to be your Dodgers for the next 53 painful games.
</P>
<P>
   They know it. Everyone knows it, and there's nothing they can do
about it. Dodgers manager Davey Johnson can tinker with the lineup
as much as he wants, but a bad baseball club is still a bad
baseball club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing the same bull for four months, so it's not
going to change,'' shortstop Mark Grudzielanek said before the
Dodgers opened a four-game series Friday against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek hit it on the nose, and the Dodgers went out and
lost 2-1 to the Mets at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Mets rookie Octavio ``Cy Young du jour'' Dotel struck out a
career-high 10 and allowed three hits in seven innings. The only
run the Dodgers scored was on a bases-loaded balk in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they (management) expect the last two
months,'' Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros said. `` . . . Why all
of a sudden would it start to happen at this point? I'd be a little
disturbed if all of a sudden guys starting playing different. We've
had four months to do some things. I don't think you want to place
more emphasis on the last month or two months unless guys are
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   There are myriad reasons the Dodgers lose, from starting
pitching to bullpen to offense to the inability to execute in the
small areas to defense to anything else associated with the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored both runs against Dodgers starter Chan Ho Park
(6-9) on sacrifice flies in the third and fourth innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers went 0 for 5 with runners in scoring position and
are 1 for 22 through the first four games of the 10-game road trip.
They've lost three so far, have 20 hits in the four games and
appear disinterested, at times, at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not giving away at-bats,'' Karros said. ``I don't
think anyone else is, either. We've run into a few good pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Those pitchers include Shane Reynolds and Mike Hampton, but they
also include 2-11 Chris Holt and Dotel, 23, who is 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   But it goes beyond good pitching. On a team spearheaded by calm,
cool manager Davey Johnson, there are few players who play with
out-and-out fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why (Johnson) is trying to mix it up, get guys in
there, guys with energy,'' said Grudzielanek, who lost his share of
games in Montreal. ``We were supposed to lose in Montreal. We
didn't have an $80 million payroll. We had $10 million. We were
supposed to lose. We were young. We weren't supposed to play the
Yankees in the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can really figure out how the season went south so
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a marked team since opening day,'' said Dodgers
catcher Todd Hundley, who spent nine years with the Mets. ``The
Mets were a hated team when I was here, but my God, I haven't seen
a marked team like we have here. Everywhere we go, it's `Beat L.A.
Beat L.A.' Obviously, the way (Fox News Corp chairman Rupert)
Murdoch spent in the winter and the expectations on this team,
we're a marked team. But I think it's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers signed free agents Kevin Brown, Devon White and Alan
Mills in the offseason. They also extended deals with Jeff Shaw and
Carlos Perez. Those signings were supposed to aid the Dodgers not
only on the field, but in the clubhouse. It hasn't worked that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have that chemistry,'' Grudzielanek said. ``We
started off good and everyone was getting along. We need to get
that. If that means a change in personnel, then that's what it
means, or go with it the way it is.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In Congress, campaign finance reform is highly partisan.
Democrats overwhelmingly support a bill to eliminate soft money and
tighten independent expenditures. Most Republicans are opposed,
some arguing that public concern over money in politics may be
genuine but is still thin _ not felt strongly enough to turn an
election.
</P>
<P>
   As frequently happens, the skeptical Washington perspective is
increasingly at odds with the reality in presidential campaigns and
in the states.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Senator John McCain's was a lonely voice pushing
the presidential contenders to address a bill he is cosponsoring
with Senator Russell Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat. Since then,
happily, he has been joined by others.
</P>
<P>
   --Former governor Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican,
has mounted an ad in Iowa decrying the dominance of big money in
the campaign. While George W. Bush, the Republican governor of
Texas, is not named, the reference to the candidate who broke all
fund-raising records _ and who announced that he will opt out of
the voluntary spending limits that would make him eligible for
federal campaign funds _ is clear.
</P>
<P>
   --Publisher Steve Forbes was accused of trying to buy votes by
paying attendees to the Iowa straw vote scheduled for Aug. 14, a
charge Forbes vehemently denied.
</P>
<P>
   --Former senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey put out a detailed
list of proposals, including public financing of congressional as
well as presidential elections, free broadcast time, and a ban on
all soft money in federal elections. Bradley has already generated
a mini-debate with Vice President Al Gore over Bradley's suggestion
that all the current presidential candidates voluntarily eschew
soft money, even in the absence of a change in the law.
</P>
<P>
   The states, too, are at odds with Congress. Those with the
strongest reforms are Massachusetts, Arizona, Wisconsin, Maine, and
Vermont. The first three have Republican governors; Maine is led by
an independent.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson from outside the Washington Beltway is that more
candidates are realizing that democratic reforms are powerful as
well as right and that either party can claim the high ground.

THE GROWING OF CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, August 9, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the beach of life, culture is often the 98-pound weakling.
Congressional bullies kick sand on the national endowments for the
arts and the humanities. Sports stadiums draw public dollars; opera
houses crumble.
</P>
<P>
   But a new effort stands to give culture more muscle. Through its
multimillion-dollar project ``Optimizing America's Cultural
Resources,'' the Pew Charitable Trusts is addressing the nation's
cultural policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew initiative talks of building a stronger ``cultural
policy community.'' While this may sound like upbeat-speak for
culture police who crack down on free expression, Pew has something
very different in mind. It points to environmental activism as a
role model, noting that 35 years ago environmental issues had
little political support. Activists and philanthropy changed that;
a similar approach could help culture and the arts.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative has three components: establishing a central
national source for data and information; expanding advocacy and
media coverage; and measuring the impact of cultural programs.
</P>
<P>
   Information is essential. The national information bank should
provide insights on everything from improving children's education
to how cultural organizations can contribute to suburban and
inner-city communities.
</P>
<P>
   There are risks. Just the word ``culture'' can stir up
unproductive debates. One question Pew asks is, ``Does our system
enable gifted artists to earn a living and to contribute fully to
our economy and society?'' This suggests that properly supported,
artists could be a source of economic prosperity. But the query
could be misinterpreted as a call for handouts to the lazy. The
initiative will have to guard against such mudslinging.
</P>
<P>
   Devising a flexible cultural framework that won't harden into
dogma will take hard, pioneering work. Europe, with its tradition
of government patronage, isn't a role model, Pew concludes.
Instead, America will have to devise its own approach to supporting
the arts, a noble challenge on a promising frontier.

RESIGNATION DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 8, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Dwight Eisenhower, the next five presidents left the White
House involuntarily. John Kennedy was shot. Lyndon Johnson was
forced to abandon his reelection campaign. Richard Nixon resigned.
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter lost elections. Of these, Kennedy's
assassination, because of its shock and the tragic sense of lost
potential, still resonates powerfully with Americans who were alive
in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Nixon's stiff-lipped resignation, 25 years ago Monday,
that deserves the most space in the history books and the most
thoughtful contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   How could such a brilliant and resourceful strategist not
overcome the dark inner suspicions that proved his undoing? How
could the public and the press for so long overlook such deep
flaws? How could the subsequent legislative efforts to avert
another such scandal be corrupted and discarded so easily? How
could the lessons of Watergate, which seem so obvious, be forgotten
and Nixon's errors repeated so soon?
</P>
<P>
   These troubling questions still need answers, for the damage of
Watergate lingers.
</P>
<P>
   The dissolving passage of time has caused some analysts to
refocus on Nixon's achievements, such as the opening of relations
with China and his willingness to abandon doctrinaire approaches
when dealing with social problems and adopt innovative solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But Nixon's legacy at its core is the injury he caused to
democracy by bruising its very basis _ the bond of trust between
the governed and their elected leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting that the capsulizing moment of Nixon's presidency
is its last _ when he became the only president to resign in
disgrace _ because no other president did as much damage to the
office and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Nixon polluted the reservoir of trust that most
people, as a matter of faith, held for him as the duly elected
president. And time and again, the reason he lost their trust was
that he didn't trust them.
</P>
<P>
   There was the phony secret plan to end the Vietnam War; the
covert bombing of Cambodia; the secret taping of Oval Office
conversations; the enemies list and the use of government agencies
to persecute those on it. Nixon was obsessed with secrecy, and his
downfall began with the publication in 1971 of the Pentagon Papers,
which aired some of the realities of Vietnam policy making and some
of the administration's secrets and lies. Had the Pentagon Papers
been made public earlier, there is no telling how many deaths and
how much national trauma might have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Nixon set up the secret White House ``plumbers,'' whose
mission was to use the tactics of common criminals to stop further
leaks. When one of their bungled efforts was discovered _ they left
a piece of tape over a door latch when breaking into Democratic
Party headquarters in the Watergate complex _ Nixon himself led a
massive coverup of subterfuge and lies. In the end, he took many
down with him, including top White House aides and the attorney
general, John Mitchell, who also betrayed his office.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Nixon's choice of the corrupt Spiro Agnew to be
vice president may be laid to bad luck as well as bad judgment, but
no such excuse can be offered for the shameful dirty tricks
employed by Nixon's 1972 reelection campaign _ tactics that
cynically targeted the electoral process, democracy's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon never revealed much remorse or even indicated that he
recognized the enormity of his transgressions. His memoirs refer to
his brief resignation speech, in which he said: ``I am confident
that the world is a safer place today. . . . That, more than
anything, is what I hope will be my legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon never seemed to understand his real legacy, and looking
back, it is discouraging to see how poorly some of the Watergate
lessons were learned by others.
</P>
<P>
   Most obvious: President Clinton could have saved himself and the
nation an agonizing year if he had understood that his personal
behavior _ however rotten _ was less of a threat to his office than
lies and coverup.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the two leading Watergate reforms are now in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform worked well at the presidential level
for several elections but has been trampled by crafty consultants
and loopholes allowed by the Federal Election Commission. Congress,
whose members benefit from the corrupt system, does nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law had some successes and some
failures, the latter including Kenneth Starr's excesses last year.
Now it has been allowed to expire, so the public has little reason
to trust that Washington can police itself independently.
</P>
<P>
   Some optimists say Watergate proved that America's system works
well: A blemish was removed without bloodshed. But damage was done,
and it persists. Since 1972 voter turnout his declined almost
without interruption, to the point that only 49 percent of
voting-age Americans cast ballots in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This is Richard Nixon's record _ an abiding, hurtful legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Any list of the most important dates of the American century
must include August 9.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 29, 1929: Black Friday, the stock market crash.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 7, 1941: Pearl Harbor, Japan's day of infamy.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 22, 1963: John Kennedy is assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   July 20, 1969: The moon walk.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 9, 1974: Nixon resigns, America's day of shame.

DRUGS.COM DOMAIN NAME IS WORTH $823,456 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBBIE SHERWOOD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ Eric MacIver did not get his predicted $1 million
bid for the Internet domain name Drugs.com, but he's hardly
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   An undisclosed bidder pledged to pay $823,456 Friday for the
right to use Drugs.com, which made the 21-year-old MacIver
financially healthier than he was three months ago when he acquired
the name _ for considerably less money. Entrepreneur, heal thyself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been pretty much happy with anything,'' MacIver
said, a few minutes after bidding closed at 5:30 p.m. ``I was happy
with the $300,000 bid that was posted this morning. We were hoping
for $1 million. The $3 million prediction was clearly an
overestimate, but that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Greatdomains.com, the Los Angeles online broker
that handled the auction, said the winning bidder wanted to remain
anonymous until a press conference that will take place ``soon,''
said Jeff Tinsley, Greatdomains.com's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know when it will be, and we can't say anything. But
the sooner they announce it the better,'' Tinsley said. ``People
want to know who ended up paying for the name. They got a great
deal, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley said his company usually commands a 7 to 10 percent
brokerage fee on sales, but he could not say what the cut was for
Drugs.com. He also said thousands of people watched the virtual
auction on his Web site, which carried real-time postings as the
bids rose.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding for the name, which had an original asking price of
$260,000, remained tame until about 15 minutes before the auction's
scheduled closeout at 5 p.m. Then bids started pouring in, each
topping the other by at least $10,000. By 5 p.m., the top offer was
$555,555.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding did not stop because the rule at Greatdomains.com is
bids can be accepted after the auction's close if received within
five minutes of the last bid. By the time the cyberdust had cleared
at 5:30 p.m., the final bid posted was $823,456.
</P>
<P>
   Although the winner was mum, the guy who came in second was
livid. Rick Schwartz of Boca Raton, Fla., had been bidding on
Drugs.com throughout the day on behalf of a ``cartel'' of 25 adult
Webmasters. Among them, Schwartz said, they own thousands of
sexually explicit Web sites and were banking up to $1 million that
Drugs.com would be a profitable addition to their collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to bid $850,000, but when I got through, they said
the (five minute) time limit had expired,'' Schwartz said. ``We
would have turned that million into a profit in 12 months. We don't
believe in losing money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bargain, really. Whoever got it, if it's one of the big
drug companies, which I doubt, the others in that market will be
kicking themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley said Schwartz knew the rules, so that's the breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the terms of the auction before it took place, so he
knew what was going to happen,'' Tinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he could have made more money, and he wasn't told who
actually won, MacIver said he was relieved Schwartz's final bid did
not go through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that it was an adult Webmaster, I'm not that
disappointed,'' MacIver said. ``I would have paid that much to make
sure they didn't get it. It would be much better if it went to
somebody that wasn't an adult site.'' &QL;

IN PAIR OF RACES, 3-YEAR-OLDS VIE TO REPLACE CHARISMATIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some have been rested after grueling Triple Crown campaigns,
others needed more time to develop and were prepped in
lower-profile stakes races. But the race for the title of the best,
or at least second-best, 3-year-old in the land resumes Sunday when
two compact fields go off in the Haskell Invitational and the Jim
Dandy Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   With the Kentucky Derby and Preakness champion Charismatic
retired to stud after fracturing a foreleg in the Belmont Stakes, a
number of seasoned colts have a chance to make a claim as the best
3-year-old in the second half of the racing season.
</P>
<P>
   Menifee, Cat Thief and the newcomer Forestry mount their bids at
the $1 million, Grade I, Haskell at Monmouth Park. The winner and
the runner-up in the Belmont, Lemon Drop Kid and Vision and Verse,
begin their assault at the $300,000, Grade II, Jim Dandy Stakes at
Saratoga. Both races are one and one-eighth miles and are important
preps for the most important summer race for 3-year-olds: the
Travers Stakes at Saratoga on Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the Travers is more of a horseman's race than the Derby
because you don't crucify your horse,'' said trainer Scotty
Schulhofer, who drew the No. 5 post Friday for Lemon Drop Kid and
the jockey Jose Santos. ``On the first Saturday in May, most horses
aren't up for going a mile and a quarter. I've always felt that I'd
rather win the Travers.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulhofer's colt was installed as a 2-1 favorite over the
Florida Derby winner Vicar, who is listed at 7-2, and Vision and
Verse, at 3-1. Seven horses have been entered, but that may change
if the trainer Elliott Walden decides to run Ecton Park in the
Haskell.
</P>
<P>
   The Jim Dandy has a slightly weaker field than the Haskell. At
Saratoga, Ecton Park would break from the No. 4 post, at odds of
4-1; at the Haskell he drew the No. 6 post, and odds of 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   Walden's decision on where to send Ecton Park is complicated by
the fact that his better horse, Menifee, is the 9-5 favorite in a
stout field in the Haskell. Menifee, the Derby and Preakness
runner-up, has had two months off after finishing a disappointing
eighth in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   The Arthur Hancock-owned colt will carry the high weight of 124
pounds and break from the No. 7 post with his usual rider, Pat Day.
Menifee broke his maiden on the Monmouth Park course, and Walden
said he liked Menifee's chances to dominate the second half of the
season all the way to a showdown with his stablemate Victory Gallo,
the leading candidate for Horse of the Year, in the $4 million
Breeders' Cup Classic in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medium goal is the Travers,'' Walden said. ``I hate to
call a million-dollar race a prep race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Menifee will probably be closer to the pace than he usually
is. He's been off a while and he seems fresh, so it's likely he'll
be closer to the pace Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   The pace at the Haskell is likely to be dictated by two West
Coast speed horses, the Triple Crown veteran Cat Thief and
Forestry, who is looking for a sixth consecutive victory. The D.
Wayne Lukas-trained Cat Thief faltered in the stretch of the Derby
and Belmont, but looked like a more inspired horse in winning the
Swaps Stakes last month in a stretch duel with General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's grown up and showed a little more fight, where before
he'd hang a little bit,'' said the jockey Mike Smith, who will
guide the colt from the No. 8 post. ``He doesn't need to be on the
lead. He can also stalk, too. But I think they'll have to come and
get him. He's quick from the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading that chase will likely be Forestry, with the jockey
Jerry Bailey, breaking from the No. 4 post. The colt ran down
Doneraille Court in the blistering fast Dwyer Stakes. The
performance broke the trainer Bob Baffert's 0-9 streak at Belmont,
and he thinks Forestry is getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dwyer was a good race, but I think he's better than
that,'' Baffert said. ``He's got the speed to be ahead or right
there with Cat Thief. He's a fresh horse; he didn't go through the
Triple Crown.''

IRL FOUNDER DOESN'T FORESEE MERGER WITH CART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Indy Racing League founder Tony George says time
has expired on a possible reconciliation with the rival
Championship Auto Racing Teams for the 2000 Indianapolis 500 in
May.
</P>
<P>
   ``And time's ticking away on 2001,'' said George, who classified
the latest round of secret talks between leaders of the open-wheel
series as ``very fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A unified series would be in everyone's best interests,'' said
George, who also is president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
``But I don't know if it's achievable, especially in the short
term. I don't see any way for a unification in 2000, and 2001 is
questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of a possible reunification surfaced at the Speedway in
late May. George said the next 30 to 60 days would be critical
toward bringing together the sides, which split after the launch of
the IRL in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now August, and there's still too many important open
issues we haven't come together on,'' George said. ``But we're
still working on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The rumor mill cranked up last month during CART's U.S. 500 at
the Michigan Speedway. Representatives of the four manufacturers
supplying turbocharged V-8 engines to CART _ Ford, Honda,
Mercedes-Benz and Toyota _ said they would be willing to devise an
equivalency formula to allow their teams to compete against the
normally aspirated V-8 engines offered by Oldsmobile and Nissan for
the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, George said there would be no racing in the Indy 500
under an equivalency program that would necessarily have to reduce
the horsepower produced by CART's engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally against that,'' George said. ``It would be
difficult to achieve _ it would be impossible to achieve _ any kind
of an equivalency that wouldn't cause a lot of people a lot of
grief. So, I don't want to go down that road. A few people think
that would be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, George referred to the CART engine representatives
as the ``gang of four.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the engine companies created this little bend in the
track that derailed things,'' George said. ``The way we look at it,
we've already announced our rules. We did that last fall, and we're
pushing ahead.''

EDITORIAL: CARING FOR THE CAREGIVERS  

</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Aug. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Some 90 percent of the hired care that old people get, either in
their own homes or in nursing homes, is given by nurses' aides. The
aides do the basic, intimate things _ the waking, toileting,
bathing, dressing, feeding and bedding down for the night. It is
their eyes, their voices, their manner and touch that form the
texture of daily life for millions of dependent old people _ a
population that suffers not only from collapsing mental and
physical states, but also from simple, profound feelings of
loneliness and depression.
</P>
<P>
   The work is not easy, or always safe. Nurses' aides injure
themselves or fall ill at twice the average of workers in private
industry. Many get no health insurance. Not surprisingly, in this
high-employment economy, such jobs have gotten hard to fill.
Ombudsmen in 41 states have reported that nursing homes cannot
recruit and retain the aides they need.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 1.6 million residents in nursing homes, with
positions for about 600,000 nurses' aides to care for them. There
may be an additional 250,000 or more aides working in private
homes. Ninety-three percent are female. Most are between 25 and 44.
Thirty percent are black, Hispanic or Asian. Ten years ago, when
the average wage for nurses' aides in nursing homes was $5.20 an
hour, the median income was $9,000. Today the national average wage
in nursing homes is thought to be $7 to $8 an hour. Their average
income is not known.
</P>
<P>
   That is not much, but not much training is required. Federal
standards mandate only 75 hours. Twenty-four percent of workers in
nursing homes have no high school degree. Ohio does not even ask
that they be able to read and write. Considering that the aged in
nursing homes suffer most from malnutrition, dehydration,
accidents, poor hygiene and bed sores _ most of which can be
prevented by adequate, well-trained care _ the quality of the work
force is critical.
</P>
<P>
   The miserly conditions of nurses' aides reflect the increasing
economic problems that nursing homes face. Thanks to stricter
reimbursement standards imposed in January, federal support of
long-term care may fall by 20 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   As federal and state governments wrestle with the cost of
nursing home care, they should consider raising the standards and
the wages of those who care for the very old at the end of the
budget line.

GALAXY'S DEPTH PUT TO TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD GONZALEZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid had been eager to test
his team's depth.
</P>
<P>
   Now he'll be forced to.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles received a triple dose of major bad news late in the
week, with leading scorer Clint Mathis forced to undergo knee
surgery, Carlos Hermosillo experiencing continued pain in his lower
back and Daniel Hernandez succumbing to the effects of a severe
contusion.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, who tore the lateral meniscus in his left knee, is
expected to miss at least the rest of August. Hermosillo and
Hernandez are sidelined on a day-to-day basis.
</P>
<P>
   The timing could hardly be worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, which slipped back into fourth place in the Western
Conference standings in recent days, faces fifth-place San Jose
tonight at 7:30 at Spartan Stadium, kicking off a stretch of five
games in 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   A Galaxy victory in regulation would vault the team back into
second place. But a loss could become a psychological omen coming
on the heels ofthe injury setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to have depth, just in case,'' said Schmid
just hours before Wednesday's exhibition match against Mexican club
team Chivas de Guadalajara at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid's comment later took on an eery tone when Mathis suffered
a fateful foul doled out by Chivas defender Juan Pablo Alfaro late
in the first half. Mathis, who leads Los Angeles with 7 goals and
16 points, remained in the game and played the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   But a magnetic resonance imaging test taken on Thursday revealed
the tear. Mathis underwent surgery on Friday and will reportedly
miss from three to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, who did not play in the Chivas match, had the
discomfort in his back resurface afterward. Hernandez, who had
started as a defender in the team's last three league games,
suffered the contusion on Wednesday after subbing into the match to
start of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Galaxy, the team welcomes back Cobi Jones
and Robin Frasier from national team duty. Both missed the Galaxy's
last three MLS games while representing the U.S. at the
Confederations Cup in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose, which had top management express very high
expectations in preseason, has been nothing short of abysmal thus
far. The Clash's two regulation victories are tied for last in the
league while the team has racked up a league-record nine shootout
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Since shootout triumphs are worth just a single point in the
standings -- as compared to three for a regulation victory -- the
team has fallen well behind in the race for playoff berths.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Cerritos has 22 points to lead a San Jose team which has
lost three starters to major surgeries.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, August 7:
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters, peace
seems to have broken out between the two squabbling Republicans
vying to run against her for the Senate seat from New York. With
only 10 days to go before Rep. Rick Lazio was scheduled to announce
his candidacy for the Republican nomination, Gov. George Pataki
exercised his prerogative as titular head of the party, endorsed
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and even asked Lazio to drop out if Giuliani
runs. Lazio's office says he is still in the race. But since the
congressman had said he would withdraw if asked by the governor, it
looks like easy sailing for New York City's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   For Pataki, who is still resentful over Giuliani's endorsement
of Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994 and weary of endless battles with City
Hall, endorsing the mayor could not have been easy. Pataki made the
announcement late Friday before a sleepy summer weekend, minimizing
potential publicity. There were no balloons, speeches or cheers, as
there were when the governor endorsed Gov. George W. Bush for
president earlier in the summer. There was just the hard reality
that Pataki faced: growing pressure from national Republican
leaders to head off a fratricidal battle that could only help Mrs.
Clinton, and a growing realization that Lazio would probably lose
in the primary anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The governor once feared that if Giuliani dropped out of the
race there would be no backup candidate. Now Lazio has at least
gotten around the state and become well enough known to run if that
happens. Many Republicans feel that Lazio, a genial moderate on
many issues, might have been a better candidate than the
temperamental mayor. But as long as Giuliani looked likely to win
the primary, all the congressman could do was damage him.
</P>
<P>
   For his troubles, Lazio has put together a $3 million campaign
war chest that could serve him well in the future _ as a
gubernatorial candidate, say, if Pataki joins a Republican
administration in Washington or decides not to run for re-election
in three years. Rep. Peter King is still looking at challenging
Giuliani. That seems less likely now. Republicans are not eager to
do Mrs. Clinton any favors. She could not have entertained any
illusions that they would.

EDITORIAL: THE COMING BUDGET BLOWUP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, August 7:
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Hill is having a tough time putting together an honest
budget this year. Republicans have passed the biggest tax cut in
two decades, disproportionately rewarding the richest Americans,
who do not need it. The fact that only high-flying GOP donors and
special interests really want this tax cut was acknowledged by a
top party strategist who commended fellow lawmakers for defying
public opinion by passing it. Meanwhile, Republicans have slashed
children's health, school aid, crime-fighting and other vital
programs, while employing budget gimmicks to avoid even more cuts.
The whole exercise is designed to please the hard right and
precipitate a confrontation with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody seems to have noticed that while Republican lawmakers are
eviscerating the federal safety net, their favorite presidential
candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, is moving at least
rhetorically in the opposite direction. Bush recently called for $8
billion in new spending for the poor. He could hardly do that under
the Republican Congressional budget.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they expect President Clinton to veto their
schemes and suffer political consequences for it. They cannot seem
to remember that since the government shutdown of 1995 they have
lost every single veto confrontation on the budget with Clinton.
This time Republicans know that eventually they will have to revise
the unrealistic budget ceilings enacted in 1997. They just hope
Clinton will be blamed for it. In an interesting admission, Rep.
Tom DeLay effectively acknowledged that the GOP never intended to
use the budget surplus next year to avoid budget cuts in domestic
programs. Rather, he said, the party's strategy was to use up the
money for defense, tax cuts and so-called budget ``emergencies,''
and push for a confrontation on everything else.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican budget strategy relies on the old gimmick of
labeling certain things, like the census, as ``emergencies'' so
that they are not governed by existing budget caps. A new gimmick
this year has to do with the fact that spending is broken down into
13 different spending bills. Republicans know that if they spread
cuts around to all of them, they would never get any passed. So
they have kept the cuts to a minimum in most of the spending bills
and, to pay for financing them, raided the one bill that is dearest
to the hearts of Democrats, which is for labor, health, social
services and education. The Republicans cut spending in these areas
so drastically they have not even dared bring the bill to the House
floor. They know it could not pass, and they are hoping that
sometime in the fall, in a final showdown with the White House, the
money will materialize to keep this problem from blowing up in
their faces.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that with $3 trillion in projected surpluses over
the next 10 years, there is enough money to save Social Security,
save Medicare, increase defense spending, run the government in a
way that would be satisfactory to most Americans and even provide a
modest tax cut. The posturing this year is only reinforcing the
public's already low opinion of Congress.

SOME HEROES NEED TO BE REMEMBERED

   The 20th anniversary of the great athlete's death passed Monday,
in much the same way as the 19 that came before: unmarked and
unfelt, except in a few scattered hearts. Mine was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The great athlete was Thurman Mun son, and for the first nine
years of the 1970s, he played catcher for the New York Yankees.
Munson, 32, made seven All-Star teams, won one Most Valuable Player
award, three straight Gold Gloves and two World Series rings. He
batted right, threw right, wore No. 15, and ran well for a squat,
squarish catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Well enough that, 20 years after his death, Munson still lopes
across the base ball diamond in my mind, trailing my childhood
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   I was 14 on Aug. 2, 1979, the day Munson died in a plane crash
near Can ton, Ohio. A witness said Munson's Cessna hit some trees
while practicing touch-and-go landings.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the wreck led the evening news all along the East Coast.
For a kid raised on 166th Street in Queens, a boy who just had
moved to Florida but who grew up with a Yankees cap dangling from
the post of his bunkbed, it was also where the newscast ended.
</P>
<P>
   Munson owned that kind of magne tism, enough to be made a Yankee
cap tain, the first since Lou Gehrig, and enough to spark a
thousand arguments on the stoop of the red-brick walk-up where I
grew up.
</P>
<P>
   FRIENDSHIPS STRAINED
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on those three concrete steps and jawing about the
Yanks, you were ei ther a Munson guy or a Reggie Jackson guy, which
to me was the difference be tween being blue collar or fur collar,
wor shiping steadiness and professionalism or applauding ego and
flair.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees signed Reggie in 1976, and that spring, he labeled
himself ``the straw that stirs the drink'' _ a slight clearly aimed
at Munson, who'd been the league's MVP that year. Somehow, the two
managed to avoid coming to blows all through 1977, even if Frankie
Cava luzzi and I couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   It strikes me as impossible now, post-Columbine, post-South
Park, post-Mortal Kombat: Two 12-year-olds brawling over baseball.
That was my 1977 in New York, though, all Munson arguments and
cracked wooden bats and hardballs cov ered in black electrical
tape, even as the Son of Sam pumped .44-caliber bullets through
teenagers and a city's psyche.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won the Series that sea son, when Jackson hit three
homers on three swings against the Dodgers. Mun son hit .320. When
it was over, he pushed the team to trade him to Cleveland, to be
nearer his wife, Diana, and his three kids.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of Munson in anything but pinstripes broke my heart
at age 12. Now, at age 34, his quote does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to be home,'' he ex plained. ``I've talked to a
lot of guys around 40 who look back and say, `Gee, I wish I spent
more time with my kids, my family.' And they never will. I want to
be the guy who does.''
</P>
<P>
   That was why Munson got his pilot's license. When he wasn't
traded, he began to fly home after most every game. This he did all
through 1978, the year the Yanks came from 14 games back to beat
the Red Sox in a playoff, the Royals for the league championship _
Munson was MVP _ and the Dodgers for the title.
</P>
<P>
   A WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD
</P>
<P>
   Then came 1979. First, Queens and our three-room apartment, my
school and my friends, became a memory. Then Munson.
</P>
<P>
   I remember his going now as a time when, for me, so much was
coming: first date, first day of high school, first beer, first
girlfriend. Munson seems to stand over that time period the way he
once stood over home plate at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The night after his death, the Yankees played Baltimore. When
the team took the field, eight men ran to their positions, leaving
the catcher's box vacant. There was no moment of silence, though.
For nearly 10 minutes, 51,000 people screamed Thurman Munson's
name.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, some of us still haven't stopped. &QL;

TECHNICOLOR TO INVEST IN DIGITAL DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Digital movies received a major boost this week
when film processing giant Technicolor pledged to invest $83
million in technology to show films without conventional celluloid.
</P>
<P>
   Technicolor's move to buy as much as 59.5 percent of Los
Angeles-based Real Image Digital may jump-start a new era in which
movies are exhibited at theaters without film reels. The first
movies using the still-in-development technology could be delivered
electronically to theaters during the first quarter of 2000,
according to Wayne Schoenfeld, Real Image's chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the partnership with Technicolor means is that we're
moving from the research stage to the real world,'' Schoenfeld
said.
</P>
<P>
   The first digital movies -- which carry the dual attraction of
improved visual quality and tremendous cost savings in distribution
-- began showing in June with four theaters showing ``Star Wars:
Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace'' for four weeks and a single
theater showing ``An Ideal Husband.'' Each theater showed movies
taken from an array of hard discs through digital projectors.
</P>
<P>
   The Technicolor partnership goes a step further by establishing
a complete ``supply chain'' with technology that can compress and
encrypt film-quality images. ``Our challenges are to complete work
on compression technology, work within the industry to establish
standards and set up a business plan,'' Schoenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, conversion of the nation's 34,000 theaters to digital
technology still faces two major hurdles: Who will pay for the
installation of $100,000 digital projector systems and which format
will be used?
</P>
<P>
   Real Image Digital, which is privately owned, has been working
on methods with New Jersey-based Sarnoff Corp. to distribute films
digitally by compressing the signal before transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Technicolor's current businesses process film stock, produce
release prints and duplicate videotapes and DVDs. The company,
which operates a plant in Camarillo, said the investment in Real
Image is part of its previously announced strategy to move into new
formats, specifically digital media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as we moved from film to video and more recently from
video to DVD, we are now ready to lead the evolution into digital
distribution,'' said Lanny Raimundo, chief executive officer of
Technicolor.
</P>
<P>
   Technicolor, a subsidiary of British conglomerate Carlton
Communications, will pay $23 million for a 49 percent stake in Real
Image with an option to buy 11.5 percent more. It has agreed to
invest $60 million more if Real Image's technology works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technicolor is positioning itself, in a very sensible way, to
move into the distribution business,'' said entertainment analyst
Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research Partners. ``They clearly see
major potential returns. It's a good business model -- every time
the zeros and ones are moved on a distribution system, they'll
collect a toll.''

GWYNN A BIG HIT AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Twenty-two years ago, Liz Minor, an
administrative assistant at Poly High, kept pestering her husband,
Harry, a scout for the New York Mets, to take a look at this chubby
kid with a sweet swing who played for the Jackrabbits' baseball
team.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, he told her, the kid's going to be a basketball player.
And just as well baseball's not in his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could always get his bat on the ball, but his tools weren't
that great,'' Harry Minor recalled of the kid, Tony Gwynn. ``He was
a singles hitter who didn't throw all that well, run all that well
or play defense all that well. He wasn't anything to rave about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was also worried about his body he never did have the
athletic body. If he gained 10 to 15 pounds, he wasn't going to be
playing football or basketball, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the kid turned out to be one of baseball's all-time
great hitters. On Friday night, Gwynn became only the 22nd player
in major league history to reach the 3,000-hit plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Minor recalls all this with a laugh as does Liz, who jokes that
after Gwynn reached the big leagues, Frank Cashen, then the Mets'
general manager, told her, ``From now on, I don't want Harry's
reports, I want yours.''
</P>
<P>
   If Minor was not alone in his opinion of Gwynn then he was
undrafted out of high school and chose to play basketball and
baseball at San Diego State neither is he alone now.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach has produced 66 major leaguers and probably twice as
many scouts and coaches, prompting some boosters to refer to the
city as the best baseball town in the world per square mile.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the more prominent players are glad to count Gwynn as
one of their own. They credit Gwynn for not only his
accomplishment, but his class.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a true professional his entire career,'' said Bob
Grich, a six-time All-Star second baseman with the Orioles and
Angels. ``He's been a gentleman on and off the field. There should
be nothing but pride and joy for the city of Long Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lemon, whom Gwynn will undoubtedly join as the only Hall of
Fame player from Long Beach, is recovering from a stroke earlier
this year and wasn't feeling well enough to be interviewed, but his
wife, Jane, says he has followed Gwynn's chase for the milestone
and is very happy for Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been so many exceptional athletes to come from Long
Beach over the years,'' said Jeff Burroughs, a former No.1 draft
pick and American League MVP. ``It's another feather in Long
Beach's hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal State L.A. coach John Herbold, who coached at Lakewood when
Gwynn played for Poly, praised Gwynn for taking time to address his
team a few years ago when it was playing at San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have to do that,'' Herbold said. ``He's just a
different type of guy. He's never been in trouble, he gives clinics
time, he gives fans time. He's been good for Long Beach and good
for the West side.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is often boiled down to a game of numbers, leaving
careers and milestones to be assessed as if they were widgets.
</P>
<P>
   It is Gwynn's peers who truly appreciate the magnitude of
Gwynn's accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy gets 3,000 hits, you just shake your head,'' said
Grich, who lives in Coto de Caza. ``It's just a number to a lot of
people. I played hard for 15 years, man, I played almost every day
and I got (1,833) hits. Unless you struggle in the major leagues
for 10 or 15 years, you have no idea what an accomplishment this
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Grich greeted Reggie Jackson at home plate following his 500th
home run, was with the Angels for Rod Carew's 3,000th hit, and
shook the hand of Detroit's Al Kaline when he doubled against the
Orioles for his 3,000th hit.
</P>
<P>
   What was Grich thinking?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished it was me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bailey, who in 1961 received a then-record signing bonus of
$175,000 from the Pittsburgh Pirates after he graduated from Wilson
High, still remembers the electric atmosphere at Dodger Stadium in
1968 when Don Drysdale set a major-league record (since broken)
with 58fr 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was spectacular,'' said Bailey, now living in Las Vegas
after his playing and minor-league managing career. ``Everybody was
rooting for Drysdale because they liked him so much as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   He can understand why people in baseball would feel similarly
about Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing in an old-timers game in Atlanta and I
introduced myself,'' Bailey said. ``He acknowledged that he knew
who I was. He was a gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   That was also the description of Bill Powell, now the Poly
baseball coach who met Gwynn this winter when the school honored
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Poly kids were very impressed with Tony,'' Powell
said. ``He was very articulate and took time for everyone there. He
didn't brush anyone off he was super polite. It's too bad that more
of the younger kids in the community weren't exposed to that. I
know a couple of school classes got out, but not many.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Gwynn didn't get to 3,000 merely by being a gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to marvel at his swing, said Minor, but what really
has made Gwynn is his work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting is such a science,'' Minor said. ``That's why you
don't see high school players go right to the big leagues. You can
judge everything in baseball a guy's arm, his speed, his hands, but
nobody can look at a high school player and see a .300 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a classic example of a guy who didn't have good tools,
but could play. His arm is just average (but Gwynn has won five
Gold Gloves). ... Those are the guys who are tough to scout. You
can't look inside a guy and measure his desire. I have all the
admiration in the world for Tony.''

YANKEES LOSE BRAWL BUT WIN GAME VS. MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Yankees and Mariners engaged in a long game that
turned ugly in the last two innings, with a bench clearing brawl.
</P>
<P>
   But long before the fight, the Yankees had slugged four home
runs and built a substantial lead that would hold up, in an 11-8
victory. But after Jason Grimsley knocked down and then hit Edgar
Martinez with successive pitches in the bottom of the eighth
inning, immediately after Alex Rodriguez hit a three-run home run,
Frankie Rodriguez hit Chuck Knoblauch in the top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch trotted to first base, as the Yankees began screaming
from their dugout for the ejection of Rodriguez, and home plate
umpire Gary Cederstrom began moving toward the Yankees' dugout,
answering their taunts, until Willie Randolph stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Piniella, the Seattle manager, came out to remove Rodriguez,
but soon many of the Yankees were shouting at Rodriguez as he
walked off the field, including catcher Joe Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez turned and screamed at Girardi, then charged, punching
Girardi three times and knocking him to the ground at home plate,
and players from both teams rushed onto the field. Bernie Williams,
Chili Davis and Shane Spencer all went after Rodriguez, and the
brawl spread to in front of the Seattle dugout on the first base
side.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires needed about 15 minutes to calm the situation, and
after they had cleared the field, Girardi and Rodriguez were
ejected, and Girardi reacted furiously, throwing his equipment,
yelling at Cederstrom. Don Zimmer _ acting as the Yankees' manager
because Joe Torre had been booted in the eighth for arguing a call
_ argued, and he, too, may have been ejected, although that was not
immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have won three straight and improved their record to
66-42. With exactly two-thirds of the season complete, the Yankees
are on a pace to win 99 games.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Jeff Fassero retired the first two batters in the top
of the first inning, before Paul O'Neill homered, and Bernie
Williams homered, and after a couple of singles, Scott Brosius
slammed a three-run home run; five batters, five runs. Fassero
retreated to the back of the mound and discarded his chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of more guys would get on base, but Fassero would
escape further trouble. Orlando Hernandez strolled to the mound for
the bottom of the first inning, staked to a five-run lead, his
chances for his 13th victory excellent.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez's first pitch was high and inside to Brian Hunter,
and Hernandez proceeded to walk Hunter _ who does not walk often _
on five pitches, and matters would get worse for El Duque.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell singled and Ken Griffey, Jr. singled and after a
sacrifice fly, Edgar Martinez singled. Hernandez appeared to be
bothered a couple of times by the calls of Cederstrom, and he
walked Jay Buhner, loading the bases. That's when Allen Watson
began warming up in the Yankees' bullpen; Torre was not going to
allow a five-run lead to evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez walked Raul Ibanez on four pitches and forced in
Seattle's third run, and soon Girardi moved slowly to the mound.
Hernandez knew exactly what was happening, he knew Girardi was
trying to buy time, at Torre's behest, so Watson could finish
warming up and face the next hitter. John Mabry prepared to hit and
Hernandez stood on the top of the mound, glancing again and again
at the Yankees' dugout, and sure enough Torre stepped out to make
the pitching change. Hernandez tried dribbling the ball on the
mound, but it stayed down.
</P>
<P>
   Watson retired the next two hitters, ending a first inning that
required about 50 minutes to play. Hernandez's final line:
one-third of an inning, three hits, three walks, three runs. On
July 27, he lasted six innings and departed with a tired arm. Five
days later, the Boston Red Sox battered him for six extra-base hits
and five runs in five innings-plus. Friday night, he had the
shortest outing of his career. He had never pitched fewer than 3
1/3 innings in any start.
</P>
<P>
   But El Duque's quick demise seemed a distant memory as the pitch
counts mounted, the runs continued to score and the hurlers from
both sides struggled. Knoblauch lashed a two-run home run in the
top of the fourth, knocking Fassero from the game, but Tom Davey,
the left-hander's replacement, labored to throw strikes, walking
four and allowing four runs in the top of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella, who had been pacing in the Seattle dugout, finally sat
on the bench after Davey issued consecutive walks to Girardi and
then O'Neill _ the second forcing home the Yankees' ninth run of
the game _ and Stan Williams, the Seattle pitching coach, went to
the mound to remove Davey.
</P>
<P>
   The unspoken truce that sometimes occurs in these sort of games
took hold in the bottom of the fifth inning, when Buhner grounded
out on the first pitch thrown to him, with the Mariners trailing
11-5. Thereafter, hitters from both teams consistently swung the
bat early in the count, both managers employed their reserves, and
the game seemed to be moving along to a merciful conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   But Alex Rodriguez bashed a three-run homer in the bottom of the
eighth off Jason Grimsley, and with his next pitch, Grimsley
knocked down Edgar Martinez; the fans that remained booed angrily.
Grimsley hit Martinez with his next pitch and was ejected by
Cederstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the same inning, Torre argued with Doug Eddings, the
first base umpire, about a close call. It was the second time Torre
had challenged Eddings' decision, and predictably, Torre was thrown
out.

ANGELS LOSE TO RED SOX

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Baseball purists probably cringe at the thought, but
the Angels have taken on the role of ``Wild Card spoilers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox went into Friday night's game trailing the
Toronto Blue Jays by one game in the American League Wild Card
race, the Angels a mere after-thought.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs by Brian Daubach and Troy O'Leary off Angels starter
Steve Sparks provided all the offense the Red Sox would need in a
5-1 victory before 36,360 at Edison Field. O'Leary added a two-run
double in the ninth off Shigetoshi Hasegawa.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, the Red Sox remain one game back of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox starter Bret Saberhagen (8-4) lasted only five innings,
but allowed just one run to earn the victory. Steve Decker, who
tied a career-high with three hits, drove in the Angels' only run
with a fourth-inning double.
</P>
<P>
   Decker's reward? After the game, Decker was optioned to triple-A
Edmonton to make room for pitcher Tim Belcher, who comes off the
disabled list to start today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to get sent down any time,'' said Decker, 33.
``They have a lot of young guys they want to see. I understand it,
but it doesn't make it any more comforting. I did my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks (5-8) performed a high-wire act in the early innings, but
survived by getting outs in key situations. He walked two with one
out in the first and got out of it.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Mike Stanley and Jason Varitek opened the inning
with back-to-back singles, but Sparks retired the next three
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Sparks gave up a two-run home run to Daubach, but
it could have been a lot worse. After the home run, Sparks walked
Nomar Garciaparra, allowed a single to O'Leary and walked Stanley
to load the bases with none out.
</P>
<P>
   But Sparks escaped further damage by striking out Varitek,
getting Darren Lewis on a pop to third and striking out Trot Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   The only other run Sparks allowed came on O'Leary's solo homer
in the fifth. Sparks went six innings, allowing three runs and six
hits. Not bad, but not as good as his eight-inning, one-run,
two-hit performance against the Twins his last time out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had less command tonight, but one thing I did was I stayed
with my knuckleball in tough counts,'' he said. ``It wasn't as good
as my last game, but I think I'm headed in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels cut into the Red Sox lead in the fourth after
back-to-back walks by Darin Erstad and Troy Glaus with one out.
Decker followed with his second of three hits, an RBI double to
left. Third base coach Larry Bowa held Glaus at third on the play,
and that's where Glaus stayed as newly recalled second baseman
Trent Durrington popped out and Orlando Palmeiro struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Durrington, called up from double-A Erie, singled on the first
pitch in his first major league at-bat and finished the night 1 for
4.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a nice, short, little swing,'' Angels manager Terry
Collins said of Durrington. ``He hustles and plays hard. We'll take
another look at him (today).''
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, O'Leary hit his team-leading 21st homer of the
year just inside the right-field foul pole for a 3-1 Red Sox edge.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen labored through 92 pitches in five innings, but got
big outs when he needed them too. Angels' hitters faced Saberhagen
five times with runners in scoring position, but got just one hit
(Decker's RBI double).

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ By any measure, the difference between Brian
Daubach and Mo Vaughn is as vast as the difference between the Back
Bay and the Left Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Fame. Charisma. Paycheck ($80 million vs. $230,000). Pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   In every category, the Hit Dog dwarfs the Belleville Basher, who
was a minor league carny act until Dan Duquette and Dave Jauss
decided the mail carrier's son deserved one last look before being
stamped return to sender.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, while Vaughn's California dreamin' took a nightmarish
tumble with virtually his first step as an Angel, Daubach continues
to be an improbable godsend for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   While Vaughn made just a pregame cameo appearance here Friday
night before leaving because of a staph infection that has caused
him to miss the last three games, Daubach made another major impact
on the Sox' fortunes, hitting a two-run home run off Angels
knuckleballer Steve Sparks that started the Red Sox to a 5-1 win
against the Angels Friday night at Edison International Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we were fortunate that we picked the apple when it was
ripe, but the kid has done very well here,'' manager Jimy Williams
said of Daubach, whose 14th home run of the season followed a walk
to John Valentin in the third inning and helped make a winner of
Bret Saberhagen (8-4), who got three innings of scoreless relief
from Derek Lowe and a finishing touch in the ninth from Tim
Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good defensive player, a good offensive player, and a
good teammate. You can't ask for anything more than he's brought
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary, who grew up in the LA suburb of Compton and went
to high school in nearby Cypress, treated two dozen friends and
family members, including his mother, to a four-hit night,
including his team-leading 21st home run.
</P>
<P>
   It was O'Leary's first four-hit game of the season and third of
his career. His two-run double off reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa in
the ninth iced the win for the Sox, who kept pace with both Toronto
and Oakland in the wild-card race. The Blue Jays won to stay a game
ahead of the Sox; the A's also won to stay a game behind.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary recoiled when told that Williams said he doesn't get as
much credit nationally as he should.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need it, I don't want it, I want to be able to go
places and not be bothered,'' O'Leary said. ``And my family's like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary is within two home runs of the career high he set last
season, and with 73 RBIs, he should easily eclipse his career-high
of 83 set last season. He remains sensitive, however, about his
poor second half last season, when he hit just .238 after the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I can get you guys (reporters) off my back about the
second half,'' he said. ``You talk about it, you make it stay in
people's heads. Just like when I came into the league, and people
said, `You can't play, you can't do this, you can't do that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get 100 RBIs, you can't mention that anymore. Then it
will be the playoffs, and I'll have to get you off my back about
the 1 for 16,'' O'Leary's output against the Indians last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen walked back-to-back hitters for the first time all
season and had runners on base in all five innings he pitched, but
he ended each of those innings with a strikeout before turning the
game over to Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, who gave up an RBI double to Steve Decker after
walking Darin Erstad and Troy Glaus in the fourth, gave up six hits
and walked two, but finished with a season-high seven strikeouts.
Williams lifted him after he'd thrown 92 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, losers of three of their four previous games, had
numerous chances to break this one open early but failed to
capitalize. The Sox had two on and one out in the first and didn't
score. They had two on and nobody out in the second and didn't
score. They loaded the bases in the third after Daubach's home run
and didn't score. They had a leadoff single from Jose Offerman in
the fourth and didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   But the home runs stood up on a night the scoreboard already
showed a Toronto win and Oakland leading.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach, widely mocked as a possible replacement for Vaughn when
he signed as a minor league free agent last winter, has completely
outplayed the former Sox slugger since June 1. Daubach is batting
.319 in 44 games since that date, while Vaughn was batting .250.
Daubach has 10 home runs and 32 RBIs in that span; Vaughn's numbers
are 5 and 26, respectively.

BOGGS A LONG WAY FROM BOSTON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG _ It's odd to see him here, now, surrounded by
all this peace and adulation. Wade Boggs is on the threshold of his
3,000th big league hit (he went 0 for 3 Friday night and is holding
at 2,997) _ a hit that will guarantee his enshrinement in
Cooperstown _ and he's going do it in a town that truly loves him.
</P>
<P>
   He's on the front page of the local papers. There are warm and
fuzzy articles about chicken and dumplings for dinner. There are
family photos, and suck-up standups by the local talking heads. The
Devil Rays' public relations department has issued a ``Wade Boggs
3,000 Hit Media Kit,'' which includes details (date, city, inning,
pitcher, etc.) of every one of Wade's hits and is only slightly
smaller than the Manhattan Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   He's Sweet Old Uncle Wade, and Tampa Bay is Pleasantville, USA.
</P>
<P>
   Good for him. Boggs worked his butt off for 24 professional
baseball seasons and made himself into one of the greatest singles
and doubles hitters of all time. He's earned his moment in the
Sunshine State, far, far away from the Horrible Hub.
</P>
<P>
   Wade doesn't talk much about Boston anymore. He's like those
World War II veterans who made it home, then never spoke of the
horrors of combat. Boston is where a lot of bad stuff happened to
Wade and it's where he still gets booed every time he returns.
</P>
<P>
   But this 3,000-hit quest is very much a Boston baseball story.
Wade can wear that traditional Tampa Bay Devil Rays hat to the Hall
of Fame if he wishes, but he got his first 2,098 major league hits
while he was wearing a Boston uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one was in Chicago (April 26, 1982) off Richard
Dotson,'' the 41-year-old Boggs recalled Friday night. ``It was a
1-2 pitch and was a base hit in the hole between short and third. I
remember when I got back in the dugout, I sat next to Jerry Remy,
who never said much. And he said, `You only need 2,999 more, kid.'
And that just stuck with me. He was the Nostradamus of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade is from Tampa. Debbie Boggs is from Tampa. Their son plays
in the Tampa Little League and their daughter is a student at the
University of South Florida. Wade's going to get his 3,000th hit at
Tropicana Field and the place is going to be awash in tears and
goodwill. It's a long way from Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston is the organization that signed Wade, supressed him
in the minors, then watched him rattle off seven consecutive
200-hit seasons (the only time that's been done in this century).
Boggs is a .369 career hitter in Fenway Park. In the Red Sox roll
call of hitters, Wade ranks second (to Ted Williams) in batting
average (.338), fifth in hits, fourth in doubles, and third in
on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   It was Wade who was seen crying in the dugout after the Sox blew
the seventh game of the World Series at Shea in 1986. Wade's the
one who struck out against Dennis Eckersley to end the first game
of the 1988 playoffs. Wade's the one who said he willed himself
invisible to get out of a Florida knife fight. When Debbie Boggs
put steel-belted radial tracks on his elbow, running him over with
the family Jeep after a night out at Nick Christey's restaurant in
Winter Haven, Wade announced, ``I'm the white Irving Fryar.'' And
what Sox fan will ever forget Margo, Penthouse, and Barbara Walters
setting up shop in Winter Haven?
</P>
<P>
   He was Our Wade for 11 big-league seasons before he went to the
hated Pinstripes, where he won a championship ring and rode a horse
in the Yankee Stadium outfield. And now he's in the late December
of a career, ready to join the rest of the 3,000-hit club.
</P>
<P>
   When Boggs addressed the national media, there was one bit of
old-timey contentiousness. Stung by radio nitwit Jim Rome's
criticism that he was orchestrating his plate appearances to make
sure he crashed the barrier at home, Wade said, ``For him to say
I've manipulated this is callous. It means so much for me to do
this at home in front of my father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get it out of the way,'' Boggs added. ``God knows what
2,999 will feel like when I walk to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen Friday night. While Boggs's West Coast
soulmate, Tony Gwynn, cracked No. 3,000 in Montreal, Wade flied to
left in the first, grounded to the mound in the third, grounded to
first in the sixth, and walked in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Son Brett Boggs (named after George Brett) is serving as batboy
for the series and Wade said, ``It's going to be special when he
picks up that bat and runs down the first-base line to give me a
hug.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game starts at 6:35. Charles Nagy will be on the
mound for the Tribe. Wade is 11 for 54 (.204) lifetime vs. Nagy.

HOLDOUT GALLOWAY GOING LONG OR JUST CATCHING HIS BREATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Joey Galloway has made some big plays in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   He's got that speed. Everyone knows it. ``SportsCenter'' has
rolled the highlight tapes of him running back punts for touchdowns
and busting 69-yard TD gambols off simple post patterns.
</P>
<P>
   After he scores, No. 84 likes to run out of the end zone, legs
stepping high, not a defender near him, because who, after all, can
catch Galloway?
</P>
<P>
   He has the ability and the ego to look like a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   But when you think of Galloway, you don't just think about the
plays he has made. You think about the plays the 27-year-old
Seahawks receiver has not made. There have been just as many of
those, and not all the blame can go to Dennis Erickson or Warren
Moon or Jon Kitna.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes you wonder if No. 84 has the guts to be a true
franchise player _ which is basically what he is demanding with
this training camp holdout in which he seeks money usually
associated with Super Bowl winners and Pro Bowlers.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway's jersey may be a big seller for the Seahawks, but
something about him has always smacked of being too precious, too
special to be the gritty, anything-to-win player worthy of a club's
biggest contract.
</P>
<P>
   For the money, Keyshawn Johnson has done better for the New York
Jets than Galloway has for the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   For all the smack talk and ego that Johnson drove with him from
L.A. to the Big Apple, the kid has backed it all up. Johnson has
turned himself into one of the league's most fearless,
do-the-dirty-work receivers _ the kind of player who helps make a
team a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that has been Bill Parcells' influence. Maybe Johnson saw
that, under Parcells, sacrifice and effort would take him and the
Jets far.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the kind of lesson Galloway will learn with Mike
Holmgren, who is now at the start of turning around one of the most
underachieving franchises in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   But how can Galloway fulfill his promise if he already thinks of
himself as the superstar who deserves extra-special consideration?
</P>
<P>
   Speed always shows up. But speed alone is not what makes the
NFL's greatest receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway obviously fails to understand that the team and the
coach and the general manager he is now testing in Holmgren
orchestrates the very system in which Galloway could actually
become the player he believes himself already to be. One hundred
catches. Twenty TDs. By next season, Galloway could be the next
Robert Brooks or Antonio Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, you can't fault a man who likes money. Money is
freedom. Money is respect. And none of his teammates faults
Galloway _ though they should _ because everyone understands that
this NFL thing is huge business.
</P>
<P>
   You also can't fault a man who likes to have his lungs filled
with deep gulps of fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway, who has routinely yanked himself off the field in the
middle of critical drives because he needs a blow, has elevated the
art of breathing to an art form.
</P>
<P>
   You want to forget about these small, human frailties in a
person. But when that person is a no-Pro Bowl receiver who is still
more potential than actual performance and he insists on asking for
more money than Jerry Rice, you come to expect a little more from
the guy.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go back to Pittsburgh last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks were 3-0, having feasted on Philadelphia, Arizona and
Washington to give themselves a nice season-starting record.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, it's crunch time. The Hawks are in a dog fight in
the Steel City, with the Steelers leading 13-10 with 1:32 left in
the game. The Seahawks have the ball on the Steelers' 32-yard line
with a last-chance efort to snatch the win.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what?
</P>
<P>
   When quarterback Warren Moon steps back and expects to execute a
play called for Galloway, Moon doesn't find Galloway in his target
range.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is James McKnight who has run Galloway's route. It
is McKnight who's in the end zone, dropping the pass that would
have given the Seahawks the win.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Galloway? On the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Why? No one has ever quite answered that question, partly
because not once during Galloway's tenure with the Hawks did former
coach Dennis Erickson, or anyone else for that matter, challenge
Galloway to suck it up and stop yanking himself out of games,
especially on critical second- and third-down plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have offered Galloway a king's ransom in a new
contract extension. The $35 million offer includes a $7 million
signing bonus and puts him ahead of Pro Bowlers such as Herman
Moore ($34 million) or Terrell Owens.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of offer, Galloway's agent should at least send
the guy over to Cheney with the stipulation that negotiations would
then go forward in good faith to work out exact terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Galloway is either getting rotten advice _ word is he is
seeking $40 million with a $12 million signing bonus _ or he does
not have a clue about what it takes to be a real winner.

the game. The Seahawks have the ball on the Steelers' 32-yard line
with a last-chance efort to snatch the win.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what?
</P>
<P>
   When quarterback Warren Moon steps back and expects to execute a
play called for Galloway, Moon doesn't find Galloway in his target
range.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is James McKnight who has run Galloway's route. It
is McKnight who's in the end zone, dropping the pass that would
have given the Seahawks the win.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Galloway? On the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Why? No one has ever quite answered that question, partly
because not once during Galloway's tenure with the Hawks did former
coach Dennis Erickson, or anyone else for that matter, challenge
Galloway to suck it up and stop yanking himself out of games,
especially on critical second- and third-down plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have offered Galloway a king's ransom in a new
contract extension. The $35 million offer includes a $7 million
signing bonus and puts him ahead of Pro Bowlers such as Herman
Moore ($34 million) or Terrell Owens.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of offer, Galloway's agent should at least send
the guy over to Cheney with the stipulation that negotiations would
then go forward in good faith to work out exact terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Galloway is either getting rotten advice _ word is he is
seeking $40 million with a $12 million signing bonus _ or he does
not have a clue about what it takes to be a real winner.

HANDWRITING MAY BE ON THE WALL FOR SIGNATURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Hancock should have seen the writing on the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1776, three weeks after Hancock drew his famous signature on
the Declaration of Independence, another signer fired off a
question: Why did delegates have to travel hundreds of miles to
scribble down their names?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ought to have the privilege, when necessarily
absent, of voting and signing by proxy,'' complained Elbridge
Gerry, a Massachusetts delegate.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken more than two centuries. But this week, as a
congressional panel approved ``digital signatures'' _ acknowleging
that computer symbols have been nudging out inked names for years _
Gerry appeared finally to be winning the argument.
</P>
<P>
   And the so-called ``John Hancock,'' a worldwide symbol of
commitment and in some cases a treasured art form, appeared to be
going the way of the horse-drawn buggy.
</P>
<P>
   The signals are everywhere. Drivers charge for gasoline without
signing a receipt. Cashiers rarely compare signatures to the backs
of buyers' credit cards. Consumers live their lives online, buying
products and getting mortgages with nary a flourish of the pen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with help from a bill drawn up in the House of
Representatives this week, businesses will most likely be able to
conduct all their transactions online within the next several
years. Many already do. But the legislation, which was sponsored by
Representative Anna Eshoo, a Democrat from Silicon Valley, would
mean that a series of encrypted numbers soon could replace the
personalized curlicue, having been given full legal status under
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which has widespread support in the business
community, was cleared without dissent by the House Commerce
Committee and is expected to pass the full House. Similar
legislation is pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   If the measure becomes law, everything from wills to bank loans
to book purchases from online booksellers could be ``signed''
online and considered legally solid in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handshakes and written signatures have bound people for a long
time,'' said Representative W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, chairman of the
House Telecommunications subcommittee and a Louisiana Republican.
``But you can't shake hands on the Internet. So what is the form of
agreement that is not only recognizable but also enforceable? The
digital handshake seems to be the way in which people can be bound
by an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect,'' Tauzin added with a laugh, ``if John Hancock were
around today and we were doing the Declaration of Independence on
the Internet, he'd use the whole Web site to sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the name, digital signatures are, for the most part,
only marginally related to the physical act of signing one's name.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are times when a digital signature requires a
written signature. An example occurred when members of Congress
signed Y2K legislation in July and sent it to the President
Clinton. The lawmakers used ``pen ops,'' equipment similar to the
rubbery pads now used in some stores for credit card transactions.
The machines recieve a person's signature through a special pen,
then translate it into an encrypted digital code. That code is then
forwarded by computer to the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   What will be far more common, however, is just a simple
mathematical algorithm. Using a combination of the number zero and
the number one, a personalized code _ or signature _ is created. It
can be any number of digits and functions ``just like an electronic
seal,'' according to Barbara Boczek, director of marketing for
CyberTrust, a GTE company based in Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   It is not completely clear how this will work in practice for
the consumer, but the possible ways of sending a digital signature
include punching in numbers on a keyboard or having the data preset
in an account's software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas in the physical world a signature looks a certain way
and might be creative, in the electronic world, it's just a bunch
of 1s and 0s,'' Boczek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could potentially give out tens of millions of digital
signatures,'' said Ed Dixon, a spokesman for MasterCard
International. ``But face-to-face, physical transactions will still
be a part of credit card transactions. I do think your actual
signature will be important.''
</P>
<P>
   But already, it is not the signature that carries weight in
court in credit card disputes. It is the digital evidence _ the
time of the transaction, for example, and whether it was approved _
several industry experts said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the computer has led to the decline of
handwriting of all sorts, and signatures were bound to follow, said
Heidi Harrelson, president of the American Handwriting Analysis
Foundation. Already, she said, ``as computers are used more and
more, we see handwriting and signatures less and less, and that's a
bit of a controversy'' among the foundation's members.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern, particularly to forensic handwriting
analysts and consumer watchdog groups, is security. Handwriting is
specific to the individual, not subject to attack from computer
hackers. It cannot be spirited away to a national data base to
track people's movements, as some analysts fear could happen with a
digital signature. Forensic handwriting analyst Linda L. Collins
said that, with an exclusively digital system, ``you are opening
the door for even more fraud to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our signature is our stamp of approval, and if somebody else
uses it, there are ways to prove it,'' Collins said. ``It has
always authenticated everything. And even other than the fact that
it opens the door to fraud, it's a loss because it once represented
us and authenticated us. It's just another way of saying who we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the business world is planning to take digital
signatures a step further. Instead of just attaching them to
documents, companies are hoping the entire nature of commerce will
be revolutionized by a system now used primarily by the Pentagon: a
two-tiered system of encrypted signatures, or ``keys.''
</P>
<P>
   The system would allow two parties _ whether they know each
other or not _ to be assured that each is who it claims to be. It
also would prevent unwanted entities from being able to decode
documents sent over the Internet, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be huge advantages to the consumer,'' said
Lamar Smith, senior vice president for government relations at Visa
USA. ``I think the general feeling is that there is a huge
potential for stimulating growth through electronic commerce
channels. And what Congress and the (Clinton) administration are
trying to do is remove the barriers to letting that flower bloom.''

NEW RUSSIAN ALLIANCE MIRRORS KREMLIN'S SHADY POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Meet the new bosses. Same as the old bosses?
</P>
<P>
   Proclaiming themselves the alternative to Kremlin cronyism, some
of Russia's most powerful regional leaders joined forces this week
to create an alliance that could drastically reshape the country's
political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the new alliance could dominate December's
parliamentary elections, and put its leader, Moscow's ambitious
Mayor Yury Luzhkov, in position to win the real prize _ next year's
presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   But would a Russia ruled by Luzhkov's alliance, Fatherland/All
Russia, look all that different from Boris N. Yeltsin's Russia?
</P>
<P>
   Although Luzhkov and his allies are presenting themselves as the
guardians of Russian democracy, their own commitment to democratic
principles looks dubious at best. Their election bid looks more
like an effort to preserve their privileges than to reform the
corrupt system Yeltsin has put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov has barely concealed his presidential ambitions. But
Yeltsin's inner circle _ darkly referred to by the Russian media as
``The Family'' _ openly distrusts Luzhkov. To keep Luzhkov from
winning power, Yeltsin's allies have resorted to a smear campaign
waged by the newspapers and television stations the Kremlin
controls and suspicious-looking tax audits on the media it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   How low will the Kremlin go? Friday night, state-controlled ORT
television's nightly news featured a commentator who warned that
the rise to power by Luzhkov's multi-ethnic alliance would amount
to a ``Tatar conquest'' of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Luzhkov promised to put an end to such
heavy-handed tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our wish is to serve our citizens, to solve the country's real
economic problems,'' Luzhkov told a news conference. ``Our wish is
to care for and develop the values of a democratic society, to
develop the economy on free-market principles.''
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, Russia's 89 regions and semiautonomous republics
are run by the very same type of shady clan politics that Luzhkov
accuses Yeltsin's Kremlin of fostering, just on a smaller scale.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, regional leaders rule their provinces like feudal
lords, using local mafias and corrupt law-enforcement bodies to
govern virtually unchallenged. They suppress dissent, censor the
press, and reap the profits of their own privatization schemes _
until now, with the silent assent of the Kremlin, which has relied
on the regional leaders for support in Yeltsin's struggles with his
Communist opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Take Mintimer Shaimiyev, president of Tatarstan _ an oil-rich
republic of 5.5 million people located 400 miles east of Moscow _
who joined Luzhkov to announce the alliance Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When Shaimiyev needed to get reelected in 1996, he ran
unopposed, even though Russian electoral law forbids uncontested
votes. That same year, Shaimiyev issued a decree making it illegal
to insult him, with fines ranging from $800 for individuals to
$6,000 for news organizations. Last year, he shut down the
republic's only opposition newspaper, Altyn Urda.
</P>
<P>
   He has used his considerable clout in Moscow to win lucrative
exceptions to federal tax and export laws _ money that disappears
in the republic's murky, unreformed accounting system. The Kremlin
never complained. Until this week, Yeltsin's aides were hoping
Shaimiyev would join an electoral alliance that would support the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaimiyev is a typical regional despot,'' said Yury Korgunyuk,
a political analyst at the Moscow-based INDEM research center. ``It
is impossible to do anything in Tatarstan without him. There is no
free press and no real independent institutions. To oppose him is
suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposing the administration of St. Petersburg governor Vladimir
Yakovlev, who was there with Shaimiyev and Luzhkov on Wednesday, is
not necessarily suicide. But it can get you killed.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's second city, known for its winding canals, baroque
architecture, and cultural sites, has since Yakovlev's 1996
election become known for something else: gangland-style
assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several years attorneys, bankers, entrepreneurs,
journalists, and government officials have been murdered in what
can only be described as an epidemic of contract killings.
Sometimes the victims are outspoken opponents of the governor, like
liberal legislator Galina Starovoitova, who was gunned down in her
apartment stairwell last November.
</P>
<P>
   Yakovlev himself has not been implicated in any assassinations.
But local media, and the city's former police chief, allege links
to various crime figures, including the Tambov mafia that controls
the city's fuel market and ``Kostya the Grave,'' the notorious head
of St. Petersburg's vicious burial services mafia (yes, they have
one of those.)
</P>
<P>
   In February, federal prosecutors arrested Yury Shutov, a city
council member and close Yakovlev ally, and charged him with
murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and racketeering.
Specifically, Shutov was charged with leading a 12-member
assassination squad that had carried out a series of high-profile
killings in St. Petersburg _ including those of a leading banker,
businessman, and attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Shutov was elected in St. Petersburg's municipal legislative
elections last December, which have been called the dirtiest in
Russia's post-Soviet history, with rampant use of dirty tricks and
even physical attacks against Yakovlev's opponents being the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Post-Soviet election politics, for Russia's regional barons,
often boils down to intimidation. In 1996, president Murtaza
Rakhimov of Bashkortostan _ Tatarstan's neighbor and another
prominent member of the new alliance _ promised to cut off heat and
electricity to regions that did not deliver a sufficient number of
votes for a candidate for reelection named Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Luzhkov who will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This alliance gives Luzhkov a colossal political machine in
the regions,'' said Sergei Markov of the Center for Political
Studies. ``It also creates the impression that the political elite
has abandoned Yeltsin and embraced Luzhkov.''
</P>
<P>
   That is bad news for Yeltsin's Kremlin. Luzhkov has vowed to
reverse some of the cozy privatization deals that allowed people
close to Yeltsin to make fortunes and build huge industrial and
media empires, and prosecute those responsible. Sources say prime
minister Sergei Stepashin may take the fall for allowing Luzhkov to
form his new alliance. The sources say Stepashin may be soon
replaced by someone tougher _ like security chief Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   But Luzhkov's ascendance may be even worse news for the voters
in the provinces, who look to have even less chance of affecting
the upcoming elections than previous ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the local elites are consolidated,'' political
analyst Boris Kagarlitsky wrote in The Moscow Times this week,
``the less pluralism depends on the will of the citizen.''

RECORDS DETAIL VERMONT STERILIZATION PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It changes the way you think of those paragons of New England
society, the Yankees, to learn that Vermont scientists had an
active program to breed them.
</P>
<P>
   But there it is, in the archives at the Public Records Office in
Burlington: the long-abandoned paperwork of the Vermont Eugenics
Survey, tracing in businesslike diagrams the ``degenerate''
bloodlines that social scientists in the 1920s and '30s hoped to
eliminate and the ``old pioneer stock'' they hoped to replenish.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen times, as she paged through the old records, Nancy
Gallagher thought about abandoning her project.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, no historian had ever written a book about
Vermont Eugenics Survey's 12-year study of ``good'' and ``bad''
families, which was widely circulated among policymakers and
culminated in a law providing for the sterilization of several
hundred poor, rural Vermonters, Abenaki Indians, and other people
deemed unfit to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   The story of state-level eugenics was largely untold. Somewhere,
between Gregor Mendel's revolutionary work in genetics and the
Nazis' bizarre distortion of it, there was a void in the teaching
of history.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, she knew there are people in the state
who would read their own family histories in her book.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher wasn't a bomb-throwing revisionist historian, she was
a 50-year-old former biology teacher who expected her doctoral
thesis to ``sit on a shelf,'' and she had stumbled into a subject
both unexplored and painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every step of the way,'' said Gallagher, ``I wondered if I
should even be writing it.''
</P>
<P>
   When her book, ``Breeding Better Vermonters: The Eugenics
Project in the Green Mountain State,'' is published by the
University Press of New England later this year, the wondering will
be over. Gallagher and the rest of the state will be left with the
emotional fallout of a historical episode that no one, not even its
victims, particularly wants to discuss. The Eugenics Project was an
obscure independent effort whose only real effect was the
sterilization law, but its archives reveal a mindset so abhorrent
that the historian who first discovered the papers walked away from
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a real dark streak in me, and it's very dark
material. You can try and not be affected by it, but there's a lot
of hate in it,'' said Kevin Dann, a historian in Woodstock who came
upon the crates of eugenics surveys almost accidentally in the
mid-1980s and published the first article about it in 1986. ``The
tales of redemption and human kindness and serendipity and grace
are not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's social scientists were hardly alone in embracing
eugenics, the science of human breeding that branched off from
social Darwinism. All over the United States during the first two
decades of this century, progressives were on fire to prevent, and
not just manage, the misery of the poor. New science seemed to
supply an answer: domestic abuse and alcoholism, long blamed on bad
social conditions, were thought to be caused by recessive genes and
inbreeding. By reducing the number of babies born to sick or unwed
parents, and by attracting desirable settlers, social scientists
thought they could a build a healthier society.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Vermont was the 31st state to pass a law allowing for
sterilization of the handicapped or ``feebleminded.'' The number of
sterilizations that took place in Vermont was a tiny fraction of
the 60,000 that took place in states before the laws were rolled
back in the 1960s and '70s, according to Diane Paul, a UMass-Boston
political scientist and author of the book ``Controlling Human
Heredity: 1865 to the Present.''
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways, Gallagher argues, Vermonters were uniquely
ready to accept eugenic solutions. The state's population was
dwindling and the draft board was rejecting an increasing number of
young men _ trends that dealt a blow to the closely-held Yankee
Protestant ideal. In 1930, 71 percent of the state's 350,000 people
were native Vermonters. This kind of population can be changed more
readily, encouraging eugenicists to ``improve the quality of its
native stock,'' as one put it. The global craze for bettering
society through selective breeding could be applied to local aims.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this atmosphere that the University of Vermont zoology
professor Henry Perkins threw himself into the project of tracing
what Gallagher calls ``pedigrees of degeneracy'' in a series of
Vermont families.
</P>
<P>
   Field workers selected particular ``notorious'' families and
issued reports with titles like ``The Results of the Matrimonial
Adventures of Four Degenerate Offspring of the Fourth Generation of
the Doolittle Family.''
</P>
<P>
   The reports drew on interviews with neighbors and local
officials, and were sometimes supplemented with estimates of the
families' cost to taxpayers, terming one extended family
``Expensive Luxuries.'' One researcher reported that ``the state of
Vermont would have been better off had Richard, Simon, John and
Joseph of Generation III not been allowed to produce children.''
</P>
<P>
   The work paid off for Perkins in 1931, when a sterilization bill
finally passed, and between then and the early 1960s, the state
would fund and arrange sterilizations, often on young men and women
living in institutions for the ``feebleminded'' or handicapped,
frequently as a condition of release.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is plenty of anecdotal evidence about
sterilization policy, particularly among the Abenaki, there is no
documentation of how widespread the phenomenon was, or how the
option was presented to its subjects. The only published summary of
state sterilization, from the 1940s, puts the number at 212,
although many suspect the real number is higher, Dann said.
</P>
<P>
   The eugenics movement radically changed direction in the 1930s,
as people recoiled from the Nazis' ``race hygeine.'' When Perkins's
student Elin Anderson published a 1937 study of Burlington called
``We Americans,'' her work showed less nostalgia for the ``old
pioneer stock'' and assigned positive value to racial diversity. By
1940, Perkins himself realized that his early ideas were
unacceptable, and omitted from his abstracts any mention of the
years spent following Vermont's ``degenerates.''
</P>
<P>
   And that whole project would have faded into obscurity except
for a pair of accidents: Perkins's proud record keeping and Dann's
chance discovery of 40 crates of surveys in the laundry room of a
state mental hospital in the mid-1980s. He quickly realized that
the history was still painfully fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can still go into high schools in Vermont and mention the
families that were studied and they'll say, `They're still the
troublemakers,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Abenaki _ who, historians have established, made up a
large contingent of the families Perkins studied _ the
sterilization law is hardly history at all. Rushlow, the
31-year-old Abenaki acting chief, said that female relatives of her
father's generation were sterilized without their consent, and that
stories of the Perkins research were not taught in school but were
``passed down through the elders of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   To her, Rushlow said, Perkins has always seemed ``just like
Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent spike of scholarly interest has drawn mixed
responses, she said _ on the one hand, printing the history of
Perkins's project could ``finally let the public know what
happened.'' But the historians' interest has also churned up
painful episodes that had been ``kind of buried.'' She told of a
53-year-old man who realized five years ago, after reading a
revisionist account of the closing of the Brandon Home for the
Feebleminded, that he had probably been sterilized when he was 7.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Gallagher, who taught biology in Vermont schools for
years, is haunted by another possibility: That at some point,
unknowingly, she may have popularized scientific inquiry with
equally horrifying applications. Right now she's worried about the
human genome project. After reading through boxes of Perkins's
pedigrees, she'll never be as trustful of science, or of herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It humbles you,'' she said. ``To their dying day they probably
thought they were doing the right thing.''

OUTINGS FOR HINCKLEY: WELLNESS VS. SAFETY

 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Within hours of life-saving surgery to remove the
bullet lodged in his lung, President Ronald Reagan scribbled this
note to one of his nurses: ``What happened to the guy with the
gun?''
</P>
<P>
   What happened is that John W. Hinckley Jr., found not guilty by
reason of insanity for his 1981 attempt to assassinate the
president, has gotten well, his psychiatrists say.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley's psychotic illnesses are in remission, according to
his doctors at St. Elizabeths Hospital here, where Hinckley was
committed a year after shooting Reagan, James Brady, his press
secretary, a Secret Service agent, and a policeman outside the
Washington Hilton Hotel. Doctors believe the depressed, delusional
young man who said he wanted to impress actress Jodie Foster is now
a 44-year-old adult healthy enough to embark on supervised outings.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley has not taken pyschotropic medications since 1992. He
lives on a low-security ward and holds a part-time clerical job at
the hospital. His supportive parents live nearby, and his fiancee
Leslie deVeau, herself a former St. Elizabeths patient, revealed in
a recent New Yorker interview that the once-violent Hinckley now
writes love songs and tenderly calls her ``the sunshine of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   But others less connected to Hinckley are skeptical about the
doctors' diagnosis and note that Hinckley has a long history of
deceiving the staff at St. Elizabeths. And they are alarmed that a
man who almost killed the president and paralyzed his press
secretary now is deemed not dangerous and might someday walk free
in the very city where he caused such mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a no-brainer. This is a man who tried to kill the
president!'' said Joseph diGenova, a former US attorney who
strenuously objects to a recent federal appeals court ruling that
gives Hinckley's doctors, not a judge, the authority to release him
for supervised visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust anyone who is directing a therapeutic regime to
make a sound public-policy decision,'' diGenova said. ``Hinckley's
going out into the community should not be up to a group of doctors
who desire to see him cured and want to prove it to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Families of his victims refused to comment about Hinckley for
this story. But on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' earlier this
year, Maureen Reagan said she was ``irate'' at the idea Hinckley
would leave St. Elizabeths, and she blamed the decision on liberal
judges who did not like her father.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Levine, Hinckley's lawyer, says the case is about
rehabilitation, not retribution. ``This man is not a prisoner, he's
a patient,'' said Levine, who suggests the visits are a ``precursor
to larger liberties'' for Hinckley. ``He is entitled to treatment.
The next step is this very modest reintroduction into the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinically, that's right. Psychiatrists universally agree that
people recovering from mental illness need to ease back into
society. As part of their therapy, patients at St. Elizabeths, the
nation's largest public psychiatric hospital, routinely leave the
grounds for staff-supervised social outings, shopping trips, and
holiday visits.
</P>
<P>
   Often, these outings lead to greater freedom and eventually
release from the institution. In nearby Maryland, for instance, the
average hospital stay for a mentally ill patient who commits murder
is seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But in this notorious patient's case, clinical decisions have
been weighed against negative public opinion and concerns for
Hinckley's own safety outside the hospital. Hinckley's extremely
restricted life _ he has been allowed to leave the hospital only
once in 17 years, for a 12-hour visit with his parents in December,
1986 _ and the strenuous opposition to his quest for freedom by the
US attorney's office here, and the Secret Service, have more to do
with his terrible act than with the severity of his schizophrenia
or the risk he will become violent again.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neil Blumberg, a Baltimore forensic psychiatrist, said the
majority of people who commit violent acts but are found not guilty
by reason of insanity do get better with drugs and treatment, are
eventually discharged from maximum-security hospitals, and live
independently as law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Blumberg said Leslie deVeau, who he has evaluated extensively,
is a ``poster child'' for rehabilitation from mental illness. In
1982, deVeau took a shotgun and murdered her 10-year-old daughter
in her bed. Ruled insane and committed to St. Elizabeths, DeVeau
made such extraordinary progress that in 1985 she was awarded
permanent outpatient status and five years later a judge declared
her legally sane. She says her friendship with Hinckley, which was
born and grew in the hospital, was therapeutic for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in arguing for supervised, off-site visits in 1997,
Hinckley's doctors reported positive, ``profound changes'' in their
patient. He was showing no symptoms of depression or schizophrenia,
they said, and the narcissistic personality disorder that drove his
pathological need to get attention had not disappeared but was much
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   In about one-third of all cases, schizophrenia can be ``cured.''
But, without medication and ongoing therapy, patients remain
vulnerable to the illness recurring, said Dr. Harold J. Bursztajn,
co-director of Harvard Medical School's Program in Psychiatry and
the Law at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center. ``To send
someone out without those things is like asking them to navigate
and fly a plane without instruments,'' Bursztajn said.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley's lawyer has accused the US attorney of
``fearmongering'' in describing his client as disturbed, dangerous,
and unpredictable. In fact, one major risk factor for violence
among people who are mentally ill is a history of violence. Because
of Hinckley's record, it would be ``unfair to the people in this
commmunity and unfair to Jodie Foster, to release him unless he is
on medication,'' said Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a research psychiatrist
and an authority on schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Torrey, who has been involved in the Hinckley case, says
Hinckley suffers from a ``fixed delusional system'' that over time
has made it quite difficult for St. Elizabeths psychiatrists to
evaluate him accurately. In the late 1980s, they petitioned the
court to allow him day trips, only to discover that Hinckley had
corresponded with murderer Ted Bundy, referred to Charles Manson as
a ``cool dude,'' and still collected photos and drawings of Foster.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Blumberg, who has never examined Hinckley but has had
conversations about his condition with deVeau, said it is very
unlikely that after 17 years of uninterrupted observation and
treatment, St. Elizabeths professional staff is going to
misdiagnose their patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this is such a high-profile case, no one wants to have
egg on his face by saying Hinckley is ready to go, and then have a
disaster happen,'' Dr. Blumberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The US Justice Department last month let the deadline pass for
taking the Hinckley case to the Supreme Court, in essence giving up
the fight to bar supervised visits. However, for Hinckley's safety
and privacy, the hospital refuses to say whether or when its
patient has left the grounds. It will, however, inform the Secret
Service of Hinckley's outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a very controlled and progressive and carefully
analyzed thing,'' said Walter Smith, special deputy for the
District of Columbia's corporation counsel, which represents St.
Elizabeths in court. ``I don't contemplate you will be running into
John Hinckley at the grocery store one day and at the bowling alley
the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative James Traficant, Jr., an Ohio Democrat, thinks
that is only a matter of time. ``What is next, Mr. Speaker?''
Traficant said in a recent speech on the House floor. ``White House
tours? Disney World?
</P>
<P>
   ``Beam me up,'' Traficant added. ``Hinckley should go to jail.
We should throw away the keys.''

<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Aug. 8:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   SYRIA-PLO-REBELS (Damascus, Syria) _ Once, George Habash and
Nayef Hawatmeh were Palestinian revolutionaries in deed as well as
word, leading guerrilla warfare against Israel from Jordan and
Lebanon. One is remembered by some as a hijacker, the other as a
killer, though it has been more than a decade since they and their
groups suspended their armed struggle. Now, they live in limbo, not
wanted by Israel and wanting no part of Yasser Arafat's peace.
Their presence in Syria now could prove a complication to the
rekindling of peace talk between Syria and Israel. By Douglas Jehl.
(With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH-PUB-MAKEOVER (London) _ The pub as downmarket watering
hole, a neighborly spot serving pints of warm beer, pickles and
starchy pies, a spot where the ghosts of Dickens and Dr. Johnson
hover in the air, is rapidly being displaced by the pub as trendy
cash cow. By Alan Cowell. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-CHILDREN-WARRIORS (United Nations) _ According to UNICEF,
the U.N. Children's Fund, 300,000 children under 18 are serving as
regular soldiers, guerrilla fighters, spies, porters, cooks and
sexual slaves _ even suicide commandos _ in conflicts under way in
about 50 nations. The lightness, simplicity and low cost of modern
weapons make them ideal for use by children. By Judith Miller and
Paul Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD-WATER-STUDY (United Nations) _ The poorest people in the
world are paying many times more than their richer compatriots for
the water they need to live, and are getting more than their share
of deadly diseases because supplies are dangerously contaminated,
an international panel of experts concluded last week. By Barbara
Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-CATTLE (Seoul, South Korea) _ Last summer, in an
encouraging sign that relations between the Koreas were improving,
a convoy of 50 trucks from the Hyundai Group of South Korea rolled
across the heavily fortified border into North Korea, carrying a
most precious cargo. Inside the trucks were 500 head of cattle, a
gift from Chung Ju Yung, Hyundai's billionaire founder. Now those
animals have become the focus of yet another dispute. By Calvin
Sims.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SHELTER (Vragolija, Yugoslavia) _ While it is unlikely
that many Albanians will freeze to death this winter, the U.N. goal
to have at least one, warm, dry room for every Albanian family is
not going to be met, officials now admit. A recent internal U.N.
report said, ``It is in shelter that the humanitarian community
faces its greatest challenge.'' By Steven Erlanger. (With photo and
map.)
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-ILLICIT-DIAMONDS (Washington) _ Concerned that diamonds
are financing and perpetuating wars in Africa, the Clinton
administration is considering actions aimed at halting the
illicit-diamond trade, administration officials say. By Raymond
Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   IVORY-COAST-NATIONALISM (Ayame, Ivory Coast) _ In the Ivory
Coast, the debate over national identity _ so-called ivoirite _ has
sparked violence against non-Ivoirians and become the driving issue
in the upcoming presidential election. By Norimitsu Onishi. (With a
map.)
</P>
<P>
   GREATER-ALBANIA (Prizren, Yugoslavia) _ Kosovar Albanians, along
with their ethnic kin in Albania, Macedonia and Serbia, have long
dreamed of a ``Greater Albania.'' The departure of the Serbian
border police, opening up the frontier, has given most a taste of
what such a state might be like. Not many seem to like it. By Chris
Hedges. (With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN-SMOKING-BAN (Madrid, Spain) _ Columbus brought back
tobacco from the New World 500 years ago, and Spain has been
enamored of smoking ever since. But the government recently has
stepped up its effort to change that situation, and the latest
decree bans smoking on all commercial flights and intercity buses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-RANCH (Crawford, Texas) _ In any other year, the news that
the governor was shopping for a weekend getaway ranch would not
have amounted to much of a story. But when word leaked out that
Gov. George W. Bush was negotiating for a 1,550-acre spread in
central Texas, it prompted an obvious, if tantalizing, question:
Where exactly does he plan to be getting away from? By Jim Yardley.
(With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   SF-CHRONICLE-REACT (San Francisco) _ The San Francisco Chronicle
once embarked on a long editorial crusade on what it saw as a
pressing issue _ improving the coffee served in restaurants. ``A
Great City's People Forced to Drink Swill,'' proclaimed one
headline. Over the years, some San Franciscans have wondered
something similar about the city's newspapers. Nevertheless, The
Chronicle's combination of provincialism and frivolity seemed to
match the city's psyche and earned the paper a certain affection.
So it was with some sadness that San Franciscans greeted the news
Friday that The Chronicle, owned by the same family for 134 years,
is being sold to Hearst Corp., publisher of the rival San Francisco
Examiner. By Andrew Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   WELLFLEET-PSYCH-RETREAT (Wellfleet, Mass.) _ So solid is the
area's reputation as a psychiatric summer retreat that Harry
Castleman, a marketing manager from Needham, Mass., on vacation
here, remarked that ``I've always heard that if you need a
psychiatrist in August, the only place to find one is in
Wellfleet.'' By Carey Goldberg. (With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE-MAYORAL-RACE (Baltimore) _ After weeks of political
chaos featuring 27 declared mayoral candidates, six of them with
arrest records, a campaign showdown loomed noisy as summer thunder
here last week in a rowdy scene outside City Hall. By Francis X.
Clines. (With photos and map.)
</P>
<P>
   MICH-CHERRIES-DECLINE (Traverse City, Mich.) _ Michigan, with
3.12 million bearing-age cherry trees, grows more cherries than any
other state. But 30,000 cherry trees were taken out last year
alone, most of them yanked out by their roots to make room for
retirement or vacation homes. By Robyn Meredith. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-JUDICIAL-WATCH (Los Angeles) _ Judicial Watch, the
conservative Washington organization that has filed more than 40
lawsuits against the Clinton administration and others seeking
evidence of alleged corruption, has opened its first satellite
office in the nation in a suburb of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   DEVELOPING NATIONAL STORIES THAT WILL MOVE BETWEEN 6 and 8 p.m.
ET
</P>
<P>
   HATE-RALLY (Washington) _ An extremist hate group is to hold a
demonstration in Washington on Saturday, and several
counter-demonstrations are planned. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   ARK-GORE-FUNDRAISER (Little Rock, Ark.) _ President Clinton is
with Vice President Al Gore for a fund-raiser Saturday evening. By
Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-WOO-JACKSON (Chicago) _ Vice President Al Gore and former
Sen. Bill Bradley are wooing Jesse Jackson in Jackson's bailiwick.
First, Bradley showed up. Gore arrived on Saturday. By Dirk
Johnson. (EDS: This story may combine into ARK-GORE-FUNDRAISER.)
</P>
<P>
   OMAHA-REPUBS (Omaha, Neb.) _ A gaggle of second-tier Republican
presidential candidates are in Omaha for a Saturday political
shindig. Story will be full of their voices. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-KIDS-MEDICAID (Washington) _ President Clinton will send
federal officials to all the states to investigate whether they
have improperly excluded people from Medicaid or from a new federal
health insurance program for children, White House officials said
Saturday. At the same time he will try to get schools across the
country to help arrange health coverage for millions of uninsured
children. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   RACE-MOMS-MORTALITY (Washington) _ At a time when the Clinton
administration has set a goal of eliminating racial disparities in
health by the year 2010, medical experts are struggling to
understand one of the most glaring, and least talked about,
disparities of all: death in childbirth. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
(With photos and graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COLUMNS &LR;  (Moving in ``k'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   HERBERT-COLUMN _ The death toll from the heat that scorched much
of the country from mid-July to the early days of August has
reached 271. The states that fared worst were Illinois, with 120
fatalities, and Missouri, with 61. Get used to it. By Bob Herbert.
</P>
<P>
   DOWD-COLUMN (Sioux Center, Iowa) _ When he walks through the
door of the party room at the Pizza Ranch, I realize I'm glad to
see Bob Dole. A girl can get pretty desperate sitting around a mall
in an outpost of northern Iowa. By Maureen Dowd.

   CRAWFORD, Texas _ In any other year, the news that the governor
was shopping for a weekend getaway ranch would not have amounted to
much of a story. But when word leaked out that Gov. George W. Bush
was negotiating for a 1,550-acre spread in central Texas, it

</P>
<P>
   Where exactly does he plan to be getting away from?
</P>
<P>
   As the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination,
Bush presumably envisions a commute from Washington. And even
though the first primary is months away, his real estate foray,
which first became news about six weeks ago, has already elicited
headlines of ``Little White House on the Prairie'' and evoked
comparisons to the ranch in Blanco County where President Lyndon B.
Johnson established his Texas White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself has remained silent about the ranch and is said to
be less than pleased that details have become public, especially
because the sale is not yet final. Friends have said that Bush and
his wife, Laura, simply want a retreat for their family where the
governor can indulge in his passion for bass fishing. But
presidential campaigns are as much about symbolism as substance,
and if he concludes the ranch deal Bush will have acquired a handy
piece of political imagery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have a specific property in mind for a specific
purpose, but the `ranch' has almost a mythical quality in Texas,''
said T.R. Fehrenbach, the San Antonio historian whose book ``Lone
Star'' is a highly respected account of Texas history. ``It goes
back to the frontier days. There is a mystique.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Crawford, the closest town to the ranch, which lies 10
miles away on the western border of McLennan County, the unexpected
prospect of a governor in the county, much less a potential
president, has made for a pretty heady few weeks. Weekend ranching,
whether it entails 5 acres or 5,000, is a popular avocation and
status symbol for affluent city folks from Dallas, Houston and
Austin who still feel the pull of the land but have little interest
in pushing the plow.
</P>
<P>
   But McLennan County is not the most fashionable address. The
area is better known for the fatal siege that occurred six years
ago at the Branch Davidian complex east of the county seat of Waco.
Needless to say, the county welcomes the new attention.

   ``It's a big deal, it really is,'' said Chief Mike Gold of the
Crawford police. ``It's going to increase our tourism trade
immediately.'' Of course, Gold said that other than a park for
recreational vehicles, Crawford had no tourism trade. There is one
gas station, one coffee shop, a barber shop offering $3 haircuts,
no stoplights and not quite 700 people. The school district ranks
among the best in Texas, attracting a few dozen new residents in
recent years, but the town still does not have a fast-food
restaurant.

   B.F. Engelbrecht, who has owned the ranch for 63 of his 82
years, said the deal had been scheduled to close on Monday but
could be delayed as final details are completed. Engelbrecht
declined to discuss the price of the ranch, but local real estate
agents have estimated $850 an acre. Last year, Bush earned $14.9
million from the sale of the Texas Rangers baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for the governor, confirmed that
Bush was interested in land in the area but offered no details,
except to hint at a possible announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have something to say about it soon,'' she said.
</P>

<P>
   Four months ago, Engelbrecht said, he and Bush began negotiating
for the 1,550-acre piece of property that is dominated by large
grazing pastures for cattle and the rusted remnants of buildings
that once housed chickens, turkeys and hogs. Engelbrecht said the
property had been up for sale for about four years. He and his
wife, Earlene, are moving closer to a hospital where she undergoes
regular treatment for kidney problems.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, Engelbrecht said, hired an engineer to insure that
a five-acre lake could be built for bass fishing. But Engelbrecht
said what most interested the governor and Mrs. Bush was the 200
acres of pristine canyons and woods that surround a stretch of
Rainey Creek, a tributary of the Middle Bosque River.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just liked the cliffs and the oak trees,'' Engelbrecht
said. ``That's where he wants to build his house.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Engelbrecht said he credited Mrs. Bush with cementing
the deal. ``She liked it more than he did. They looked at one in
Coryell County, but she liked this one. They just want a hideaway
place, especially if he gets to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   The property is sealed off from any public roads and accessible
only by a single entrance. Several local residents also have
remarked that the ranch is not only well located between Austin and
Dallas but also only about 20 miles from the Army base Fort Hood.
``It would be easy access in case he gets to be president,'' said
Celeste Mattlage, who lives a mile from the Engelbrechts.
``Diplomats could be flown in here and brought by helicopter.''

   In the 1960s, during the Johnson administration, Texans became
accustomed to dignitaries arriving at the 2,000-acre LBJ Ranch in
the hill country west of Austin. John T. Tiff, historian for the
Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, which includes about
600 acres of the ranch as well as the Texas White House, said
Johnson enjoyed driving guests in his Lincoln convertibles to show
off the deer and the cattle. For Johnson, who always claimed that
the stars shined brighter in Texas, the ranch was a reminder of his
Hill Country boyhood.
</P>
<P>
   But Tiff said politics also played a role when Johnson bought
the ranch in 1951. With his national political ambitions rising,
Johnson wanted to change his political image and embrace the
frontier individualism embodied by the West. ``He had been
perceived as a Southern politician, and he wanted to change his
image,'' Tiff said.

   Bush already owns a house in East Texas at a fishing and hunting
camp, but with a ranch he joins a different caliber of Texans. A
few weeks ago, he unexpectedly stopped by a coffee shop in another
nearby town, McGregor, and pressed the flesh with his constituents
and possible future neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mattlage, for one, worries that Bush's presence might
disrupt the slow rhythm of a community where she says people do two
things: work and go to church. But she and her husband, Marvin,
were told by the Engelbrechts that governor and Mrs. Bush plan to
hold a get-to-know-you social on the ranch if the sale goes
through. The Mattlages plan to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like our quiet lifestyle,'' Mrs. Mattlage said. ``He's
really getting in a good community. Just so he'll be a good
neighbor.''

   WASHINGTON _ Eight months pregnant, Deborah Edwards smoothed a
thin hospital gown over her bulging belly, nibbled at a graham
cracker and ticked off the reasons she had spent a week confined to
the maternity ward of George Washington University Hospital here.
</P>
<P>
   At 42 she is, in medical parlance, of ``advanced maternal age.''
She had no prenatal care until last month: after 20 years of
marriage and two adopted children, she had no idea she was
pregnant. She weighs 208 pounds, up from 196. She has diabetes,
which puts her baby in danger. And her high blood pressure has
worsened into pre-eclampsia, a condition that could kill her if it
is not carefully monitored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned,'' she said, ``but I'm not worried. I know I'm
being cared for.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a good thing, because Mrs. Edwards possesses another
characteristic that statistically puts her at risk during delivery:
She is black.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the Clinton administration has set a goal of
eliminating racial disparities in health by the year 2010, medical
experts are struggling to understand one of the most glaring, and
least talked about, disparities of all: death in childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   In a study made public this spring, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta reported that black women in the
United States were nearly four times as likely to die during
delivery, or shortly thereafter, as white women. The disparity,
which has remained about the same for the last four decades, holds
true even for women who, like Mrs. Edwards, are middle class and
have health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The findings _ coupled with the awareness-raising efforts of a
Connecticut man whose wife died in child birth _ have renewed
interest among scientists and legislators in a problem that many
people think no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The issue is also making for strange political bedfellows in
Washington. On Tuesday, Reps. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., and Jo Ann
Emerson, R-Mo., convened a panel of doctors, women's health
advocates and CDC officials to discuss maternal mortality and
garner support for a bill, introduced in June, that would provide
additional federal money to study it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get together, whether Democrat or Republican,
pro-choice or pro-life, white or black,'' Ms. Lowey said, ``to get
the best research, the comprehensive data, the right programs.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dying in childbirth, in this country at least, is still
extremely rare. But several facts trouble federal health officials.
First, while infant mortality has declined steadily over the last
decade, maternal deaths have remained unchanged, and experts think
as many as 70 percent could be prevented. Second, the 4-to-1 racial
disparity in maternal deaths is among the greatest gaps in public
health. (The gap is narrower for more common problems, including
infant mortality.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the most recent year for which statistics are
available, 327 women died in childbirth in the United States. When
the CDC examined deaths over a nine-year period, from 1987 to 1996,
it found that one black woman died for every 5,102 who gave birth;
among white women, the figure was one in 18,868. While the deaths
are few, said Dr. David Satcher, the U.S. surgeon general, ``the
disparity is important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were comparing black women in this country with women in
Tanzania,'' Satcher said, ``we would be talking about how great we
are doing. We are not. In this country, we have a certain standard
of expectation about the risk of women dying in pregnancy, and
black women are off the scale right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this are varied, and not well understood. Black
women are more prone to obesity, hypertension and diabetes,
conditions that can complicate pregnancy. Poverty plays a role, as
does the drug and alcohol abuse that sometimes goes along with it,
experts say. So, too, does poor prenatal care.
</P>
<P>
   Yet black and white women generally suffer the same types of
complications. For every maternal death, CDC officials say, 1,600
women are admitted to hospitals for pregnancy complications that
are not related to delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paradox that we have is that mortality is about four to
five times higher among blacks, but morbidity, or complications,
are only 1.5 times higher,'' as measured by hospital admissions,
said Dr. Hani Atrash, chief of the CDC's pregnancy and infant
health branch. ``What worries me most is that it may be true that
blacks and whites have the same rate of complications,'' he said,
but blacks may seek medical care ``at a later stage and with more
serious conditions, and therefore their mortality is higher.''
</P>
<P>
   In the District of Columbia, where the majority of residents are
black, these numbers come as no surprise to doctors; the rate at
which women die in childbirth is higher here than anywhere else in
the country. At D.C. General Hospital, the city's largest public
hospital, as many as three-quarters of all maternity patients are
high risk.
</P>
<P>
   Most obstetricians are afraid to talk about losing patients. But
the doctors at D.C. General are surprisingly direct. Dr. John S.
Selden, who has worked at the hospital on and off for the last 13
years, told of a death that occurred just a few months ago: a woman
in her early 30s, already a mother of six, suffered an amniotic
fluid embolism, an extremely rare condition in which fluid from her
womb escaped into the bloodstream and lodged in her lung. She died
on the operating table, moments after a Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was alive and alert to the point where the baby was out,''
Selden said. ``The nurses showed her the baby. I'm sure that's the
last thing she remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Selden said there was no way to predict the woman's death, and
outside experts agreed. But, they said, if scientists and public
health officials spent more time researching maternal mortality,
they might find ways to better handle _ or even to prevent _ such
unpredictable complications, so that they did not escalate into
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   One researcher, Dr. Roberto Romero, chief of the perinatology
research branch at the National Institute on Child Health and Human
Development, suspects that amniotic fluid embolism is, in fact, a
``chronic process that could be identified in women who are
admitted to the hospital.'' Romero said he was planning a study of
the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, officials at the CDC, as well as at the
American College of Gynecologists, are pressing state health
officials to resurrect the practice of performing maternal death
reviews. Currently, said Dr. Jeffrey C. King, who is leading the
effort for the obstetricians' group, only 25 states conduct
in-depth examinations every time a pregnant woman dies.
</P>
<P>
   But even where the reviews are conducted, some say, they are not
always thorough enough. Dr. Janet L. Mitchell, a New York City
obstetrician who performed reviews for the city until a few years
ago, said she wanted to interview relatives of women who died, in
an effort to understand how socioeconomics and lifestyle contribute
to the racial gap. But she could not get government financing for
the work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to back away from the medical causes,'' she said,
``and begin to take a much more ethnographic, anthropological
approach to analyzing this tragic outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Black or white, the tragedy of death in childbirth cannot be
underestimated. Five years ago, Arny Goodman, who is white, became
a widower and a single father when his wife, Deborah Sorkin,
suffered a catastrophic hemorrhage while delivering their second
child, a baby girl. Ms. Sorkin was 38; the couple's newborn
daughter died, as well. Goodman was left with the task of telling
his son, who was not quite 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Andrew, Mommy's not coming home again, ever.' He just
froze. He instantly knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, who lives in Manchester, Conn., a suburb of Hartford,
said his wife suffered placenta accreta, in which the placenta
burrows deep into the uterine wall, intertwining itself with the
blood vessels. Goodman responded by suing the state of Connecticut,
which owns the hospital where his wife died, and turning himself
into an expert on placenta accreta. He began a one-man crusade to
heighten scientific interest in the condition and in maternal
mortality in general.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development held a two-day conference on postpartum hemorrhage and
placenta accreta, and invited Goodman to speak.
</P>
<P>
   He said he told the conference, ``There has got to be some
uniform way of having a doctor look at these risk factors, utilize
ultrasound and arrive at a high index of suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman settled his suit with Connecticut; he said he cannot
discuss the terms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mitchell, the New York obstetrician, says Goodman's vehemence
illustrates a cultural difference in the way many blacks and whites
respond to unexpected deaths, a difference she said helped explain
why blacks had not been more vocal. The National Black Women's
Health Project, an advocacy group in Washington, recently has begun
to try to collect stories of black women who have died in
childbirth or been affected by pregnancy complications. But
Mitchell said that when she worked at Harlem Hospital, she tried to
start a support group for black mothers whose babies had died.
Nobody came.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are cultural differences in grieving,'' she said. ``For
communities of color, especially those of African descent, it tends
to be much more individual, spiritual and inward. They don't have a
need to be in a support group. They would much rather do this
privately.''
</P>
<P>
   That same sense of spirituality has been both a guide and
comfort to Deborah Edwards, the George Washington University
Hospital patient, during her difficult pregnancy. Mrs. Edwards, who
is a deacon in her church, said she had no intention of becoming a
terrible statistic. She is now watching her diet carefully,
something she has never done before, and her obstetrician, Dr.
Kristiina Parviainen, says she follows doctors' orders with
precision.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Parviainen debated the length of her hospital stay,
Mrs. Edwards was looking to a higher authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm believing in the Lord,'' she said. ``He knew my health
condition before I got pregnant. He knew my age before I got
pregnant. If he decides, at 42, to bless us with a baby ... .'' Her
voice trailed off for a bit. ``I just believe in the Lord.''

<P>
   LONDON _ Four years ago, when Amanda Rimmer took over as
landlady at the Bull and Last in north London, it was, she said,
``a really run-down pub with a bit of a reputation'' as a rough
sort of spot. The decor was dowdy. Brawls were not unknown. People
came to drink and, well, drink. So she set about making it over.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, she turned a landlord's bedroom into a dining room.
Downstairs, she changed the barroom to include more dining tables,
a sofa, a fireplace and a new kitchen with a menu offering
bruschetta and homemade pasta. What she sought, she said, was an
atmosphere where people could ``relax and chill out.''
</P>
<P>
   Her reasoning was simple. ``It's getting to the stage where you
really have to offer something different or distinctive to attract
people, to break the mold,'' she said. Ms. Rimmer had reached the
same conclusion that has inspired a revolution in the $35 billion
British pub industry.
</P>
<P>
   The pub as downmarket watering hole, a neighborly spot serving
pints of warm beer, pickles and starchy pies, a spot where the
ghosts of Dickens and Dr. Johnson hover in the air, is rapidly
being displaced by the pub as trendy cash cow. It is all part of a
booming leisure industry, financed in large part by money from
America and Japan, that has freckled the British landscape with all
the trappings of a mass-market society: themed bars, brand-name
taverns, chain restaurants and leisure centers offering everything
from water parks to 10-pin bowling and, of course, beer.
</P>
<P>
   The business of Britain's 70,000 pubs has ``changed beyond
recognition,'' said Lindsay Campbell, who leases four of them,
including the Bull and Last, from Punch Taverns Group Ltd. As just
one sign of this change, when 3,500 pubs were put up for sale en
masse earlier this year, a bruising battle ensued over who would
win this prize.
</P>
<P>
   But what turned the British pub from a barren shrine to
single-minded drinking into a battleground for takeovers? The
answer lies primarily in a set of government rules, known as the
Beer Orders, that came into force a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, pubs were tied to beer consumption and to
brewing companies,'' said Linda Bain, a spokeswoman for Scottish &AMP;
Newcastle PLC. ``So a company such as ourselves brewing a lot of
beer would own a lot of pubs.'' Scottish &AMP; Newcastle, an
Edinburgh-based brewer that had sales of about $5.3 billion last
year, owns a slew of branded pubs and produces beer
</P>
<P>
   The Beer Orders, issued in the Thatcherite spirit of
deregulation, sought to sever this umbilical link between brewers
and drinkers because it gave the big breweries a stranglehold on
the supply chain, virtually from hops to gullet. The orders
instructed brewers that owned more than 2,000 pubs to sell either
their breweries or some of their pubs.
</P>
<P>
   That meant, Ms. Bain said, that ``a large number of pubs came
onto the market,'' offering new opportunities for a mini-generation
of pushy young entrepreneurs like Hugh Osmond, 37, who made his
name by establishing the Pizza Express brand and now runs Punch
Taverns, and Guy Hands, 38, a former investment banker with
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. Both have substantial backing from outside
Britain _ Hands from Japan's Nomura Securities Co. and Osmond from
Texas Pacific, a private U.S. equity company.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time,'' Ms. Bain said, ``you have changes in
consumer patterns. People want to go to the pub at least three or
four times a week for a meal, or to have coffee in the morning.''
In many pubs and themed bars, the old-fashioned pint of warm,
low-margin English beer has been displaced by smarter and more
profitable beverages, from chilled lager to elaborate cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura's involvement in the British pub business, which might
seem unlikely, is ascribed by analysts to Hands' ability to
persuade the Japanese company to invest in his vision of pubs as
business _ an investment that has so far led to some $3.2 billion
in acquisitions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If there was any doubt about the passions fueling this sea
change, consider the struggle for control of those 3,500 pubs put
on the market by Allied Domecq PLC, the world's second-largest
drinks maker, which shed its pubs to focus on liquor brands like
Ballantine's whisky and Beefeater gin. From May to July, Punch
Taverns dueled with the blue-chip brewer Whitbread PLC for control
of the Allied Domecq estate. Offer followed counteroffer. Only when
antitrust regulators threatened to scrutinize its offer did
Whitbread withdraw from the fray. That left Osmond of Punch Taverns
to clinch the deal on July 20 with $4.4 billion in cash and shares
in Bass PLC, which will buy 650 of the Allied Domecq pubs.
</P>
<P>
   The deal turned Punch Taverns _ which already owned 1,500 pubs
and recently acquired 688 more from Inn Business Group PLC for $107
million _ into one of Britain's biggest pub operators. Nomura, with
some 5,000 pubs, is the leader. And the matter may not end there.
Nomura was rumored last month to be preparing a counterbid, but has
withheld comment on the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Pub owners have recognized that a new generation of customers _
Scottish &AMP; Newcastle is aiming at 18- to 30-year-olds, Ms. Bain
said _ wants a new style, much to the consternation of older
customers who cleave to the old notion of the pub as a no-frills
retreat. But as the industry consolidates around a number of big
players like Nomura and Punch Taverns, it is questionable whether
the Beer Orders have really had the effect they were supposed to
have.
</P>
<P>
   Individual pub operators can pay up to $80,000 a year in rent on
a 10-year lease costing up to $250,000, Campbell said. But,
crucially, the deals restrict people like him to selling only the
beers specified by the big companies that own them. That means
leased pubs are just as immunized from competing brands as
so-called tenanted pubs were before the Beer Orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention was to break the stranglehold'' of the big
breweries, said Campbell, whose four leased pubs are dotted around
London, ``but now you have leases that make us vulnerable to
nonbrewers' whims.'' At the Bull and Last, for instance, Ms. Rimmer
may sell only beers from Bass PLC, the brewing, hotel and leisure
company that sold 1,500 pubs to Osmond in 1997 as Punch Taverns was
getting started. That translates into tight margins on beer sales,
leaving leaseholders to look for profit in food and wine, which are
controlled by the owners.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Campbell acknowledged, the owners invest in
improvements to the leased pubs, like those undertaken by Ms.
Rimmer. And by buying in bulk from the breweries, the owners can
command favorable wholesale prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some breweries take that a step further toward uniformity.
Managed pubs, like Scottish &AMP; Newcastle's 1,900 Rat &AMP; Parrot and T
&AMP; J Bernards outlets, are designed to offer what Ms. Bain, the
Scottish &AMP; Newcastle spokeswoman, called ``common standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the McDonald's thing, where you walk in and you know what
to expect,'' said Ms. Rimmer at the Bull and Last, which she
describes as a ``gastro pub'' in which the menu is dictated more by
an in-house chef than by a central marketing organization.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the drama surrounding the Punch Taverns purchase of
Allied Domecq's pubs, though, the market is not universally chirpy.
One big regional leisure group, the Greenalls Group PLC, which
makes half its $640 million sales from pubs and restaurants, mainly
in northwestern England, has underperformed the market so greatly
that it may be forced to sell its 760 managed pubs.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, many analysts regard the beer market itself as
being as flat as English beer is held to be by its critics, leaving
people like Campbell and Ms. Rimmer to look for profits in wines
and food.
</P>
<P>
   Yet small operators are being squeezed. ``What's tended to
happen in the last five years is that the bigger brands are getting
bigger and smaller brands are becoming less popular,'' Ms. Bain
said. Or, as Campbell put it, ``I think the old notion of the
corner boozer has fallen away forever.''

   DAMASCUS, Syria _ They work from basement offices, with dim
fluorescent light. Faded posters and almanacs depict Fidel Castro,
Che Guevara and martyrs killed long ago, and these aging
Palestinian leaders, too, seem relics of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Once, George Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh were Palestinian
revolutionaries in deed as well as word, leading guerrilla warfare
against Israel from Jordan and Lebanon. One is remembered by some
as a hijacker, the other as a killer, though it has been more than
a decade since they and their groups suspended their armed
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they live in limbo, not wanted by Israel and wanting no
part of the peace sought by Yasser Arafat, the mainstream leader of
the Palestinian Authority. Damascus is their haven, as it has been
for years, and this city is home, too, to even more radical
Palestinians, like Ahmed Jibril, whose group has yet to unshoulder
its arms.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has played host with gusto, even though guests like Habash
and Hawatmeh have for many years remained largely out of Western
view. But the presence of such men now could prove a complication
to the rekindling of peace talk between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly, Syria's role as host served to tweak Arafat, who is
regarded by the leaders here as a traitor to the Arab cause for
making a separate peace. And by allowing the groups to operate in
Lebanon, where it is a dominant power, Syria has kept pressure on
the Israelis as well.
</P>
<P>
   But if Syria is to enter a new and determined peace effort with
Israel, what is to become of these radical Palestinian leaders now?
</P>
<P>
   ``According to one story, when one of the Palestinian leaders
asked the Syrians what he should do if peace comes, the answer was,
`Buy a farm,''' said a diplomat, conjuring up an image of one-time
terrorists in bucolic retirement.
</P>
<P>
   A desire to achieve peace with Israel in the months ahead would
present Syria with competing goals. It would almost certainly
require some reining in of the Palestinian groups, which could lead
to lifting of American economic sanctions on Syria.
</P>
<P>
   But limiting actions by the groups could also cause bad feelings
among exiled Palestinians, who include 700,000 refugees in Syria
and Lebanon _ particularly if a crackdown preceded a comprehensive
settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, which is to
determine the refugees' final status.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said one well-connected Syrian, ``I don't think many of
these guys are looking at a long-term active future in Damascus.''
</P>
<P>
   The radical Palestinian groups in Syria and Lebanon cover a wide
range. On the most radical extreme, perhaps, is Jibril's Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, whose forces
are involved in attacks against Israeli forces in southern Lebanon,
sometimes in conjunction with Syrian-backed Lebanese groups like
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   The group's barracks in the southern suburbs of Beirut and in
the Bekaa region of Lebanon are regularly the target of Israeli air
raids.
</P>
<P>
   Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
which was an active fighting force from 1964 to 1987, is at the
other end of the spectrum. Now it is more of a social and political
body that opposes Arafat's Fatah faction and that operates openly
not only in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, but also in Gaza and the
West Bank, where Arafat is leader of the limited self-rule
Palestinian government.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to terrorism, Syria has usually been deft in
trying to keep its hands just as clean as necessary. It does not
allow the radical Palestinians to carry out any operations from its
soil, and about the most radical statements that emerge from
Damascus are carried on Jibril's radio station, Al Quds.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is no evidence, the State Department has said, of
direct Syrian involvement in terrorist acts since 1986. At about
that time, under American pressure, the Syrians expelled the
notorious Abu Nidal. But the fact that Syria provides safe haven
and support to the most violent of the Palestinian rejectionists,
including Jibril's group and Islamic Jihad, is among the reasons
cited by the State Department for Syria's continuation on the
terrorism list.
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews here, Hawatmeh and Habash, who is the
leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said
they were confident that their operations would continue without
interruption, even in the case of a Syrian-Israeli peace.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, Hawatmeh, a committed leftist who was born a
Greek Catholic in Salt, Jordan, led a Palestinian faction that lost
5,000 men in violence between 1965 and 1987, he said. Among the
acts for which he was labeled a terrorist by Israel was the 1974
takeover of a school in the Israeli town of Maalot by his
organization.
</P>
<P>
   In that hostage operation, more than 20 schoolchildren were
killed. Now Hawatmeh is 63, a slight man with a gentle demeanor who
sits beneath a tattered banner that traces the outlines of historic
Palestine and declares: ``God Bless Our Homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Habash, 72, was born in what is now Lod, Israel, to a Greek
Orthodox family, studied medicine, and went on to lead what became
the second-largest Palestinian group. He was an ardent Marxist
revolutionary and steadfast opponent of Israel's right to exist who
pioneered the tactic of airline hijackings in the late 1960s and
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   His most infamous act came in 1970, when his organization blew
up three airliners after parking them for a week in Jordan's
desert. ``When we hijack a plane it has more effect than if we
killed a hundred Israelis in battle,'' Habash once said. ``At least
the world is talking about us now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Today, Habash tires easily, his right side almost immobile from
a stroke suffered more than a decade ago. In 1992, France allowed
him to enter the country for medical treatment, but that turned
into a political scandal, with Jewish leaders and some French and
Israeli politicians calling for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The paths of the two men took them to Jordan, on to Lebanon, and
then, after the Israeli invasion of 1982 sent the Palestinians in
flight, on different tracks. Habash took refuge in Syria and
Hawatmeh went first to Algeria, where he stayed for nine years.
Their military operations stopped in 1987, when the Palestinian
focus shifted to the West Bank and Gaza, and the beginning of the
intifada, the uprising against the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they run what are effectively political parties, both
strongly opposed to Arafat's pursuit of what they regard as a
deeply flawed peace. Their separate headquarters are near each
other, in a largely residential neighborhood, and their dingy
quarters with dated decor make it appear that time has all but
stood still.
</P>
<P>
   Hawatmeh suggested that the newer Palestinian groups that still
embrace violence, like Islamic Jihad, are more likely to face
Syrian restrictions. ``If there is a comprehensive peace between
Syria and Israel, I think the Syrians will say frankly to these
groups that they cannot continue military struggle,'' Hawatmeh
said.
</P>
<P>
   In subtle ways, it appears that that message is already being
sent, Western diplomats and well-connected Syrians say. After a
meeting last month between the Syrian vice president, Abdelhalim
Khaddam, and the leaders of some organizations, including Habash,
there were news reports that Khaddam had gone so far as to call on
the groups to halt armed activities in Lebanon now, in preparation
for a possible peace.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian authorities denied that, and Habash told a visitor that
he had heard no such instructions. In an interview, Syria's
information minister, Mohammed Salman, said that nothing about the
role played by the Palestinian groups in Syrian or Jordan had
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such measures would be a reward to Barak,'' Salman said,
referring to Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel. ``Why should
Syria reward Barak in spite of the fact that he has done nothing
yet to move the peace process forward?'' But Salman seemed to leave
the door open to future limits on the more militant Palestinian
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian groups that exist in Syria have the right to
exert political and informational activities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   People with knowledge of the talks said that some of the more
radical Palestinian groups in Damascus, including the one led by
Jibril, who is in his 60s, were working overtime to digest what
they had heard as a clear signal.
</P>
<P>
   Khaddam, these people said, had simply observed that a
Syrian-Israeli peace might come within a year, and either
implicitly or explicitly said there might be a need for the
Palestinians to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Damascus-based diplomats say it is unlikely that Syria would
expel members of the radical groups, even after a signed peace.
Such a step could tarnish Syria's claim that it, and not Arafat, is
the true defender of the Palestinian cause and of the right of the
refugees to return to their homeland. The diplomats say Syria would
be more likely to close some training camps and to enforce an order
for the fighters to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Radical leaders like Habash say they have no intention of
leaving Syria any time soon. Only if Arafat can somehow win a
promise that every Palestinian refugee will be allowed a right to
return, Habash said, will he shake hands with his rival and
conclude that the cause has been won.
</P>
<P>
   Hawatmeh, on the other hand, would like to visit the West Bank
and Gaza. He still disagrees deeply with Arafat, but at a time when
the Palestinians and Israel may be about to begin a final stage of
negotiations, it is his duty, he said, to make a personal appeal to
the Palestinian leader not to give up too much.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent past, Palestinians far more notorious than he,
including Mohammed Abbas, the mastermind of the 1985 hijacking of
the cruise ship Achille Lauro, have been able to win the necessary
permission from the Israelis to return. But despite three years of
trying, Hawatmeh said, he has been unable to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The awkwardness of his position was underscored in February,
when a quick handshake with Israel's president, Ezer Weizman, at
the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan, created an Israeli political
firestorm that may have added to his troubles. At the time,
Benjamin Netanyahu, then Israel's prime minister, acidly declared,
``Today he remains committed to the murder of the Jews.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress went home for the August recess late last
week with little to show for itself beyond an arsenal of political
sound bites stockpiled to serve as campaign themes for a
high-stakes election that is still more than a year away.
</P>
<P>
   The achievements of the 106th Congress so far are scant _ mainly
a measure giving states more flexibility in using federal education
funds and another requiring deployment of a national missile
defense system. And across an array of fronts, Republicans and
Democrats seem more interested in campaigning than legislating.
</P>
<P>
   For example, President Clinton is so certain to kill the
far-reaching $792 billion tax cut passed by the Republican Congress
that its leaders decided not to send it to him until after Labor
Day so that he would not be able to make a showy White House
ceremony out of vetoing it while lawmakers were away. Republicans
nonetheless were elated that they had used the tax cut bill as a
way to distinguish themselves from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a dramatic difference between Republicans and
Democrats in this capital city,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,
``and this is the dividing line.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to regulate the managed care industry passed the
Senate but has yet to make it to the House floor because of
Republican fears that they could lose control and give the
Democrats a victory on the issue. Despite the school shootings in
Littleton, Colo., another school year will open without any new gun
control measures. And although Clinton has proposed restructuring
Medicare and adding a new prescription drug benefit, the issue has
simply drifted into the fall.
</P>
<P>
   It's still early to make any definitive judgments about this
Congress, and some grand political bargain on tax cuts, spending
and Medicare might yet materialize in the fall. But at the moment,
compromise does not seem to be in the air. Some lawmakers are
despairing at the focus on political point-scoring in the
all-campaign-all-the time Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep saying, `the election,''' said Sen. Olympia Snowe,
R- Maine. ``And I say that's a year and a half from now. In the
meantime could we just sort of legislate?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it has been said that in a democracy the people get the
government they deserve. The voters put in place a recipe for
gridlock when they elected a Democratic president, a Republican
Senate and a House nominally in Republican control but actually
divided nearly in two.
</P>
<P>
   Issues like gun control and health care are complicated and
emotional. Sorting out what the nation's fiscal priorities should
be across a decade that is expected to bring in a $3 trillion
surplus is a profound political decision with far-reaching
consequences. So it's no wonder that the two parties want to fight
out their differences in the 2000 campaign in hopes that next
year's election _ unlike the last presidential year of 1996 _ will
help settle some of the arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had a surplus of the magnitude projected, at least
in my lifetime,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle.
``There's a legitimate philosophical debate over what you do with
it,'' he said. ``This is the noise of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might say the tenuous balance of power is a sign to
Congress and the president that they should compromise. And they
briefly did, after the bruising 1995 fight over budget priorities
that led to the government shutdown, and after the inconclusive
1996 election. Unable to carry a Democratic Congress into office
with him, Clinton began his second term pledging to build a ``vital
center'' in U.S. politics. Republicans, chastened by their failure
to capture the White House, said they would cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later there was Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton
standing side by side on the White House lawn celebrating a
bipartisan milestone: a plan to balance the budget and cut taxes in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the spirit of compromise was short-lived. No matter how much
Clinton has tried to create a ``New Democrat'' or George W. Bush
looks for his own way as a ``compassionate conservative,'' the
partisan divisions in Congress have only been widening.
</P>
<P>
   The reapportionment of 1990 left many congressional districts
safely Republican and others overwhelmingly Democratic, giving most
House members little need to search for a center ground. The
Democrats who were once willing to vote with Ronald Reagan have
become Republicans. Liberal Republicans are almost extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Low voter participation in mid-term elections has also pushed
Republicans and Democrats, most particularly in the House, to cater
to their most devoted core voters and donor base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly Congress has become polarized,'' said Marshall
Wittmann, a congressional analyst at the conservative Heritage
Foundation. ``This has been a long-term development over the last
20-odd years. What you essentially have is a conservative party
versus a liberal party.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is that even when the two parties sound alike, their
rhetoric masks profound differences. Democrats say they support a
tax cut too _ just a smaller one than the Republicans. But most
Democrats put their passions into new programs like one to help
with school construction or a new Medicare prescription drug
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   And while Senate Republicans came up with a ``Patients' Bill of
Rights Plus'' to counter the Democrats ``Patients' Bill of
Rights,'' the Republican managed care bill was so much weaker than
the Democrats' version that it almost seemed to highlight the
Republicans' aversion to government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a reservoir of trust and good will to find a way
around such differences. But the impeachment battle left trust
between the parties in short supply. And the razor-thin majority in
the House has made matters worse: The parties judge every issue by
its likely effect on the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   So Democrats accuse Republicans of passing a large tax cut to
create a campaign issue. Republicans insist that Democrats are
blocking bills, like a Republican version of gun control, because
they want to run against a do-nothing Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers still try to swim against the tide. One
bipartisan group in the House reached agreement on a managed care
bill Thursday, hours before Congress recessed.
</P>
<P>
   As they announced the details in the late afternoon heat
Thursday outside the Capitol, Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said,
``Let's put the election of 2000 where it belongs _ November 2000.
Today let's work on issues that face every American. ''
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed like a throwback to another era.

CLINTON FAULTS PROGRAM TO EXPAND HEALTH COVERAGE TO CHILDREN

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will send federal officials to
all the states to investigate whether they have improperly excluded
people from Medicaid or from a new federal health insurance program
for children, White House officials said Saturday. At the same time
he will try to get schools across the country to help arrange
health coverage for millions of uninsured children.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to announce the efforts on Sunday when he
addresses the 91st annual meeting of the National Governors'
Association in St. Louis. The steps reflect his disappointment at
the way some states have carried out the new health program for
children, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, the officials said, Clinton may take a more
confrontational approach than he usually does in discussions with
the governors, whose policy role he appreciates as a former
governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``States now have an unprecedented opportunity to expand health
coverage, and they should make the most of it,'' said Bruce Reed,
the president's chief domestic policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress created the Children's Health Insurance Program in
1997, it gave the states billions of dollars _ $24 billion over
five years, more than $39 billion over 10 years _ and considerable
flexibility in how the money may be used. In addition, White House
officials noted, states are getting billions more from the
settlement of lawsuits against tobacco companies, money that is
available for children's programs.
</P>
<P>
   But so far only 1.3 million children have been enrolled in the
new health program, the administration says. Clinton said recently
that he would have expected at least 3 million by now, and that he
was therefore ``a little disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also try to enlist the governors in his campaign
against tax and spending policies of the Republican Congress. He
will argue that the tax bill passed this week by Congress would not
only use up all the anticipated surpluses in the federal budget,
but also threaten federal-state programs like welfare, Medicaid,
education and social services, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Confidential White House documents show that Clinton will
instruct the Health Care Financing Administration to ``conduct
comprehensive on-site reviews of state Medicaid enrollment and
eligibility processes'' in all states. Federal officials will
interview state officials and check case files to ``assess
compliance with current laws and develop recommendations for
improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said a major purpose of this audit was ``to find out more
information about what's going on in each state.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, a group of welfare recipients filed suit against
the state of Florida, contending that the state had illegally cut
off their Medicaid benefits when it ended their cash assistance. In
January, a federal district judge ruled that New York City had
improperly denied Medicaid to poor people who failed to comply with
work requirements of the city's welfare program. In Pennsylvania,
32,000 former welfare recipients won reinstatement of Medicaid only
after months of difficult negotiations with state officials.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, federal officials will highlight the best
practices developed by states like Nebraska, Ohio and South
Carolina to enroll eligible children in the new health insurance
program. Federal officials will also publicize the techniques used
by states to insure that people moving from welfare to work get
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, White House officials said, the Education Department
will send letters to 15,700 school superintendents and 27,000
elementary school principals, prodding them to help enroll children
in Medicaid and in the Children's Health Insurance Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``A staggering 11 million American children and teen-agers have
no health insurance,'' said Education Secretary Richard W. Riley on
a new Web site created especially to promote the Administration's
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to school superintendents, Riley says more than 6
million of these children are eligible for Medicaid or the new
health program, but have not enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Uninsured children are more likely to suffer from asthma, ear
infections and vision problems _ ``treatable conditions that
interfere with classroom participation'' _ and they are absent more
often than their peers, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Eligibility criteria for Medicaid and the new child health
program vary from state to state. Medicaid is intended for families
with somewhat lower incomes.
</P>
<P>
   White House documents show that the Clinton administration will
urge schools to take these steps to enroll children in the two
programs:
</P>
<P>
   _ Make enrollment part of the school registration process. Add a
question to school enrollment forms asking whether students have
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use the school lunch application form to see if children are
eligible for subsidized health insurance and even to enroll them in
the health programs. ``Children who are eligible for free and
reduced-price school meals are usually eligible for free or
low-cost health insurance programs'' too, the Education Department
says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disseminate information on children's health insurance at
back-to-school nights, PTA meetings, sports events and school
plays.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure all school employees, including teachers,
principals, school nurses, guidance counselors and coaches, know
about children's health insurance programs, so they can share the
information with students and parents.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also plans to criticize the states for
failing to submit required data on the number of children enrolled
in Medicaid and the new program. In the absence of such data,
federal officials cannot be sure if the programs are succeeding,
and Republicans in Congress are tempted to take back some of the
money earmarked for Medicaid and the children's health program.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting in St. Louis, the governors are expected to
adopt resolutions declaring that Congress should not reduce the
amount of money available to the states for the children's health
program, Medicaid or welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Seven senators deeply involved in creation of the new children's
health program sent a letter this week to Secretary of Health and
Human Services Donna Shalala lamenting ``the lack of reliable
data.'' They said they needed such data ``to evaluate whether we
have made overall progress in reducing the number of uninsured
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter also expressed concern that some states were using
money from the new program to cover children already eligible for
Medicaid, a practice forbidden by the 1997 law.
</P>
<P>
   States have a financial incentive to enroll children in the new
program, rather than in Medicaid, because the federal government
pays a larger share of the costs. Families often prefer the new
program because it carries less of a stigma than Medicaid, which is
widely but inaccurately viewed as something available only to
welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Among the seven senators who signed the letter to Shalala were
William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee;
Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the panel's senior Democrat;
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; John H. Chafee, R-R.I.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also prod the states to guarantee Medicaid coverage
for people who lose welfare benefits. Congress made $500 million
available to the states to help achieve this goal, but so far
states have spent only $39 million, the White House says.
Twenty-nine states will lose eligibility for the money at the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1996, people who received cash assistance were
automatically enrolled in Medicaid. But the 1996 welfare law
severed the link between the programs. Congress provided the $500
million because it assumed that states would incur new
administrative costs in evaluating eligibility for Medicaid and
welfare separately.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says states should use the money to ``conduct
aggressive outreach campaigns,'' to find people eligible for
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also challenge states to expand Medicaid
eligibility by taking advantage of several options authorized by
the 1996 welfare law. States can, for example, provide Medicaid for
many low-income families who no longer qualify for welfare.
</P>
<P>
   People seeking free or low-cost health insurance for children
can obtain information on a toll-free telephone number,
877-KIDS-NOW (877-543-7669) and on the Internet, at
www.insurekidsnow.gov. Another Web site is at www.ed.gov/chip.

   WASHINGTON _ First there was the name change. The American
Association of Retired Persons is no longer the American
Association of Retired Persons. It is AARP, and Horace Deets, its
executive director, insists that, ``It is no longer an acronym.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the gradual transformation of ``Modern
Maturity,'' the AARP's magazine. A year ago, the cover featured
Betty White, 77, looking lovely but also, well, mature. The
headline was, ``Betty White, on Life, Loss and Laughter.'' This
month, the cover features Susan Sarandon, 52, looking like she
belongs in an issue that is, in fact, headlined, ``Great Sex _
What's Age Got to Do With It?''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of sex, the AARP (note to copy editors: this is no
longer an acronym) released a survey last week focusing on the
sexual satisfaction of Americans 45 and up. Before the news
conference began, the nation's largest senior citizens' group
played cuts from James Brown (``I Feel Good'') and Gladys Knight
and the Pips (``You're the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me'')
stirring up latent memories of college mixers among the assembled
reporters, who proceeded to ask a flurry of questions about
frequency and potency.
</P>
<P>
   AARP officials made much of the fact that over-45 boomers were
still having sex and, by and large, would continue to have sex for
many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Its officials make no secret of it: The AARP is trying to
retrofit itself for the baby boomers, the next great wave of the
aged, who began turning 50 three years ago and thus became eligible
for that fraught rite of passage, membership in the AARP.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the lobbying giant say they have no intention of
short-changing older members, who have more traditional
expectations of retirement and what they want from a senior
citizens' organization. (``We're not just showing people on the
cover who are 51 and 52 years old,'' said Martha Ramsey, publishing
director for the group.)
</P>
<P>
   But the boomers, those born from 1946 through 1964, are headed
inexorably through the life cycle, and the mighty AARP's struggle
to adjust says a lot about how they will remake paradigms of aging
and retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get the benefit or the burden, whichever way you see it, of
all the ambivalent feelings people have about aging,'' said John
Rother, the organization's chief lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the cultural collision between the boomers and what
Modern Maturity cheerfully calls the ``Big Five-Oh'' has launched a
thousand newspaper columns, essays, bad birthday greetings and
late-night monologues, including Jay Leno's ceremonial enrollment
of Mick Jagger, 56, into the AARP two weeks ago. (Leno produced a
mock version of Modern Maturity with Jagger on the cover, with
headlines like, ``From Rolling Stones to Kidney Stones'' and
``Can't Get No Satisfaction? Try Bran Muffins.'')
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is some evidence that the boomers are simply
denying the passage of time. A recent poll found that while the
median age of the boomers is now 42, the typical boomer says he or
she feels about 35.
</P>
<P>
   But polling done for the AARP and others suggests that boomers
are, in fact, beginning to think about their golden years _ and in
a very distinctive way. To begin with, lest you wonder why the AARP
moved away from the word ``retired,'' 80 percent of the boomers say
they expect to continue working during ``retirement,'' either part
time, full time in a new career or by going into business for
themselves, according to a 1998 poll by Roper Starch Worldwide for
the AARP. And more than a third say they will be doing that
primarily for ``interest and enjoyment.'' (Even now, 40 percent of
AARP's members are still working.)
</P>
<P>
   Only a fifth of the boomers expect to move to a new geographic
area when they retire _ in contrast with the previous generation's
dream of a mass exodus to Florida _ and only a third think they
will have to scale back their lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Big majorities say they expect to live longer than their
parents' generation, and that awareness makes a difference, said
Dr. James Birren, associate director of the UCLA Center on Aging.
``Boomers are thinking more about how they want to invest all those
years of the future as opposed to getting through them,'' he said.
Many of the previous generation, he added, simply did not
anticipate living as long as they have.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Peter Hart agreed that while boomers might expect to
live 25 years after retirement, the previous generation probably
anticipated five to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Dychtwald, the president of Age Wave, a research
organization and business focused on the ``mature market,'' argues
that boomers will live a ``cyclical lifestyle'' _ ``going back to
school, having multiple careers, retiring, rehiring.'' He added,
``They will not accept old age at all.'' Previous generations, the
49-year-old Dychtwald said, lived ``linear lives'' _ from work to
rest to death.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Delehanty, the 50-year-old new editor of Modern Maturity,
said he senses a hunger among the boomers for a ``new paradigm for
life after 50,'' a way of thinking about the next career or the
next work life. Delehanty, who once edited the Utne Reader, a
leftist, boomer-oriented digest of the alternative press, said he
plans a future issue of Modern Maturity on ``How to Reinvent Your
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Boomers are also more health and fitness conscious, analysts
say. And, not surprisingly, they tend to be more anti-authority,
more skeptical of government, more interested in ``empowerment''
and ``choice.'' As Deets puts it: ``They want to make their own
decisions. They don't want to be told what to do.''

   What does all this mean for the 41-year-old AARP, which claims
more than 30 million members? Officials say they are doing a lot of

diversity of the boomer generation.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, long known for its insurance products as well
as its formidable defense of Social Security and Medicare on
Capitol Hill, recently spun off a subsidiary to explore new
services and products for the over-50 population. And its magazine,
which has long published different versions for the working and
retired set (the sex report appeared in both), may be doing more
such demographically zoned editions in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Dychtwald, a critic of the AARP, asserts that the senior group
will have a hard time serving both the old old and the new old.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is worried about fixed incomes and entitlements, the other
is worried about paying for their kids' education and elder care
and mutual funds,'' he said. ``Can AARP maintain their relationship
with their core constituency, who are likely to be retired
grandparents with a lot of free time, who are very respectful of
government, while simultaneously trying to be irreverent,
anti-authority, hip and modern?''
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic pollster Mark Mellman argues that the boomers
will be traditionalists in one respect: their support for those New
Deal-Great Society entitlement programs. ``They are pro-Medicare
and pro-Social Security, for themselves and for their parents,''
Mellman said.
</P>
<P>
   Celinda Lake, another Democratic pollster, said the 50-to-64 age
group is ``more adamant'' about strengthening and protecting those
programs than any other.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying question, of course, is how much old age will
change the boomers, and how much the boomers will change old age.
Meanwhile, time stops for no generation. Welcomed into ``The Big
Five-Oh'' club in the latest issue of Modern Maturity were Annie
Leibovitz, Twiggy and, the headliner of this summer's big rock
tour, Bruce Springsteen.

<P>
   On Wolcott Street in Waterbury, Conn., on a recent afternoon
earth-movers prowled the wreckage of the Naugatuck Valley Mall,
scooping up the rubble of what was once the main shopping center
there. For miles on either side, roadside signs announce Arby's,
Shop-Rite, Sleepy's the Mattress Professionals _ today's typical
suburban vista.
</P>
<P>
   But now dead or dying shopping centers are also typical. It's
known as ``going dark,'' the theatrical term that seems
particularly apt given the April closing of the Galleria Mall, in
Sherman Oaks, Calif., where ``Valley Girls'' and ``Fast Times at
Ridgemont High'' were filmed. In Fishkill, N.Y., the once vibrant
Dutchess Mall is ailing. Payless Shoes, Deb Shops and Foot Locker
are among the few remaining tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Gibbs, a retail consultant and urban planner from
Birmingham, Mich., who is regularly on the road monitoring these
things for cities and developers, estimates that there are 500 to
1,000 ghost shopping centers in the country.
</P>
<P>
   To observers of this changing scene, such ferment seems natural.
``Babylon was done in in part by certain conquerors who sacked
it,'' says William W. Hallo, the Laffan Professor of Assyriology at
Yale University. ``But what really did it in was the location of
new capital cities in close proximity that undercut the economic
base for its prosperity. This happened all over the ancient
world.''
</P>
<P>
   And it went on happening, not only with cities but also with the
buildings within them and now with the malls beyond, which were
created in the image of downtown centers. Witold Rybczynski, who
chronicled the history of shopping centers in ``City Life: Urban
Expectations in a New World'' (Touchstone, 1996), says it is part
of the nature of any building to have a life cycle that ends in
obsolescence. Shopping centers are no exception. ``They've been
around in various forms since the turn of the century,'' he said,
``and they've evolved, they've changed a lot over that time.'' The
early town centers that mixed shops with apartments were followed
by hybrids of strip centers and enclosed malls, including today's
neo-traditional town centers that some planners see as an antidote
to suburban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, where a mall has failed, a bigger, more
state-of-the-art shopping mecca looms on the horizon. ``You
remember that movie `One Million B.C.,' with Victor Mature as a
caveman?'' asks James Howard Kunstler, whose book, ``The Geography
of Nowhere'' (Touchstone, 1994), helped establish him as an
outspoken proponent of the New Urbanism, a design movement to
restore a sense of community to cities and suburbs. ``Well, at one
point the cavemen are sort of cringing in the foreground while
these two dinosaurs battle it out in the background, and in the end
one of them has his feet up in the air and he's dead. And this is
pretty much the mall situation in American towns. The citizens are
standing around like the cringing cavemen watching these monsters
battle each other for world domination. Of course, behind it all we
know they're both headed for extinction anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Shopping centers, some critics feel, have reached their
saturation point. The new mall threatening the old one is perhaps
symptomatic of a much larger problem _ ``too much shopping space
per American,'' Rybczynski says. That includes cyberspace and the
incalculable square footage that mail order catalogs would take up
if laid end to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will always be malls,'' Gibbs said, ``but fewer
of them. And they will face greater competition'' _ in some cases
from downtown blocks that developers, in an interesting about-face,
have remodeled to mimick malls.
</P>
<P>
   David Livshin, president of the Dagar Group Ltd., which manages
the Dutchess Mall, admits that the sight of it ``sitting there
basically on life support'' could be viewed as a harbinger of
suburban decay. Instead, this 70 acres of interstate-front property
is a new frontier, ready to be reconfigured, Livshin says, with
offices, retail stores, restaurants, perhaps a conference center, a
gym and ``an interesting common area where people can sit.'' In
other words, he hinted at an environment akin to Gibbs' current
project at the defunct mall in Levittown, N.J. The new center will
have housing, a community college, a post office and about 2,000
square feet of retail shops.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, some failed malls are turning into industrial parks
and corporate or college campuses. Or they're being ``de-malled''
to create drive-up-to-the-door strip centers _ often anchored by
retailers like Walmart or Home Depot, which an increasing number of
shoppers find more convenient than the vast, multi-level centers
with miles of parking lots and walkways.
</P>
<P>
   What time-challenged shoppers want these days, Gibbs said, is
``to park close to the store and run in and run out without having
to go through the whole mall process.''
</P>
<P>
   An outdated center is easier and cheaper to recycle than, say,
the abandoned old brick mills or factories haunting some towns,
Rybczynski says. Their lightweight construction is an advantage in
restructuring them. Or in demolishing them. And, said Gibbs, who
prefers retrofitting to starting over, ``Local people generally
have a love and loyalty for the old mall. A lot of them grew up
there as kids, or they're senior citizens and raised their families
there, so they want to see it survive.'' Rybczynski says that
shopping centers have become a part of who Americans are and how
they live. Several are on the National Register of Historic Places,
including Highland Park Village in Highland Park, Texas, built
between 1931 and 1941, which is also a National Historic Landmark.
</P>
<P>
   But less distinguished examples of what architectural historians
now recognize as ``a distinctive American building type'' will
always be vulnerable to the vicissitudes of commerce and
demographics. ``The perception was, the mall's gone, now the area's
dead,'' said Rob Kane, who owns Kartele Cellular Phones near the
recently razed Naugatuck Valley Mall. ``We had to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Local merchants are aggressively promoting the area as the
``Magical Retail Mile.'' Although the nearby Barnes &AMP; Noble and
Toys ``R'' Us moved to Waterbury's brand-new regional mall, which
put the old one out of business, a new movie theater, a day care
center and a video store have opened here since the old mall's
demise. What will replace it is still undecided, but just the sight
of the rubble is ``progress,'' Kane said. ``It means there's
activity going on. It's not like when it was just sitting there,
empty.''

   In ``The Lorax,'' Dr. Seuss wrote about ``thneeds,'' an
absolutely useless product for which an entire forest is destroyed.
Compared to what you are about to read, thneeds seem essential.
</P>
<P>
   This is a story about artificial testicles for pets.
</P>
<P>
   Some 25,532 sets were said to have been sold in 50 states and 14
countries _ including one for a horse in Louisiana that was
outfitted two weeks ago _ and ain't capitalism grand?
</P>
<P>
   The inventor and manufacturer of the gumdrop-shaped implants,
Gregg A. Miller, who lives in the Kansas City area, came up with
the idea seven years ago when he had his 200-pound bloodhound Buck
neutered. Three years later he patented ``Neuticles,'' just as
profits from a previous invention, candy in a tube, had dried up.
And he has expanded the line to include other animals, particularly
cats.
</P>
<P>
   The cheaper polyprophylene model sells for $25 to $32 a set; the
newer solid silicone alternative, called ``Neuticle Naturals''
sells for $80 to $129. The implantation procedure takes two or
three minutes, and there have been no reported medical
complications. ``It's as easy as changing a light bulb,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   But why?
</P>
<P>
   Some experts suggest it is not done for the pets. ``The dog
doesn't care,'' said Sean Aiken, a surgeon at the Animal Medical
Center in New York. ``Very few dogs are truly vain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogs could care less,'' Laura Keagy, office manager of the
Beverly Hills Small Animal Hospital, which offers neuticles. ``But
a lot of clients have trouble with a male dog being castrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sheldon Yessenow, a veterinarian at the Oronoque Animal
Center in Stratford, Conn., said a client had asked for neuticles
and that he had dutifully ordered some. But when it came time to do
the operation, he could not install them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was ridiculous and unethical,'' he said, saying
if the dog ran away and ended up with new owners, he might end up
getting neutered twice.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a time when lots of people will do seemingly
anything for their pets. There are pet vacations, pet gourmet foods
and pet perfumes. Pets get hip replacements, cataract operations
and dental jobs. About the only thing they don't get is plastic
surgery. Indeed, the clipping of ears and tails of some breeds is
on the downswing. (It's illegal in Britain.) Floppy-eared Dobermans
have won dog shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is tending toward a more natural look, including the
dog world,'' Ms. Keagy said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's contention is that dogs  &UR; do  &LR;  know the difference, and
that they suffer from what he calls ``post-neutering trauma.'' He
asked, ``Why wouldn't they know they've lost an important body
part?''
</P>
<P>
   But do they dwell on it? Ingrid Newkirk, president of the People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, thinks not. ``It's like
switching from regular to skim to soy milk,'' she said. ``You get
adjusted to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Manevitz, a psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital,
suggests that people are showing a good side of themselves by
investing their animals with concerns that are important to human
beings. ``It's identifying with suffering,'' he said. ``It has a
sweet quality to it, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   One question remains. Does Buddy, the Clinton family's chocolate
Labrador, have Neuticles? Miller claims to have gotten a personal
thank-you note from the president after sending a pair at the time
of the dog's neutering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw or heard anything about any unusual features,''
said Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman. ``But I'll check on it.''
</P>
<P>
   He did. No Neuticles.

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Not long ago, outside the
razor-wire-topped fence around our house here, I drove past a man
in street clothes with a large pistol tucked in the leather holster
at his waist. After a second, I decided he must be a security
guard. But I looked at that gun and scoffed. What was he going to
do with such a puny gun, and holstered besides? Up the street was a
guard pacing a driveway with a pump-action shotgun. Now that might
do some good.
</P>
<P>
   I went about my business.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be me? Four years ago, when I lived on the Upper West
Side of Manhattan, the sight of a civilian with a gun on my block
would have left me slightly out of breath. I would have hustled my
kids inside, asked the doorman who that guy was and probably called
the police. At least I would make sure he was a licensed, trained
guard.
</P>
<P>
   But guns are everywhere in Africa, a legacy of conflict and a
result of lax gun control. Here the special line for checking guns
at the airport is often as long as the one to go through the metal
detector. There are gun stores in South Africa's fanciest malls,
within spitting distance of Godiva chocolates and Fendi handbags.
Of course, these are designer gun shops, where the rich buy slick,
showy little guns hoping to protect themselves from a crime rate
that is among the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the upscale stuff. Police and army roadblocks are
standard practice all over the continent, manned by young men with
huge automatic weapons dangling carelessly from their shoulders. In
South Africa, you might be asked for a bribe. In some other
countries, the roadblocks are often an encounter with hungry,
drunken youths itching to show their authority.
</P>
<P>
   Since moving here four years ago, I have learned to distinguish
an AK-47 from a South African R-4 or an R-5 from an Uzi _ though
this skill isn't much use. They can all kill you. Still, the
learning process is a little like getting to know the kinds of
trees and birds that are native here.
</P>
<P>
   I even know enough to laugh at the swaggering revolutionaries on
the Comoros Islands who taped three ammunition magazines together:
The move might look Rambo-ish, but it's pretty useless. Tape two
banana clips together and you save time loading. Three doesn't
work: You'll be tangled up in tape for half an hour. Yes, this is
me talking. The lady in the designer jeans.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I arrived late at night at my hotel in Angola I
thought I was done for when two figures moved out of the shadows
with machine guns. Now I know they are the doormen, and I don't
like getting out of the car until I see the glint of their
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most unlikely South Africans carry guns. Early on, we
were invited to dinner by a couple _ both television producers.
They were smart and funny and we had journalism in common. You
might have met them on the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   But then, as it often does here, the subject turned to crime.
The husband started talking about caliber, ammunition and, with
some modesty, of course, what a good shot he was.
</P>
<P>
   Could he be serious? He was. He favored ankle holsters. He
 &UR; always &LR;  carried a gun.
</P>
<P>
   More shocking still was the day we discovered that a woman my
husband drools over _ a woman who might actually have Barbie Doll
proportions _ drove around town with a little gun in her lap. She
was the mother of my youngest daughter's best friend. My daughter
was in that car a lot _ and had never been told to put on her seat
belt.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many guns here that cops even have to watch out for
the good guys. When I did a story about drug-trafficking in South
Africa, a group of undercover police officers told me the story of
how they tried to arrest one of the big bosses behind the street
sales. They lured him out of his mansion to make an exchange on the
street. But when a grungy looking undercover officer pulled his gun
out to arrest the man, more than a half dozen well-meaning citizens
misunderstood the situation. They saw only a white man in a
Mercedes being held up at gunpoint. Soon, the police officer was
begging for his life.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is now considering broad new anti-gun legislation
that would make all gun owners apply for new licenses, prove their
need to be armed and take a mental health test. Gun owners are
furious. Whether the law could be enforced is a question. After
all, the current laws already are pretty tough, and widely
circumvented. To buy a gun, you have to pass a police check which
can take months. But generally, the police are inept and corruption
is rampant. One of the biggest gangsters in Cape Town was recently
found to have a legitimate license for his gun.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter what South Africa's laws, there will always be
easy access to guns _ big guns _ nearby. Mozambique is awash with
weapons, left over from its long civil war. Even civilians were
armed by the various factions, and by some estimates there are
still enough AK-47s around to arm every man, woman and child in
that country.
</P>
<P>
   At night in our lush suburb with a pool in every yard, the pop
of gun fire can be heard regularly. But it usually takes a visitor
to remind me. Like the screeches of the ibises that peck the thatch
from our roof, I don't even hear them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   I do still draw the line at having a gun in my own household.
While I was away once, my husband _ who now brags that he outshot
everyone on a game-ranger course _ got into the game in a small
way. He bought a BB gun and swore our two girls to secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   But he forgot to clean up the packaging. Was there a gun to go
with the box, I asked the girls? They laughed. Oh yes, Dad had
showed them how to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   In a fury, I found the BB gun and buried it deep behind some
bushes in the yard.
</P>
<P>
   Really, if we are going to do this, we need a better gun than
that.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Not long ago, outside the
razor-wire-topped fence around our house here, I drove past a man
in street clothes with a large pistol tucked in the leather holster
at his waist. After a second, I decided he must be a security
guard. But I looked at that gun and scoffed. What was he going to
do with such a puny gun, and holstered besides? Up the street was a
guard pacing a driveway with a pump-action shotgun. Now that might
do some good.
</P>
<P>
   I went about my business.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be me? Four years ago, when I lived on the Upper West
Side of Manhattan, the sight of a civilian with a gun on my block
would have left me slightly out of breath. I would have hustled my
kids inside, asked the doorman who that guy was and probably called
the police. At least I would make sure he was a licensed, trained
guard.
</P>
<P>
   But guns are everywhere in Africa, a legacy of conflict and a
result of lax gun control. Here the special line for checking guns
at the airport is often as long as the one to go through the metal
detector. There are gun stores in South Africa's fanciest malls,
within spitting distance of Godiva chocolates and Fendi handbags.
Of course, these are designer gun shops, where the rich buy slick,

   LONDON _ When an eclipse brings night at mid-morning on
Wednesday in Cornwall, a county in southwestern England, there will
be a clear, predictable scientific explanation: The moon will
interpose itself between the Earth and the sun and a shadow will
fall on land for precisely two minutes and six seconds. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   The full solar eclipse will be the first seen from Britain in 72
years and the last one of the millennium. But with little regard
for the obvious explanation, pagans, druids, doomsayers and New Age
travelers are anxiously awaiting the approach of the eclipse and
translating its portents in many ways, seeing divine felicity, the
end of the world _ anything except celestial science.
</P>
<P>
   And that says something about a nation whose John Bull
stereotype of proud pragmaticism seems challenged by this strain of
mysticism questing for alternative meanings. It is as if within the
soul of every bulldog Briton there lurked a secret doppelganger,
mistrustful of the scientifically obvious and craving mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Duality, of course, has always been an object of fascination
here: consider Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or Dorian Gray, both
presenting one visage to the world while another corrodes from
within. And the rejection of science's road map for the universe
yields a seam of alternative thinking, from the Luddites who
protested the mechanization of the Industrial Revolution in the
early 19th century, to the activists who, three times in the past
couple of months, have torn up experimental crops to protest the
genetic modification of the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans cheerfully embrace the fruits of scientific
advance as the harbingers of future wealth and well-being _ from
bug-free soya to Internet stocks _ it could be argued that some
people in this much older nation with its great imperial history
look backward for their coordinates. In Cornwall this week, that
means a long, long way back _ back to the times when the Earth's
unlocked mysteries were an explanation in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eclipse is the big event, the end of an era,'' said Andy
Norfolk, a member of the pagan Cornish Earth Mysteries Group. ``We
find divinity in the natural world. The sun and moon are very
important. There is a great power when they come together like
this.'' Pagan worshipers plan a sun dance to ward off what the
science of meteorology says is a 50 percent chance of cloudiness on
the fateful day.
</P>
<P>
   And if that seems implausible, just consider the omens.
</P>
<P>
   The eclipse is set to begin at 11 minutes past 11 o'clock on the
11th day of the month. Coincidence? Or necromancer's compass
bearings? Plenty of people prefer the latter explanation. Take the
Cornish Eclipse Stone Festival, for instance, which runs one whole
week around the eclipse and is billed as ``a celebration of bikes,
blues, stones and druids.'' Or the Moonshadow Rising, a three-week
assembly of New Age travelers, who are Britain's anarchic, nomadic
successors to the hippie travelers of the 1960s; they are expected
to join the 1 million converging on the county.
</P>
<P>
   This wild blossoming of mysticism is probably because the
70-mile-wide track of ``totality,'' as the complete blotting out of
the sun is known, will cross a county readily linked with the
supernatural. ``There's a mystical strain in every country and
eclipses are likely to bring that out,'' said Richard Dawkins,
professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford
University. ``But Cornwall has a certain association with pixies,
fairies and standing stones and so it's fairly normal for people to
gravitate towards Cornwall.''
</P>
<P>
   But the last total eclipse in Britain, in 1927, was over the
bleak Yorkshire moors, which are not especially known for
mysticism, and it inspired the same awe and hype: Special trains
were scheduled, then as now, thousands converged on the track of
totality, including, most famously, Virginia Woolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had very strongly the feeling as the light went out of some
vast obeisance; something kneeling down and suddenly raised up when
the colors came,'' she wrote in her diary. When the sun re-emerged,
she said, ``It was like recovery . . . We had seen the world
dead.'' Even hard-nosed newspapermen grew mystical. The London's
Daily Mail reported: ``It was just as if the light of the sun had
been extinguished for ever and the end of the world was at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Awe seems an appropriate emotion. ``It will be right to be awed
by the eclipse, and to draw on ideas from religion, myth and
literature,'' said John Casey, an academic at Cambridge University.
``It will be much healthier than all the Nostradamus and New Age
noodledom that has afflicted us with the approach of the third
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   But Britain's alternative strain is not driven simply by awe.
Environmental protesters routinely barricade themselves in trees or
caves to prevent the building of new highways and airports. In
June, druids converging on Stonehenge found their celebration of
the summer solstice disrupted by New Age travelers and anarchists
protesting the introduction of entrance fees to the site.
</P>
<P>
   The same month, anarchists who had promised only a day of street
carnivals in London's financial district instead trashed investment
banks and exchanges, baited, it was reported, by hot-shot
derivatives traders taunting them by waving gold credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   The same people have printed fliers advertising similar action
this week, calling for an ``anarchy jamboree'' in the Cornish town
of Penzance, targeting such disparate icons of capitalism as
McDonald's and organized rock concerts. ``Pay for absolutely
nothing. Help yourselves from corporate retailers,'' the leaflets
say, calling for a so-called dance-a-thon with ``lots of happy
people smashing up all the cars via the medium of dance.'' Mammon
is not the only target.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the outcry against genetically modified crops _ and the
readiness of protesters to risk arrest by uprooting them _ that the
authorities have decided to keep their location secret in future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's clearly a lot of Ludditism and you see it in all the
hysteria about every scientific story,'' said Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
   This being Britain, though, John Bull's dogged pragmatism can be
expected to stand four square against such distractions, fusing
Britain's sundered soul into one single motif: profit. For
instance, two British Airways Concorde airliners flying in
formation 10 miles up and at 1,350 miles per hour will pursue the
track of totality as it speeds across the Atlantic, enabling
eclipse junkies to keep the darkened sun in sight for six minutes
instead of the terrestrial two _ blending science and superstition,
the supernatural and the supersonic, at a mere $2,500 a head.

COMMENTARY: POLITICAL HUSBANDRY IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SIOUX CENTER, Iowa _ When he walks through the door of the party
room at the Pizza Ranch, I realize I'm glad to see him.
</P>
<P>
   A girl can get pretty desperate sitting around a mall in an
outpost of northern Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The Bobster has on that same powder-blue early-bird-special
jacket he wore in his own presidential campaign in the summer of
'96. And those gleaming tasseled loafers that mark him as a Gucci
Gulch Washington lobbyist in a joint with a sign out front that
reads: ``Please remove soiled boots before entering.''
</P>
<P>
   The 76-year-old spouse in the running to be the first first man
dishes about remodeling at the Watergate. ``We did buy the
apartment that Monica lived in,'' Bob Dole tells the handful of
seniors with gray hair and teen-agers with purple hair who have
shown up to hear him. ``We wanted to make our place a little
bigger. In fact, the walls are being torn down today, I think.''
Pausing, he adds slyly: ``We'll have tours there on Sundays.''
</P>
<P>
   The retired senator spent two days in Iowa last week stumping
for his wife, trying to work his way out of the doghouse. He was
banished there after his interview in May with The New York Times'
Richard L. Berke, in which he was distinctly dour about Elizabeth
Dole's prospects, and even suggested he might write a check to John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told the truth _ I don't think that's against the
law,'' he says defensively to an Iowa reporter who asks about it.
``John McCain is a good friend of mine. But obviously I'm for
Elizabeth. I've been urging her to do this for years.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Dole was probably not belittling Elizabeth because
he was jealous. He's just a saturnine guy who speaks his mind. He
was even more dour during his own race four years ago, a campaign
with no pulse and no rationale that was dubbed ``Dead Man Walking''
by The New Republic.
</P>
<P>
   He still tends to be more realistic than connubially partisan
when talking about his wife's bleak chances. ``I think there will
be a Republican president,'' he ventures.
</P>
<P>
   He's fuzzy on Liddy's 10-point agriculture policy, but recalls
wistfully, ``I was on the Ag Committee for 30 years.'' He gives the
same impression campaigning for her that he did campaigning for
himself: He'd rather be home on the treadmill watching C-Span.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife seem a bit confused on how to play the issue of
a female president. On the one hand, Dole says, gender shouldn't
matter; qualifications should. But on the other hand, he suggests
that if she's elected, the ``glass ceiling will be forgotten.'' And
he envies all the press attention Hillary Clinton gets. ``You've
got a woman running for president and the press ignores her,'' he
complains, ``as opposed to a woman running for Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   He is still as disjointed as ever. Speaking to 15 or so people
at yet another Pizza Ranch, this one in Orange City, he poignantly
notes that he may have made a mistake voting against the
assault-weapons ban: ``'cause I'm a pretty good example of what
happens when you get hit by a gun. Of course, it's in a war, but
it's still gunshot and it takes a heavy toll.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later he echoes the NRA line: ``In that latest spree in
Atlanta, these children were killed with a hammer. People are
sometimes just sick and they do terrible things.''
</P>
<P>
   The dyspeptic Bob Dole and the bubbly George Bush had a great
political rivalry. It was colored by Dole's class resentment, his
assertion that people whose fathers wore overalls did not get the
same privileges and resumes and endorsements in life. In '88, Dole
aides muttered that George was a lap dog, while Bush aides mocked
Bob as Captain Queeg.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Dole if he was surprised at W.'s early coronation,
he conceded he was ``astonished'' at the millions W. has raised and
suggested people look into where all that money was coming from.
</P>
<P>
   But the old class rage has dissipated. Asked why Doles always
end up trailing the Bushes, he counters with good humor. ``I don't
know why we're always squaring off. In 1988, when Vice President
Bush and I were running, the exchanges got pretty heated. Then I
became the president of Iowa and he became the president of the
United States. But then we became very good friends. He was a very
good president, especially on foreign policy. I've got great
admiration for the Bushes, for the Bush family.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd better watch it. A few more enthusiastic syllables about
the Bushes and he'll be back in the doghouse. And what a waste of
Viagra that would be.

<P>
   PRIZREN, Kosovo _ As concerts go, it wasn't much of an affair _
a few hundred people gathered to hear a local band flail out some
songs on a scratchy sound system. But it was a fine night for the
``halabaket,'' gangsters visiting from Albania. Above the din of
the rock band they looted and burned four Serbian homes, hot-wired
and drove off a dozen cars, including seven belonging to those in
the crowd, and topped off the haul with a couple of armed
robberies.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after the show, which took place at the end of July,
a weary ritual was enacted. Several of the Kosovo Albanians who had
lost vehicles traveled the 30 miles over the border to Kukes,
Albania, to buy them back. Among them was Lutfi Shala, the
concert's organizer, who paid $600 to regain his car, the price
jacked up because it had already been repainted.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar Albanians, along with their ethnic kin in Albania,
Macedonia and Serbia, have long dreamed of a ``Greater Albania.''
The departure of the Yugoslav border police, opening up the
frontier, has given most a taste of what such a state might be
like. Not many seem to like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls are kidnapped, taken we expect to work as prostitutes in
Italy, cars are stolen or hijacked, houses are looted and there are
shootings at night,'' said Masar Shala, the mayor here appointed by
the Kosovo Liberation Army, known as the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refugees who are coming home, many of whom have driven
from Germany with their families, are systematically stopped just
before they enter Kosovo and robbed of all their money,'' he
continued. ``Apartments in the city have been seized by Albanian
gangs and rented out. The only thing we lack is drug dealing, but
that will probably arrive shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   Prizren is a sleepy city of 80,000 people with crumbling
mosques, domed Turkish baths, cobblestone streets, old wood-frame
shops and an imposing Serbian Orthodox monastery perched on a steep
hillside above the city. It was once, in the old Yugoslavia, a
tourist attraction, famed for its Ottoman architecture, mountain
peaks and Turkish food.
</P>
<P>
   But its proximity to Albania has made it a haunt for men wearing
sunglasses and packed into old Mercedes. Scores of the cars,
stripped of license plates, rumble into the city center each day.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian visitors have taken over the bars. The sidewalks
are lined with Albanians selling cigarettes, plastic containers
filled with gasoline, cheap clothes, cooking oil and sunglasses _
all brought in from over the border. At night, when most of the
criminal activity takes place, locals give the gangs a wide berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to work here,'' said Pajtim Syla, 20, from Kukes,
who had a collection of KLA shirts and banners spread out on a
street corner. During the day, at least, he said it was safe to
show his wares.
</P>
<P>
   The German troops, who control this sector, have reopened the
jail and imprisoned 80 suspects for murder, rape, arson and theft.
They have also imposed a midnight curfew.
</P>
<P>
   But the troops, hampered by unfamiliarity with the area and a
language barrier, acknowledge that the problem is too vast for them
to handle. On an average day they record more than 50 crimes,
including at least one murder. They blame the Albanian gangs for
much of the lawlessness, although some is clearly by carried out by
Kosovo Albanians, sometimes working with Albanians across the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who drive a car toward the border with Albania risk
their lives,'' said Lt. Ander Henrik, the liaison officer for the
German military police. ``The lucky ones are beaten and lose the
car. The unlucky ones we never hear about.''
</P>
<P>
   On one afternoon cars headed into Albania had washing machines,
chairs, stereos and televisions lashed to their roofs or crammed
into the back seats. The Albanian border guards, engaged in a game
of cards, never lifted their heads to watch the loot streaming out
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``For fifty years our two countries were blocked,'' said border
policeman Zylfi Ademi, 32, slumped in a chair next to the empty
customs post. ``Now everyone wants to visit Kosovo and have a
little fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, to stem the flow of contraband, is setting
up a customs police. But the gangs, the German officers said, use
an intricate network of back roads that are not patrolled. ``The
border is mined,'' said Henrik, ``and we do not know the area well
enough to wander around in the countryside. These back roads are
heavily traveled, especially by those carrying weapons or
kidnapping girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovars, when asked what happened to a missing item, hang their
fingers limply toward the ground and give them a half turn, as if
unscrewing a gas cap, to indicate that it was stolen. The gesture
has come to characterize life in Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they fear traveling to Kukes, where large numbers were
stranded as refugees during the war and watched helplessly as the
gangs carted away relief aid from the U.N. camps. But it is
impossible to make international phone calls from Prizren, so those
who want to communicate with family members abroad are forced to
make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I parked my car in front of the Kukes post office to make a
call and watched armed men break all the windows and take
everything inside, including my passport,'' said Perparim Elshani,
32, ``but I was lucky. The guy in line next to me had to watch them
drive his car away.''

<P>
   VRAGOLIJA, Yugoslavia _ Under a bright red Albanian flag, with
its double-headed black eagle, Ali Sllamniku, two of his brothers
and a neighbor were scrambling to put up a roof on the burned-out
shell of their two-room house.
</P>
<P>
   They were expelled by the Serbs from this little village near
Pristina on March 9, and for six weeks now the 10 members of the
Sllamniku family have been living in a tent they brought back with
them from a refugee camp in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The family's possessions are gone, stolen or burned; they have
no furniture of any kind, just a few filthy cushions and some
plastic dishes and cheap utensils.
</P>
<P>
   But with the first chills of Kosovo's long and miserable winter
just two months away, Sllamniku has given up on his expectations
for reconstruction help from the Western powers that drove the
Serbs out of Kosovo. Borrowing from friends, he has scraped
together the $2,300 he needed to buy the timber and roof tiles to
give the family a modicum of shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell the Serbs! The Albanians are building again!'' his
brother, Hashim, shouted, picking up a corner of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   But not enough of them are, and not quickly enough, because the
money and the materials and the promised aid are simply not here.
</P>
<P>
   The rough estimate now is that there are 300,000 to 400,000
people in Kosovo ``who don't have habitable homes for the winter,''
said Dennis McNamara, the regional head of the U.N. refugee agency.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unlikely that many Albanians will freeze to death,
the United Nations is unlikely to meet its goal of having at least
one warm, dry room for every Albanian family, officials now admit.
A recent internal U.N. report said, ``It is in shelter that the
humanitarian community faces its greatest challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   So aid officials are scrambling to come up with solutions, like
more winterized tents and finding host families and rehabilitating
existing buildings for collective housing, euphemistically called
transit centers, where the most vulnerable people can live until
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real race now with the winter,'' said Dan Philpott,
the field manager in Pec for Goal, an Irish aid agency working on
housing and school rehabilitation under contract for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The nations that banded together to fight this war for the
Albanians of Kosovo are entwined in all the usual and inevitable
problems of bureaucracy, rivalry, staffing, funding, logistics and
politics. Then there is the sheer August indolence of home capitals
and factories, especially in Europe, when most officials and
workers are on vacation and professional administrators and civil
servants do not take on new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency shelter kits of plastic, window frames and tools,
promised and designed early on, are now not only thought to be
inadequate but are also very slow to arrive. Orders for timber are
going through tenders, even before contracts are signed and orders
compiled or delivered through the logistical nightmare of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Pec, the city with the most damaged or destroyed housing in
Kosovo, and the surrounding towns of Istok and Klina, only the U.N.
refugee agency has begun any emergency housing rehabilitation. The
Americans are still signing letters of intent with their aid agency
and the Europeans, one local official said, ``haven't done anything
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Philpott, of Goal, said: ``The Albanians are adaptable and have
a marvelous spirit. But I don't think the penny has dropped with
the international decision-makers about what we will face in the
winter.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And reality, as usual, has altered the best-intentioned plans.
</P>
<P>
   The quick end to the war surprised many officials and aid
workers, who were thinking about how to get the refugees through
the winter in the camps across the border. The fervent desire of
the Albanians to return to Kosovo as fast as possible also seemed
to surprise the Westerners, whose admonitions to remain in the
camps were completely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   More than 740,000 Albanians poured back by the end of July,
straining every unvandalized or unbombed resource, from water to
electricity to telephones.
</P>
<P>
   And extensive surveys of buildings and housing in Kosovo,
completed only at the end of July, showed considerably more damage
than had been estimated.
</P>
<P>
   There was less damage than expected to bridges and roads, but
more to houses and other shelter, said McNamara, who is also in
charge of humanitarian assistance for the United Nations here under
the chief administrator for Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a massive movement of population,'' he said. ``We
have a massive challenge ahead of us, and we're talking about two
months, just 60 days.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed severe damage to 67,326 buildings, most of
them houses, compared to an estimate of 28,346 made in December
1998, after a harsh summer offensive by the Serbs but before the
three-month bombing war that began in March. A European Union
survey of 1,383 villages found damage to 120,000 homes, with 78,000
severely damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In the villages, some of them 3,000 feet above sea level and
very cold, fewer than 25 percent of houses are not damaged, while
nearly 40 percent are considered destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the U.N. refugee agency, through its aid contractors,
has distributed partial shelter kits, largely consisting of thick
roofing plastic, to only 3,600 families. James Kovar, head of the
agency's field office in Pec, says that deliveries from the
contractors have been ``very slow.'' At least 40,000 more such kits
are expected from the United States and the European Union, but no
one knows when.
</P>
<P>
   Given the amounts of money involved, Kovar said, Washington and
Brussels insisted on designing and controlling their own housing
rehabilitation projects, separate from the U.N. refugee agency,
though supposedly coordinated through it.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has ordered at least 15,000 winterized tents with an
adapted stove inside, and 30,000 wood-burning stoves to deliver to
villages. But given the paucity of good roads and available trucks,
the likely time span between orders and delivery is worrying
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Matters were made worse by problems with customs and duties at
the Macedonian border, just resolved Friday, after the Macedonians
gave up their demand for a $350 ``inspection fee'' for all trucks
and rail cars carrying assistance.
</P>
<P>
   So in the Pec area, where between 200,000 and 250,000 people are
now living, Kovar said, ``there is bound to be a gap.'' He is
planning, he says, to secure emergency collective housing for
between 1,000 and 2,000 people. But Philpott of Goal thinks at
least 5,000 people in the Pec area will need such shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Kovar, who arrived in Pec in late June, is pushing hard. He is
working to get more and better shelter kits; to find some timber
and roof tiles; to identify buildings that could be used for
collective housing, and to persuade the commanders of the
peacekeeping troops here to use some of their abundant transport
equipment to deliver relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
   One idea being discussed is for the peacekeepers to set up
guarded municipal or regional distribution centers for building
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO-led peacekeeping force here is largely willing to help,
even with some emergency rehabilitation, say McNamara and Kovar,
although the military also has its own logistical and security
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Albanians, there is disappointment. They had expected
the West to provide timber and the region's ubiquitous red clay
roof tiles so they could do the work themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But these are not in the plans for Kosovo's emergency
rehabilitation. Distribution of such supplies will apparently wait
for a larger reconstruction project that will be handled by the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruins of downtown Pec, Hajri Gjota, 71, watched some
workers as they put something like a roof over the first floor of
what had been his relatively lavish two-story house.
</P>
<P>
   On March 28, four days after NATO's bombing began, masked Serb
irregulars put a gun in his mouth and gave him five minutes to
leave the house, refusing to allow him to get shoes or a jacket.
``I was that evening in the mountains with nothing,'' he said
simply. ``I worked 50 years for this house.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned here only three weeks ago to find this ruin, and
Albanians in similar circumstances have moved into any available
and now vacant Serb apartment. ``Morally, I couldn't do that
anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of all this, I want at least one room,'' he said. He is
spending about $8,800, most of which comes from relatives abroad,
to repair walls, put up a roof, install windows, and buy a stove
and some furniture.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts to find some aid have been fruitless, he said
bitterly. ``These foreign workers sit in cafes and people line up
to see them, to try to get their names on a list,'' he said, but
could not identify their agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Gjota knows he is lucky _ lucky to be alive, to have help from
relatives, to be able to pay others to put up a roof. But other
Albanians are not so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their houses are burned, too,'' he said, gesturing to the
workers slick with sweat in the unforgiving sun. ``Who will help
them? They're earning money to get bread and shelter.''

HOLLYWOOD LOVES SEQUELS, BUT RISING PRODUCTION COSTS CLOUD PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Coming soon -- ``Men In Black 2,'' ``Jurassic
Park 3,'' ``Indiana Jones 4,'' ``Godfather 4,'' ``Superman 5'' and
``Rocky 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Don't hold your breath. The climate for sequels has become
chilly even though this summer's versions of ``Star Wars'' and
``Austin Powers'' have proven beyond a doubt that sequels and
prequels work just fine. Collectively, ``Star Wars: Episode 1 --
The Phantom Menace'' and ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' have generated
$600 million in box office revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those successes, Hollywood's appetite for sequels has
diminished considerably. The high-water mark came in 1990, when 27
were released; this year, the number will be nine if ``Phantom
Menace'' is counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the studios have run through most of the properties
that they can do,'' said Dan Marks, a movie industry analyst with
box office tracker ACNielsen EDI. ``That's a pretty dramatic drop
in nine years.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend will continue next year with only six sequels
expected, all of the second-time-around genre: ``Jumanji 2,''
``Rugrats 2,'' ``Blair Witch 2,'' ``Mission: Impossible 2'' ``Viva
Rock Vegas: Flintstones 2'' ``The Klumps: The Nutty Professor 2.''
</P>
<P>
   A few more are in the pipeline in the years to follow, including
``The Mummy 2,'' ``The Matrix 2 and 3,'' ``Blade 2'' and ``Rush
Hour 2,'' along with ``Star Wars Episode 2: Rise of the Empire.''
``Jurassic Park 3'' may have gotten a jump-start for 2001 with last
week's announcement that Universal and Steven Spielberg had agreed
to hire a director and writer.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Hollywood doesn't want sequels. Any successful new
movie carries with it the hope it can be turned into a franchise,
perhaps even like ``Star Wars'' or the James Bond series, which
will see its 19th version in November with ``The World Is Not
Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But the increased pressure from studio parents to ensure
profitability may be taking its toll, first and foremost, because
sequels cost more -- sometimes a lot more -- than the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, the success of the sequel depends on getting the
original talent, so those costs may be significantly higher,'' said
Richard Ingrassia, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates. ``The
costs of your special effects also go up because everyone expects
them to be next generation, so those are big considerations. That's
why something like `Superman 5' may not ever get off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend away from sequels has seen Disney take two of its most
valuable franchises -- ``The Lion King'' and ``Aladdin'' -- out of
the future movie pipeline and hedge its bets instead with
direct-to-video follow-ups.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not that moviegoers are necessarily tired of sequels,
Marks noted. ``I don't think the audience is more demanding,'' he
said. ``It's just that with a sequel, there's a more direct
comparison than with other movies. It's really a double-edged sword
-- you can get them into the auditoriums on the opening weekend but
you have to live up to the promise.''
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing popularity of James Bond and ``Star Wars'' shows
that cultural icons can exist almost indefinitely. Making the
stakes even more lucrative is a growing foreign audience that has a
hunger for recognizable Hollywood properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the global audience for movies, it's mind-boggling how
much potential there is for a movie to gross over $1 billion if
it's a truly familiar property,'' said Steve Cesinger, managing
director at Greif &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that lure, landmark properties have become exceedingly
difficult to sequelize in the current climate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the prospect of another ``Indiana Jones'' movie has
been the source of speculation over the last decade, which heated
up last year when Steven Spielberg told reporters, ``The `Indiana
Jones 4' hat is halfway on my head. I have the plot worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. Salaries for
the top stars have moved into the $20 million to $25 million per
movie range and ``Indiana Jones' '' Harrison Ford would no doubt
command a top-end salary. In addition, the many recent high-priced
sequels -- including ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' ``Blues Brothers
2000,'' ``Species 2,'' ``Speed 2,'' ``Alien Resurrection'' and
``Mortal Kombat Annihilation'' -- have performed badly, despite
major stars attached to almost each project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that bringing back `Indiana Jones' would take a
lot of creative financing by Harrison Ford, Steven Spielberg and
Paramount,'' Cesinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Sequels aren't going away, however, and it appears that the ones
that are fast-tracked are properties that were low cost to begin
with such as Miramax's ``Scream'' franchise, which will see its
third version open in December, a mere two years after the
original.
</P>
<P>
   Even more telling is Artisan Entertainment's decision to commit
to making a follow-up to ``The Blair Witch Project'' even though it
will obviously have to spend more than the $35,000 it took to film
the first movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be starting discussions about doing `The Blair
Witch Project 2,' '' declared Amir Malin, president of Artisan
Entertainment. ``The movie has turned into a cultural phenomenon
and it sets up not only the things like the comic book and
merchandising but also a future franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors emerged last week that writer-directors Daniel Myrick and
Eduardo Sanchez have outlined at least four potential story lines,
including one that would explore the 200-year-old legend and
another that would search for the characters from the original.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY CONTINUES ON 2ND TAKE.) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Hecht admits that multiple ``Rugrats'' sequels are a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought of the characters in terms of sequels but
more as new adventures, just like the TV series,'' he said. ``We
all had confidence that the `Rugrats' would be the animated icons
of the 21st century with plenty more stories to tell. People love
these characters, so when you can put them in different stories,
they become fresh again.''
</P>
<P>
   And this spring's surprise success, ``The Mummy,'' looks to be
on a fast track for a follow-up with the same cast. Writer-director
Stephen Sommers said he plans to return to Morocco next summer for
filming, adding, ``I've given everyone on the cast a heads-up about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The story will again be set in the 1920s in Egypt with even more
impressive special effects, Sommers promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the new story came together while we were sitting
around the campfire during production telling ghost stories,'' he
said. ``I've watched loads of sequels and tried to learn from the
ones that worked, from `Godfather 2' to `Home Alone 2.' It's not a
strict science but some of the bad ones were hurt by changing the
feel of the movie too radically.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingrassia agreed that sequels won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sequels are a way for studios with big libraries to leverage
their assets fully because they can put out movies that are known
quantities to the public,'' he said. ``That's important because
it's almost impossible to fully predict the public's taste at a
particular time. So if you can keep the budget down, sequels are
lower risk than unknown properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingrassia noted sequels will also continue to be attractive
because of the growing importance of foreign markets, which now
generate over 60 percent of the worldwide box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an uncertain economic climate overseas, the only films that
can be pre-sold to foreign territories are your most recognizable
properties,'' he added.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Have we _ that is, Americans _ got a really
serious problem with the rest of the world?
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade or so, significant numbers of countries
have been signing on to one treaty or convention after another
aimed at reining in abusive regimes, ending the mistreatment of the
weak and cutting back on the proliferation of all kinds of weapons
from nuclear bombs to land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, even while participating in the writing of another
pact, has reacted with diminishing enthusiasm in the White House,
unease in the Pentagon and mounting outrage in Congress, always on
the lookout for invasions of U.S. sovereignty to beat back.
</P>
<P>
   Withholding U.S. backing for international pacts sometimes puts
the United States in decidedly mixed company. Only two nations are
holding out against the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the
United States and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   When 120 nations agreed last year to set up a permanent
International Criminal Court for the future Hitlers, Pol Pots and
Saddam Husseins of the world, Washington was one of seven
dissenters. The others were China, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Qatar and
Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cold War reduced to history and only one superpower
left, it seems to some politicians that foreigners, most of them
not reliable friends, want to tie this Gulliver down with
Lilliputian ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a healthy skepticism across the political spectrum
about what direction these treaties can take,'' said Ian Vasquez of
the Cato Institute in Washington. ``Another healthy attitude is
that the United States does not sign on to multilateral treaties in
a casual way, which I do think occurs in other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans reckon that many nations ratify agreements they have
no intention of abiding by, although this does not stop their
leaders from trying to use them against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   However, beyond U.S. borders the view is different. Canadian
officials, for example, lose no opportunity to chide Washington for
its failure to pay American assessments to the United Nations, a
situation that rankles worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the United States committed to multilateralism or not?'' a
Middle Eastern envoy asked last week. ``We need American
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Now two unresolved issues are prompting new looks at U.S.
attitudes toward international covenants. One is arms control. Last
week, a commission of disarmament experts from around the world
warned that American reluctance to ratify a pact against nuclear
testing, or to press Moscow for further mutual reductions in
strategic weapons, or to give full attention to deteriorating
relations with Russia and China, was creating an atmosphere of
insecurity worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Japanese-backed commission found,
Washington was whittling away inspection safeguards in the Chemical
Weapons Convention and lagging in commitments to tighten
international rules against biological weapons. The United States
has also opted out of an international convention banning the
production or use of land mines, killers of millions of the world's
poorest people caught in the most brutal of civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   The second battleground is the International Criminal Court.
Three weeks of talks are going on now at the United Nations to
clarify details about the court's operations. Most diplomats,
including Americans, are convinced that the court is likely to be
up and running in a matter of a few years, replacing the ad hoc
tribunals for the Balkans and Rwanda. The question is, where will
the United States be then?
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing now is a trend that was exemplified by the
U.S. opposition to and isolation on the convention to ban
antipersonnel mines,'' said Richard Dicker, associate counsel of
Human Rights Watch. ``On the Convention on the Rights of the Child,
it has to do with the military recruitment of individuals less than
18 years of age, and the U.S. Department of Defense does recruit
some 17 year olds. It's for that military, Pentagon-driven reason
that the United States has put itself in opposition to everyone in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   This predicament is not entirely without precedent. ``It took 40
years for the U.S. to ratify the Genocide Convention,'' Dicker
said. ``It took 25 years for the U.S. to ratify the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This is part of a broader
issue, and it's particularly concentrated or crystallized in the
case of the International Criminal Court, because here what you
have is the creation of a new judicial body that would extend the
rule of law in its broadest conception.''
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. officials, that is exactly the problem: the specter of
a sweeping judicial process outside U.S. control with the potential
to interfere with U.S. policy decisions, especially when waging war
or sending troops abroad on international missions short of combat.
This is the treaty that Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has preemptively declared
``dead on arrival'' in Congress, if and when it shows up for
ratification.
</P>
<P>
   David Scheffer, the Clinton administration's ambassador at large
for war crimes, has met dozens of government delegations at the
United Nations over the last two weeks in his effort to persuade
foreign capitals that Washington is not uniformly opposed to an
International Criminal Court, but that U.S. concerns about its
reach and the risk it could pose if used politically against the
United States and, more particularly, American soldiers will have
to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   His arguments represent a classic American caution about
entangling foreign alliances _ in this case a treaty that will
change the face of international criminal law, and could involve
Americans whether or not they are party to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot sign the present text of the treaty,'' Scheffer
said. ``We've made that very clear. But we also want to engage very
constructively with other governments to see if there is a pathway
for our support.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of governments recognize that if the United States can
be brought on board, the treaty, in a pragmatic sense, can be
greatly strengthened, he said, ``because we can bring our
resources, our enforcement capabilities, our diplomatic skills, and
so much of what we provide to the ad hoc tribunals.''
</P>
<P>
   If this campaign doesn't work, the isolation of the United
States, for all its power, can only grow, and with it a distrust of
U.S. motives now that Washington stands above the world.
</P>
<P>
   Anne-Marie Slaughter, director of graduate and international
legal studies at the Harvard Law School, prepared a hypothetical
memo to the president on the options, pro and con, open to the
United States in a recent study for the Council on Foreign
Relations. She noted that in the wake of the bombing of Serb
targets and the occupation of Kosovo, ``the apparent conflict
between our humanitarian justification for NATO action and our vote
against the ICC in July 1998 feeds suspicion and confusion about
our foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, she added: ``Beyond Kosovo, our position on
the court will affect our ability to exercise leadership in shaping
the international order for the next century.''

COMMENTARY: WHEN SUMMER TURNS DEADLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The death toll from the heat that scorched much of the country
from mid-July to the early days of August has reached 271. The
states that fared wort were Illinois, with 120 fatalities, and
Missouri, with 61.
</P>
<P>
   Get used to it. This summer's intense heat is not, by itself,
evidence that global warming is upon us. But it is part of an
increasingly convincing trend, and it's a good example of the
hazards we'll face if, as expected, that trend continues.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, chief
scientist of the Environmental Defense Fund, said the average
person in a place like the New York metropolitan area would
probably experience the change over the coming decades in the
following fashion: ``It's getting hot, it's getting humid, it's
getting horrible, and it's happening more and more often.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This is very important because there are direct
public health impacts from too much heat. Heat kills. It's that
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laurence Kalkstein of the Center for Climatic Research at
the University of Delaware is an expert on the relationship between
extreme temperatures and mortality. In a paper he co-authored with
J. Scott Greene of the University of Oklahoma, he wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Using models that estimate climate change for the years 2020
and 2050, it is estimated that summer mortality will increase
dramatically and winter mortality will decrease slightly, even if
people acclimatize to the increased warmth. Thus, a sizable net
increase in weather-related mortality is estimated if the climate
warms as the models predict.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalkstein noted in an interview that it is not just high
temperatures but heat associated with particular types of
oppressive air masses that is most dangerous to humans. And the
occurrences of those high-risk air masses are expected to increase
substantially over the next several decades.
</P>
<P>
   For New Yorkers it will ultimately seem as if the city,
weather-wise, had slipped far below the Mason-Dixon line. A report
in June from the Environmental Defense Fund (prepared in
collaboration with researchers from Columbia University) said that
in the best-case scenario New York City in the year 2100 would have
as many 90-degree-plus days as Miami has now.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst case, New York would have as many 90-plus days as
Houston, which is about six times as many as New York has now.
</P>
<P>
   The health consequences of extreme heat vary from one population
to another. New Yorkers and Bostonians and Chicagoans will not soon
be ready for the kinds of intense summers that are beckoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respond in relative fashion to the weather,'' said
Kalkstein. ``What is hot to someone in Duluth is very different
from what's hot to someone in Atlanta. In Boston people start dying
in the low 90s. In New York it's a little higher. In Washington
it's a little higher yet.''
</P>
<P>
   We are speeding toward increasingly tragic long-term
consequences. The smart thing to do would be to view the toll from
this summer's heat wave as a warning, a sign that closer attention
must be paid and strategies and solutions developed.
</P>
<P>
   As bad as the official death toll was, Kalkstein believes the
real toll this summer was probably much higher. ``The death rates
could be 50 to 60 percent higher from all heat-related causes,'' he
said. ``Not just heat stroke and heat exhaustion, but from heart
attacks and respiratory distress and so on. What we do to measure
heat-related death is look at the long-term baseline, the average.
And during these heat waves, when there are bad air masses in, we
look at the number of deaths above that particular baseline. And we
attribute all of those deaths to the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, Kalkstein mentioned that while studying
heat-related deaths in Rome he came upon the surprising finding
that in severe heat waves women apparently were dying at
significantly higher rates than men.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``On the worst 1 percent of days, women in Rome die at
a rate that is 50 percent higher in some cases than men do. We've
never seen this result before.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his colleagues plan to recheck their data, which
have not yet been published, and also will try to determine if
similar patterns exist in the United States.

HOLLYWOOD LOVES SEQUELS, BUT RISING PRODUCTION COSTS CLOUD PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Coming soon -- ``Men In Black 2,'' ``Jurassic
Park 3,'' ``Indiana Jones 4,'' ``Godfather 4,'' ``Superman 5'' and
``Rocky 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Don't hold your breath. The climate for sequels has become
chilly even though this summer's versions of ``Star Wars'' and
``Austin Powers'' have proven beyond a doubt that sequels and
prequels work just fine. Collectively, ``Star Wars: Episode 1 --
The Phantom Menace'' and ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' have generated
$600 million in box office revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those successes, Hollywood's appetite for sequels has
diminished considerably. The high-water mark came in 1990, when 27
were released; this year, the number will be nine if ``Phantom
Menace'' is counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the studios have run through most of the properties
that they can do,'' said Dan Marks, a movie industry analyst with
box office tracker ACNielsen EDI. ``That's a pretty dramatic drop
in nine years.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend will continue next year with only six sequels
expected, all of the second-time-around genre: ``Jumanji 2,''
``Rugrats 2,'' ``Blair Witch 2,'' ``Mission: Impossible 2'' ``Viva
Rock Vegas: Flintstones 2'' ``The Klumps: The Nutty Professor 2.''
</P>
<P>
   A few more are in the pipeline in the years to follow, including
``The Mummy 2,'' ``The Matrix 2 and 3,'' ``Blade 2'' and ``Rush
Hour 2,'' along with ``Star Wars Episode 2: Rise of the Empire.''
``Jurassic Park 3'' may have gotten a jump-start for 2001 with last
week's announcement that Universal and Steven Spielberg had agreed
to hire a director and writer.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Hollywood doesn't want sequels. Any successful new
movie carries with it the hope it can be turned into a franchise,
perhaps even like ``Star Wars'' or the James Bond series, which
will see its 19th version in November with ``The World Is Not
Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But the increased pressure from studio parents to ensure
profitability may be taking its toll, first and foremost, because
sequels cost more -- sometimes a lot more -- than the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, the success of the sequel depends on getting the
original talent, so those costs may be significantly higher,'' said
Richard Ingrassia, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates. ``The
costs of your special effects also go up because everyone expects
them to be next generation, so those are big considerations. That's
why something like `Superman 5' may not ever get off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend away from sequels has seen Disney take two of its most
valuable franchises -- ``The Lion King'' and ``Aladdin'' -- out of
the future movie pipeline and hedge its bets instead with
direct-to-video follow-ups.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not that moviegoers are necessarily tired of sequels,
Marks noted. ``I don't think the audience is more demanding,'' he
said. ``It's just that with a sequel, there's a more direct
comparison than with other movies. It's really a double-edged sword
-- you can get them into the auditoriums on the opening weekend but
you have to live up to the promise.''
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing popularity of James Bond and ``Star Wars'' shows
that cultural icons can exist almost indefinitely. Making the
stakes even more lucrative is a growing foreign audience that has a
hunger for recognizable Hollywood properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the global audience for movies, it's mind-boggling how
much potential there is for a movie to gross over $1 billion if
it's a truly familiar property,'' said Steve Cesinger, managing
director at Greif &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that lure, landmark properties have become exceedingly
difficult to sequelize in the current climate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the prospect of another ``Indiana Jones'' movie has
been the source of speculation over the last decade, which heated
up last year when Steven Spielberg told reporters, ``The `Indiana
Jones 4' hat is halfway on my head. I have the plot worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. Salaries for
the top stars have moved into the $20 million to $25 million per
movie range and ``Indiana Jones' '' Harrison Ford would no doubt
command a top-end salary. In addition, the many recent high-priced
sequels -- including ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' ``Blues Brothers
2000,'' ``Species 2,'' ``Speed 2,'' ``Alien Resurrection'' and
``Mortal Kombat Annihilation'' -- have performed badly, despite
major stars attached to almost each project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that bringing back `Indiana Jones' would take a
lot of creative financing by Harrison Ford, Steven Spielberg and
Paramount,'' Cesinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Sequels aren't going away, however, and it appears that the ones
that are fast-tracked are properties that were low cost to begin
with such as Miramax's ``Scream'' franchise, which will see its
third version open in December, a mere two years after the
original.
</P>
<P>
   Even more telling is Artisan Entertainment's decision to commit
to making a follow-up to ``The Blair Witch Project'' even though it
will obviously have to spend more than the $35,000 it took to film
the first movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be starting discussions about doing `The Blair
Witch Project 2,' '' declared Amir Malin, president of Artisan
Entertainment. ``The movie has turned into a cultural phenomenon
and it sets up not only the things like the comic book and
merchandising but also a future franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors emerged last week that writer-directors Daniel Myrick and
Eduardo Sanchez have outlined at least four potential story lines,
including one that would explore the 200-year-old legend and
another that would search for the characters from the original.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY CONTINUES ON 2ND TAKE.) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Hecht admits that multiple ``Rugrats'' sequels are a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought of the characters in terms of sequels but
more as new adventures, just like the TV series,'' he said. ``We
all had confidence that the `Rugrats' would be the animated icons
of the 21st century with plenty more stories to tell. People love
these characters, so when you can put them in different stories,
they become fresh again.''
</P>
<P>
   And this spring's surprise success, ``The Mummy,'' looks to be
on a fast track for a follow-up with the same cast. Writer-director
Stephen Sommers said he plans to return to Morocco next summer for
filming, adding, ``I've given everyone on the cast a heads-up about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The story will again be set in the 1920s in Egypt with even more
impressive special effects, Sommers promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the new story came together while we were sitting
around the campfire during production telling ghost stories,'' he
said. ``I've watched loads of sequels and tried to learn from the
ones that worked, from `Godfather 2' to `Home Alone 2.' It's not a
strict science but some of the bad ones were hurt by changing the
feel of the movie too radically.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingrassia agreed that sequels won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sequels are a way for studios with big libraries to leverage
their assets fully because they can put out movies that are known
quantities to the public,'' he said. ``That's important because
it's almost impossible to fully predict the public's taste at a
particular time. So if you can keep the budget down, sequels are
lower risk than unknown properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingrassia noted sequels will also continue to be attractive
because of the growing importance of foreign markets, which now
generate over 60 percent of the worldwide box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an uncertain economic climate overseas, the only films that
can be pre-sold to foreign territories are your most recognizable
properties,'' he added.

<P>
   The news that two-thirds of New York City's fourth-graders
failed a state reading test was embarrassing. The results,
announced in May, followed too many other tests with unhappy
results, including one in which American eighth-graders ranked
below South Korea, the Czech Republic and two dozen other countries
in math and science performance.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a teacher what needs to be done to improve such dismal
performance, and it's a good bet the first answer will be to raise
teachers' salaries, thereby attracting and keeping better teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But there is scant evidence that higher salaries alone make a
difference in student performance. In fact, there is little
evidence that tinkering with any single element of the education
system does any good at all, when so many variables come into play,
like class size, curriculum, early childhood education, discipline,
homework and parental involvement, just to mention a few.
</P>
<P>
   But teachers' salaries seems always to top the list of problems,
perhaps because teachers' organizations make forceful arguments on
the issue. They say, for instance, that one thing is clear:
Beginning teachers usually earn less than other college graduates,
and that discourages many top-notch people from going into
teaching. Average starting pay for public school teachers
nationwide is $25,735, ranging from $19,146 in North Dakota to
$33,162 in Alaska. While the most experienced teachers in some
affluent suburbs earn more than $90,000 a year, the average salary
for teachers nationwide is $39,347 _ just a fraction of the annual
bonus received by many thirty-somethings on Wall Street. Just try
to raise a family or send a child through college on that amount,
many teachers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to improve the quality of our public schools,''
said Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, ``a major part of that is to make sure we can, to be
cliched, attract the best and the brightest, and you're not going
to do that without increasing salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the higher status of teachers in Japan, advocates
say raising pay is a sine qua non to upgrade the status of American
teachers and to show that the nation is paying more than lip
service to improving education. What signal does it send about
teaching, many educators ask, when a 45-year-old teacher with a
masters degree earns $45,000 a year and a 25-year-old out of law
school often starts at $90,000?
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching should be a profession, not a philanthropic act,''
said David Haselkorn, president of Recruiting New Teachers, a
nonprofit group that encourages college graduates to become
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts question whether raising teacher salaries, by
itself, will translate into better educational performance. And
some conservatives maintain that this push for higher pay is an
attempt by powerful teachers unions to line their members' pockets
at taxpayer expense.
</P>
<P>
   If you just increase salaries, it's going to buy you very
little,'' said Richard Murnane, a professor at Harvard's School of
Education. ``Right now, schools are not places where well-educated
college graduates want to work for very long. There is very little
collegiality, very little opportunity to work on projects with
other adults. It's a lonely job, and in many communities, it's seen
as very low status.''
</P>
<P>
   One argument that undermines the push for higher pay is the
experience of private and parochial schools, whose teachers are
generally paid less than public school teachers, but whose students
often out-perform public school students. At the nation's Catholic
schools, pay averaged $22,000 last year, 45 percent below the
public school average. At other private schools, teachers averaged
about $35,000, 11 percent below public school levels.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic school administrators say their schools perform well
notwithstanding their low salaries because their teachers are
dedicated, their curriculum is highly structured and discipline is
maintained. But many educators say Catholic schools often
outperform public schools largely because they are free to kick out
students who misbehave. Private schools often outdo public schools,
educators say, because they have smaller class sizes and student
bodies often culled from the nation's elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly our salaries are a lot lower, but the general
question is, will paying higher salaries produce better learning?''
said Leonard DeFiore, president of the National Catholic Education
Association. ``Everyone in the teaching profession hopes teachers
will get paid more, but whether that is correlated with more
learning is an open question. For most people who go into teaching,
money is not an issue. It's like in other helping professions _
it's what you want to do and you know you're not going to make a
lot of money doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many teachers, money is definitely an issue. Take Daniel
Perez, a 27-year-old graduate of New York University with a
master's from Hunter College. After five years of teaching math at
a Queens intermediate school, he earns $38,600, but this fall he is
jumping to a Suffolk County high school where he will earn $47,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was OK to start at $28,000 when I was still living with my
parents, but it doesn't cut the mustard when you have a family or
want to own a home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City teachers often seize on Scarsdale's pay scale _ a
teacher with five years' experience and a master's degree earns
$60,000 versus $38,600 for a city teacher _ to argue that they
should earn far more because their jobs are harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the high-wealth suburbs, salaries are higher, working
conditions are better, facilities are newer, social conditions are
less impacted and class sizes tend to be lower,'' said Haselkorn of
Recruiting New Teachers. ``So urban districts tend to lose out all
the time in the bidding war for qualified teachers. That's a
scandal. You can't say that we're providing equal education
opportunities in this country when there are such imbalances
between low-wealth and high-wealth districts.''
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for higher pay, many education experts cite studies
showing that the nation, which has 2.7 million public school
teachers, will need to hire 2 million new teachers over the next
decade because of increased enrollment and a wave of retirements.
Another factor experts point to is that a generation or two ago,
many talented women and blacks entered teaching, despite the low
pay, because many other careers were closed off to them, but that
is no longer the case. Now they can go into engineering,
accounting, medicine or law, all of which pay considerably more
than teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Many educators say that if school districts raise teacher pay
while taking other steps like increasing expectations, cutting
class sizes and demanding more teacher training, then those steps,
taken together, will improve student performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think salaries in and of themselves are a magic
bullet, but they're an important piece in a larger puzzle,'' said
Haselkorn.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend recently noticed that I take one route going to the gym
and another coming home. That's good, she told me. It will make you
smarter. When I asked her why, she said scientists say that varying
the routine helps the brain sprout new nerve connections and that,
in turn, makes people more intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner party last week, some of my friends were on a diet
that excluded potatoes, rice, bread and pastas. Those tasty foods,
they said, make people fat. Scientists say so.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so my friends may be a bit misinformed. These days it seems
that almost any scientific-sounding extrapolation for taking off
pounds or putting on IQ points can quickly gain a seal of approval
from public health groups or educators and help set policy for
untold years to come. Problems arise, though, when such
recommendations are launched without any scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Tuesday, 39 health organizations, including the
American Public Health Organization, signed a petition to the Food
and Drug Administration asking that food labels tell whether the
sugar content occurs naturally or is added; that the agency
recommend that Americans consume no more than 10 teaspoons of added
sugar a day, or half of what they now consume. ``Heavy consumption
of added sugar is contributing to soaring obesity rates,'' said Dr.
Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in
the Public Interest, a consumer health advocacy group in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, the American Academy of Pediatrics, citing
brain research, stated that children under 2 years old should not
watch television. Period.
</P>
<P>
   These events surprised both scientists who study obesity and
those who study brain development. Where, they demanded, are the
supporting data?
</P>
<P>
   There are no data establishing that Americans are getting fatter
because they are eating sugar, the researchers said. ``I don't
think there's any sound scientific basis to it at all,'' said Dr.
Jules Hirsch, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University.
</P>
<P>
   Neuroscientists dismissed the American Academy of Pediatrics'
statement that television should be discouraged because ``research
on early brain development shows that babies and toddlers have a
critical need for direct interactions with parents and other
significant caregivers (e.g., child care providers) for health
brain growth and the development of appropriate social, emotional,
and cognitive skills.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no data like that at all,'' said Dr. Charles Nelson,
a professor of child psychology, neuroscience and pediatrics at the
University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Petersen, a neurology professor at Washington
University Medical School in St. Louis, noted that not only was
there no brain research to back up the statement, but there was
also no logical reason to ban television for the very young. Why no
television as compared with one or two hours of it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Couldn't your child watch a little bit of TV and also get lots
of interactions with caregivers?'' Petersen asked. The academy's
stance, ``is like saying that tons and tons of junk food is bad and
so therefore kids should never have a hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marjorie Hogan, the lead author of the pediatric academy's
report, agreed that there are no studies with young children
showing actual brain changes occurring with television viewing.
``We extrapolated,'' Dr. Hogan said; the pediatricians used other
research to infer that children's brains are harmed when they spend
their time gazing at television screens instead of interacting with
humans.
</P>
<P>
   Those who extrapolate and make public health recommendations say
that they have to make a judgment call in deciding when there are
enough presumptive data to act. ``If we wait, we lose another
cohort of kids,'' Dr. Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes well-intentioned advice is later revealed to be
based on hopes rather than facts. Those hopes can turn out to be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Take the so-called Mozart effect, that well-varnished notion
that children who grow up listening to Mozart turn out smarter. The
idea was so entrenched that former Georgia Gov. Zell Miller
provided Mozart CDs to new mothers. Florida's public schools are
currently required to play classical music to toddlers daily.
</P>
<P>
   The science behind these two government practices was a study
involving college students _ not babies or toddlers. On tests of
special abilities the students did slightly better for 10 minutes
after listening to music by Mozart as compared to their performance
after listening to a relaxation tape or sitting silently for 10
minutes. No one tried to find out whether their brains were changed
or even whether Mozart's music in particular made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart, in fact, had little to do with it, according to a new

<P>
   A friend recently noticed that I take one route going to the gym
and another coming home. That's good, she told me. It will make you
smarter. When I asked her why, she said scientists say that varying
the routine helps the brain sprout new nerve connections and that,
in turn, makes people more intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner party last week, some of my friends were on a diet
that excluded potatoes, rice, bread and pastas. Those tasty foods,
they said, make people fat. Scientists say so.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so my friends may be a bit misinformed. These days it seems
that almost any scientific-sounding extrapolation for taking off
pounds or putting on IQ points can quickly gain a seal of approval
from public health groups or educators and help set policy for
untold years to come. Problems arise, though, when such
recommendations are launched without any scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Tuesday, 39 health organizations, including the
American Public Health Organization, signed a petition to the Food
and Drug Administration asking that food labels tell whether the
sugar content occurs naturally or is added; that the agency
recommend that Americans consume no more than 10 teaspoons of added
sugar a day, or half of what they now consume. ``Heavy consumption
of added sugar is contributing to soaring obesity rates,'' said Dr.
Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in
the Public Interest, a consumer health advocacy group in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, the American Academy of Pediatrics, citing
brain research, stated that children under 2 years old should not
watch television. Period.
</P>
<P>
   These events surprised both scientists who study obesity and
those who study brain development. Where, they demanded, are the
supporting data?
</P>
<P>
   There are no data establishing that Americans are getting fatter
because they are eating sugar, the researchers said. ``I don't
think there's any sound scientific basis to it at all,'' said Dr.
Jules Hirsch, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University.
</P>
<P>
   Neuroscientists dismissed the American Academy of Pediatrics'
statement that television should be discouraged because ``research
on early brain development shows that babies and toddlers have a
critical need for direct interactions with parents and other
significant caregivers (e.g., child care providers) for health
brain growth and the development of appropriate social, emotional,
and cognitive skills.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no data like that at all,'' said Dr. Charles Nelson,
a professor of child psychology, neuroscience and pediatrics at the
University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Petersen, a neurology professor at Washington
University Medical School in St. Louis, noted that not only was
there no brain research to back up the statement, but there was
also no logical reason to ban television for the very young. Why no
television as compared with one or two hours of it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Couldn't your child watch a little bit of TV and also get lots
of interactions with caregivers?'' Petersen asked. The academy's
stance, ``is like saying that tons and tons of junk food is bad and
so therefore kids should never have a hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marjorie Hogan, the lead author of the pediatric academy's
report, agreed that there are no studies with young children
showing actual brain changes occurring with television viewing.
``We extrapolated,'' Dr. Hogan said; the pediatricians used other
research to infer that children's brains are harmed when they spend
their time gazing at television screens instead of interacting with
humans.
</P>
<P>
   Those who extrapolate and make public health recommendations say
that they have to make a judgment call in deciding when there are
enough presumptive data to act. ``If we wait, we lose another
cohort of kids,'' Dr. Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes well-intentioned advice is later revealed to be
based on hopes rather than facts. Those hopes can turn out to be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Take the so-called Mozart effect, that well-varnished notion
that children who grow up listening to Mozart turn out smarter. The
idea was so entrenched that former Georgia Gov. Zell Miller
provided Mozart CDs to new mothers. Florida's public schools are
currently required to play classical music to toddlers daily.
</P>
<P>
   The science behind these two government practices was a study
involving college students _ not babies or toddlers. On tests of
special abilities the students did slightly better for 10 minutes
after listening to music by Mozart as compared to their performance
after listening to a relaxation tape or sitting silently for 10
minutes. No one tried to find out whether their brains were changed
or even whether Mozart's music in particular made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart, in fact, had little to do with it, according to a new
study by Kristin Nantais of the University of Windsor in Canada and
E. Glenn Schellenberg of the University of Toronto at Mississauga.
Students did comparatively better on the test after listening to
Mozart's music, but they did just as well after listening to
Schubert or after simply listening to a story. The investigators
suggest that the negative effect may have been irritation or
boredom from hearing the stultifying relaxation tape or sitting
through 10 deadly minutes of silence.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mozart effect sounded so right to parents and
policy-makers. It had the same sort of intuitive zing as the alarms
over television viewing or sugar consumption. What could be wrong
with telling people to listen to classical music or to turn off the
television or cut back on sugar?
</P>

   ``I guess I just take umbrage at misstating science and taking
liberties with science,'' Nelson said. ``Then you open the door to
people saying anything they want to say under the guise of

</P>
<P>
   People can also open the door to bitter disillusionment when the
true facts emerge, he added. ``I can imagine a lawsuit five years

listen to that Mozart CD and he's in jail now.'''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ City slickers may think there was some connection
between the withered cornstalks they saw on the nightly news last
week and the Senate's passing a $7.4 billion ``emergency''
agricultural aid bill Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is a crisis in American farming, but it has
little to do with this summer's drought, and a lot to do with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Federal farm policy is creating bigger and bigger farms and
fewer and fewer farmers, converting tens of billions of taxpayers'
dollars into cattle fodder, creating big profits for the biggest
agribusinesses and underwriting cheap hamburgers. But that policy
is bringing precious little benefit _ and, some argue, great harm _
to small farmers trying to make a living, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   These critics include the conservative Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
the centrist National Farmers Union, which represents 300,000
farmers and ranchers, and the liberal Environmental Defense Fund.
Though they marshal their arguments in different ways, they
generally agree that a system begun back in the Depression to help
farmers survive is now ``planting a seed that is going to destroy
American agriculture as we know it,'' as Gramm said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The government will plow close to $24 billion into agriculture
this year, assuming the Senate bill becomes law. That federal money
will account for nearly half of all farm income, Agriculture
Department figures show. No other American business receives this
kind of subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   Very little federal largesse goes to small farmers growing food.
Most of it goes to the increasingly industrialized production of a
few basic commodities like wheat, soybeans and corn _ not the sweet
corn of summer, but the corn that animals eat. One-third of the
wheat, three-quarters of the corn and almost all the soybeans are
used for feed, not food.
</P>
<P>
   And much of the market for those commodities is controlled by
corporations like Cargill, the nation's largest privately held
company, and Archer-Daniels-Midland, the politically connected
conglomerate recently fined $100 million for price-fixing. These
two companies control 60 percent of the export market for American
grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agriculture policy does not protect the person you or I think
of as a farmer,'' Tom Buis of the National Farmers Union said. ``It
benefits the largest operations and the processors. And the
processors want cheap grain. There are a lot of different interests
in agriculture, and the farmers are the least powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of small farmers _ those with annual gross incomes
below $250,000 _ has declined by 75 percent since the 1960s. With
tiny profit margins, farmers must have bigger farms, pricier
machines, more fertilizers, fence-to-fence plantings. Yet this
often gets them nowhere. Midwestern corn farmers' gross earnings
per acre are about the same as they were in 1950, though their
yields have doubled, Agriculture Department figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to adapt or die, fewer farmers are running bigger and
bigger operations. Hog barns and chicken coops become huge meat
factories; these economies of scale affect farming and ranching
everywhere. Farmland is concentrated in fewer and fewer hands: Five
percent of the landowners now own 50 percent of all farmland.
</P>
<P>
   And just as no other industry gets the kind of federal subsidy
that agriculture does, no other industry suffers from
overproduction on the same scale. One big reason that prices are
plummeting is that farmers are growing too much. There is no market
for half this fall's wheat crop _ close to a billion bushels,
growers say.
</P>
<P>
   Federal farm law is contributing to that oversupply, the critics
say. The law was revised by the Republican Congress in 1996 to
remove the set-aside subsidy, which paid farmers to let part of
their fields lie fallow. The old law had many critics, but the
change ``accelerated this trend of overproduction,'' said Buis.
``It encouraged more production without any measures to control
supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Searchinger, a senior attorney at the Environmental Defense
Fund in Washington, said: ``The subsidies mean that farmers produce
too many basic crops, taxpayers pay them for the excess, and
farmers keep doing it. They mean millions more acres of corn and
wheat fields, more tons of fertilizer and pesticides.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Senate's new bill, the Agriculture Department
forecast farm income declining very slightly this year, from $44.1
billion last year to $43.8 billion. Congress, by passing a bill of
that size, would push the figure up above $50 billion _ with $24
billion coming from the Treasury. The same forecast shows the total
value of farm assets rising and farm debt declining this year.
</P>
<P>
   The new farm law was supposed to let the market rule. To an
extent, it has. The agribusiness giants like overproduction because
it keeps prices down. But Congress pumps more and more money into
the system _ including a $6 billion ``emergency'' package last
October along with the $7.4 billion offered by the Senate _ and the
total payout has been greater than or equal to what would have been
paid under the old law, according to Agriculture Department figures
cited by Searchinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are paying so much money that we are actually encouraging
more production rather than compensating people partially for their
losses,'' Gramm said. ``We are going to end up exacerbating
oversupply and driving prices further and further down.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a farm crisis, but it seems to be that the market,
supported by the government, is forcing America's small farmers to
get big or get out.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On a muggy Monday night in July, some 80,000 classical music
fans ignored forecast thundershowers and flocked to New York's
Central Park to enjoy the music of Dvorak and Tchaikovsky.
Meanwhile, businesses across North America are deploying similar
symphonies to drive people away.
</P>
<P>
   In tactics akin to psychological warfare, a growing number of
merchants, building owners and transit officials are switching on
the classics to scatter loiterers, especially teens. Criminologists
trace the trend to a 7-Eleven store in Victoria, British Columbia,
which began bombarding its parking lot with classical music in 1985
to dissuade teens from congregating. Margaret Chabris, a 7-Eleven
spokeswoman, says about 150 franchises have followed suit, as have
many other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying teens with classical gas seems out of synch with the
genre's growing acceptance by mass culture. After all, sales of
classical CDs rose nearly 20 percent in 1998. And in response to
recent (albeit controversial) studies suggesting that classical
music stimulates brain development, Georgia and Tennessee now
dispense free classical CDs for newborns.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're noticing is a much broader use of orchestral music
on television, in advertising, and in public spaces,'' said John
Sparks, vice president of the American Symphony Orchestra League.
But he thought the idea of using classical music to disperse people
``says more about the person making that selection than the people
they're aiming at.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, recent experience suggests that the classical deterrent

   Before Bernie Naiman started booming ``Horowitz at the Met'' and

   The aversion of teen-agers to what used to be called ``long-hair

classical pieces like Chopin's ``Fantasie-Impromptu in C Minor''
into Kennedy Station, long a hub for subways, buses and
troublemakers. ``The bottom line is that kids don't like classical

   Bach's ``Lute Suite in A Minor'' alone won't eliminate muggings

redesign at the Port Authority's midtown bus terminal that has made
the place less threatening. Before the overhaul in 1991, the
terminal's seediness was the butt of jokes by David Letterman. Then
the authority installed brighter lighting, opened up nooks where
the homeless camped, beefed up police patrols, brought in roving
social workers _ and introduced classical music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classical music didn't stop muggings,'' Philmus said. ``What
it did was make people walking through the building say, `You know,

<P>
   On a muggy Monday night in July, some 80,000 classical music
fans ignored forecast thundershowers and flocked to New York's
Central Park to enjoy the music of Dvorak and Tchaikovsky.
Meanwhile, businesses across North America are deploying similar
symphonies to drive people away.
</P>
<P>
   In tactics akin to psychological warfare, a growing number of
merchants, building owners and transit officials are switching on
the classics to scatter loiterers, especially teens. Criminologists
trace the trend to a 7-Eleven store in Victoria, British Columbia,
which began bombarding its parking lot with classical music in 1985
to dissuade teens from congregating. Margaret Chabris, a 7-Eleven
spokeswoman, says about 150 franchises have followed suit, as have
many other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying teens with classical gas seems out of synch with the
genre's growing acceptance by mass culture. After all, sales of
classical CDs rose nearly 20 percent in 1998. And in response to
recent (albeit controversial) studies suggesting that classical
music stimulates brain development, Georgia and Tennessee now
dispense free classical CDs for newborns.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're noticing is a much broader use of orchestral music
on television, in advertising, and in public spaces,'' said John
Sparks, vice president of the American Symphony Orchestra League.
But he thought the idea of using classical music to disperse people
``says more about the person making that selection than the people
they're aiming at.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, recent experience suggests that the classical deterrent
is effective.
</P>
<P>
   Before Bernie Naiman started booming ``Horowitz at the Met'' and
``La Traviata'' outside the commercial building he owns in downtown
Denver four years ago, he considered an adjacent outdoor plaza ``a
country club for bums.'' Sidewalk preachers in particular irritated

   Whatever the shortcomings of professional wrestling as a sport _
and purists say they are many _ it is definitely a business, and a
highly profitable one.
</P>
<P>
   Just how profitable became clear when World Wrestling Federation
Entertainment Inc., which promotes and stages Wrestlemania and the

with federal securities regulators indicating that it intends to
sell up to $172 million in stock to the public.

<P>
   In the 12 months ended April 30, the WWF earned pretax profits
of $58 million on revenues of $251 million, a rate of return that
puts the company in a league with the most lucrative sports
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Few true sports, however, prize an athlete's ``acting ability''
as much as his physical presence, as the WWF says it does, and few
leagues script performances right down to each combatant's entrance
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it too farcical to pay attention to,'' said Andrew
Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College who studies the
business of sports. ``The question in my mind is whether it should
be considered sport or theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The WWF's stock offering is likely to get an enthusiastic
reception from individual investors. Professional portfolio
managers, however, might cast a more skeptical eye on the fact that
the company's chairman also participates in wrestling matches, his
wife is the chief executive and the board, as yet, has no
independent directors to help make sure that only the matches are
rigged.

   A Star Is Born, in Queens
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite the same as the 1920s, when the motion picture
industry was centered in New York and Gloria Swanson, W.C. Fields,
the Marx Brothers and Paul Robeson were making movies at the Famous
Players-Lasky Studio in the Astoria section of Queens, New York
City. But the studio and New York are undergoing a remarkable
revival of film and television production.
</P>
<P>
   The studio, now known as Kaufman Astoria Studios, said it would
build an $8.3 million, 18,000 square-foot soundstage, the seventh
at the complex. ``Ransom'' and the ``First Wives Club'' were shot
at Astoria, which serves as home to the CBS comedy ``Cosby'' and
the Children's Television Workshop program ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a great surge of business over the past five
years,'' said Mitchell Brill, director of operations at Lifetime
Studios, a tenant at the complex. ``The broadcast and cable
television business is extremely robust. I've got clients three
deep on hold.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of films shot in New York soared to 221 last year, up
from 69 in 1993. And even if there's been a slowdown in the film
industry this year, television production has plugged the gap. The
HBO series ``Sex and the City'' and ``The Sopranos'' are taped at
Silvercup Studios in Queens, while ``Law and Order'' has set up
house at the Pier 59 Studios in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question New York is hot. The number of prime-time
television series shot here will double to 12 this fall, with the
addition of ``Third Watch,'' ``Now &AMP; Again,'' ``Special Victims
Unit'' and ``The Beat.'' Some of it is location driven, but the
trend is also fueled by the simple desire of Bill Cosby, Kyra
Sedgwick, Ron Howard and Michael J. Fox to go home at night when
they finish shooting, respectively, ``Cosby,'' ``Talk to Me,''
``Bellevue'' and ``Spin City.''

   Ruling Creates Logjam In the Pacific Northwest  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Various species of snails, salamanders and the red tree vole, a
small rodent, could take on the importance of the famed northern
spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest's continuing battle over
logging. The same federal judge who once halted logging in the
old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest to protect the owl
ruled that two federal agencies had failed to insure the monitoring
and protection of 77 other species.
</P>
<P>
   Judge William Dwyer of the U.S. District Court in Seattle
blocked nine major logging deals and threatened to hold up more
than 100 others. Hailing the decision, environmental groups said
Dwyer had stopped the agencies from ``putting logging activities
ahead of their responsibilities to protect wildlife, fish, clean
water and old-growth forests.''

   After months of internal upheaval, the Christian Coalition got
some good news: A U.S. District Court judge threw out most charges
in a lawsuit that accused the group of illegally trying to boost
Republican candidates through voter guides and other efforts. The
verdict does little to clarify just how far nonpartisan
organizations of all stripes can go in activities that verge on
political.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, the largest group of religious conservatives, was
not completely exonerated. It must pay a civil penalty for efforts
that promoted the candidacies in 1994 of Newt Gingrich, who soon
became the House speaker, and Oliver North, who lost his campaign

   Nothing makes China go ballistic as much as moves by Taiwan that
look like a step away from Beijing's goal of reunification. China
tested a new long-range missile that has the capability of reaching
America. The launch comes in the middle of a crisis over Taiwan
that started last month when President Lee Teng-hui asserted that
his country will now only talk with China on the basis of ``special
state-to-state relations.'' The test occurred the same day Beijing
excoriated Washington for selling military equipment to Taiwan.

   When Cayman Islands banker John Mathewson was nabbed in San
Antonio in 1996 for helping cable pirates launder profits offshore,
he quickly offered federal agents an investigative gold mine:
investigators got their first ever access to computer tapes of a
Cayman bank's transactions and the real names behind some 2,000
bogus depositor names. Overnight the American and his Guardian Bank
&AMP; Trust Co. became the worst nightmare of the British
protectorate's bankers. The Caymans are the world's fifth largest
financial center because of strict confidentiality laws, no
taxation and a determined non-cooperation with U.S. tax probers.
</P>
<P>
   Mathewson drew a lenient sentence of five-years probation for
his cooperation in present cases that have put $50 million in taxes
and penalties in federal coffers. Future cases could bring $250
million more.

</P>
<P>
   Does the pledge of ``morally straight'' in the Boy Scout Oath
mean homosexuality is immoral? Lawyers for the Scouts say yes and
argue that this guaranteed a First Amendment right of ``expressive
association'' to expel a gay Eagle scout in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous opinion, the New Jersey Supreme Court disagreed,
saying morally straight meant goodness, with no sexual
connotations. The justices likened treatment of the former Boy
Scout, James Dale, now 29, to discrimination against women and
blacks. Scout officials said they will take their case to the U.S.
Supreme Court.

   Ruling Creates Logjam In the Pacific Northwest  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Various species of snails, salamanders and the red tree vole, a
small rodent, could take on the importance of the famed northern
spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest's continuing battle over
logging. The same federal judge who once halted logging in the
old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest to protect the owl
ruled that two federal agencies had failed to insure the monitoring
and protection of 77 other species.
</P>
<P>
   Judge William Dwyer of the U.S. District Court in Seattle
blocked nine major logging deals and threatened to hold up more
than 100 others. Hailing the decision, environmental groups said
Dwyer had stopped the agencies from ``putting logging activities
ahead of their responsibilities to protect wildlife, fish, clean
water and old-growth forests.''

   Christian Coalition's Win
</P>
<P>
   After months of internal upheaval, the Christian Coalition got
some good news: A U.S. District Court judge threw out most charges
in a lawsuit that accused the group of illegally trying to boost
Republican candidates through voter guides and other efforts. The
verdict does little to clarify just how far nonpartisan
organizations of all stripes can go in activities that verge on
political.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, the largest group of religious conservatives, was
not completely exonerated. It must pay a civil penalty for efforts
that promoted the candidacies in 1994 of Newt Gingrich, who soon
became the House speaker, and Oliver North, who lost his campaign
for the Senate from Virginia.

   After a drawn-out nomination battle, the Senate voted to confirm
Richard Holbrooke as chief U.S. delegate to the United Nations. The
14-month delay left the Clinton administration without a high-level

Balkans and the Persian Gulf. The administration hopes Holbrooke
can improve relations with the organization.

   India, Tripled

<P>
   India is set to pass the billion mark sometime this month,
United Nations demographers said, and it is closing in on China for
the title of world's most populous nation. The milestone is
expected to renew a moribund debate in India over family-planning
policies that have failed to stop the population from tripling in
half a century of independence. India has the world's largest
concentration of poor people, illiterate adults and malnourished
children.

   Film Fetches $16 Million
</P>
<P>
   A divided federal arbitration panel decided that the government
must pay the heirs of Abraham Zapruder $16 million for his film of
President John F. Kennedy's assassination. The award, about halfway
between the $30 million sought by the family and the $1 million
offered by the Justice Department, was the highest price ever paid
for any American historical artifact.

   China's Missile Test
</P>
<P>
   Nothing makes China go ballistic as much as moves by Taiwan that
look like a step away from Beijing's goal of reunification. China
tested a new long-range missile that has the capability of reaching
America. The launch comes in the middle of a crisis over Taiwan
that started last month when President Lee Teng-hui asserted that
his country will now only talk with China on the basis of ``special
state-to-state relations.'' The test occurred the same day Beijing
excoriated Washington for selling military equipment to Taiwan.

   A Money Trail
</P>
<P>
   When Cayman Islands banker John Mathewson was nabbed in San
Antonio in 1996 for helping cable pirates launder profits offshore,
he quickly offered federal agents an investigative gold mine:
investigators got their first ever access to computer tapes of a
Cayman bank's transactions and the real names behind some 2,000
bogus depositor names. Overnight the American and his Guardian Bank
&AMP; Trust Co. became the worst nightmare of the British
protectorate's bankers. The Caymans are the world's fifth largest
financial center because of strict confidentiality laws, no
taxation and a determined non-cooperation with U.S. tax probers.
</P>
<P>
   Mathewson drew a lenient sentence of five-years probation for
his cooperation in present cases that have put $50 million in taxes
and penalties in federal coffers. Future cases could bring $250
million more.

   Farm Teams' Hoop Dreams
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association has never had a minor-league
farm system where it could nurture young talent. Isiah Thomas, a
former NBA superstar with the Detroit Pistons, said he hoped to
fill that void by buying control of the Continental Basketball
Association for $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes at a time when the NBA is seeking to impose a
minimum age of 20 to enter the league, and the CBA could act as a
proving ground for raw, teen-aged talent leaping to the pros from
high schools and colleges.

   Gun Toll in Dollars
</P>
<P>
   Most discussion about gun violence focuses on the human toll.
But a new study shows that when guns are fired, everyone gets hit _
in the wallet. It costs $2.3 billion a year to treat America's
gunshot wounds, said a study by a group of economists that appeared
in The Journal of the American Medical Association. Nearly half
that cost is picked up by taxpayers. ``It is really everybody's
problem,'' said the study's chief author, Dr. Philip J. Cook of
Duke University.

<P>
   CONGRESS-GRIDLOCK-REVIEW (Washington) _ Congress has recessed
with little to show for itself beyond an arsenal of political
soundbites stockpiled to serve as campaign themes for a high-stakes
election that is still more than a year away. Still, hasn't it been
said that in a democracy the people get the government they
deserve? Can voters really expect anything but gridlock if they
elect a Democratic president, a Republican-dominated Senate and a
House nominally under Republican control but actually divided
nearly in two? By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ELDERLY-REINVENT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The AARP is trying to
retrofit itself for the baby boomers, the next great wave of the
aged, who began turning 50 three years ago and thus became eligible
for that incredibly fraught rite of passage, membership in the
AARP. Officials say they have no intention of short-changing their
older members, who in many ways have more traditional expectations
of retirement and what they want from a senior citizens'
organization. But the boomers are different. And the mighty AARP's
struggle to adjust says a lot about how the boomers will remake the
aging process. By Robin Toner.

<P>
   MALLS-DECLINE-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at why so many shopping
malls are dead or dying. One reason is greater competition _ in
some cases from re-imagined downtown blocks that developers, in an
interesting about-face, have remodeled to mimic malls. Usually,
where a mall has failed, a bigger, more state-of-the-art shopping
mecca looms on the horizon. Some are being `de-malled' to create
drive-up-to-the-door strip centers, which an increasing number of
shoppers find more convenient than the vast, multi-level centers
with miles of parking lots and walkways. But some critics feel
shopping centers have reached their saturation point. By Elin
Schoen Brockman.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL-MUSIC-KIDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Businesses across North
America are deploying symphonies to drive people away. In tactics
akin to psychological warfare, merchants, building owners and
transit officials switch on the classics to scatter loiterers,
especially teenagers. Criminologists trace the trend to a 7-Eleven
store in Victoria, British Columbia, which began bombarding its
parking lot with classical music in 1985 to dissuade teenagers from
congregating there. By David Wallis.
</P>
<P>
   FARM-AID-REVIEW (Washington) _ Federal farm policy is creating
bigger farms and fewer farmers, converting tens of billions of tax
dollars into cattle fodder, creating big profits for big
agribusiness and underwriting cheap hamburgers, but bringing little
benefit _ and, some argue, great harm _ to small farmers trying to
make a living. A system that began in the Depression to help
farmers survive is now `planting a seed that is going to destroy
American agriculture as we know it,' says Sen. Phil Gramm. By Tim
Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   DUBIOUS-SCIENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ It seems that almost any
scientific-sounding extrapolation for taking off pounds or putting
on IQ points can quickly gain a seal of approval from public health
groups or educators and help set policy for untold years to come.
Sometimes it has nothing to do with science. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   TEACHER-PAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ask a teacher what needs to be
done to improve dismal student performance, and it's a good bet the
first answer will be to raise teachers' salaries, thereby
attracting and keeping better teachers. But there is scant evidence
that higher salaries alone make a difference in student
performance. By Steven Greenhouse.

<P>
   WORLD-TREATIES-REVIEW (United Nations) _ Over the last decade,
many countries concerned about problems that transcend their
borders and threaten to overwhelm them have been signing on to one
treaty or convention after another aimed at reigning in abusive
regimes, ending the mistreatment of the weak and cutting back on
the proliferation of all kinds of weapons. Washington often watches
all this with an array of not-very-positive reactions: diminishing
enthusiasm in the White House, unease in the Pentagon, and mounting
outrage in Congress, always on the lookout for invasions of U.S.
sovereignty to beat back. By Barbara Crosette.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-MYSTICISM-REVIEW (London) _ The approach of the first
full solar eclipse in Britain in 72 years, and the last of the
millennium, is being hailed by pagans, druids, doomsayers and New
Age Travelers who interpret it in many ways, from divine felicity
to the end of the world _ anything except celestial science. And
that says something about a nation whose stereotype of proud
pragmatism seems mirrored, or even challenged, by this strain of
mysticism and quest for alternative meanings. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-GUNS-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ Guns are everywhere in
Africa, a legacy of conflict and a result of lax gun control. There
are gun stores in fancy malls, including designer gun shops where
the rich buy slick, showy little guns hoping to protect themselves
from the high crime rate. Police and army roadblocks are standard
practice all over the continent, manned by young men with huge
automatic weapons dangling carelessly from their shoulders. By

   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ As concerts go, it wasn't much of an
affair _ a few hundred people gathered to hear a local band flail
out some songs on a scratchy sound system. But it was a fine night
for the ``halabaket,'' gangsters visiting from Albania. Above the
din of the rock band they looted and burned four Serbian homes,
hot-wired and drove off a dozen cars, including seven belonging to
those in the crowd, and topped off the haul with a couple of armed
robberies.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after the show, which took place at the end of July,
a weary ritual was enacted. Several of the Kosovo Albanians who had
lost vehicles traveled the 30 miles over the border to Kukes,
Albania, to buy them back. Among them was Lutfi Shala, the
concert's organizer, who paid $600 to regain his car, the price
jacked up because it had already been repainted.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar Albanians, along with their ethnic kin in Albania,
Macedonia and Serbia, have long dreamed of a ``Greater Albania.''
The departure of the Yugoslav border police, opening up the
frontier, has given most a taste of what such a state might be
like. Not many seem to like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls are kidnapped, taken we expect to work as prostitutes in
Italy, cars are stolen or hijacked, houses are looted and there are
shootings at night,'' said Masar Shala, the mayor here appointed by
the Kosovo Liberation Army, known as the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refugees who are coming home, many of whom have driven
from Germany with their families, are systematically stopped just
before they enter Kosovo and robbed of all their money,'' he
continued. ``Apartments in the city have been seized by Albanian
gangs and rented out. The only thing we lack is drug dealing, but
that will probably arrive shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   Prizren is a sleepy city of 80,000 people with crumbling
mosques, domed Turkish baths, cobblestone streets, old wood-frame
shops and an imposing Serbian Orthodox monastery perched on a steep
hillside above the city. It was once, in the old Yugoslavia, a
tourist attraction, famed for its Ottoman architecture, mountain
peaks and Turkish food.
</P>
<P>
   But its proximity to Albania has made it a haunt for men wearing
sunglasses and packed into old Mercedes. Scores of the cars,
stripped of license plates, rumble into the city center each day.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian visitors have taken over the bars. The sidewalks
are lined with Albanians selling cigarettes, plastic containers
filled with gasoline, cheap clothes, cooking oil and sunglasses _
all brought in from over the border. At night, when most of the
criminal activity takes place, locals give the gangs a wide berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to work here,'' said Pajtim Syla, 20, from Kukes,
who had a collection of KLA shirts and banners spread out on a
street corner. During the day, at least, he said it was safe to
show his wares.
</P>
<P>
   The German troops, who control this sector, have reopened the
jail and imprisoned 80 suspects for murder, rape, arson and theft.
They have also imposed a midnight curfew.
</P>
<P>
   But the troops, hampered by unfamiliarity with the area and a
language barrier, acknowledge that the problem is too vast for them
to handle. On an average day they record more than 50 crimes,
including at least one murder. They blame the Albanian gangs for
much of the lawlessness, although some is clearly by carried out by
Kosovo Albanians, sometimes working with Albanians across the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who drive a car toward the border with Albania risk
their lives,'' said Lt. Ander Henrik, the liaison officer for the
German military police. ``The lucky ones are beaten and lose the
car. The unlucky ones we never hear about.''
</P>
<P>
   On one afternoon cars headed into Albania had washing machines,
chairs, stereos and televisions lashed to their roofs or crammed
into the back seats. The Albanian border guards, engaged in a game
of cards, never lifted their heads to watch the loot streaming out
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``For fifty years our two countries were blocked,'' said border
policeman Zylfi Ademi, 32, slumped in a chair next to the empty
customs post. ``Now everyone wants to visit Kosovo and have a
little fun.''

   The United Nations, to stem the flow of contraband, is setting
up a customs police. But the gangs, the German officers said, use
an intricate network of back roads that are not patrolled. ``The
border is mined,'' said Henrik, ``and we do not know the area well
enough to wander around in the countryside. These back roads are
heavily traveled, especially by those carrying weapons or
kidnapping girls.''

<P>
   Kosovars, when asked what happened to a missing item, hang their
fingers limply toward the ground and give them a half turn, as if
unscrewing a gas cap, to indicate that it was stolen. The gesture
has come to characterize life in Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they fear traveling to Kukes, where large numbers were
stranded as refugees during the war and watched helplessly as the
gangs carted away relief aid from the U.N. camps. But it is
impossible to make international phone calls from Prizren, so those
who want to communicate with family members abroad are forced to
make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I parked my car in front of the Kukes post office to make a
call and watched armed men break all the windows and take
everything inside, including my passport,'' said Perparim Elshani,
32, ``but I was lucky. The guy in line next to me had to watch them
drive his car away.''

   WASHINGTON _ First there was the name change. The American
Association of Retired Persons is no longer the American
Association of Retired Persons. It is AARP, and Horace Deets, its
executive director, insists that, ``It is no longer an acronym.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the gradual transformation of ``Modern
Maturity,'' the AARP's magazine. A year ago, the cover featured
Betty White, 77, looking lovely but also, well, mature. The
headline was, ``Betty White, on Life, Loss and Laughter.'' This
month, the cover features Susan Sarandon, 52, looking like she
belongs in an issue that is, in fact, headlined, ``Great Sex _
What's Age Got to Do With It?''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of sex, the AARP released a survey last week
focusing on the sexual satisfaction of Americans 45 and up. Before
the news conference began, the nation's largest senior citizens'
group played cuts from James Brown (``I Feel Good'') and Gladys
Knight and the Pips (``You're the Best Thing That Ever Happened to
Me'') stirring up latent memories of college mixers among the
assembled reporters, who proceeded to ask a flurry of questions
about frequency and potency.
</P>
<P>
   AARP officials made much of the fact that over-45 boomers were
still having sex and, by and large, would continue to have sex for
many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Its officials make no secret of it: The AARP is trying to
retrofit itself for the baby boomers, the next great wave of the
aged, who began turning 50 three years ago and thus became eligible
for that fraught rite of passage, membership in the AARP.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the lobbying giant say they have no intention of
short-changing older members, who have more traditional
expectations of retirement and what they want from a senior
citizens' organization. (``We're not just showing people on the
cover who are 51 and 52 years old,'' said Martha Ramsey, publishing
director for the group.)
</P>
<P>
   But the boomers, those born from 1946 through 1964, are headed
inexorably through the life cycle, and the mighty AARP's struggle
to adjust says a lot about how they will remake paradigms of aging
and retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get the benefit or the burden, whichever way you see it, of
all the ambivalent feelings people have about aging,'' said John
Rother, the organization's chief lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the cultural collision between the boomers and what
Modern Maturity cheerfully calls the ``Big Five-Oh'' has launched a
thousand newspaper columns, essays, bad birthday greetings and
late-night monologues, including Jay Leno's ceremonial enrollment
of Mick Jagger, 56, into the AARP two weeks ago. (Leno produced a
mock version of Modern Maturity with Jagger on the cover, with
headlines like, ``From Rolling Stones to Kidney Stones'' and
``Can't Get No Satisfaction? Try Bran Muffins.'')
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is some evidence that the boomers are simply
denying the passage of time. A recent poll found that while the
median age of the boomers is now 42, the typical boomer says he or
she feels about 35.
</P>
<P>
   But polling done for the AARP and others suggests that boomers
are, in fact, beginning to think about their golden years _ and in
a very distinctive way. To begin with, lest you wonder why the AARP
moved away from the word ``retired,'' 80 percent of the boomers say
they expect to continue working during ``retirement,'' either part
time, full time in a new career or by going into business for
themselves, according to a 1998 poll by Roper Starch Worldwide for
the AARP. And more than a third say they will be doing that
primarily for ``interest and enjoyment.'' (Even now, 40 percent of
AARP's members are still working.)
</P>
<P>
   Only a fifth of the boomers expect to move to a new geographic
area when they retire _ in contrast with the previous generation's
dream of a mass exodus to Florida _ and only a third think they
will have to scale back their lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Big majorities say they expect to live longer than their
parents' generation, and that awareness makes a difference, said
Dr. James Birren, associate director of the UCLA Center on Aging.
``Boomers are thinking more about how they want to invest all those
years of the future as opposed to getting through them,'' he said.
Many of the previous generation, he added, simply did not
anticipate living as long as they have.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Peter Hart agreed that while boomers might expect to
live 25 years after retirement, the previous generation probably
anticipated five to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Dychtwald, the president of Age Wave, a research
organization and business focused on the ``mature market,'' argues
that boomers will live a ``cyclical lifestyle'' _ ``going back to
school, having multiple careers, retiring, rehiring.'' He added,
``They will not accept old age at all.'' Previous generations, the
49-year-old Dychtwald said, lived ``linear lives'' _ from work to
rest to death.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Delehanty, the 50-year-old new editor of Modern Maturity,
said he senses a hunger among the boomers for a ``new paradigm for
life after 50,'' a way of thinking about the next career or the
next work life. Delehanty, who once edited the Utne Reader, a
leftist, boomer-oriented digest of the alternative press, said he
plans a future issue of Modern Maturity on ``How to Reinvent Your
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Boomers are also more health and fitness conscious, analysts
say. And, not surprisingly, they tend to be more anti-authority,
more skeptical of government, more interested in ``empowerment''
and ``choice.'' As Deets puts it: ``They want to make their own
decisions. They don't want to be told what to do.''

   What does all this mean for the 41-year-old AARP, which claims
more than 30 million members? Officials say they are doing a lot of

diversity of the boomer generation.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, long known for its insurance products as well
as its formidable defense of Social Security and Medicare on
Capitol Hill, recently spun off a subsidiary to explore new
services and products for the over-50 population. And its magazine,
which has long published different versions for the working and
retired set (the sex report appeared in both), may be doing more
such demographically zoned editions in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Dychtwald, a critic of the AARP, asserts that the senior group
will have a hard time serving both the old old and the new old.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is worried about fixed incomes and entitlements, the other
is worried about paying for their kids' education and elder care
and mutual funds,'' he said. ``Can AARP maintain their relationship
with their core constituency, who are likely to be retired
grandparents with a lot of free time, who are very respectful of
government, while simultaneously trying to be irreverent,
anti-authority, hip and modern?''
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic pollster Mark Mellman argues that the boomers
will be traditionalists in one respect: their support for those New
Deal-Great Society entitlement programs. ``They are pro-Medicare
and pro-Social Security, for themselves and for their parents,''
Mellman said.
</P>
<P>
   Celinda Lake, another Democratic pollster, said the 50-to-64 age
group is ``more adamant'' about strengthening and protecting those
programs than any other.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying question, of course, is how much old age will
change the boomers, and how much the boomers will change old age.
Meanwhile, time stops for no generation. Welcomed into ``The Big
Five-Oh'' club in the latest issue of Modern Maturity were Annie
Leibovitz, Twiggy and, the headliner of this summer's big rock
tour, Bruce Springsteen.

<P>
   WELLFLEET, Mass. _ Banish any image of a Shrinkland where the
streets are peopled by bearded, strategically taciturn men and
motherly but penetrating women all asking each other, ``And how did
that make you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   This is not even close. It is just one more quaint Cape Cod town
swamped by vacationers of all ilks in summer, one with pleasant
sandy surroundings and a reputation for attracting intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Boston and New York analysts who still perform the
traditional August abandonment ritual migrate out to all sorts of
places to enjoy the sunny hours that last longer than 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But enough of them do come here, and have for decades, that they
are a felt presence in Wellfleet and in neighboring Truro; a big
and active enough presence that some of the recent change in the
psychotherapy world is reflected in the evolution of their summer
chat and study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call them `the psychs,' and in August we say, `The psychs
are here,''' said Elden Gray, 86, a retired grocer from near Boston
who has summered here for 50 years. ``This town is known for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   So solid is the area's reputation as a psychiatric summer
retreat that Harry Castleman, a marketing manager from Needham on
vacation here, remarked, ``I've always heard that if you need a
psychiatrist in August, the only place to find one is in
Wellfleet.''
</P>
<P>
   When Paul Buttenwieser, a psychoanalyst in Cambridge, wrote a
comic novel called ``Free Association'' in 1981, he placed the
chapter ``Where Do Analysts Go in August?'' in and around
Wellfleet, and described a scene of ``beached porpoises'' who could
not stop their earnest discussions even on the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Upon close examination, the Wellfleet area seems to have two
psychiatric traditions: the old, begun in the decades around World
War II, when informal groups of psychoanalysts gathered for long
stretches, creating casual traditions whose remnants last to this
day; and the new, a more formalized set of seminars, each usually
lasting a week, that funnels several thousand mental-health
professionals through the area each summer.
</P>
<P>
   The old tradition, said Dr. Robert Michels, a professor of
psychiatry at Cornell University, apparently arose because European
psychoanalysts, including Freud himself, used to go away for weeks
in summer to healthful climes and often take their patients with
them.
</P>
<P>
   When many moved to the United States, they continued that habit
here, Michels' psychoanalysis teachers told him. They were drawn to
the tip of Cape Cod, it seems, for its natural beauty, its quiet
and the stimulation of the artists' colony in Provincetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``And because in the analytic world, analysts get analyzed, you
start having extended family cultures,'' Michels said. ``An elderly
analyst, their middle-aged analysands, and their analysands who are
younger still. And people established patterns that would continue
after their analyses were over.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, few active therapists take vacations of several weeks.
Also, the numbers of European-born analysts have dwindled. But the
remnants and new versions of that tradition continue: houses bought
and passed down, family habits, groups of friends, some of them
therapists, who travel here together year after year.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the most visible signs of ``psych'' presence are at
schools and hotels, where psychiatrists, psychologists, social
workers and others mass for edifying, tax-deductible weeks of study
_ with a whale-watch or two thrown in.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Gilbert Levin, a professor of psychiatry at Albert Einstein
College of Medicine, founded the Cape Cod Institute 20 years ago,
and it puts about 1,300 mental-health professionals through courses
each summer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar group, the New England Educational Institute, serves
about 2,000, said its founder, Dr. Robert Guerette. Harvard Medical
School also offers courses here, Guerette said, as does the
Massachusetts Mental Health Center. Last week the Boston Graduate
School of Psychoanalysis ran seminars with intriguing titles such
as ``Is Sex Just Sex?'' and ``Is Love Necessary?''
</P>
<P>
   And there are others, like the seminar that Dr. Robert Jay
Lifton, professor of psychiatry at John Jay College and the City
University of New York, holds each year on psychology and history
for a few colleagues. Erik Erikson, the originator of the concept
``identity crisis,'' who died in 1994, used to attend that one.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the part about change. The courses at the two big
institutes have shifted their orientation somewhat in recent years.
If they once focused mainly on the psychology of individuals and
clinical therapy, now, with many psychologists chafing under the
strictures of managed care, they have branched more into areas like
organizational management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patient or client is a system rather than an individual,''
Levin said. ``Now, many people trained in the psychodynamic
tradition are looking to enter that venue.'' Hence institute
courses like this year's ``Creating Great Groups,'' about
team-building and creativity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the hobnobbing among participants, Guerette said, he has
noticed a rise in discussion of bread-and-butter issues as
therapists struggle with managed care. There is also, he and others
said, excited discussion about the potential of quicker,
post-Freudian methods.
</P>
<P>
   For all the summer seminars, however, Lifton objected to ``the
mythology of a shrink gathering here,'' saying that Wellfleet had
long been summer home to all kinds of people; that there was no
great organized social ``shrink scene.''
</P>
<P>
   His words are borne out in an essay by Alfred Kazin in his book
``Summer'' (Addison-Wesley, 1990). Kazin describes a scintillating
mix of beachside literati in the 1950s and '60s that included
Edmund Wilson and Mary McCarthy. The historian Arthur Schlesinger
might stroll by, or the polemicist Dwight Macdonald. One wit called
the place ``the beach of the intellectuals,'' Kazin wrote.
</P>
<P>
   To longtime residents like Gray, nearly all fit under the
``psych'' heading, and share telltale characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just go down the street and try to pass on the sidewalk _ they
block the sidewalk with their conversations!'' Gray said, more
amused than annoyed. ``They stand there and yak away and pat each
other on the back, and most all of them have chin whiskers.''

SALE OF PAPER STIRS A MUTED SADNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco Chronicle once embarked on a
long editorial crusade on what it saw as a pressing issue _
improving the coffee served in restaurants. ``A Great City's People
Forced to Drink Swill,'' proclaimed one headline.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some San Franciscans have made a similar
observation about their newspapers, wondering why the people of
this wealthy, well-educated city were forced to read fluff.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, The Chronicle's combination of provincialism and
frivolity _ as embodied by the coffee campaign in 1963 and the more
than 50 years' of columns by the late Herb Caen _ seemed to match
the city's psyche and earned the paper a certain affection.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with some sadness that San Franciscans greeted the
news on Friday that The Chronicle, owned by the same family for 134
years, is being sold to Hearst Corp., publisher of the rival San
Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the end of an era,'' said Ed Moose, the proprietor of
Moose's, a bar and grill frequented by newspaper people. ``This is
a paper with a real history,'' he said, adding that Chronicle
columnists ``spoke for the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly which era is over, however, is not clear. The Chronicle,
a morning paper with a circulation of 482,000, will survive,
although under Hearst management it will probably change.
</P>
<P>
   It is The Examiner, with an equally rich history dating from the
days of the newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst, that is most
in danger. An afternoon paper with a circulation of only 114,000,
The Examiner is being put up for sale, but analysts think no one
will buy it.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, it will be combined with The Chronicle, ending a
newspaper battle that has lasted more than a century and adding San
Francisco to the growing list of cities with only one daily
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say you're shocked, but when it finally happens
it's sad,'' said Susan Rasky, an acting associate professor of
journalism at the University of California at Berkeley. ``It's like
an old friend died.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the trendy North Beach neighborhood, where the coffee
now draws few complaints, many people interviewed on Friday night
did not seem to care that one point of view might be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Although their news staffs compete vigorously, the two papers
have shared revenues and have published a combined Sunday edition
since 1965 under a joint operating agreement, contributing to the
impression here that the papers are not really distinct, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a one-paper town already _ it doesn't matter that
much,'' said Richard Levine, a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Elijah Curtis, a bicycle messenger, agreed. ``It's hard for me
to tell the difference between the two,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the papers have differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Examiner folks are more two-fisted, blue-collar, `We go
out and get the story,''' said Moose, the restaurant owner. ``The
Chronicle is more cerebral, slightly more sophisticated and more
eccentric.''
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner also focuses more closely on city, as opposed to
regional, news, and is more liberal editorially.
</P>
<P>
   Some said that with television, the Internet and national
newspapers like The New York Times and USA Today, there is no
shortage of news sources. San Francisco also has spirited
alternative newspapers like the Bay Guardian and SF Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the alternative weeklies anyway, so it doesn't matter
to me,'' Jeff Stewart, a department-store salesman, said of The
Chronicle purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Casper, a lawyer who is chairman of the San Francisco
Republican Party, said he worried that The Examiner's editorial
policy, which he called ``ultra PC knee-jerk left,'' will now be
transferred to the more conservative Chronicle. This is a
distinctly minority worry in this overwhelmingly Democratic city.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, he was not worried about the loss of either
newspaper. ``A newspaper no longer defines a city,'' Casper said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To some extent, the big newspaper competition here in recent
years has not been between The Chronicle and The Examiner, anyway.
It has been between The Chronicle and Knight Ridder, which owns The
San Jose Mercury News to the south of San Francisco and a string of
smaller papers to the east.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bay Area's growth in recent years coming from the
suburbs and not San Francisco itself, The Chronicle has been trying
to transform itself into a regional paper, with zoned local
editions. It has beefed up its coverage of technology and business.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, both The Chronicle and The Examiner, which in
the days when it was published by Hearst was known for its ``yellow
journalism,'' have become far more serious newspapers that no
longer seem to deserve their old reputations.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle was started in 1865 by two teen-age brothers,
Charles and Michael de Young, as The Daily Dramatic Chronicle.
Their descendants, who now own the paper, have fought among
themselves, helping lead to the decision to sell.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner was taken over by Hearst, the model for the main
character in the movie ``Citizen Kane,'' in 1887 and made the
flagship of his newspaper chain. In recent years, as its
circulation has lagged, its demise has been rumored.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, The San Jose Mercury News published an article saying
that Hearst and The Chronicle were close to an agreement to shut
The Examiner and jointly produce a morning newspaper. The Examiner
denied that, and a year later staff members held a party and made
T-shirts bearing the slogan ``We're still here.''
</P>
<P>
   But to a lot of people it looks doubtful that they will have
such a party a year from now.

U.S. MAY TRY TO CURB DIAMOND TRADE THAT FUELS AFRICAN WARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Concerned that diamonds are financing and
perpetuating wars in Africa, the Clinton administration is
considering actions aimed at halting the illicit-diamond trade,
administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of uncut diamonds from rebel-held mines to market
centers around the world _ valued at hundreds of millions of
dollars a year _ is keeping rebel armies in Angola, Congo and
Sierra Leone supplied with tanks and assault rifles and even
uniforms and beer, U.S. and European officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Control of these mines has been an obstacle to peace efforts in
African hot spots, and officials hope that by cutting off the
gray-market diamond trade they can also choke off the flow of arms,
stop the endless killing and hasten peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Diamonds are not the only way in which rebels pay for weapons,
but experts in Africa and the trade say cutting it off would have a
substantial impact.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is likely to propose a global marketing
system, by which diamond sales must be accompanied by documents
declaring the source of the precious stones and their destination.
</P>
<P>
   From the fields in Africa, diamonds reach dealers in Belgium,
Israel and Ukraine, where the unscrupulous turn the ready cash into
weapons. The largest weapons pipeline into Africa is controlled by
Russian organized crime figures who work with diamond brokers, U.S.
and European officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight years, the Angolan rebel organization, known
as Unita, has raised $3 billion to $4 billion from diamond sales,
according to a recent report by a U.N. committee on Angolan
sanctions. An arduously worked-out peace accord for that country
collapsed late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The brutal war in Sierra Leone, which left thousands maimed and
mutilated, was prolonged by at least 18 months because of the
ability of the rebels to quickly trade diamonds for arms, an
administration official said last week. A delicate agreement ending
that war was signed in July.
</P>
<P>
   At the middle levels of the State Department, the African
diamonds-for-weapons trade has been under study for several years.
But the problem has not penetrated more senior levels because wars
in Africa are not generally seen as affecting America's strategic
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after an intelligence study, which had been slow in coming,
illustrated how the trade works to perpetuate rebellion in Africa,
top administration officials appear to be ready to back a plan that
would try to regulate the diamond trade.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how such a marketing regime would be implemented in
various African nations and European diamond centers is undecided,
officials say. It could take the form of a U.N. program, a
multilateral treaty or a voluntary agreement within the diamond
industry.
</P>
<P>
   It appears to be an idea that is gaining support outside
government channels. Human rights organizations, including those
that led the campaign to ban land mines, are now talking about a
public education campaign aimed at highlighting the
diamonds-for-weapons trade.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the world's largest diamond company, DeBeers
Consolidated Mines Ltd., said in an interview that it would support
tighter controls on the trade. DeBeers, which controls about 70
percent of the world's diamond sales, views the growing flow of
illicit diamonds as a potential threat to its ability to influence
prices.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Its support would surely be welcomed by the administration,
which had expected DeBeers to resist any move to regulate the
market since the company has done quite well under the current
system.
</P>
<P>
   DeBeers has repeatedly maintained that it does not buy illicit
diamonds, a claim that U.S. and British officials dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all for it,'' a DeBeers spokesman in London, Andrew
Lamont, said about any proposal that the administration might
advance to strengthen controls on the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suits our interests,'' he added. ``The illicit trade only
serves to destabilize the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamont added that he thought the countries of southern Africa
whose economies are heavily dependent on diamond sales _ Botswana,
Namibia and South Africa _ would also welcome more stringent
controls on the trade.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And Belgium, which has resisted entreaties from the Clinton
administration to crack down on the gray-market diamond merchants,
appears to be changing its attitude. In Antwerp, the diamond
trading center of Europe, officials have asked for help from U.S.
law enforcement agencies to combat the growing power of Russian
organized crime figures, who launder money through diamond
merchants, according to U.S. officials in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The diamond trade, which is highly secretive and governed by
informal arrangements, has been difficult to regulate. A U.N.
embargo against buying diamonds from Unita, the Angolan rebel
movement, has been largely ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diamond revenues constitute the essential component of Unita's
capacity to wage war,'' Robert R. Fowler, Canada's ambassador to
the United Nations, wrote in a recent report to the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is reluctant to talk publicly about
what steps it is considering to curb the diamond trade in order to
avoid the perception that a regulatory regime would be imposed on
African states by the powerful West, said an administration
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Britain is also
supportive of tighter controls and is working with the
administration on proposals, U.S. and British officials said.

NORTH KOREA SEES A PLOT AFTER DEATHS OF GIFT COWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CALVIN SIMS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Last summer, in an encouraging sign that
relations between the Koreas were improving, a convoy of 50 trucks
from Hyundai Group of South Korea rolled across the heavily
fortified border into North Korea, carrying a most precious cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the trucks were 500 head of cattle, a gift from Chung
Ju-yung, Hyundai's billionaire founder, to help feed the
famine-stricken North. At the time, Hyundai's cattle donation was
the most shining example yet that South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung's policy of constructively engaging the North was working.
</P>
<P>
   A Buddhist priest, on hand for the highly publicized cattle
drive, banged a wooden block and prayed that the animals would
survive until the Korean Peninsula was reunited.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, those prayers appear to have gone unanswered.
North Korea announced recently that about half the cattle had died,
casualties of what it said was a sinister plot by South Korea's
intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   The North accused the South's spy agency of force-feeding the
cows vinyl rope, large nails and other indigestible items before
the animals were shipped. The agency strenuously denied the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Western diplomats would dismiss such claims as the
desperate propaganda of a hermetic communist state, but several
envoys and international aid workers here have confirmed that
scores of the donated cattle have died under mysterious
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we don't believe that the South Korean government had
anything to do with the cattle's untimely death,'' a senior Western
diplomat said, ``it is certainly curious that so many of these
cows, which were intended to relieve hunger, perished this way. If
we find this curious, one can only imagine the level of paranoia
spreading through North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   In a broadcast on North Korean radio last month, a government
spokesman said that 246 of the first 500 cows given by Hyundai in
June 1998 had died, along with 30 sent by a civic group, according
to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency, which monitors North Korean
radio transmissions. The North Korean spokesman said autopsies
found ``vinyl rope, vinyl sheeting, magnets, fragments of glass,
large nails and other indigestible items in the dead cattle's
stomachs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We severely reprove the intelligence service for resorting to
such a despicable trick in a bid to hinder and frustrate
nongovernmental cooperation between the North and South,'' the
spokesman said, referring to Chung's donation.
</P>
<P>
   International famine relief workers, who maintain contact with
their colleagues in North Korea, said they had received reports
that several hundred of the donated cows died. The workers said
that during the first autopsies, North Korean veterinarians
searched the animal carcasses for electronic devices and tested for
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   In denying that the agency was responsible for the deaths, a
spokesman for South Korea's National Intelligence Service said,
``It is absolutely untrue that we planted any type of surveillance
device on the cows.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea in no way blamed Hyundai for the deaths. When Chung
led the caravan of Hyundai trucks across the demilitarized zone
last year, the cows appeared healthy and were heard mooing softly.
According to news reports here, the animals had been given a
sedative to prevent motion sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai donated an additional 500 cattle last September, but it
could not be learned how that herd has fared.
</P>
<P>
   Chung, a son of a poor farmer in Tonchon, Kangwon Province, in
North Korea, said he had decided to donate the cattle to pay a
family debt. At 18, Chung stole his father's cow in secret and used
the proceeds to travel to Seoul to make his fortune. He is now one
of South Korea's wealthiest men.
</P>
<P>
   A Hyundai spokesman, Kim Sang-ryun, said the company had
received no indication from North Korea that so many cows had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's now the case that hundreds of cows have died,'' Kim
said, ``we are very sad to hear that because we had hoped that the
cows would be bred and used to provide nourishment.''
</P>
<P>
   International relief agencies estimate that the North Korean
famine has killed a minimum of several hundred thousand and left
millions close to starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of Kim Dae-jung, the South Korean president, view
the cow debacle as further evidence of the faltering of his
so-called sunshine policy, which lifted bans on travel and trade
with North Korea to encourage reforms there.
</P>
<P>
   Although South Korea has provided the North with tens of
millions of dollars in food, fertilizer and tourist revenues in the
last year, the North recently provoked a navy skirmish, detained a
South Korean tourist and threatened to test a new long-range
missile.

FIGHTING TO SAVE CHILDREN FROM BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JUDITH MILLER and PAUL LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. official charged with saving children
from the scourge of war had plowed through the swampy,
mosquito-infested wilderness of the northern Sri Lanka jungle for
four hours to ask rebel leaders a delicate question.
</P>
<P>
   Was it true that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, locked
for more than 15 years in a vicious civil war with the government,
were using young girls as suicide bombers?
</P>
<P>
   The Tamils ``neither confirmed nor denied'' the reports from
relief groups and U.N. officials, said the official, Olara Otunnu,
recalling the meeting a year ago. ``But they said they couldn't
defend the practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The encounter may not have been an all-out victory, but it
represented progress in what many diplomats once considered the
United Nations' hopelessly ambitious struggle to protect the
world's children from war.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics attest to the daunting nature of Otunnu's quest.
According to the U.N. Children's Fund, UNICEF, 300,000 children
under 18 are serving as regular soldiers, guerrilla fighters,
spies, porters, cooks and sexual slaves _ even suicide commandos _
in conflicts under way in about 50 nations. The lightness,
simplicity and low cost of modern weapons make them ideal for use
by children.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, Otunnu's office adds, these wars have
claimed the lives of more than 2 million children, left 6 million
maimed or permanently disabled, created 1 million orphans, left 10
million with serious psychological trauma and resulted in
children's accounting for half the world's 24 million refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after a year of almost nonstop travel to what he calls the
world's ``places of death and bloodshed,'' and months spent
begging, cajoling and even embarrassing government and rebel
leaders, his efforts have led the United Nations to begin to
establish a critical legal and moral framework for giving children
special status and their protection new priority.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 183 U.N. member states and eight nonmembers, including
many where children have fought in civil conflicts, have ratified a
1989 convention that established international rights for children.
</P>
<P>
   Three new categories of war crimes affecting children would be
prosecutable before a new international criminal court. And
finally, several governments and the rebel groups seeking to
overthrow them have agreed to stop recruiting or using children
under 18 as soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not supported what Otunnu considers his
major achievements, however.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, it has not ratified the convention, and may not do
so. Fearing it will be used for political purposes, the United
States opposes the creation of the international criminal court.
The United States also opposes the ban on recruiting soldiers under
18, wanting to preserve its policy of recruiting high school
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Although the agency she heads adamantly supports raising the
recruitment age, Carol Bellamy, the American who is executive
director of UNICEF, concedes that the battle is still uphill.
``There is not yet a worldwide consensus that the minimum age
should be raised,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition of the United States, Britain and several
other states to the child recruitment ban has not stopped Ms.
Bellamy and Otunnu from making progress with several states that
have witnessed vicious internal strife and bloodshed. In Sri Lanka,
for example, Otunnu may not have ended the use of child suicide
bombers, but he wrested pledges from the rebels and the government
not to recruit soldiers under 17.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, he has also obtained pledges for a minimum age
of 18 from governments and rebel factions in Sudan, Burundi, Congo
and Angola, where ethnic strife, UNICEF says, has claimed the lives
of more than 2 million children in the past decade. The Colombian
government, too, has accepted 18 as the minimum, but the principal
guerrilla movement has said only that it will not recruit soldiers
under 15.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Otunnu persuaded Sierra Leone and the rebels
there to accept a higher minimum age for their fighters and to
include in their peace agreement provisions that guarantee
``special care and protection'' of children and their ``inherent
right to life, survival and development'' in accordance with the
international convention.
</P>
<P>
   Otunnu considers such commitments vital. ``Children suffer
disproportionately in war but they are never mentioned in peace
agreements,'' he said. ``The welfare and protection of children
should always be part of the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges, however, that such pledges are difficult to
monitor or enforce. Ruth Wedgwood, a law professor and senior
fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, also says that reliable
recruitment statistics are hard to come by, and that existing ones
might not reflect a decline in child recruitment so soon.
</P>
<P>
   Children, of course, have served as soldiers for centuries. But
most experts agree that the changing nature of modern warfare, with
its small and lightweight weapons, has led to a vast expansion in
the involvement of children as victims and perpetrators. Moreover,
because modern conflicts tend to be civil wars that drag on,
children are recruited as soldiers after manpower grows scarce. And
children, in fact, make good killers, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Some children volunteer to be soldiers just to survive or to
``prove their manhood,'' says the Coalition to Stop the Use of
Child Soldiers, a private group seeking to persuade governments and
political groups to exempt children from warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' concern about children and warfare began in
earnest with the 1990 Children's Summit here, which more than 150
heads of state attended and which drew attention to the plight of
children affected by armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1993, the General Assembly asked Graca Machel, a former
education minister in Mozambique who is now the wife of former
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, to prepare a report and
recommendations. After three years of travel and study, Ms. Machel
produced a horrific portrait of the fate of children caught up in
conflict, which was infused with a deeply personal sense of
outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Her plea for action so galvanized the General Assembly that it
immediately endorsed her principal recommendation _ the creation of
a special post reporting directly to the secretary-general and
charged formally with ``the protection of children affected by
armed conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Many expected Ms. Machel to be named as the secretary-general's
special representative, but for personal reasons she turned the
post down. Instead, it went to Otunnu, who is legal guardian of the
six children of his dead sister and brother. He helped Ms. Machel
prepare her report.

</P>
<P>
   Educated on scholarships that took him to Oxford and Harvard to
study law, Otunnu served as Uganda's permanent representative to
the United Nations from 1980 to 1985 and as foreign minister from
1985 to 1986. But he was forced to leave his country because of a
dispute with Yoweri Museveni, Uganda's president, who stripped him
of his citizenship _ a loss that President Felix Houphouet-Boigny
of Ivory Coast corrected by giving him a new nationality.
</P>
<P>
   His new job has a broad agenda but no guaranteed budget, and is
instead dependent on contributions from member countries. Last
year, Otunnu's first full-time year on the job, his budget was a
paltry $500,000, which barely covered air fare, never mind money
for staff. This year, he has raised $4 million so far, and now has
a staff of four.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Diaz, executive director of the Women's Commission for
Refugees, Women and Children, which is part of the International
Rescue Committee, said that despite limited resources and a high
turnover in his staff because of the world body's employment
practices, ``Olara has really raised the profile of this issue and
shaken up the status-quo folks at the United Nations and
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign to raise the age of military recruitment to 18,
Otunnu is effectively trying to change the U.N. Convention on the
Rights of the Child, adopted in 1989, which at American and British
insistence sets 15 as the minimum age for soldiers to be recruited.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the United States and Somalia, which has no government,
are the only two countries that have not ratified the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton agreed to sign it in 1995, the Senate
is traditionally very slow to approve international treaties, said
Ms. Bellamy. In addition, however, many senators and other U.S.
officials doubt the wisdom of conferring special rights on
children, particularly, argue conservatives, if they are at the
expense of parental authority or they weaken the family.
</P>
<P>
   In another effort to shield children from the effects of war,
Otunnu has helped persuade advocates of the planned international
criminal court to expand the list of recognized war crimes to
include several affecting children. Since the court would have
authority to seek the arrest of accused war criminals, children's
advocates consider it an essential tool to enforce the child rights
convention and other treaties.
</P>
<P>
   With a growing number of conflicts in countries in which half or
more of the population is under 18, Otunnu acknowledges that he is
racing against a demographic clock to win broad acceptance of the
notion that special international legal and cultural norms are
needed to protect children, victims and child soldiers alike.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most haunting memories is a trip last year to
Connaught Hospital in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, where
he met child fighters and child victims. ``Suddenly, as if from
nowhere,'' he said, he encountered ``a community'' of limbless
children. One child, under 10 years old, told him that after rebel
fighters had cut off both of his hands, they had told him, ``Go
tell President Kabbah that we are still here.''

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ After weeks of political chaos featuring 27 declared
mayoral candidates, six of them with arrest records, a campaign
showdown loomed noisy as summer thunder here last week in a rowdy
scene outside City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, you're stabbing us in the back,'' one black politician
shouted at another as demonstrators disrupted a news conference,
called to endorse a mayoral candidate, and drove their rivals
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   But their target, Howard Rawlings, the state General Assembly
delegate, was determined to go forward with his role as a political
kingmaker. He called on this gritty city's black majority to
support the leading white mayoral contender, Martin O'Malley, a
city councilman.
</P>
<P>
   ``O'Malley is a new generation of white political leadership,''
Rawlings, who is black, declared after he retreated from hooting
and hollering demonstrators bused to City Hall on Thursday by the
rival campaign of Lawrence Bell III, the City Council president and
the leading black candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``O'Malley has a track record of empowering black Americans,''
Rawlings said in front of the television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who had been increasingly upset at the rise of O'Malley
from the status of also-ran to possible unity candidate, was
nowhere in sight on Thursday. But his political lieutenants
directed the disruptive rally and denounced the potentially
decisive endorsements of O'Malley as treachery by ``so-called
pseudo-Negro political leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   News reports would describe the scene at City Hall as a
dirty-tricks ``ambush'' by Bell forces frustrated that the formerly
underrated O'Malley was gaining momentum. He had garnered
endorsements from black leaders like Rawlings and state Sen. Joan
Carter Conway and from some well-organized, heavily black labor
unions, including the city's health care workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of being the best black candidate or the
best white candidate,'' Rawlings said in an interview. ``O'Malley's
the best candidate for Baltimore.'' He noted that he and other
black leaders had tried and failed to enlist black candidates like
Kweisi Mfume, the former U.S. representative who is president of
the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   And so they are urging voters to wrench some order from what
Rawlings described as a ``frightening'' and divisive campaign for
the Sept. 14 primary that will determine the next mayor in this
predominantly black Democratic city.
</P>
<P>
   The primary field includes 17 Democrats, seven Republicans and
three independents. But only the top three Democrats were rated as
having any chance of being elected mayor. All the candidates talked
of a turnout of little more than 100,000 voters in this city of
675,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   The beneficiary of the black leaders' strategy, O'Malley, seemed
almost surprised to have risen to the center of attention as he
warned against ``the divisive politics of the past.'' He had used
his four terms on the council to make a show of visiting New York
and other urban renaissance spots in building an image _ tinged
with the sharp-edged resolve of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York
_ as the leading voice against Baltimore's persistently high
standing in drug and murder rates.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of O'Malley, a proven vote getter in his heavily black
council district, appeared to have as much to do with a process of
elimination as it did with his own dogged sense of opportunity in
suddenly entering the race after black leaders failed to produce a
unity candidate. Rawlings candidly admitted that after Mfume and
other prominent blacks spurned a candidacy, he was going to turn to
Carl Stokes, a black candidate and a former city councilman, as the
next best choice.
</P>
<P>
   But then Stokes became embroiled in a campaign resume
controversy for having falsely claimed a college degree. That left
O'Malley, who was unsullied thus far in the tragicomical series of
candidate gaffes that had provided this city with a bleak campaign
sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   One fringe candidate was recognized as a fugitive from a court
warrant by a police officer watching television, who then moved in
for an arrest. Controversy had even focused on the management
talents of Bell, who marshaled a formidable patronage machine in
trying to appear the odds-on heir to Mayor Kurt Schmoke. Bell has
had to deal with lawsuit disclosures of personal financial troubles
highlighted by the repossession of his car.
</P>
<P>
   The contenders are campaigning against a bittersweet subtext of
the end of the 12-year Democratic reign of Schmoke. Hailed
initially as an urban visionary, he is departing with various
politicians voicing disappointment that Baltimore had failed to
keep pace with other major cities during the national economic
boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, although everybody likes the mayor,'' said Jim
Knight, a Democratic committeeman from south Baltimore. He was
campaigning for Stokes, faulting Bell for racial politics that
Knight considered deliberately divisive in a city that sorely
needed reconciliation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bell, vying to maintain his earlier career promise before an
electorate that is more than 60 percent black, had become openly
petulant about his former ally, O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of being a punching bag,'' Bell declared, pacing and
frowning before the voters as the two appeared Thursday night
before the 43/44 Democratic Club in the heart of the city's black
wards. ``I'm not going to take it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bell forces' commitment to an aggressive last-ditch
targeting of O'Malley became clear earlier in the week when they
rallied outside The Baltimore Sun newspaper. They complained that
negative stories had focused on black candidates, but that O'Malley
had been spared criticism and should be scored as a criminal lawyer
who sometimes represented drug defendants even as he campaigned
against them. The Sun reported that O'Malley's mixed criminal
caseload was far from lucrative and not atypical for a former
criminal prosecutor. O'Malley told voters that other public
figures, from Abraham Lincoln to Thurgood Marshall, pursued similar
livelihoods in the law.
</P>
<P>
   The crossover to O'Malley reflected growing wariness among some
black leaders about Bell, as well as their own political need to
play a decisive role in the city's affairs. Rawlings, appalled at
being cut off as he stood for O'Malley, accused the Bell campaign
of ``political vandalism.'' ``He's a child,'' snapped the black
Statehouse leader, joining the O'Malley camp.

EDITORIAL: A HANDFUL OF DUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Aug. 8:
</P>
<P>
   Drought is a slow emergency. It does not swoop down out of the
skies like a tornado or pull the earth apart at its seams like an
earthquake. A drought of the kind the Eastern seaboard is suffering
now, the worst of this century in at least four states, is the
product not of one summer's failed rains but of chronic dryness
over several seasons _ compounded by routine profligacy in our use
of water.
</P>
<P>
   It is the result of what we have all been taught to call good
weather _ hot, it is true, but blue skies day after day, mild
winters, little snow. It is also the result of what we have come to
call normal water use.
</P>
<P>
   The drought of 1999 has become severe enough to bring about a
flurry of administrative actions intended to mitigate its effects
on farms, businesses and communities.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Clinton ordered the appropriate federal
agencies to form a task force to organize timely drought relief.
New Jersey's governor, Christie Whitman, and the governors of
Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia have all imposed mandatory
restrictions on water use.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman has declared West Virginia
and 33 counties in five surrounding states a disaster area.
Meanwhile, the Senate approved $7.4 billion in aid to farmers, to
which a drought and disaster relief package will need to be added
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   This is all to the good, and it may also reconcentrate, for a
moment, our attention on this nation's patterns of water usage.
Drought is nothing new, and dealing with it does not require
radically new ideas. Any number of entities, including the Western
Drought Coordination Council and the National Drought Policy
Commission, have been spawned in recent years in order to monitor
drought conditions and respond to them as the long-term events they
are.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Drought Mitigation Center, no state
had a drought plan during the 1976-77 dry spell. This year 30
states do, and nearly every encounter with water scarcity leads to
a set of recommendations _ essentially the ones invoked in a
drought emergency _ meant to discourage consumption and encourage
recycling.
</P>
<P>
   But once the rains begin again and controls are lifted, water
use tends to rebound to previous levels. Drought dramatizes an
epistemological problem that has real, practical effects. There is
something almost intangible about the causes of drought, something
as abstract and as forceful as fate. A high-pressure dome has kept
rain from the mid-Atlantic states this summer, a weather pattern
related to the occurrence of La Nina, a drop in sea-surface
temperature in the eastern equatorial Pacific last winter.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tie any single drought unequivocally to the solid
evidence of global warming, but that too lurks in many people's
minds as the ultimate cause of this summer's parching.
</P>
<P>
   Against such a grand array of forces, it can be hard to imagine
how taking a shorter shower or watering the lawn less frequently
makes a difference. But individual action _ conserving water _ is
the basis for collective action, and collectively, the residents of
drought-stricken states can make an enormous difference in their
own welfare, both now, when stream levels are at record lows, and
in the future, when rain returns.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, of course, are forced to take the weather as it comes,
and they understand just how illusory any sense of expectation
based on what passes for normal really is. Consumers can scale back
water use to the bone with little more than inconvenience. But
farms, like many other forms of industry, require water for
economic survival, which is exactly what is at risk again this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The reserves of water in reservoirs and aquifers have been
steadily diminishing. So have the economic reserves of American
farmers, who find themselves bringing their products to market, if
they survive this dry season at all, at depressed prices. Neither
of these problems, drought or farm income, can be solved with a
sudden flurry of attention.
</P>
<P>
   They require long-term commitment and the changing of habits
that are so persistent we have come to call them normal.

CLINTON FAULTS PROGRAM TO EXPAND HEALTH COVERAGE TO CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: SUBS optional graf in 2nd take to add three other senators

insurance for children.)  (nk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will send federal officials to
all the states to investigate whether they have improperly excluded
people from Medicaid or from a new federal health insurance program
for children, White House officials said Saturday. At the same time
he will try to get schools across the country to help arrange
health coverage for millions of uninsured children.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to announce the efforts on Sunday when he
addresses the 91st annual meeting of the National Governors'
Association in St. Louis. The steps reflect his disappointment at
the way some states have carried out the new health program for
children, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, the officials said, Clinton may take a more
confrontational approach than he usually does in discussions with
the governors, whose policy role he appreciates as a former
governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``States now have an unprecedented opportunity to expand health
coverage, and they should make the most of it,'' said Bruce Reed,
the president's chief domestic policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress created the Children's Health Insurance Program in
1997, it gave the states billions of dollars _ $24 billion over
five years, more than $39 billion over 10 years _ and considerable
flexibility in how the money may be used. In addition, White House
officials noted, states are getting billions more from the
settlement of lawsuits against tobacco companies, money that is
available for children's programs.
</P>
<P>
   But so far only 1.3 million children have been enrolled in the
new health program, the administration says. Clinton said recently
that he would have expected at least 3 million by now, and that he
was therefore ``a little disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also try to enlist the governors in his campaign
against tax and spending policies of the Republican Congress. He
will argue that the tax bill passed this week by Congress would not
only use up all the anticipated surpluses in the federal budget,
but also threaten federal-state programs like welfare, Medicaid,
education and social services, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Confidential White House documents show that Clinton will
instruct the Health Care Financing Administration to ``conduct
comprehensive on-site reviews of state Medicaid enrollment and
eligibility processes'' in all states. Federal officials will
interview state officials and check case files to ``assess
compliance with current laws and develop recommendations for
improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said a major purpose of this audit was ``to find out more
information about what's going on in each state.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, a group of welfare recipients filed suit against
the state of Florida, contending that the state had illegally cut
off their Medicaid benefits when it ended their cash assistance. In
January, a federal district judge ruled that New York City had
improperly denied Medicaid to poor people who failed to comply with
work requirements of the city's welfare program. In Pennsylvania,
32,000 former welfare recipients won reinstatement of Medicaid only
after months of difficult negotiations with state officials.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, federal officials will highlight the best
practices developed by states like Nebraska, Ohio and South
Carolina to enroll eligible children in the new health insurance
program. Federal officials will also publicize the techniques used
by states to insure that people moving from welfare to work get
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, White House officials said, the Education Department
will send letters to 15,700 school superintendents and 27,000
elementary school principals, prodding them to help enroll children
in Medicaid and in the Children's Health Insurance Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``A staggering 11 million American children and teen-agers have
no health insurance,'' said Education Secretary Richard W. Riley on
a new Web site created especially to promote the Administration's
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to school superintendents, Riley says more than 6
million of these children are eligible for Medicaid or the new
health program, but have not enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Uninsured children are more likely to suffer from asthma, ear
infections and vision problems _ ``treatable conditions that
interfere with classroom participation'' _ and they are absent more
often than their peers, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Eligibility criteria for Medicaid and the new child health
program vary from state to state. Medicaid is intended for families
with somewhat lower incomes.
</P>
<P>
   White House documents show that the Clinton administration will
urge schools to take these steps to enroll children in the two
programs:
</P>
<P>
   _ Make enrollment part of the school registration process. Add a
question to school enrollment forms asking whether students have
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use the school lunch application form to see if children are
eligible for subsidized health insurance and even to enroll them in
the health programs. ``Children who are eligible for free and
reduced-price school meals are usually eligible for free or
low-cost health insurance programs'' too, the Education Department
says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disseminate information on children's health insurance at
back-to-school nights, PTA meetings, sports events and school
plays.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure all school employees, including teachers,
principals, school nurses, guidance counselors and coaches, know
about children's health insurance programs, so they can share the
information with students and parents.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also plans to criticize the states for
failing to submit required data on the number of children enrolled
in Medicaid and the new program. In the absence of such data,
federal officials cannot be sure if the programs are succeeding,
and Republicans in Congress are tempted to take back some of the
money earmarked for Medicaid and the children's health program.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting in St. Louis, the governors are expected to
adopt resolutions declaring that Congress should not reduce the
amount of money available to the states for the children's health
program, Medicaid or welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Seven senators deeply involved in creation of the new children's
health program sent a letter this week to Secretary of Health and
Human Services Donna Shalala lamenting ``the lack of reliable
data.'' They said they needed such data ``to evaluate whether we
have made overall progress in reducing the number of uninsured
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter also expressed concern that some states were using
money from the new program to cover children already eligible for
Medicaid, a practice forbidden by the 1997 law.
</P>
<P>
   States have a financial incentive to enroll children in the new
program, rather than in Medicaid, because the federal government
pays a larger share of the costs. Families often prefer the new
program because it carries less of a stigma than Medicaid, which is
widely but inaccurately viewed as something available only to
welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The seven senators who signed the letter to Shalala were William
V. Roth Jr., R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee; Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York, the panel's senior Democrat; Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; John H. Chafee, R-R.I.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah;
James Jeffords, R-Vt.; and John Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also prod the states to guarantee Medicaid coverage
for people who lose welfare benefits. Congress made $500 million
available to the states to help achieve this goal, but so far
states have spent only $39 million, the White House says.
Twenty-nine states will lose eligibility for the money at the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1996, people who received cash assistance were
automatically enrolled in Medicaid. But the 1996 welfare law
severed the link between the programs. Congress provided the $500
million because it assumed that states would incur new
administrative costs in evaluating eligibility for Medicaid and
welfare separately.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says states should use the money to ``conduct
aggressive outreach campaigns,'' to find people eligible for
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also challenge states to expand Medicaid
eligibility by taking advantage of several options authorized by
the 1996 welfare law. States can, for example, provide Medicaid for
many low-income families who no longer qualify for welfare.
</P>
<P>
   People seeking free or low-cost health insurance for children
can obtain information on a toll-free telephone number,
877-KIDS-NOW (877-543-7669) and on the Internet, at
www.insurekidsnow.gov. Another Web site is at www.ed.gov/chip.

   TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. _ Cherry trees, like wealthy vacationers,
are choosy about where they will put down roots.
</P>
<P>
   They prefer the high ground, where warm air rises to protect
their springtime buds from late frosts. Because they hate having
wet feet, they favor sandy soil where water can drain quickly from
their roots.
</P>
<P>
   So they have settled on the scenic rises here in northern
Michigan, where they stand 20 feet apart in acre after acre of
orchards, like soldiers massing across hills.
</P>
<P>
   But they are losing the war to people who covet their land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cherry orchards and other scenic land along the northwest
Michigan shore is definitely under pressure for development into
housing,'' said Daniel J. Wyant, director of the Michigan
Department of Agriculture. ``People and cherries prefer the same
rolling hills and lake views.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan, with 3.12 million bearing-age cherry trees, grows more
cherries than any other state. But 30,000 cherry trees were taken
out last year alone, most of them yanked out by their roots to make
room for retirement or vacation homes.
</P>
<P>
   The well-off who live in the Midwest have summered in this
region for a century, and even now, people from factory workers to
auto executives have dachas here on Lake Michigan or around the
many sparkling inland lakes nearby. They like the relaxed routine,
where farmers at roadside stands charge $2.50 for a bag of fresh
cherries that will stain fingertips red in minutes. By now, they
have filled in most of the shoreline with cottages, and summer
homes have begun crawling up the hills here in view of the lakes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most sublime spots is Old Mission Peninsula, a long
stretch of land poking up into Lake Michigan's Grand Traverse Bay,
so skinny in parts that from high ground there is a view of water
on both sides. For years, that peninsula had the state's largest
concentration of cherry trees, but not anymore. A Presbyterian
missionary who settled in Michigan in 1839 brought the first cherry
trees to the state from Europe, and he started planting them on the
peninsula by 1845.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cherry farmers on the Old Mission Peninsula were wooed by
the real estate developers, and a lot of the prime cherry orchards
that sat on the high ground overlooking both bays were sold and
have been developed into residential areas,'' said M. Ann Hoopfer,
53, the director of the local history museum here, who grew up on a
cherry farm.
</P>
<P>
   Some cherry farmers embrace the changes, some are ambivalent and
some are reluctant to abandon the way of life their families have
known for more than 100 years. Standing on a hill on the peninsula
with a breathtaking lake view, a farmer-turned-Realtor, Robert L.
Underwood, 61, watched a half-million-dollar house rising where a
cherry orchard once stood and defended his decision to sell his
farm with more than 25,000 cherry trees to help develop 89 vacation
homes here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception that farmers or developers are just
raping the land to make money,'' Underwood said. ``You have to look
at the opportunity to provide the people with a nice place to
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice indeed. Each has a view of the lake, and prices range from
$350,000 to $750,000. A silver Mercedes glided by one lot, where
owners are building a tennis court that can be flooded in winter to
make an ice rink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow or other, people forget that farmers are
businessmen,'' Underwood said. His three children have not followed
him into farming, and he is glad northern Michigan has boomed and
provided jobs for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was not for growth in this area,'' he said, ``my kids
would not be able to live here _ they'd be down in Chicago or in
New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Other longtime farmers are concerned that too many orchards are
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 miles south of Underwood, state Sen. George A. McManus
grew enough cherries on his 400-acre farm this summer to fill about
a million pies. He is so concerned that farms are giving way to
houses that he has held eight hearings across the state, where more
than 250 people have testified about the plight of farmers and how
the land should be used.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Michigan grows about three-quarters of the nation's cherries,
and leads the nation's production of tart cherries, the kind used
in baking. The Michigan Agricultural Statistics Service estimates
that this year the tart cherry harvest will reach 192 million
pounds, about 20 percent below the five-year average. The smaller
sweet cherry harvest is expected to be up 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Martha M. Jamieson, 63, has 70 acres of cherries on Old Mission
Peninsula, but half of her land is for sale. ``I feel like I
shouldn't sell it,'' said Mrs. Jamieson, who farmed the land with
her husband until he died four years ago. ``I'm farming alone and
it has been tough.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just farmers who are wistful. Taxpayers on the
peninsula voted to spend nearly $7 million to buy the development
rights to about 3,300 acres of cherry orchards, preserving open
views of Lake Michigan. But that is a small chunk of the cherry
orchards here, and the taxpayers' preservation money has been
spent.
</P>
<P>
   Gary D. Warren, 48, said that his family had grown cherries for
134 years, but that none of his six children wanted to gamble on
cherry farming. Selling out to developers ``is always in the back
of your mind after a bad year like this,'' Warren said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even McManus, sitting at his kitchen table with a plateful of
cherry cookies, has no illusion that his children will follow him
into farming. But he still believes that the cherry farm will
provide for their future _ if they sell the land to developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one subdivision going in at one end of the farm and
another subdivision going in at the other end of the farm,'' he
said, ``so they won't have any problem.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   AYAME, Ivory Coast _ In this quiet lakeside town, far from the
trucks rumbling along the highway south of here, fishermen from
Mali lived peacefully for four decades alongside the local
Ivoirians, trading, mingling and even intermarrying.
</P>
<P>
   Then, over several nights of violence, the Ivoirians set fire to
the fishermen's houses. The Malians fled to Abidjan, the country's
commercial capital on the Atlantic Coast. From there, convoys
carried 2,500 of them 600 miles north to the deserts of Mali, the
landlocked country most of them had never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains here now _ besides the few Malians who dare not
fish, or even identify themselves as non-Ivoirians _ is a fierce
and growing sense of nationalism: Ayame for Ivoirians only. Next on
the expulsion list are migrant plantation workers from Burkina
Faso, warned a group of Ivoirian fishermen paddling back to shore
aboard their pirogues on a recent morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each his turn,'' said Clement Yao, 29, cackling with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming,'' Miniambue Amon, 40, said.
</P>
<P>
   The real reasons behind what occurred in Ayame are still in
dispute a year later, too laden with emotion to yield anything but
a Rashomon-like retelling. But what is clear is that Ayame _ as
well as Sassandra, a coastal town where a similar incident
involving fisherman from Ghana occurred in December _ has become a
touchstone in the debate over national identity.
</P>
<P>
   That identity has a name: ivoirite. Translated from the French,
it means the quality of being Ivoirian; its power derives not from
its definition, which has been left vague, but from the open or
hidden meanings people ascribe to it.
</P>
<P>
   The concept has already become the driving issue in the
presidential elections of next year, crucial elections for West
Africa, where the Ivory Coast has long been a stable and relatively
prosperous nation in a troubled region and the home of investments
from the West.
</P>
<P>
   To its chief supporters, including President Henri Konan Bedie,
ivoirite amounts to a positive form of nationalism that seeks to
unify the country's different ethnic groups around common values,
surely an important goal on a continent where ethnic rivalries
undermine nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``To achieve peacefully the formidable leap between an ethnic
consciousness and a national consciousness, the reference mark of
identity must be strong, and that fixed point is called ivoirite,''
Bedie wrote recently in the Paris-based magazine Jeune Afrique.
</P>
<P>
   Auguste Miremont, the parliamentary leader of the Democratic
Party of the Ivory Coast, the president's party, said ivoirite was
needed because Ivoirians themselves were being marginalized in a
country where at least one- third of the population of 16 million
was born abroad. ``It became necessary for the Ivoirian to be able
to assert his identity, to be able practically to affirm his
existence, which was drowning in an undefined mass,'' Miremont
said.
</P>
<P>
   To its detractors, including the political opposition, ivoirite
is nothing less than an attempt at marginalizing the country's
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a concept inspired by fear, by the rejection of the
other, the rejection of what is different,'' said Aly Coulibaly, a
member of Parliament of the Rally of the Republicans, the main
opposition party. ``It's a concept with the musty smell of
xenophobia that is dangerous for national unity.''
</P>
<P>
   On a continent where political leaders routinely use ethnic
divisions for political gains, the concept of ivoirite has marked
something of a new development: the attempt to forge a national
identity in a country, like so many in Africa, drawn capriciously
by colonial map makers.
</P>
<P>
   The notion also signified a departure from the post-independence
history of the Ivory Coast, whose longtime ruler, President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny, died in 1993. Inspired by genuine feelings of
openness toward fellow Africans and the need for cheap labor,
Houphouet-Boigny had long made it easy for foreigners to come here.
</P>
<P>
   The Malian fishermen gravitated to Ayame, a town of about 11,000
people, four decades ago, after the construction of two
hydroelectric dams changed the flow of the Bia River and created a
propitious lake. The local Ivoirians, who cultivated cocoa and
coffee, did not engage in commercial fishing, said the town's
mayor, Blaise Aka.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, with unemployment running high among Ivoirian
youths, the mayor said he and other officials urged them to take up
commercial fishing and gave them subsidies to get started. The
Malians refused to share the lake with the Ivoirians, Aka said,
citing that as the reason behind the eventual conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was purely an economic problem,'' the mayor said. ``It was
not a problem of ivoirite. We talk of ivoirite in the sense that
one has to be proud to be Ivoirian.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the house of one the few remaining Malians, though, the
residents did not see it that way. The owner, Ibrahim Nabo, 37, sat
in a chair, while two friends sat on carpets and drank hot tea,
telltale signs of difference from the Agni ethnic group dominant in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the conflict between the Ivoirians and Malians, Nabo
at first denied that he was Malian. ``I am Ivoirian! I am
Ivoirian!'' Nabo said, his voice quavering.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that no problems existed between the Ivoirians and
Malians. Then one of his friends, Bocar Toure, said that Nabo's
mother had been so heartbroken that she had gone back to Mali for
good. For decades, the two groups had gotten along here, Toure, 36,
said, but in recent years, the Ivoirians had become intolerant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to be open people,'' Toure said. ``We felt that
there was freedom here. We even admired them.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was that most of the fishermen were eventually taken
to Mali in convoys organized by individual Malians, the Malian
government and the Ivoirian Red Cross. There are no plans for them
to return.
</P>
<P>
   The governing party, perhaps in response to these events, has
recently tried to soften ivoirite's image.
</P>
<P>
   Ivoirite first came to the forefront of political discourse in
the year leading up to the 1995 presidential elections, with stark
talk of who was a ``pure Ivoirian'' and who was only a
``circumstantial Ivoirian.'' The government of Bedie _ who first
became president in 1993 as the head of a party in power since
independence from France in 1960 _ changed the electoral code in
1994 to require that a presidential candidate be born in the Ivory
Coast to parents both born here as well.
</P>
<P>
   The change was clearly intended to frustrate Bedie's main rival,
Alassane D. Ouattara, a former prime minister whose father, the
president said, was born in Burkina Faso. Ouattara, while insisting
that his father was Ivoirian, bowed out of the race and returned to
his job as a deputy director of the International Monetary Fund in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was resurrected last year when Ouattara announced his
intention of returning to the Ivory Coast to contest in the
elections of October 2000. In recent months, the president's party
drummed up the ivoirite campaign to such a peak that when Ouattara
made his long-awaited return here one week ago, and was named the
head of the Rally of the Republicans, the debate over whether he is
a pure Ivoirian dominated the news media completely.
</P>
<P>
   But given the concept's roots in the political battle against
Ouattara, a Muslim northerner, Ivoirians in the north have begun to
feel like targets. Politically so far, the government-controlled
news media have defined the agenda and focused exclusively on
Ouattara's origins. (In 1995, when some journalists questioned
Bedie's roots and wrote that his mother was actually born in Ghana,
the government had them arrested.)
</P>
<P>
   Its energies consumed with responding to this issue, the
opposition news media have barely paid attention to the
government's recent setbacks, including the European Union's
decision to cut off all aid after widespread fraud was discovered
in the Ministry of Health's billing practices.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the fate of Ouattara's candidacy remains unclear. A
nine-member Constitutional Board, whose composition is controlled
by Bedie, is unlikely to rule in favor of Ouattara, who may be
counting on popular support and international pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In Ayame, the two fishermen who had warned that migrants from
Burkina Faso would be expelled next said they believed that
political opportunism and ivoirite were inextricably linked. They
supported it, nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's certain is that we don't want Ouattara,'' Amon said,
citing his Burkina Faso origins. Yao said he wanted a change
because the governing party has held power since independence. But
he said he would vote for Bedie over Ouattara anytime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the PDCI much,'' Yao said of the governing party.
``But when Bedie talks of ivoirite, I agree with him. Ivoirians
first!''

EDITORIAL: THE BUSINESS OF WAR IN AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Aug. 8:
</P>
<P>
   In many African nations, the natural resources that should be
used to feed and educate people are instead being used to destroy
them.
</P>
<P>
   The government and guerrillas in Angola, for example, are
selling the country's oil and diamonds to buy weapons and pay
soldiers in a 30-year civil war that has made the nation perhaps
the most miserable in the world. In Congo and Sierra Leone as well,
natural wealth is fueling catastrophic conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But no warring party can make an arms deal alone. Outside
nations and companies are also profiting. They should be helping
instead to limit the ability of African warlords to sell a
country's patrimony and to block the flow of weapons to Africa's
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Colonialism, which allowed Europe to extract Africa's natural
resources, left behind leaders who exploit gold, diamonds, timber,
oil and even wildlife to benefit their own regional or ethnic
groups _ or their own bank accounts. Several of Africa's wars are
waged partially over control of these resources. Zimbabwe, Uganda
and other nations supporting the government or guerrillas in
Congo's war got involved in part to preserve _ or to grab _ Congo's
mining concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign corporations and mercenaries, often those who had
American or Soviet connections during the Cold War, have also
financed and transported weapons in exchange for mines.
</P>
<P>
   These resources can buy plenty of tanks, guns and missiles,
keeping wars going long after the political rationale is gone.
Loot, not better government, has motivated the psychotically brutal
guerrillas of Sierra Leone. They trade the diamonds they control
for arms through neighboring Liberia, under the sponsorship of
President Charles Taylor, their longtime patron.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Africa's weapons come from Ukraine, Bulgaria and other
former Soviet bloc countries, traded by Western arms dealers using
forged documents. The governments are either unable or unwilling to
stop this. In other wars, weapons are sold openly by Russia and
China.
</P>
<P>
   The world's growing recognition of the role of outsiders,
however, opens a new opportunity to cut these pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the United Nations placed an embargo on the sale of
diamonds controlled by Jonas Savimbi, the Angolan guerrilla leader.
Once backed by Washington and apartheid South Africa, Savimbi lost
his patrons after the Cold War ended and he broke repeated promises
to disarm or respect elections and cease-fires. But diamonds have
brought him more than $3 billion in the last eight years, according
to a new U.N. report.
</P>
<P>
   The embargo has been ineffective. De Beers, the diamond giant,
denies that it violates the embargo, but many independent experts
dispute this. The United Nations is now seeking ways to strengthen
controls. One proposal backed by Washington would require all
diamonds to have credible certificates of origin.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier, however, to stop a shipment of tanks than one of
diamonds. The former communist nations need pressure and technical
help to crack down on arms sales. But more effective, perhaps,
would be action against the arms smugglers, largely Western
Europeans and Americans. These smugglers are often working within
the laws of their home nations and are almost never prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Washington adopted laws governing American arms traders
abroad, but so far no one has been brought to trial. Such laws, and
the will to enforce them, are important, as Western nations are the
only participants in this global problem with working courts and
the possibility of being shamed into ending their role in Africa's
misery.

SPORTS COLUMN: CELEBRATING THE BROWNS' TRIUMPH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (mk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something wonderful is about to happen in Cleveland, but it
should be celebrated all over North America. A community is
regaining its beloved football team, which it lost through no fault
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Browns, the real thing, are rising from the ashes
of ownership greed and disloyalty. The team played its last game in
December 1995, and then the material goods of the franchise were
hauled to a new home in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, against all precedents, the National Football
League agreed that the nickname, the colors, the uniform, the
statistics, the very memories, belonged to the people alongside
Lake Erie. Now that team has been resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to know how much the new stadium cost, but I am
positive the burghers of Cleveland would never have raised that
much money for the frayed city school system. The economists who
make sense to me claim that most jobs from a football team are
selling peanuts eight home games a year.
</P>
<P>
   However, the gates will soon open in downtown Cleveland, and at
the very least, a man named Art Modell was not allowed to
expropriate the history of a franchise, and that is something to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the real Cleveland Browns will play an exhibition
game at the National Hall of Fame in Canton in the state of Ohio.
On Aug. 21 the real Cleveland Browns will play their first home
exhibition in the new stadium in downtown Cleveland. And on Sept.
12 the real Cleveland Browns will play their first league game at
home against their old Rust Belt rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   These milestone games reflect the persistence of dogged,
faithful people in Cleveland, but the victory is not local. It
speaks to every city that ever loved and lost a team.
</P>
<P>
   This victory does not mean Monte Irvin and Whitey Lockman are
going to magically resume hitting baseballs in the shadow of
Coogan's Bluff. (Go look it up on some search engine, kid.) But it
does mean that fans everywhere now have an example of the good name
of their team being left behind when the moving van chugs into the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Leading rusher, Baltimore Ravens, Jim Brown, 12,312 career
yards. Huh? I'd like to see somebody try telling that to Brown
himself. But Paul Tagliabue, the commissioner of the NFL, made sure
Modell could not ransack Marion Motley and Lou Groza along with the
current players.
</P>
<P>
   This great triumph by the fans of Cleveland came too late to
save the name Dodgers from being trundled off by the O'Malley clan.
If there is any justice in the world, the team visiting Shea
Stadium in New York Sunday afternoon should be called the Los
Angeles Diggers, in honor of the team's Australian owner, rather
than a hallowed Brooklyn nickname.
</P>
<P>
   The great nicknames, the histories both grand and modest, await
their rightful claimants, the way the Cherokee nation can be heard
chanting along the Trail of Tears, if you are quiet and listen
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   When the hockey team in the Canadian capital of Ottawa ceased
operation in 1934, no other National Hockey League team had the
gall to use its nickname until an expansion team was plunked back
in Ottawa in 1992, appropriately renamed the Senators.
</P>
<P>
   Who is to say that heroes like Walter Johnson and noble managers
like Gil Hodges and Ted Williams could not be recalled with a third
Washington Senators?
</P>
<P>
   The predators took a vibrant hockey franchise from Quebec City
to Colorado, but maybe that lovely name Nordiques will once again
be trilled on a crisp winter night in La Belle Province.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams are just dead and gone, the victims of westward
migration, the new demographics. St. Louis Browns. Providence
Steamrollers. Hartford Whalers. The spiritual heritage of the
Syracuse Nationals _ the crew cuts and tiny satin shorts and
fisticuffs and the deadeye one-handed set shot of Dolph Schayes _
still belongs to the tiny Snow Belt city.
</P>
<P>
   There were legal reasons they couldn't, but I am convinced the
new Major League Soccer franchise in the Meadowlands in East
Rutherford, N.J., would have resonated far better with fans if the
team had been named the Cosmos, after that brief dynasty of Pele
and Beckenbauer. Instead, they were forced to go with the clumsy
name MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be realistic. The victory of the Cleveland Browns will not
bring Johnny Unitas back to Baltimore or Roy Campanella back to
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But all of us who had our teams taken away from us can rejoice
when the familiar brown-orange-and-white uniforms soon become
saturated in good old-fashioned Great Lakes mud and snow. The
people of Cleveland have won one for all of us.

EDITORIAL: ALBANY'S LAST-MINUTE LABORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Aug. 8:
</P>
<P>
   Although Gov. George Pataki and the New York Legislature tied
the record for the latest budget in Albany's history, the $73.3
billion package negotiated last week is cause for at least modest
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature resisted the urge to spend last year's $1.8
billion surplus, saving it instead to cover the cost of previously
enacted tax cuts. It wisely restored cuts the governor had proposed
in Medicaid, tuition aid for low-income students and
prekindergarten classes. At Pataki's request, legislators approved
$839 million for child care for working mothers. With increases for
school construction and remedial programs, it becomes clear that
children and mothers did well this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature was nearly as judicious in dealing with crime
and dangerous behavior. It unfortunately left the counterproductive
Rockefeller drug laws on the books, but it agreed on an important
bill to ensure safe access to abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful measure would make stalking a crime, while yet
another, known as Kendra's Law, would allow a doctor or family
member to get a court order to compel a mentally ill person to get
treatment. The law was named for Kendra Webdale, who was killed
when a former mental patient shoved her onto New York City's subway
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   But the usual last-minute frenzy to agree on numbers left a lot
of other important business on the sidelines. There was no action,
for example, on campaign finance reform and no effort to improve
the state's ridiculously porous lobbying laws. Once again, the
Senate failed to address the issue of hate crimes. All these issues
need addressing in the special session scheduled for this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the Legislature distinguish itself on environmental
matters, a signature issue for the governor. It finally unraveled a
jurisdictional mess that has blocked the construction of new power
plants in the state, but it brushed off pleas from
environmentalists to impose new pollution controls on older,
dirtier plants and to revive the state's once-robust energy
conservation program.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Assembly and the Senate passed laws preventing New York
power plants from selling their excess pollution credits to
coal-fired Midwestern power plants whose wind-borne pollutants are
a major cause of acid rain in the Adirondacks. But a ridiculous
turf war prevented the two chambers from reconciling their modest
differences.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers did, however, grant themselves an increase in
their per diem pay.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE GUY WHO COULD   HAVE BEEN MCGWIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sports highlights came on, featuring Mark McGwire reaching
another statistical milestone and Darryl Strawberry making another
sobering comeback. McGwire hit his 500th home run Thursday night,
an achievement Strawberry would have long since reached had he not
become baseball's home office for waste.
</P>
<P>
   From the time he joined the Mets in 1983, Strawberry hit 280
home runs over nine baseball seasons that were nothing like the
homer happy years to come. Over the last seven and two-thirds
seasons, marred by illness, injury and mostly insult to himself,
Strawberry has hit the grand total of 52 in the puny sum of 961
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   In this decade when baseball developed a clear entrepreneurial
strategy to juice up the game, marketing the long ball, is it
unreasonable to wonder if Darryl Strawberry would have made his own
run at Maris had he not let his career go to drink and drugs?
</P>
<P>
   I will leave the projections of exactly how many more home runs
he would have hit to the capable people at the Elias Sports Bureau
and just say this: A lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had all the talent and ability in the world, but I'll never
know what I might have achieved with it,'' Strawberry once told me,
probably in 1995, when the Yankees rescued him from baseball's
phantom zone.
</P>
<P>
   The comebacks have begun to blur, but as far as I'm concerned,
Strawberry can keep coming back, as long as George Steinbrenner
will have him. Strawberry has become one of the easy targets in
sports, a cheap morality tale. The reality is that he is not
America's scourge _ any more than Steve Howe was _ as much as he is
another sad case.
</P>
<P>
   Why are some people so determined to wish or shout the likes of
Strawberry away, to banish the self-destructive and turn them into
the homeless of sports? What is gained by placing a limit on the
number of opportunities for a man who poses little threat to the
welfare of baseball, or anyone, excluding himself and his family?
Is it possible or even beneficial to make professional sports the
clean suburban street it was decades ago, when issues were largely
kept behind family doors?
</P>
<P>
   The industry riddles should all be so easy to crack as the
Strawberry case. I have a much harder time explaining to my own
sons why Latrell Sprewell is such a New York folk hero so soon
after choking his coach and then navigating his car on the
California freeway the way he drives to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Inebriated adults cheering hockey brawls and greedy television
moguls selling garbage like wrestling are more of a threat to your
child's social development than a player who blows millions of
dollars for powder up his nose. For as long as Strawberry puts on
the pinstripes, they will be a reminder of the prison of
professional limitation he has locked himself in, with no way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There goes the guy who could have been McGwire'' would be one
befitting perspective when Strawberry makes his inevitable return
to Yankee Stadium and is trotted out as a part-time left fielder, a
pinch-hitter, a spare part.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is better off when society's ills are hidden in the
closet. Given the facts, I would suspect that most children would
prefer to emulate McGwire's success than Strawberry's failure,
which is why Major League Baseball's procrastination on banning
androstenedione in the face of too many red flags is irresponsible
and indefensible. Bud Selig sure was quick to slap a suspension on
Strawberry, though, to set the ``right'' example.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, before anyone knew what andro was, John Lucas was
already talking about how the sports drug culture had perceptibly
shifted, from the recreational street plague to the problem of
enhancement. The former basketball star, a recovering addict who
later became a counselor and coach, told me that sports teams still
bring him in, expecting and preferring the standby just-say-no
speech.
</P>
<P>
   He had moved on to another kind of lecture, though. He knew the
more prevalent dangers were in the pills that are dispensed,
legally and otherwise, to athletes of all ages who embrace the idea
that they are not trapped in the bodies they are born with.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire wanted it both ways: to be the adult who had the right
to take his own risks and the role model who could speak out
against child abuse. In refusing to acknowledge that the two
McGwires were one and the same, he sent the unfortunate message
that was encouraging young people to abuse themselves.
</P>
<P>
   His defenders said androstenedione couldn't help him hit home
runs, but that missed the point. The implication was that McGwire
needed the juice to sustain such a physically demanding pace. He
did the right thing last week, even if he waited four months to
announce he had stopped taking andro, obviously to quiet those who
said the home run record was artificially attained.
</P>
<P>
   At the rate he has been hitting them the last few weeks, McGwire
may go for 75. His legend will be that much greater. Strawberry,
conversely, will belt a few homers in September, maybe a couple
more in the playoffs. The unfulfilled decade will end for him, and
the numbers will speak for themselves. The truth is much worse than
a stadium full of boos.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry is no model, but he does have a role.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The risk of severe thunderstorms will heighten along the Middle
Atlantic Seaboard Sunday afternoon and evening as volatile
ingredients come together ahead of a strong cold front barreling
southeast from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Winds from the west ahead of the front will warm on descent from
the Appalachians, helping to raise temperatures into the 90s from
eastern North Carolina to Delaware and eastern Maryland, with
readings soaring toward 100 degrees in parts of southeast Virginia
eastern North Carolina. In turn, hot, less dense air will lower
barometric pressures, creating a trough of low pressure just east
of the Appalachians. As moist air converges into the trough and
rises, chilly air associated with the Canadian cool front will
arrive aloft, rapidly destabilizing the atmosphere and setting the
stage for clusters of potent thunderstorms. Damaging winds are
possible near storms that become severe.
</P>
<P>
   An area of rain with a few embedded thunderstorms will move
across the Northeast. Gusty winds will accompany storms in some
areas. In the wake of the front, unseasonably cool air will invade
the Great Lakes region. Sunday night, temperatures will fall into
the 40s across northern Michigan and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms with heavy rain will erupt over parts of the
Tennessee Valley, north Alabama and north Georgia as a weak but
effective jet stream disturbance passes overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Hot weather will persist across the southern Plains, with
isolated thunderstorms bringing brief, spotty relief to a few parts
of Texas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Alaskan Connection
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures soared to 90 degrees in northeastern Alaska on
Friday as a warm high pressure system held steady several thousand
feet aloft. Accompanying the high has been a northward bulge in the
jet stream over western Canada. In see-saw fashion, the jet stream
has dipped southeast over eastern Canada and the Northeast,
allowing a parade of cool fronts and attendant jet stream
disturbances to cross the region. In the Northeast, the fronts have
kept humidity low but the disturbances have sparked thunderstorms.
Sunday, another volley of storms will arrive.

 &HT;    Decline of cash crop jeopardizes future
 &HT;    By Staff reports

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Ephraigm Smith is a bear of a man, with big,
meaty hands worn rough, dirt on them that no amount of soap will
remove.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer's hands are his tools, and they show their use.
</P>
<P>
   He comes from a long line of men and women who drew their living
from the land. His ancestors have been in Pitt County since the
mid-1700s, first tapping vast tracts of pine trees for their
valuable turpentine, then cultivating row crops such as cotton and
corn and soybeans on the many acres in the Chicod community.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 56, recalled that cotton was king for a while here, as it
was in much of the southeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   But around the turn of the century, even while farmers worked to
keep weeds out of their crops, a weed was poised to take over the
throne.
</P>
<P>
   King tobacco crept into virtually every aspect of the county's
economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Children followed their parents into the fields, priming,
looping and barning the leaf. Entire families, even those which
didn't have a square foot of land to call their own, made a living
planting and harvesting the crop.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the auctioneer's call lured thousands from the
county's far reaches into warehouses in Greenville and Farmville.
Growers, cash in hand from the morning's sale, patronized local
merchants and often purchased enough supplies to last until the
next tobacco season.
</P>
<P>
   Life was symbiotic: A good year for the tobacco farmer meant a
good year for the merchant, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville itself lived and breathed with the golden leaf.
Whistles from processing plants called the populace to work, sent
them home to lunch, then called them back again.
</P>
<P>
   Through this century, tobacco pumped billions of dollars into
the economy, provided a livelihood for thousands, and shaped and
sustained a way of life. But in the latter portion of the century,
urbanization, increased awareness about tobacco's health effects,
legal sanctions and government regulation chipped away at that
lifestyle. And as Pitt County residents head into the 21st century,
they are left wondering if tobacco will continue to be a force in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Smith stood in an expansive field of tobacco that
announces its various stages of maturity in hues ranging from
chartreuse to dark green. It is an apropos setting as he mulls the
future of the inedible leaf that nourished several generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as raising tobacco,'' Smith lamented after some
thought, ``I wouldn't encourage a young person, with the
uncertainty there is now, to start raising tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   BROKEN DREAMS
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco began to supplant white cotton bolls as the dominant
scenery around the eastern Carolina countryside after farmers
realized that it bested even the profitable cotton as a cash crop _
even though it's expensive to grow and requires about 250 man-hours
of labor per acre.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco has been the mainstay of this family for
generations,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The story of his life, and his family's, is inextricably bound
up in the heavy, broad leaves, he said. They came to symbolize the
chance for prosperity, or at least something more than mere
survival eked out out in the fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tobacco) was all you had,'' Smith said. ``That was the only
game in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Where he grew up, there was no Hardee's or McDonald's where a
school lad could flip burgers and earn cash for clothes and fun
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I got the spending money,'' Smith said of his
tobacco work.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after World War II, ``My daddy still had two
wood-burning (barns),'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody had to monitor the fire around the clock to assure the
temperature was right for curing the green tobacco. From late
grammar school on, Smith was that sentinel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You stayed up all night,'' he said. ``What they did, they made
a bunk at the tobacco barn.'' Every couple of hours he would check
on the barns, catching a few winks of sleep between rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call them the good old days,'' Smith said wryly.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard work, but the cured, golden leaves looked like
greenbacks to the farm families that depended on them, said Smith,
who keeps receipts dating to 1900 from tobacco sold at markets in
Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   But times change.
</P>
<P>
   A study by James W. Kleckley, an economist and associate
director for Planning and Institutional Research at East Carolina
University, shows tobacco accounted for about 8 percent of the
county's economy in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, farming of tobacco was probably 20 percent
or more of the economy,'' he said. ``It's just not as important as
it once was in Pitt County.''
</P>
<P>
   Social mores have exerted downward pressure on tobacco's
cultural and economic influence, said Mitch Smith, director of the
Pitt County Agricultural Extension office.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon general's warning that began appearing on cigarette
packs in 1969 ``played a part in it,'' Smith said. ``The
anti-smoking sentiment definitely takes a toll.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to find someone who isn't aware of the
links between tobacco use and diseases such as cancer and
emphysema, said Dr. John Morrow, director of the Pitt County Public
Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, generally, they're certainly more aware of the health
effects of tobacco,'' Morrow said. ``I think that has contributed
to decreased use.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitt County Board of Commissioners Chairman Eugene James,
himself a tobacco scion, decries those who would enforce their
anti-smoking opinion on others through legislation and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people that produce it, like myself, they know that's
freedom of choice,'' he said. Even if the leaf is driven out of
Pitt County, North Carolina or the United States, the lure of
tobacco will persist, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's grown in Pitt County or Brazil, it's going to be
grown,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   Court decisions related to tobacco's health effects have taken a
bite out of the industry as well.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes went up about 45 cents a pack at most stores earlier
this year as a result of tobacco companies marking up wholesale
prices to offset their $206 billion settlement with 46 states,
including North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The leaf's status is even threatened from overseas by exporting
countries as divergent as Brazil and Zimbabwe where environmental
standards and wages are both lower than in the United States, Mitch
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Brazil is the No. 1 exporter of tobacco, which it sells
for 40 cents a pound _ about what the leaf brought here in the
mid-1940s, before adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Though the quality of the tobacco does not match the American
product, the Brazilian variety is rapidly improving, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Instability in Asia and the Pacific Rim, where many of U.S.
tobacco's customers are located, is snuffing the lit end of the
export cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of (the tobacco production) is happening in developing
countries that can't purchase the U.S.'s top cigarette,'' while
they export them like crazy, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   A phenomenon called ``agricultural illiteracy'' also hurts
tobacco, Smith said. As an area like Pitt County becomes more
urban, the average resident's connection to agricultural production
falls, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, people don't realize Pitt is a top 10 county in
North Carolina for cash farm receipts and No. 4 in terms of row
crop production, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention No. 1 in tobacco, Smith said. ``You don't have
the public support for it you once had.''
</P>
<P>
   A WAY OF LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the years since it was first cultivated in Pitt
County, tobacco has paid many a bill for residents. Its influence
is visible almost everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The seal of the city of Greenville bears the image of a tobacco
leaf, and so does the seal that hangs on the wall behind the Pitt
County Board of Commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   That board's chairman, James, 75, grew up on a tobacco farm and
still owns tobacco-producing land.
</P>
<P>
   James recalls the sentiment expressed by his son, Paul: ``He
said, 'Daddy, tobacco sent me to school.''' Paul James is now a
physician who serves as director of rural health for the State
University of New York at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question about that, he paid his way through
college (with tobacco),'' his father said. ``He worked in tobacco
up until he went to medical school.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitt County families and neighbors came together to plant, tend,
harvest and sell the leaf. It was more than a plant: It was a
lifeline grasped by the community's collective hand.
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications extended off the farm and into the streets of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Wilkerson Sr., 80, former owner of Globe Hardware, grew
up in Greenville on Eighth Street. As a boy in the 1930s, he worked
in a shoe store a few blocks from the tobacco warehouses where the
leaf was sold and the factories where it was processed.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson recalls the impact tobacco had on the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole economy was built on tobacco,'' he said flatly.
</P>
<P>
   He remembered the smell of the cured gold leaf at the warehouses
on opening day _ the biggest day of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing in the world was the opening _ because it
smelled like money,'' Wilkerson said.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, almost all the farmers in the area would charge
their purchases during the year and pay off the bill after selling
their tobacco, Wilkerson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fall, our business would quadruple,'' Wilkerson said.
One tobacco farmer would bring in his children and shoe them all
while in town auctioning off his cured leaf, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Wilkerson Jr., 45, took over the Fifth Street hardware
store from his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of petered out since I've been working here, even in
20 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back before the son took over from his father, merchants would
display their wares on the sidewalks the day the tobacco markets
opened, hoping to snag some of the cash floating around town.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell, back when I was a kid, it was like that, in
the '50s and '60s,'' Wilkerson Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   Again, times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's entirely different. We're not even dependent on it
anymore,'' his father said of the tobacco money.
</P>
<P>
   END OF AN ERA
</P>
<P>
   The elder Wilkerson does not foresee a return to tobacco's salad
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any possible future for it,'' he said. Tobacco's
prominence as a thread in the county's cultural and economic
fabric, he said, has been badly undermined ``by all these lawsuits
_ billions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Even North Carolina, the largest producer of tobacco in the
world, is part of the problem now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got our hands out too. We want our share,''
Wilkerson said.
</P>
<P>
   James' view was a little more sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is that Pitt County will continue to produce
tobacco,'' he said. ``It's part of our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged the changes that have taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitt County has left the rural area and gone to the urban,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Kleckley called the change in economic forces ``the
natural evolution of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the leaf's current tenuous position, a diversified
economic base, founded on industries other than tobacco processing,
``saved our lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as much as tobacco getting smaller, but everything is
growing up around us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said East Carolina University, its medical school and
associated businesses account for the largest economic force now
``without a doubt _ no contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the higher education institutions and burgeoning medical
community, manufacturing industries play an increasing role, and
Greenville has over the years become a regional hub for retail
sales, Kleckley said.
</P>
<P>
   The 8 percent that tobacco contributed to the money pie is about
what the old Burroughs-Wellcome pharmaceutical plant accounted for
at the time of Kleckley's study, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of (tobacco) driving the Pitt County economy, it
hasn't happened for a while,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ephraigm Smith said the field hands that growers used to rely on
have left the farm life for work in factories.
</P>
<P>
   Migrant Hispanics have taken their place _ further distancing
native Pitt Countians from tobacco's cultural influence.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, he said finally, about 10 tobacco farmers
lived in his neighborhood; there's probably not more than two or
three now.
</P>
<P>
   In years to come, as tobacco continues to shrink as a proportion
of the economic pie, the most visible link to that part of the
county's past might be silent monuments preserved for future
generations, like Greenville's block of the five erstwhile tobacco
warehouses and processing plants that have been relegated to
service on the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Taylor, 70, recalled Greenville back when the railroad
overpass on Charles Boulevard marked the city's southern limit.
</P>
<P>
   These factories, where the tobacco was processed and put in
hogsheads for shipping, were a focal point of the city.
</P>
<P>
   A whistle would sound telling workers to come to work, leave for
lunch and head home at quitting time.
</P>
<P>
   ``No bigger than the town was, you could hear them all over the
town,'' said Taylor, former managing editor of The Daily Reflector.
</P>
<P>
   Each whistle had a different sound, he recalled, and some people
could pick out which factory was calling.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, like so many others, is clear about the leaf's role in
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first place, I doubt I'd have gone to college at all
without that tobacco money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the handwriting is on the barn wall, Taylor says he is
not saddened by the crop's diminishing role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just accept change,'' he said, ``and I don't know that
tobacco's going to disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   THE ERA AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   Though the weed has lost some of its clout, Mitch Smith is quick
to point out that Pitt is still the largest tobacco-producing
county in the world, with nearly 32 million pounds harvested here
last season on 13,384 acres. At an average price of $1.77 per
pound, the commodity had a value of more than $53.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the federal allotment or ``quota,'' the amount of tobacco
that farmers can grow based on consumer demands projected by
tobacco companies, has been cut by about a third over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will cost our producers about $9 million,'' Smith said.
That effect can be doubled to $18 million for the total impact on
the Pitt County economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a pared down 11,182 acres will bring the tobacco
forth.
</P>
<P>
   Ephraigm Smith has 40 acres dedicated to tobacco this season,
down 55 from previous years.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of tobacco allotted for Pitt County this year is
worth $45,214,119, down from $53,669,940 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, if momentum is up in other sectors of the economy,
the area may not notice tobacco's effect, said John Chaffee,
executive director of the Pitt County Development Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Price supports, which guarantee a minimum price per pound, have
kept tobacco income stable since the 1930s and helped make it the
most dependable cash crop for many farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Other crops likely won't ever supplant tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton is down to about 47 cents per pound and soybeans fetch $4
a bushel, Ephraigm Smith said. ``They won't take the place of
tobacco,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pitt County Cooperative Extension Service, in
terms of economic returns, it would take seven acres of cotton to
replace one acre of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Smith said he does not expect the quota to continue its
decline. He believes as economies in Asia and elsewhere stabilize,
demand for the leaf should increase again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation is there will be some rebound in the years to
come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rebound or not, Ephraigm Smith plans on hanging in for a while
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 56 years old,'' he said. ``I'll probably give tobacco a
few more years ...''
</P>
<P>
   But that desire, perhaps sustained in large measure through
inertia imparted by his tobacco legacy, doesn't extend to his son,
Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991, I kind of saw the handwriting on the wall, and I put
in four hog houses,'' Smith said. His son tends to the swine during
breaks from his studies at N.C. State University, where he's
earning a degree in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   True to his farm roots, the younger Smith likes husbanding the
hogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can't see him raising tobacco,'' his father said.
</P>
<P>
   Though his son might be the first generation to eschew the
tobacco, Smith isn't terribly disappointed by that development.
However, he admits to being a little disheartened, not only because
his son might step out of his father's footsteps, but for the
generations of farmers across the county who are watching a
lifestyle fade into the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad for any kind of small farm,'' he said.

   IOWA-BIKE _ IOWA CITY, Iowa _ After spending seven days riding a
bicycle 550 miles through 61 small towns, we take a look at the
folks who are deciding the fate of the presidential candidates. For
months hey have been part of an intensive campaign which for some
candidates could come to end on Aug. 14 during the Ames, Iowa straw
ballot. This event has become so important that George Bush paid
$46,000 to rent the best piece of lawn outside the hall where the
voting takes place. Candidates may love Floridians for their cash
but it's Iowa's small town voters who may stop some of them from
ever getting their campaigns to Florida. (Crowley, Palm Beach

   BISCAYNE _ MIAMI _ For 50 years, it was Miami's gateway: a broad
boulevard lined with neon, palms and Mom-and-Pop motels that
welcomed visitors to sun-splashed Miami. Then came the freeway.
When Interstate 95 opened in the 1960s, visitors whisked into town
at 60 mph, 20-feet up in the air. As in so many American cities,
the elevated highway overnight changed the look and feel of Miami.
Biscayne Boulevard, long the city's proud route of entry, began a
30-year decline. Cozy motels once packed with family station wagons
became crack dens and flop houses. Customers disappeared from shops
and restaurants, while block-long stretches fell into urban decay,
with boarded-up buildings marred by graffiti. Hookers became more
prevalent than tourists. As recently as last winter, it was on
Biscayne that cops running a prostitution sting snared an Atlanta
Falcons player the night before the Super Bowl. Now, however,
almost miraculously, Biscayne Boulevard is making a comeback. The
redevelopment boom that swept over nearby South Beach in the past
decade has jumped Biscayne Bay and is working its way up a 50-block
stretch of Biscayne Boulevard. (MWilliams, Atlanta

SPAIN SETS NEW LIMITS ON ITS CRUSH OF SMOKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Columbus brought back tobacco from the New World
500 years ago and Spain has been enamored of smoking ever since.
But the government has recently stepped up its effort to change
that situation, and the latest decree bans smoking on all
commercial flights and intercity buses.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is enforcement. Ever since King Philip III
ordered a temporary halt to tobacco growing in the Spanish colonies
in 1606, Spaniards have found a way to get around the rules
regarding tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke-free zones in offices, banks and restaurants are
frequently ignored by Spaniards, many of whom prefer the pungent
dark tobacco cigarettes. Smoking in elevators, against the law, is
not uncommon and there is even smoking in prohibited zones in
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The application of the legislation has to have a certain
tolerance,'' said Juan Jose Francisco Polledo, director general of
Public Health. ``Spaniards are very strong willed and it's not good
to provoke them.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, he said, should not get too far ahead of society
when legislating behavior, but he thinks the restrictions are
starting to pay off. The rate has declined slightly in the past
decade, to 35.7 percent of those 16 and over, still among the
highest in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some key groups are kicking the habit, like Spanish doctors.
Nearly 50 percent of them smoked in the late 1980s; now the
percentage has dipped below the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Spain did not ban cigarette ads on television and require health
warnings on cigarette packs until 1988, about two decades after
similar measures in the United States. But authorities have seen a
change in attitudes here ever since 1995, when Pedro Perez _ then
chairman of Spain's largest tobacco company, Tabacalera _ provoked
an uproar by claiming that smoking in moderation had health
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the information that smoking is harmful,'' said Maria
Angeles Planchuelo, of the Spanish Association Against Cancer.
``The awareness to quit smoking is coming little by little. Parents
who smoke are now trying to stop their kids from smoking. A few
years ago, they didn't mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus companies and airlines expect few problems in enforcing
the new bans, which are to begin this autumn. Since 1988, intercity
buses have been required to provide separate seating for smokers
and nonsmokers, and since 1992, smoking has been prohibited on
domestic flights of less than 90 minutes, which is most of the
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But reducing the smoke in offices and public buildings seems a
long way off.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a business caters to the public, it fears losing clients if
it insists that they not smoke on the premises,'' Ms. Planchuelo
said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The contradictions are apparent at a downtown branch of the Caja
Madrid savings bank, on Acala Street. There is one prominent
no-smoking sign and six ashtrays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always smoked, and no one here tells me not to,'' said
Nuria Hernandez, 28, who was doing some banking while puffing on a
Fortuna cigarette. ``It's full of ashtrays.''
</P>
<P>
   A bank employee said that half of the branch's staff smokes on
the job.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away at Madrid's ornate main post office, there are
20 no-smoking signs on the main floor, and 20 ashtray receptacles,
many of them right beneath the signs that depict a burning
cigarette crossed out by a bright red line.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Spain collected $5.5 billion in cigarette taxes last year, but
the financially strapped state-run national health service has
found that smokers are hospitalized at nearly twice the rate of
nonsmokers. Its statistics showed that in 1994, for example,
chronic lung disease, only one of the more than 25 illnesses linked
to tobacco, cost the public health system more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some 46,000 Spaniards die annually from smoking-related cancer,
considered the leading preventable cause of death in Spain. The
first wrongful-death lawsuit against Tabacalera, once a state-owned
company but now largely private, was filed last year.

FOR THE POOR, WATER IS UNSAFE AND YET COSTLY, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The poorest people in the world are paying many
times more than their richer compatriots for the water they need to
live, and are getting more than their share of deadly diseases
because supplies are dangerously contaminated, an international
panel of experts concluded last week.
</P>
<P>
   The reason may be that the price of water is kept artificially
low by government subsidies, making the water systems inefficient
and unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   Such systems, then, simply bypass the poor, who in desperation
turn to private water carriers. The private providers may charge up
to 100 times the municipal rates for water of very dubious quality,
in which diarrheal diseases and other infectious diseases thrive.
The cheaper, subsidized water then flows to better, politically
more influential neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Invariably this results in inadequate services, with many of
the rapidly growing poor neighborhoods going without municipal
services,'' said a report published last week by the panel, the
World Commission on Water for the 21st Century, which is supported
by U.N. agencies, a number of governments and the Ford Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail Serageldin, a vice president of the World Bank and
chairman of the water commission, said in an interview that in some
cases the poorest families spend as much as 30 percent of their
income on water. ``Yet subsidies are defended in the name of the
poor,'' he added. ``This perverse situation has got to be
tackled.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that an end to subsidies and a system of graduated
fees use may be the solution. Under such a system, fees could be
based on water use. ``The poor always use less water than the
rich,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Water systems in developing countries are often inefficient,
losing as much as 40 percent to 60 percent of available water in
the process of providing municipal services and raising costs,
Serageldin said. By contrast, he added, a city like Singapore, with
well-maintained facilities, has a waste rate of only 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report, the culmination of a year of research,
compared prices of water in European cities with those in the
developing world and found that in richer countries people
generally paid many times more for piped water than what their
middle-class or richer counterparts pay in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Germans, for example, pay $2.16 for a cubic meter of water; in
Ireland 61 cents. In Jakarta, Indonesia, the charge would be 9
cents, and in Pakistan, a city dweller, however rich, pays 6 cents
to 10 cents per cubic meter. Good water services cannot be provided
at those prices, Serageldin said, adding that cities in the third
world may need to contract out parts of the system to private
investors, including community development groups that have been
springing up in many developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of creative ways of involving the community
and the private sector,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Indonesia, one such project, called the Kampung Improvement
Program, has helped people cover open drains for sanitation and
install standpipes that each bring reasonably clean water to every
three or four families. In Pakistan, the Orangi Pilot Project has
reached 650,000 people in a poor neighborhood of Karachi, the
largest city.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't need a flush toilet in every home or a faucet in
every room,'' Serageldin. ``But with a standpipe for every three
units, with adequate pit latrines and other forms of treatment, the
services can be there and the health of the children can be
maintained.''

   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Melissa Margetts will never forget the

released into the wild last December.
</P>
<P>
   Margetts is a modern day Dr. Doolittle meets MacGyver.
</P>
<P>
   Take the time she rescued a baby porcupine from its mother's
womb using only her Swiss Army knife, cinnamon dental floss and a
little ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first C-section,'' Margetts said. ``I got the uterus
out and opened it up and got the baby out. The placenta was
attached to it and I thought with a human baby you tie off the
umbilical cord so they don't bleed to death, so I had cinnamon
dental floss in the car, and I thought, what the heck.''
</P>
<P>
   The baby, dubbed Stickers, was featured on a National Geographic
Explorer television special with Boyd Matson.
</P>
<P>
   Margetts, 43, is the brainchild behind the Rocky Mountain Ark
Wildlife Rehabilitation Center hidden away on a 14-acre spread high
in the San Juan Mountains near Telluride. She jokingly refers to
her wildlife refuge as the ``Damn Nice Ranch'' because that's what
she said to herself when she spied the rugged plot of land located
off of a dirt Forest Service access road.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Margetts has rescued thousands of wild and
domestic animals, which has garnered her the title ``Animal Lady''
with the locals.
</P>
<P>
   Current residents include, Spike, an African-crested porcupine;
Wyle E. Coyote; a homeless donkey dubbed Jackson Browne; Elvis the
mutt; and a sassy exotic parrot named Diego, who seems to have
picked up a bit of office lingo from his previous owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right!'' screeches the brilliant blue and yellow bird from his
perch next to the deck.
</P>
<P>
   It's just after 10 a.m. and Margetts and an intern, Ann Allen,
make the usual feeding rounds _ which take place every four hours
around the clock _ armed with containers of mealworms for the
birds, a bucket of milk for the fawns, and roadkill for Ruby the
mountain lion. Elvis and Jackson Browne trail behind for company,
occasionally chasing each other. It seems one of them has forgotten
that he is a donkey.
</P>
<P>
   A typical season at the Ark produces as many as 150 animals,
many considered hard luck cases after tangling with the most
dangerous creature of all _ humans.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with Chaos, a great-horned owl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This couple was driving from California to their home in
Arizona,'' begins Margetts, as Chaos listens perched on her gloved
arm. ``They were driving at night and they hit him and thought he
was just stunned. They put him in a box and kept him overnight
while they continued to drive and their dog got into the box and
totally mangled him. The dog tore off his left foot and it was
hanging by a thread and his left wing was dangling. They put him
back in the box and thought he would be dead and continued to drive
to Arizona. He was still alive when they got there, so they thought
the most peaceful way to die was when you freeze to death. They
stuck him in the freezer and left him there for 30 hours and when
they checked on him, he was still alive. They finally called the
sheriff's department and asked what to do. The sheriff's department
picked him up and took him to Liberty Wildlife where his left wing
was amputated and his left foot was sewn back on. This was good
intentions really gone awry.''
</P>
<P>
   Margetts is a woman on a mission. She's on call 24 hours a day
and can often be found behind the wheel of her green and white
critter mobile fashioned from an old ambulance, picking up wounded
animals and bringing them back to the Ark for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary goal is wildlife rehab and reintroduction into the
wild,'' she said. ``All we are is a second chance for these guys to
be free. There's no guarantee. They die in the wild all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   With just barely a 63 percent survival rate, many of Margetts
animals are too critically wounded to survive and must be
euthanized. Those that make it are released back into the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``The animals that I get attached to are the ones that I don't
think are going to make it,'' said Margetts. ``I am down at the
incubator at 2 o'clock in the morning and I've got my fingers
crossed and I am prepping myself for the idea that this animal is
more than likely going to be dead. Those are the ones that bring
tears to your eyes when it finally comes time to open up the box
and you see them tear across the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Animals that are maimed or unable to survive in the wild for
various reasons are retained for education programs at schools and
national parks for both children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can plant a seed in one kid, you never know what kind
of a difference they will make,'' said Margetts. ``If you inspire
one kid not to throw that plastic six-pack container in a bag
without cutting it up and he tells his son who becomes a school
teacher and tells more kids _ you never know how it is going to
steamroll.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her education programs, Margetts has been
featured in People magazine for her pet lending library, believed
to be the only one of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
   For five bucks, kids can get a library card and check out a
plethora of pets, including chinchillas, rabbits, guinea pigs,
hamsters, snakes, birds, pygmy goats _ even a tarantula spider in a
locked viewing box.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my favorite animal in the pet lending library,'' said
Margetts, while holding up what appears to be a gigantic New York
sewer rat. ``This is Howard Stern.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ark is also part of the International Placement Program
where animals are placed from all over the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   That's how she acquired a webbed-footed beaver named Wally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came from Montreal, Canada, and his dam had been blown
up,'' Margetts said. ``The parents were killed and the two babies
floated to the surface. A couple brought the babies home and they
tried to feed them but didn't do it properly, so they got metabolic
bone disease which caused their legs to break. They were taken to a
zoo, but the zoo didn't want them, so they were put on the
placement program list.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruby, a sleek mountain lion with haunting green eyes, was
rescued when she was just 10 days old from a fur farm in Iowa where
she was going to be used as a lab animal for nutrition experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love her, she is part of my family,'' said Margetts, who
once had a finger partially eaten off by a badger and has been
taloned by an eagle. ``She is not in captivity because I want her
to be. She is in captivity because she would be three times as
dangerous as one in the wild because she doesn't have any fear of
humans. I don't want anyone left with the idea that it is cool to
go out and get these animals and keep them as pets. They don't make
good pets and they are not happy being pets.''
</P>
<P>
   Margetts uses Ruby in the mountain lion safety classes she
teaches in Colorado, Wyoming and Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, a black bear cub rescued last month, was brought to
Margetts after nearly starving in the wild after her mother was
found dead. Although an exact cause of death could not be
determined, officials with the Division of Wildlife believe the
mother bear was poisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings is scheduled for release in November. That's when
colder temperatures and shorter days will force the young bear cub
into her natural cycle of hibernation. She will be sedated and
taken to a man-made den at an undisclosed location for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Margetts said if Hastings, or any other wild animal, is going to
survive in the wild, it is absolutely critical they have minimal
contact with humans. For that reason, she only goes to the bear
cub's pen when it is necessary to feed and replenish water and
shovel out waste.
</P>
<P>
   Talking is prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to their release into the wild, animals undergo an
intensive ``demanning'' process where Margetts and her volunteer
assistants beat on pots and pans with silverware or bang on the
side of their pens three times a day in an effort to make the
animals afraid of humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not to harass the animals,'' Margetts said, ``but
we want them to have negative human contact. That's the hardest
part of the job. These guys start to follow you around after a
while and you have to start scaring them, banging on pots and pans
and flipping blankets and yelling and screaming. You want them to
run from you every time they see you.''
</P>
<P>
   Margetts' compassion for critters began at an early age while
growing up in Telluride. Her father, a medical doctor, often
doubled as the town vet and would bring home animals for Margetts
and her half dozen brothers and sisters to nurse back to health.
</P>
<P>
   She gleaned much of her medical knowledge from Dr. Dad, who was
known to dissect the chicken before dinner and pointing out things
like tendons and joints to anyone who would listen.
</P>
<P>
   After a short stint in Minnesota as an engineer for Honeywell
designing laser eyepieces for anti-tank weapons, Margetts heard the
call of the wild and followed it back to her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Life hasn't always been easy for the auburn-haired animal lover
who firmly believes that one person can make a difference. She
survived a first marriage to an alcoholic husband which ended in
divorce. In 1992, she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
The cancer went into remission after several bouts of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The quick-witted pied-piper of the animal kingdom uses humor to
deal with life's ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   Like when she married Steve Margetts, 44, a custom home builder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a dog once in his entire life,'' she quips. ``He met me
and I had 67 animals.''
</P>
<P>
   It ended up with Margetts promising to keep the permanent animal
head count to under 50 and Steve buying a lifetime supply of
Benedryl.
</P>
<P>
   To seal the deal, Margetts turned to her new husband and said,
``I thought you'd bring me flowers,'' to which Steve replied, ``I
brought you road kill instead.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't kidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in the door and said, 'You've got to see what I
brought home for you,''' Margetts said. ``This man had gotten out
of his truck and dragged a big, bloody, nasty roadkill into the
back of his truck _ it was something I would have left. He was so
proud of himself, then he made me wipe the blood off his shoes and
get out there at night with Dawn dishwashing liquid, a broom and a
hose and clean out his truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Margetts is never short on animal stories. She remembers the
time a woman offered her $20 and told her to go to the grocery
store after she spotted Margetts tugging on a dead animal carcass
she was attempting to bring home to her animals.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time she yelled at her son Jake to put his
toys away only to find out later that he had put his toys away
before going to bed and it was the baby beaver who was dragging
them back out at night in an attempt to build a dam across the
doorway.
</P>
<P>
   Margetts and her husband Steve once trapped an out-of-control
badger inside a Rubbermaid container. Taz, as the badger was
affectionately called, was making horrible noises and the container
was flipping all over the place as the two struggled to keep it
intact. It was then that Steve turned to Margetts and said with a
straight face, ``Don't you wish everything was made like
Rubbermaid?''
</P>
<P>
   And she remembers the time a couple gave her a pair of milk
goats but neglected to tell her that they only produced milk if
they got to listen to the country radio station, KKXK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Them's country goats,'' she remembers the man telling her.
</P>
<P>
   Margetts takes a moment to reflect on her life as rain pours
from the dark storm clouds that have gathered overhead near the San
Juan Mountain range. After watching four otters gleefully swimming
in the enclosed otter pond outside her living room window, she
turns and says, ``If I won the lottery, I would still be doing this
on Monday. Even if I didn't have a dime to my name, I'd be doing
this on Monday. It's a fulfillment in my life that I would have a
hard time explaining to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   She just hopes she has many more Mondays. In November 1998,
Margetts cancer returned. She underwent surgery to remove masses
from her pancreas and stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, she has lost 80 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   In an unexplainable role of reversal, it's the animals who are
now keeping Margetts alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe the animals have had more to do with healing
me than I had to do with healing them,'' she said, quietly. ``I
feel that I have made a difference, not only in the lives of
thousands of animals, but also the kids. If I died tomorrow, that
would be perfectly fine with me.''

JUDICIAL WATCH OPENS OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Judicial Watch, the conservative Washington
organization that has filed more than 40 lawsuits against the
Clinton administration and others, seeking evidence of alleged
corruption, has opened its first satellite office in the nation in
a suburb of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the group say they will use the location, in San
Marino, Calif., to handle its litigation stemming from what they
broadly call Chinagate, the involvement of foreign money in the
1996 presidential campaign. Opening the office made sense, they
said, because many of the figures involved in the litigation live
in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch said it also intended to begin monitoring, on a
state level, the performance of judges and judicial ``activism,'' a
term usually used to describe liberal judges who apply the law in
unusual ways. ``We'll try to monitor and provide a balanced report
on what is really going on in the courtroom,'' said Mike Pendleton,
Judicial Watch's lawyer here.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's leaders say they have no political agenda and
are only trying to root out corruption and encourage judges to take
a restrained approach to the law.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats in California see the group as a Republican front.
According to financial statements filed by Judicial Watch, the
organization received $800,000 in grants last year from foundations
controlled by Richard Mellon Scaife, the conservative millionaire
and Clinton critic. In Washington, the group has filed dozens of
lawsuits seeking information on subjects that include the propriety
of the release of FBI files and the selection of Democratic
contributors to participate in overseas trade missions.
</P>
<P>
   News of Judicial Watch's arrival in California has unsettled
some in Democratic legal and political circles. Adam Schiff, a
Democrat who is the chairman of the state Senate judiciary
committee and who recently held hearings on judicial independence
from other branches of government, has expressed concern about how
judges may be affected by Judicial Watch's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff's spokesman, Paul Hubler, said ``Judges shouldn't have to
be looking over their shoulder when they make legal decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he was hired to run Judicial Watch's western office,
Pendleton monitored judicial nominations and appointments for the
Free Congress Foundation, a conservative group that favors a
culture based on Judeo-Christian values.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Klayman, one of the Judicial Watch founders, said the
organization opened the California office because a large number of
its supporters are in the state and because California is at the
forefront of governmental and legal issues. ``It's an important
state when it comes to issues of judicial activism and conduct,''
Klayman said.

SPORTS COLUMN: DID SCURRY CHEAT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world championship was in the balance when Briana Scurry
strode to the goal line on July 10 in the Rose Bowl. The American
goalkeeper had picked out her victim, the third Chinese player to
take a penalty kick in the shootout that would decide the Women's
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one girl _ her body language didn't look very positive,''
Scurry said later. ``It didn't look like she wanted to take it.
She'd been running on the flank and she was tired. I looked up at
her and said, `This one is mine.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was one thing to choose which opponent was most likely to be
weak. It was another thing for Scurry to choose her tactics. By her
own admission, Scurry decided to improve her chances by ignoring
the rules of the penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   In a quick and practiced move, Scurry bolted two steps forward _
in violation of the rule _ and cut off the angle for Liu Ying, her
opponent. With superb reflexes, Scurry then dived to her left and
tipped Liu's shot wide of the goal. That one stop would shortly
give the United States the championship, and newfound fans of
soccer would admit they were teary-eyed watching Scurry's
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the poised goalkeeper has become one of the most
popular of the Yanks, but there has been a minor swell of criticism
that the Americans had to break a rule in order to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen things on the Internet,'' said another goalkeeper,
Mike Ammann of the MetroStars of Major League Soccer. ``People are
saying, `Wow, Briana Scurry cheated.' But they don't understand
that part of the game. What Briana did was perfectly normal. She
took a step and the referee didn't call it. I don't call that
cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry is on vacation, and chose not to come to the phone when
she was called the other day. But her position was staked out soon
after the final game when she told The Los Angeles Times:
``Everybody does it. It's only cheating if you get caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it that simple? Has sport become so intense, so important,
that athletes can justify deviating from the rules? Is there a
difference between gamesmanship and cheating? Golfers are disgraced
if they do not penalize themselves for even an inadvertent nudge of
the ball. Baseball players are suspended if caught doctoring their
equipment. But in between there are a vast number of tactics that
are both technically illegal and widely accepted, even praised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professionalism is not sportsmanship,'' said Chili Davis, a
respected 39-year-old with the New York Yankees who is seen as a
manager in the near future. ``If you don't succeed, you won't be in
your profession for long. In our society, it's not about good or
bad. It's about who's on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're caught roughing up the ball or corking your bat,
that's cheating,'' Davis added. ``But short of that, I would do
anything I could to hit the ball 20 feet farther and help my team
win. I owe it to my teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same way with phantom tags at second base. I accept
that. The infielder leaves it up to the umpire to decide. You take
your chance, and if they call it, you can't whine and moan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Dennis Rodman,'' Davis said, referring to
basketball's finest rebounder, who shoves, holds and taunts
opponents when the three referees are otherwise occupied. ``He's
one of the smartest athletes you'll ever see _ on the court. Most
of what he does is not just rebounding, it's a head game.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposing view is presented by Donna LoPiano, the director of
the Women's Sports Foundation, and a former world-level softball
pitcher as well as the former director of athletics at the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gamesmanship is just another word for cheating,'' LoPiano said
the other day. ``It's one thing for a pitcher to say to a batter,
`Would you like a changeup?' and then you throw a fastball. It's
another thing to see what you can get away with.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was at Texas, LoPiano loved teaching a course called
sports ethics for a master's degree in sports management. ``There
were always two questions everybody got wrong,'' she said. One was
about a swimmer not giving it her best in a qualifying heat. The
other was about committing an intentional foul in the closing
seconds of a basketball game. Both are against the spirit and law
of the sport, LoPiano said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the kind of split-second edge that Scurry sought against
China, LoPiano said: ``It's a perfectly legitimate reaction for the
brain to tell the body when to move. It takes 1/25th of a second to
put your body in motion. I know that because I was a base-stealer
as well as a pitcher. If you react too quickly, that's a foul, not
cheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that any win that comes as a result of a decision
to cheat is tainted,'' LoPiano said. ``It has to be. But not in
some awful way. This is not about Briana Scurry, but it just points
out human frailty.''
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the criticism of the World Cup tactic has come
from Americans who do not follow soccer, and are not familiar with
the widespread pattern of cynical fouls and blatant diving in the
men's game, as well as the beleaguered mind-set of goalkeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people forget is that shooters should score 90 to 95
percent of the time on penalty kicks,'' said Ammann of the
MetroStars. ``Soccer just changed the rule this year allowing us to
move laterally before the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that, many goalkeepers would ``cheat'' to the left or
right before the ball was struck. Now they ``cheat'' going forward,
always trying to gauge how much latitude they have.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, they have plenty. Esse Baharmast, the American who
was chosen to referee several games at the 1998 men's World Cup in
France, is now the director of officials for the U.S. Soccer
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to know is that Briana Scurry is also a
referee,'' Baharmast said the other day. ``She was chosen the best
youth referee in Minnesota in 1989, and she knows the law of the
game, and she also knows how to bend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baharmast said that during the intense physical conditioning and
technical preparation for the 1998 World Cup, he was shown video
examples of offside violations and flagrant fouls, but that
referees were not specifically instructed to crack down on forward
progress by goalkeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule is already there,'' Baharmast said. ``The referees
have all the tools. I don't think players think about cheating. All
they think about is saving the goal. But if they can take a little
advantage, have a little more control, then they do it. The referee
was there, and she did not call anything, so it was not cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   With no electronic assistance in soccer, the Swiss official
relied on her eyes, her experience and her judgment. Probably in
the next year, the world soccer body, FIFA, will pass out some
videos of goalkeepers taking one step over the line. Two things are
certain: Briana Scurry made a brilliant world-level dive to tip the
ball. And the result will stand.

 &HT;    Impact of NAACP boycott doubted by some Myrtle Beach businesses
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. _ Waves wash peacefully under the
weather-worn planks of Pier 14, smack in the middle of the Grand
Strand, the jewel of Palmetto State tourism.
</P>
<P>
   It's just as calm on deck. Cashier Joe Daley sells bait shrimp
for $5.50 in Styrofoam cups, and plastic bottles of water bearing
the NASCAR logo.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours away, a political storm brews at the Statehouse,
where the Confederate battle flag flutters over its penny-colored
dome. In protest, the NAACP threatens an economic boycott of the
state, the last in the country to fly the flag over its capitol.
</P>
<P>
   A $14.5 billion statewide tourist trade hangs in the balance.
The amount includes $6.7 billion spent directly on things like
hotel rooms and food in places like Myrtle Beach.
</P>
<P>
   But so far on the Grand Strand, there's been nary a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's making a lot of waves,'' Daley said after
taking a drag on his Marlboro. ``Most people think the tourists are
going to come regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Charleston, civil rights groups _ including the Southern
Christian Leadership Council based in Atlanta _ already have
canceled conventions. State tourism officials worry that anxious
professional groups will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NAACP officials acknowledged that they have collected
financial information on about a dozen lawmakers who have pushed to
keep the Confederate flag flying. They hinted that they might
advocate boycotts of businesses that have contributed to the
campaigns of those legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Myrtle Beach could become a prime target of the proposed
boycott. It generates $5 billion in tourism spending. That's more
than $1 of every three bucks spent by tourists in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Confederate flag can be a souvenir. Stars and bars
beach towels hang on tourist-shop racks next to cotton prints of
Mickey Mouse, Elvis and the Budweiser logo _ your choice for
$11.99.
</P>
<P>
   Waterfront hotels line Ocean Boulevard. So do tourists who open
their wallets for the dazzling multitude of tie-dyed-shirt shops,
Calabash seafood buffets, mini-marts, driving ranges and kiddie
amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it. That's our business. Tourism,'' said Gloria Sapp,
73, who runs the Ocean Adventures miniature-golf course, where
water the color of Windex splashes over fake rock formations.
</P>
<P>
   The smell of Sapp's microwaved lunch of broccoli and macaroni
and cheese fills her small, wood-paneled attendant's booth. She
sets her food aside as a family of five pays $6 each to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you folks?'' Sapp asks. She's had practice polishing
her tourist-friendly tone. Her family has run a business on this
spot since 1939 _ first a restaurant, then the Carolina Hotel. Out
front, two knee-high lawn jockeys are painted white. Black eyes
poke through like lumps of coal on snowmen.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp shrugs off financial consequences that may follow if the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People national
board endorses the boycott during an October meeting. The NAACP
state conference in Columbia drafted the measure, which calls for
an economic boycott starting Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks don't play that much mini-golf,'' Sapp said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other full-time residents, she retells tales about the
black bikers weekend that comes here every Memorial Day _ something
like Freaknik on Harleys. ``It's a nightmare,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A former fourth-grade teacher, Sapp offers a measured response
to civil rights groups that maintain the Confederate flag stirs up
a history of racial oppression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help what happened a hundred years ago,'' Sapp said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its Charleston counterpart, the Myrtle Beach Convention
Center _ one of the most active in the state _ has lost no business
from the flag flap.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 650,000 people attended conventions in
Myrtle Beach. They booked 167,000 room nights and spent $26.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it's been made an issue here,'' said Paul
Edwards, interim general manager of the city's convention center.
``I don't want to make it sound like I'm turning a deaf ear to it,
but we haven't had any calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a group does call and says we're canceling because of this,
we'd say we're not taking a stand on the flag issue, and we hope
that you see we represent all races.''
</P>
<P>
   The state tourism department is polling regional associations to
see who might respond to the boycott.
</P>
<P>
   As for the throngs of vacationing families piling their Dodge
Caravans full of kids, golf clubs and beach balls, tourism
officials hope the boycott has the same effect as the one eight
years ago in Arizona. There, voters initially refused to approve a
Martin Luther King holiday and a civil rights boycott cost the
state a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But vacationers kept coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``People, when they're looking at their leisure time, don't
really think in terms of political arenas,'' said Moke McGowan,
senior director of marketing for South Carolina's Department of
Parks, Recreation and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   A relative newcomer in the convention business, Charleston has
borne the brunt of early backlash. The National Urban League,
another major civil rights group backing the boycott, canceled its
convention scheduled to be next year in Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of State Democratic Chairs, an organization for
the 50 Democratic state party chairs nationwide, considered
canceling its November meeting in Charleston. Only a request by
Gov. Jim Hodges postponed the vote to cancel. Invited speakers
include Vice President Al Gore and New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley,
both campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few years, the images coming out of South Carolina
do not point to a state that is one of the leaders in terms of the
New South, whether it be the issue of objecting to women attending
The Citadel or whether it be the flag issue,'' said Bill Moore, a
political scientist at the College of Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Myrtle Beach, the smell of cocoa butter sunscreen fills
the lobby of the Breakers resort. Men with overhanging bellies and
women in two-piece bikinis check in at the front desk. General
manager Vernon Brake says he can't help but pay attention to the
boycott threat. As tourism goes, so does his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a businessman, I am greatly concerned about it,'' Brake
said. ``But I don't feel I have much impact on it. We appreciate
all our guests, but I don't feel the approach being taken is the
best way to solve it or get something done.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking down Ocean Boulevard with his camcorder propped on his
shoulder, Everett Wicks is one of the few black tourists in Myrtle
Beach. Blacks account for only seven in every 100 South Carolina
tourists, officials estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, a housekeeping supervisor from Baltimore, Md., said a
boycott might make a small economic dent. But it also might turn
off people who might have weighed the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would stop right there,'' said Wicks, as he and his wife
walked up Pier 14 past a peddler of frozen ice treats. ``It's like
drawing a line in the sand. People still like coming to South
Carolina to visit. People have a right to hear what the issues are.
If someone's already decided to have a boycott, nobody will
listen.''
</P>
<P>
   But some people are. One of them is Ashby Ward, CEO of the
Myrtle Beach Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   There's wariness in town, he said. Ward notes that the NAACP
resolution calls not only for black people to avoid South Carolina
but for all people to stay away till the Confederate flag comes
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably erroneous to think that this would just cost us
some black vacationers,'' Ward said. ``It could cost us more than
that.

BRAVES ARE BEHIND BUT NOT READY TO CONCEDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How quickly they forget.
</P>
<P>
   The operator answers the telephone at Turner Field, and the
caller asks for John Schuerholz.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the name, please?''
</P>
<P>
   The caller repeats the name, and he is disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   He calls a second time, again asks for John Schuerholz. This
time he gets the line of Jim Schultz, the Atlanta Braves' public
relations director.
</P>
<P>
   They sure are spoiled in Atlanta. Fall out of first place, slip
a couple of games back in the standing, and the man who designed
the championship team of the '90s becomes a nonperson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lasted only eight years,'' Schuerholz said. ``Fame is
fleeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will find out in the next eight weeks how fleeting
their dominance of their division is. They have won seven
successive titles and appeared to be well on their way to No. 8
until their own injuries and the New York Mets got in the way.
</P>
<P>
   When they entered the weekend in second place, the Braves found
themselves behind another team this late in the season for the
first time since 1994, a season that didn't interrupt the Braves'
title run because it was never finished. In the intervening four
seasons, the Braves were out of first place, going forward, no
later than July 3, May 18, April 12 and April 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no coronations in this business,'' Schuerholz said.
``Even though we've had a great run, there's nobody at the
beginning of the season who says we crown you champions. You've got
to go do it. You have to stay healthy and have a mix of veterans
and young players. We've done that for eight years and we thought
we had done it this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves lost Andres Galarraga, their No. 1 run producer,
with cancer even before spring training. They lost Kerry
Ligtenberg, their closer, to elbow surgery before the season. And
now they have lost Javier Lopez, their good-hitting catcher, and
Odalis Perez, one of their starting pitchers, for the season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, John Smoltz, one of their trio of fine starters,
has been plagued periodically with a bad elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the perennial winners appear vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox, who has guided the teams Schuerholz has put together,
refuses to accept condolences. In fact, he shrugs off questions
that suggest the Braves have any kind of problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, there's nothing wrong, there's absolutely nothing
wrong,'' the manager said stoically. ``We just have to put together
a win streak.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he quickly pointed out that the Braves have overcome
deficits before, in 1993, for example. The Braves that season were
nine and a half games behind San Francisco on Aug. 7 but won 39 of
their last 50 games, beating Colorado on the last day of the
season, while the Giants were losing to Los Angeles. The Braves
finished with 104 victories to the Giants' 103.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card didn't even exist then, so the Braves had to
finish first to reach the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is we're not worried about the Mets or the Phillies
or the Yankees,'' Cox said. ``We're just worried about ourselves.
We can't do anything about those teams until we play them. We just
worry about our own team. That's where our mind-set is.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz worked feverishly in the days leading up to last
weekend's nonwaiver trading deadline to secure reinforcements for
Cox's depleted troops. He obtained Jose Hernandez, a defensively
versatile player with some power, and Terry Mulholland, a veteran
pitcher, but he was unable to pry first baseman Fred McGriff out of
Tampa Bay's clutches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some question,'' Schuerholz said, ``about whether we
could reasonably assume we could buttress up this club sufficiently
in the absence of those guys to give us a chance to win. But the
way our guys played, I felt that's the least we could do.''
</P>
<P>
   But the general manager was willing to go only so far. The Devil
Rays' asking price for McGriff was exorbitant, he felt, and he did
not make the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the acquisition of Hernandez and Mulholland, we tried to
address two areas we felt some vulnerability,'' Schuerholz said.
``We wanted to stay in the fight. We weren't ready to retire to the
corner and say it's all over. There's still some fight left in our
guys and we wanted to send in some troops to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Making no concession speech, Schuerholz said the Braves thought
it would be appropriate to end the '90s with another championship.
``I'm not delivering any eulogies here,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   And for those doubters who think this is the beginning of the
end for the Braves, that there has to be a time when they don't
win, Cox said: ``This may not be the year that we don't win. We may
still win.''

BASEBALL NOTEBOOK: HOT (AND COLD) PITCHING; NO MUZZLE FOR MCRAE;
BADMOUTHING GWYNN; ANGELS FOR SALE; UMPIRES MISS THE CALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu, who began the season as George Steinbrenner's fat
toad, has made the Yankees feel good by winning eight consecutive
decisions in 12 starts, dating to his last loss on May 25. Rick
Reed of the Mets has a 7-0 record in his last 11 starts, dating to
his last loss June 4.
</P>
<P>
   But neither has gone the longest without losing. Armando Reynoso
of Arizona has only one defeat in his record, and he incurred it
April 27. He has since started 16 times, winning six and emerging
with no decision 10 times. John Halama of Seattle has made 13
starts since joining the Mariners' rotation May 25, winning seven
and losing none.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the won-lost ledger, Jeff Weaver of Detroit
has gone the longest without winning, sustaining an 0-5 record in
12 starts since last gaining a victory May 27.
</P>
<P>
   An Upfront Guy
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine read something
in a newspaper article he didn't like. Brian McRae heard that
Valentine thought he was the player who had said it anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say it,'' McRae said. ``I don't work that way.
Anybody who knows me knows that I don't play that game. If I'm
going to say something, I'm going to put my name to it. I own up to
it. That's how I am and that's how I always will be.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point was McRae's remark after a game late last season
that teams try harder to beat the Mets because they don't like
Valentine. McRae did not try to hide behind anonymity, and
Valentine didn't like the comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just repeating what I heard,'' McRae said. ``I didn't
initiate it. I'm sure that's not the first time he heard it. A lot
of teams wanted to beat us. I don't think that's anything that's
shocking news to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine no longer needs to fret about what McRae might say in
his own clubhouse. The Mets traded him to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure if I have something to say, I'm going to say it,''
McRae said, explaining his outspoken nature. ``That makes me feel
better. I'll bring things up and maybe say something that needs to
be said. Somebody's got to say it. Whatever repercussions it has,
that's fine. I feel better because I said what I thought I had to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old outfielder was asked if anyone had ever told him
his direct way might not be the best in a sport like baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said, ``but that's the way I am. I'm not going to
try to change my personality. If you talk enough, if you've been
around enough, you're going to say some things that people don't
like. There's nothing you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Misguided About Gwynn
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyritz, as he was on his way out the door after his trade
to the Yankees, and some other members of the San Diego Padres were
quoted in The San Diego Union-Tribune as saying that Tony Gwynn was
a selfish player. They came across as sounding petty and jealous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Tony Gwynn and I know he's not a selfish individual,''
said Frank Robinson, the Hall of Fame player. ``The people who are
saying that have to be very small-minded. Evidently they have been
teammates of Tony, but they don't know Tony.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, Robinson noted, has played for the Padres for 18 years
even though he could have earned more money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Padre at heart,'' Robinson said. ``He lives and dies
with the Padres. To say all he's thinking about is 3,000 hits is
very small. Tony's a true professional. He wants to win,''
</P>
<P>
   And furthermore, Robinson said, ``This is great for the ballclub
to have the interest and the attention of the people and the media.
The players should be saying thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   No Fairy Tale Ending
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck long to decide they
don't like baseball. Or more to the point, they don't like losing
money in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has said nothing publicly, Walt Disney Co. has made
it known within baseball that it wants to sell the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The team is having a disastrous season, which has done nothing
to encourage Disney to retain the Angels. Their performance has
certainly not lured loads of fans to the ballpark. Earlier in the
season, some of the players had differences with the manager, Terry
Collins, and more recently the Angels plummeted 13 games in the
standing in 19 days.
</P>
<P>
   After Disney's initial disclosure that it wanted to sell, some
baseball people heard that Mickey and Donald might be having second
thoughts. But the ``For Sale'' sign is up, even if no one can see
it.
</P>
<P>
   Blown Call
</P>
<P>
   The umpires readily acknowledge that their mass resignation was
a tactic meant to induce baseball officials to begin bargaining for
a new labor agreement. When officials opted instead to accept some
of the resignations, the umpires cried foul. The development
prompted an observation from a New York lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just proves,'' he said, ``that the umpires still don't know
how to call a strike.''

NBA NOTES: OAKLEY HAS TO CHOOSE _ GET RICH OR GET A RING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After he was traded to Toronto a year ago, Charles Oakley showed
up at a golf tournament with some of his former New York Knicks
teammates. Still unhappy about becoming a Raptor, he began boasting
of how he would eventually end up in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bringing Shaq back with me to New York, knock out
everyone,'' Oakley said, grumbling under his breath. ``Get me some
rings with the Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the Lakers' acquiring Oakley seemed far-fetched at
the time _ the Raptors had no intention of trading him, and
Shaquille O'Neal's team seemed stacked for the millennium. But a
year later, Lakers president Jerry West is seriously interested in
paying what his team is allowed to spend for the toughness and
intangibles of a 35-year-old power forward who has never won a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   After Oakley had lunch with Kobe Bryant and O'Neal last week in
Los Angeles, Magic Johnson got up at a golf outing and spoke of how
important Oakley was to the Lakers' championship hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Now Oakley may have to decide which side of himself to listen
to: the smart businessman, or the sentimental soul who always cared
more about winning than getting paid. He has a tough decision to
make in the next couple of weeks. He can re-sign with Toronto for
the final years of his career for nearly $20 million, securing his
last big payday and helping the Raptors try to crack the Eastern
Conference playoffs. Or he can sign with the Lakers for no more
than $8 million and find solace in once again playing for a title
contender.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto may increase its offer and make the decision even more
difficult. Or another team like Indiana, Philadelphia or Atlanta
might enter the Oakley sweepstakes, if that's what you can call
them at this point. Like many decent but not All-Star-caliber free
agents, Oakley is finding that his leverage may decrease the longer
he waits, while teams fill out their rosters and empty their
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   The best scenario for Oakley would be a sign-and-trade deal, in
which the Lakers or another contender would send Toronto other
players and agree to pay Oakley much more than their $2
million-a-year salary exception.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley barely missed out on playing with a dynasty in Chicago,
came close to a title in New York and then started at the bottom
again in Toronto. Los Angeles would be a fitting place to end to
his career, in Jack Nicholson's lap after hunting down a loose
ball.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a no-brainer. The lockout caused him to miss a good
portion of his largest payday ever last season, nearly half of $10
million. Even though he has numerous investments, and makes a nice
profit from his car-wash chain, passing up more than $10 million
this time around would have to be hard.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley returns from the Bahamas this week after a short vacation
with a genuinely tough call. Here's hoping the sentimental soul
wins out over the smart businessman. After all, money can't buy you
a ring.
</P>
<P>
   Magic Makeover Continues
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Anfernee Hardaway's departure from Orlando last
week did not bring the Magic much in return: Danny Manning, Pat
Garrity and a couple of first-round draft picks. But it was
reportedly the best offer John Gabriel, the Magic's general
manager, had on the table.
</P>
<P>
   The truth about Hardaway's move to Phoenix for $86 million is
that the Magic had to trade him before it was forced to re-sign
him.
</P>
<P>
   Injury and inconsistency the last two seasons led to Hardaway's
falling out of the group of upper-echelon players, plummeting far
enough that other teams were not prepared to part with a perennial
All-Star of their own. The Suns' owner, Jerry Colangelo, showed
more faith in the disenchanted Hardaway's ability and future than
any of his peers wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   With Jason Kidd feeding him, Hardaway will probably lead the
league in dunks on the fast break next season, and perhaps he will
even recapture his form of three seasons ago. But last week, he was
just another part of Orlando's makeover, in which Horace Grant and
Nick Anderson had departed.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond's Diminished Value
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to Mitch Richmond?
</P>
<P>
   Once thought to be the league's second-best shooting guard
behind Michael Jordan, he has turned into another malcontent who
cannot find a playoff team or an exorbitant contract to suit him.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, Golden State and Sacramento, his former teams, have all
backed off from trying to acquire the 31-year-old shooting guard.
Miami was believed to be the only team still trying to make a
sign-and-trade deal with Washington, Richmond's current team.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Heat unwilling to part with P.J. Brown, it was
looking less likely that Richmond would move on to Miami, his
destination of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond was one of the league's brightest young stars a few
seasons ago. Now he is just another veteran scorer who wants to be
paid for his past instead of his potential, a player who may or may
not be a piece to a championship puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Bucks Take a Step Back
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee experienced a rejuvenation under George Karl last
season, but the Bucks took a major step backward in the off season.
Letting go free-agent role players like Michael Curry (to Detroit)
and Dell Curry (to Toronto) is the kind of decision that seems
unimportant until playoff time. Michael Curry gave Milwaukee a
physical presence on defense, and Dell could still knock down the
3-point bomb routinely.

RALLYING THE NFL'S ASSISTANT COACHES FOR BETTER BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Kennan is one of the most important men in the National
Football League these days. He is not a coach _ although he used to
be _ or a player. And he is not a billionaire owner. If he walked
through an airport, few people would know who he was.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kennan recently played a key role in avoiding what could
have been a very ugly situation between NFL owners and the more
than 400 assistant coaches who form the backbone of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Kennan, the former New England Patriots offensive coordinator,
is head of the NFL Coaches Association, and just several years ago
the group was considering a massive strike.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches wanted improved health benefits and retirement packages,
which in some ways were highly inadequate and not in line with what
the league provided its players and game officials.
</P>
<P>
   Then Kennan took control of the group early last year. What
Kennan found was a group that remained highly skeptical that the
assistant coaches could improve their position without taking
drastic action.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennan was able to persuade the association to wait and
trust that he could make something happen through negotiations.
Kennan, with the support of the players' union, made progress
fairly quickly by using calm, intelligent arguments with the NFL
instead of hard threats.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a series of agreements between the assistants and
the NFL that were kept secret until recently. The deals have swayed
even the most radical of the assistant coaches, who now believe the
league is serious about listening to their demands.
</P>
<P>
   Many NFL assistants are unlike high-profile head coaches such as
Bill Parcells and Mike Shanahan, who receive lucrative,
incentive-laden contracts. Instead, the majority of the assistants,
like the strength coach or the person who teaches the defensive
backs, receive far less pay and may often have to worry about job
security. According to Kennan, 25 percent of all coaches are
dismissed every year. And health benefits for assistants in the
past have been mediocre at best.
</P>
<P>
   Before Kennan, the league was mostly unresponsive to the
complaints of the assistants, who then became bitter about their
situation. Last year a small number of assistants walked out of a
league-sponsored coaching seminar as a form of protest. After that,
some coaches wanted to stage further protests by wearing black
armbands during a game or file a class-action lawsuit. Others
wanted to strike.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, all of that talk seems to be in the past,
because the league has addressed many of their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   First, the NFL standardized the health and dental insurance
plans for the coaches. In the past, different teams had different
plans. One team's package was considered excellent while other
plans were severely lacking. Now there is a single policy for all
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the life insurance policy of each assistant was doubled,
to $500,000 from $250,000. Several recent deaths and long-term
illnesses of assistants may have played a factor in this agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Third, those over 65 years old who have coached in the league
from 1998 on will receive $1,200 a year toward supplemental medical
coverage. This is the only agreement coaches are not completely
happy about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the fact they did something in that area,'' one
offensive assistant said. ``But it is still kind of cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennan and the NFL are working on two remaining issues. The
coaches would like to lower the retirement age and standardize the
league's severance package.
</P>
<P>
   Once the agreements were reached, however, the league did not
inform the coaches, several of them said. The assistants had to
learn the news from Kennan.
</P>
<P>
   Kennan, commissioner Paul Tagliabue and George Young, the senior
vice president of football operations, have been the main
negotiators. Kennan said Tagliabue and Young had been honest and
open-minded and had listened to what Kennan had to say. The talks
have always been amicable.
</P>
<P>
   The league had to be extremely careful in its dealings with the
coaches. Owners and league executives feared other groups stepping
forward if they placated the coaches. What if the trainers formed a
union and started making demands? Or the office secretaries? Or the
people who get water for the players?
</P>
<P>
   The difference with the assistant coaches is that no other group
in professional football puts the same amount of time into their
jobs that the coaches do. Not even the players work 12-to-15-hour
days. Stress is a daily companion.
</P>
<P>
   Some assistants believe there remains a small chance the
association might be forced to file a class-action lawsuit against
the league if their final demands are not met, but that number is
few. There is a better chance that both sides will reach an
agreement on each issue without any sort of labor strife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do this professionally,'' Kennan said. ``We do not
want to do anything drastic. I am listening to and believing George
Young and the commissioner. I trust them and their word.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennan is now touring training camps and spreading the word of
the agreements to the assistant coaches, fielding questions and
informing them of the next steps. He is, of course, extremely
popular these days. It is easy to understand why. &QL;

WHEATLEY DIDN'T FIT IN MIAMI
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Running back Tyrone Wheatley arrived at the Miami Dolphins' camp
last week and was told by the team that his services were no longer
needed. It was probably devastating to Wheatley but, as strange as
it seems, the Dolphins were probably doing him a favor.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami coaching staff knew early in training camp that
Wheatley, a former No. 1 draft pick by the New York Giants, was not
going to make the team. The Dolphins have one of the deepest
backfields in the league, and most backs on coach Jimmy Johnson's
roster are faster and hungrier than Wheatley. So Wheatley had to
impress the coaches immediately just to have a chance to make the
team. Obviously, he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Miami coaches were also concerned about Wheatley's lack of
aggression when running up the middle in drills, the same concern
expressed by the coaching staffs of Dan Reeves and Jim Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a difficult pro career for Wheatley, the 17th
overall pick out of the University of Michigan in 1995. When
Wheatley was drafted by the Giants, he was immediately disliked by
Reeves because the former head coach wanted running back Rashaan
Salaam instead. (Salaam has also had a career below the
expectations for him.)
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Wheatley and Fassel was not much
better. Wheatley felt Fassel never had an open mind about him, and
Fassel thought Wheatley was a complainer with a questionable work
ethic. Wheatley was once so frustrated with his lack of playing
time that he requested a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Wheatley's size _ he is 6 feet and 235 pounds _ a
team will always take a chance on him. In fact, several days after
Miami released Wheatley, the Oakland Raiders, the official home
base for wayward NFL souls, signed him to a contract.
Coincidentally, he is now a teammate of Salaam's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rod Woodson, after 47 career interceptions, 164 games and 7
Pro Bowls at cornerback, has moved to safety with the Baltimore
Ravens. He is 34 years old and age can slow even the best. But
because of his athleticism he might make another Pro Bowl after
this season _ at safety.
</P>
<P>
   _ Running back Barry Sanders might meet with William Clay Ford,
the Detroit Lions' owner, at the end of the week. Ford wants a
chance to pull Sanders out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several Giants players say they have noticed a more intense
and aggressive Jim Fassel this year in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   _ The former Giant safety Tito Wooten has signed with the
Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Six No. 1 draft picks remain unsigned, including the third
overall selection by Cincinnati, quarterback Akili Smith.
</P>
<P>
   _ Green Bay defensive tackle Gilbert Brown, who has been
criticized for his weight problems, has lost significant weight,
coach Ray Rhodes said. Neither Brown nor Rhodes is saying exactly
how much.

UT TOWER, SITE OF SNIPER ATTACK, TO REOPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A Texas landmark designed as a monument to
higher learning only to become infamous as a deadly sniper's perch
will reopen to the public next month amid hopes that visitors will
be more enamored with its view than curious about its violent past.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Texas at Austin plans to allow public tours of
the observation deck of the campus' 231-foot-high tower beginning
Sept. 16. The deck has been off-limits since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Campus officials said they hope the deck's reopening helps to
dim the memory of Aug. 1, 1966, when Eagle Scout and ex-Marine
Charles Whitman ascended to the perch and began spraying bullets
from high-powered rifles at people crossing the university's mall
and nearby city streets.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman killed 14 people and wounded 31. Earlier in the day, he
killed his wife and his mother in their homes. He died in the tower
in a gun battle with police.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old tower was also the scene of nine other deaths,
two accidental falls and seven suicides.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, during a media tour, UT-Austin assistant vice
president Steve Kraal said the reopened deck will have adequate
safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Metal detectors will be installed and armed guards will be
stationed on the first floor and on the deck, which is being
wrapped with a stainless-steel cage-like lattice fastened to the
deck's cheek-high masonry rail.
</P>
<P>
   The lattice will ensure the deck's safety while allowing
visitors a clear view of the state Capitol, the Austin skyline and
the Texas Hill Country, Kraal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a vision of Austin you can't get from any other
place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tours will be run from 6 p.m. until dark, and all day Saturday
and Sunday. Cost will be $3 and visitors will be allowed to spend
about an hour on the observation deck.

SLAYING ENDED A LONG EFFORT TO SAVE A MENTALLY ILL WOMAN

(rk) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She was the child of Holocaust survivors, born in
Brooklyn on Christmas Eve of 1959 with good looks, keen
intelligence and a big brother determined to protect her from all
the evil in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But when her battered body was found in Central Park on July 22
this year, the police identified Susan Fuchs by a food stamp card
and said her last address was a homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Her descent from middle-class promise to violent death at
society's margins was part of a 20-year journey through the New
York mental health system. In the end, family members maintain, the
system failed her, accepting her resistance to treatment though it
was symptomatic of her mental illness, and frustrating their own
desperate efforts to keep her safe.
</P>
<P>
   The case also underlines how difficult it can be to help the
most severely mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Public concern over the dangerously mentally ill spurred Gov.
George Pataki and state lawmakers to agree last week on legislation
giving the courts new authority to order former mental patients to
comply with treatment or face re-hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the lobbying for the new law focused on mental patients
charged with crimes, but Susan Fuchs herself _ repeatedly
hospitalized against her will, deeply resistant to taking
medication, and tracked by relatives ready to try anything to help
her _ also seemed to be an obvious candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Fuchs, who was 13 when his sister was born, and his wife,
Gloria, say they would have used the law if it had been enacted
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a close look at Susan Fuchs' troubled history, through
interviews, court records and hospital documents, suggests that
even in her case, the practical effects of the law would have been
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Susan Fuchs cycled through psychiatric wards,
assisted-living programs, emergency rooms and homeless shelters,
laws intended to protect mental patients were ignored at crucial
points, and a hard-line policy of patient confidentiality made it
hard for relatives even to find her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there was going to be a disaster,'' Gloria Fuchs said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Fuchs had covered a table in their antiques store on
Atlantic Avenue with a jumble of documents and notes compiled in
their 20-year battle to save Susan Fuchs: court orders,
correspondence from doctors, hospitals and insurance companies, her
Regents scholarship award, her first suicide note.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Susan Fuchs disappeared, she was injured, said her
brother, a former high school teacher with a graying ponytail who
founded his antiques and carpentry business with his wife 20 years
ago, when their own daughter was born _ and just before his smart,
pretty sister fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Fuchs graduated as a math major from SUNY-Binghamton
despite serious symptoms of mental illness beginning at 15, despite
a major breakdown in college. She kept spiraling downward, caught
in the grip of ``a bipolar affective disorder, manic, severe with
psychotic features,'' in the words of a doctor's diagnosis in a
Feb. 12, 1991, court affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Courts repeatedly found her a danger to herself or others and
committed her for involuntary hospital treatment and medication,
but only when someone knew or cared enough to make her madness a
legal matter. And when Susan rejected her family members, in part
for their role in her commitments, in part because of her paranoid
delusions, the system helped her disappear into the streets, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, relatives do not have to wait for a family
member with such a history to become dangerous before petitioning
the court to order the person to submit to outpatient treatment or
face commitment. But the person still would have to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Susan Fuchs was discharged from one of the dozen
private and public psychiatric hospitals that treated her, Gloria
Fuchs called social workers, psychiatrists, nurses and homeless
shelter clerks in an effort to find her, hunting for a weak link in
the chain of patient confidentiality that shut the family out.
</P>
<P>
   Once, in 1996, they discovered her in a homeless shelter in
Canarsie, Brooklyn, naked, bruised and delusional, her clothes
stolen by other shelter residents. Another time, about two years
ago, she walked into their antiques store, barefoot, distraught and
covered with sores.
</P>
<P>
   Four months before her death, they waited with her until 4 a.m.
in the emergency room of Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn to
secure her psychiatric admission, after she had declared that she
had no family, because aliens had taken over her relatives' bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital discharged her at her request within a week rather
than seeking a court-ordered commitment, releasing her to an
address it would not tell the family, her brother said. Police
investigators now say it was a homeless shelter, though an appeals
court ruling in 1993 bar transfers to shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to abide by the hospital's policy of protecting
patient confidentiality,'' Eileen Tynan, a spokeswoman for
Maimonides, said in declining to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   The new law allows a judge to order a patient like Susan Fuchs
into the hospital for a 24-hour assessment by doctors to determine
if court-ordered outpatient treatment is suitable. But if the
patient refuses to comply with its terms, a doctor could put the
patient in the hospital involuntarily for a maximum of 72 hours.
For a longer commitment, the old standard of dangerous behavior
must be met.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Fuchs' delusions had repeatedly proved dangerous. When she
had an apartment, she set small fires to burn ``secret papers,''
according to a doctor's court affidavit. More recently, emergency
room records show, she inflicted injuries on her own face until she
was black and blue.
</P>
<P>
   On that occasion, in January of this year, a nurse at New York
Methodist Hospital summoned Tom Fuchs, telling him his sister had
been in a padded observation room in the emergency room for three
days. No psychiatric beds were available, and doctors said she was
too psychotic to release, Methodist Hospital officials confirm.
Fuchs signed her out and drove her to Maimonides hospital himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Maimonides, which obtained a 60-day court order of
involuntary commitment after that episode, discharged her as soon
as the order expired _ to the apartment of a woman who had herself
been released from a mental ward only 48 hours earlier, the Fuchses
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was insane, like a Kafka play,'' Fuchs recalled, adding
that by the time they discovered the address a few days later,
Susan had moved on.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``That does not constitute a proper discharge in any way, shape
or form,'' said Shelley Nortz, director of policy for the Coalition
for the Homeless, which won a class-action lawsuit against what she
called ``patient dumping'' in 1993. Under law, she added, New York
Methodist itself should have transported the patient to another
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Financial pressures have quickened discharges, and made
hospitals less likely to try to renew involuntary commitments, said
Barbara Jones, a lawyer for Mental Hygiene Legal Services, which
represents patients at commitment hearings. ``Even when we're
advocates for the patients who want to leave, we're sometimes sorry
the facility didn't try to keep them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   State hospitals are under pressure, too, she said. Since the
mid-1990s, when Susan Fuchs was treated at the South Beach State
Psychiatric Center on Staten Island, the population of such state
centers has been cut by 40 percent, to 6,000. For outpatient
services, like case managers who can monitor difficult patients,
waiting lists have grown.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of outpatient commitment have found that patients with
good outpatient services did equally well with or without a court
order. The new law's budget, $40 million, is mainly for medication.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Fuchs had long rejected psychotropic drugs, which can be
heavily sedating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a vegetable on medication,'' she wrote in the early 1980s
before leaping into the Hudson in a suicide attempt. ``I can't
think. I can't read. I can't enjoy anything. ... I can't live
without my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   That time, someone pulled her from the water. This year, Tom and
Gloria Fuchs wanted to put her in a hospital long enough to try
newer drugs, or at least to keep her from predators. ``A woman
alone, deranged, wandering on the street without her glasses, so
myopic she couldn't even read a street sign _ she's just going to
get hurt,'' her brother said.
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Fuchs was an adult, and they were not even her
parents. Her mother, Miriam Fuchs, a 77-year-old Auschwitz survivor
who declined to be interviewed, lives half the year in Florida. Her
father, Philip, died more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   From Susan's perspective, moreover, the system did not promise
safety. Her brother said she had been sexually assaulted in
psychiatric units by other patients.
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, the Fuchses caught up with her as she picked up
documents at Services for the Underserved, a nonprofit agency that
sponsors the supervised-living program that she had left in
January, after battering her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look like my family but their bodies have been taken over
by others,'' she told a social worker there, according to Gloria
Fuchs' notes. The social worker called the police and an ambulance
to take her back to Maimonides.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, the Fuchses retained a lawyer to draw up a petition
under a recent guardianship law, asking the court to rule her
mentally incapacitated _ a procedure that would cost several
thousand dollars, and that required Susan Fuchs to be served with
papers.
</P>
<P>
   But she was already gone again. Maimonides had not sought a
court commitment this time. The Fuchses were outraged. No hospital
knew the severity of Susan Fuchs' illness better than Maimonides,
they say. Marvin H. Lipkowitz, the chief of psychiatry, had been
one of her first doctors. Gloria Fuchs appealed to him.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled him as telling her: ``People like you in this
situation have long abandoned their mentally ill relatives. I think
you should explore in yourself why you are still here.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the exchange, the psychiatrist responded, ``I may
have said something like that.'' But he stressed that he had not
meant his remarks critically. ``I was left admiring the woman,'' he
said. ``Her involvement was very prolonged and had been met by all
sorts of rejection. Many families simply abandon the case.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the hospital that abandoned Susan, Gloria
Fuchs contends, and she feels the issue was money. In the emergency
room just before that last, brief hospitalization, she said,
hospital employees realized that private insurance had lapsed.
Susan Fuchs' mother had dropped the $160 monthly premium, Tom Fuchs
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No patient gets treated differently because of the financial
coverage,'' Lipkowitz countered. ``The general rtle is that when a
tragedy in life occurs somebody has to be blamed. I am truly sorry.
I feel for these people.'' But he added, ``You have only half the
story.''
</P>
<P>
   In bipolar disorders, he said, ``The individual who can be quite
psychotic at some times can become quite normal at another time.
You cannot force medication on someone who does not seem obviously
psychotic.''
</P>
<P>
   To Gloria Fuchs, his responses amounted to telling them to wait
until the next time Susan got hurt. Then, it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, at 2 a.m., several people heard a woman screaming in
Central Park but did not call the police. At 11 a.m. Susan Fuchs'
half-naked body was found there, her head smashed in with a rock.

HOLDING HANDS, THEN A TORRENT OF BRICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPLEWOOD, N.J. _ They had walked the tree-lined streets of this
town for most of their lives, raising their family in a 2 1/2 story
home not far from the main drag and choosing to remain after their
two children had grown up.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Shire had recently marked his 75th birthday at a family
celebration arranged by his wife, Phyllis. Neighbors dropped by
with champagne, toasting the couple's closeness and the years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the Shires left to take their usual walk down
Maplewood Avenue, holding hands in the cool breeze. As they passed
Bill and Harry's Chinese restaurant shortly before 7 p.m., there
was the sound of a crack, and a section of the building's brick
facade came tumbling down.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shire, 67, was killed instantly, according to police, and
Shire was critically injured by the debris that fell from the
facade. He remained in critical but stable condition Saturday at
University Hospital in Newark, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not know what caused the torrent of bricks to give
way. ``Engineers will have to check to see what if anything was
wrong with the building,'' said Maplewood Police Director Paul
Gizzo.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the phone at the home of the building's
owner, identified by police as Harold Bobrow, said he would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, neighbors stood by the buttressed facade, some leaving
flowers near where the couple had fallen, others speaking of the
perfect love the Shires shared.
</P>
<P>
   They were lovebirds, a devoted couple who were always holding
hands, said Pat Ross, co-owner of the real estate company next door
to where the accident occurred. ``You would see them almost every
night: he wearing his hat and she nicely dressed for their
stroll.''
</P>
<P>
   According to their neighbors, Shire was a psychologist and Mrs.
Shire often sold antiques. The couple, who had celebrated their
47th anniversary in June, took a trip to Europe every year in the
late summer, neighbors said. Last summer it was Italy. On Monday or
Tuesday, they were to leave for a trip to the Netherlands,
relatives said.

``The Thomas Crown Affair'' when the accident occurred. At the

   ``Many of us were in the pizza parlor just by there when we
heard the crash and all these people came screaming in, `The

pull bricks off this elderly man and his wife.

   ``He was finally able to sit up but she never moved,'' Ms. Bloom
said, shaking her head. ``It's amazing more people weren't hurt.''

GIULIANI PLAYS DOWN TEPIDNESS OF PATAKI'S ENDORSEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after receiving an endorsement from Gov. George
Pataki that was noticeably lacking in political fanfare, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani said Saturday that the governor's support would
provide an important bulwark in his anticipated run for the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said at a City Hall briefing that the endorsement on
Friday, in which Pataki urged the mayor's major Republican rival to
drop out of the race, would prevent damaging divisions within New
York state's Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the romantics and political spinning that goes on,
providing unity within the Republican Party is what is important,''
Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is really important for New York is to have a Republican
elected to the Senate,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the seemingly subdued nature of Pataki's statement,
in which he said the mayor had ``earned the right'' to receive the
backing of the state's Republican Party, Giuliani voiced no
dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate very much the governor's support, and I look
forward to working with him,'' Giuliani said, adding that he and
the governor had had ``a fairly lengthy conversation'' in recent
weeks about the prospect of his run for the seat being vacated by
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat. He declined to specify when
that conversation had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the governor had called him on Friday morning to
tell him of his decision to make a statement of support,
effectively withdrawing his backing from Rick Lazio, the Long
Island congressman widely regarded as Giuliani's chief opponent
within the party.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani dismissed suggestions that Pataki's endorsement could
have been stronger or had more impact on voters, since it was made
with little advance notice on a Friday afternoon in August when
many are preoccupied with weekend travel or other summer
activities. Speculation about the governor's timing ``is just
political spin,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   And he said nothing would have been gained if the governor had
orchestrated his statement in the fashion of most high-profile
political endorsements, with the bestower of support standing
shoulder-to-shoulder with the grateful candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he did it just the right way,'' Giuliani said. ``It
is far more forceful if somebody just stands up and announces his
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has so far declined to respond to the governor's
announcement. But through a spokeswoman, Mollie Conkey, he said
Saturday that had no intention of withdrawing from the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Long, chairman of the New York state Conservative party,
a group whose support has long been regarded as critical to
Republican Party candidates in the state, said he had talked
briefly with Lazio about the governor's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not tickled pink, certainly not a happy camper,'' Long
said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani acknowledged Saturday that the governor's endorsement
was certain to create temporary tensions within the Republican
party, but he described the strain as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may take three months, four months or into next year, but
there will be unity within the Republican Party,'' he said, adding
that such unity was crucial as part of an overriding theme in his
campaign that a Republican senator, joining a Senate in which
Republicans now have a majority, would benefit New York state
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also characterized the competition between him and
Lazio as a reflection of ``strength and a diversity of talent''
within the state's Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, the mayor segued into a criticism of his
anticipated Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats can't even produce a candidate from this
state,'' he said. ``The Democrats must be in pretty bad shape.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   August Huber, an investment banker and stock market analyst in
the 1960s and '70s, died on Wednesday. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   He died at Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in Sleepy Hollow,
N.Y., near his home in Scarborough, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Huber spent his entire career at Spencer Trask &AMP; Co., which was
founded in 1868. He joined the firm in 1931, became head of the
stock department and also ran its foreign department. He became a
general partner in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Huber became president of the firm, and, in 1971, he
was made the chief executive. He retired in 1977, when the firm
merged with Hornblower &AMP; Weeks-Hemphill Noyes, which was later
merged into Loeb Rhodes &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Huber was perhaps best known for predicting a 23 percent decline
in the stock market in 1966, after a three-year climb in prices.
</P>
<P>
   He was a governor of the New York Stock Exchange, a vice
chairman of the American Stock Exchange and a member of the New
York Society of Security Analysts from its beginnings in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Huber, who was born Nov. 19, 1911, in Brooklyn, is survived by
his wife, Alice; two sons, William Huber of Chillicothe, Ohio, and
Robert Huber of San Diego; seven grandchildren, and four
great-grandchildren.

EX-LEADER OF PERU HINTS AT COUP TO PUT FUJIMORI OUT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Former President Alan Garcia, who fled corruption
charges and went into exile in 1992, has suddenly re-emerged at the
center of Peruvian politics by making ambiguous remarks suggesting
that the military should overthrow President Alberto Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door is open for a civilian and military response to
President Fujimori's permanent coup d'etat,'' Garcia told foreign
correspondents Thursday in a telephone interview from Colombia,
where he lives in exile. He further called for ``a democratic
coup'' that would prevent Fujimori from making any attempt to steal
next year's presidential election by stuffing the ballot boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's comments were published with great fanfare here, and
they elicited condemnations from Fujimori and most opposition
leaders. In response, Peruvian government prosecutors began to
prepare papers seeking to have the former president extradited.
</P>
<P>
   When the Colombian government asked Garcia for a clarification,
he said his comments had been misunderstood and that he did not
favor a violent overthrow.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his waffling, Garcia has seized the spotlight to
continue attacking the government and encouraging speculation that
he could return to the country at the risk of arrest to lead the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in a telephone interview with Peruvian journalists
that was televised nationally, Garcia asserted that Fujimori was
isolating Peru internationally by rejecting the jurisdiction of the
Inter-American Court of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brutality of the regime continues to increase,'' he said.
``We are all almost absolutely certain that we are on the brink of
a fraudulent re-election.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia has not received this much attention since he fled Peru
in 1992 to escape charges that he stole millions of dollars from
the treasury and deposited the funds in a Swiss bank account.
Garcia has rejected the charges, saying they are politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Since late last year, Garcia has suggested that he would like to
return to Peru to run for Congress next year on the social
democratic ticket. But at the urging of Fujimori, the Congress
recently enacted a law prohibiting anyone who faces corruption
charges from running for office.
</P>
<P>
   Political graffiti have appeared around Lima in recent months
calling on Garcia to return, some of which read, ``Alan Means
Jobs.'' But opinion polls indicate that a majority of Peruvians
still have deep reservations about Garcia, whose approval ratings
are far below Fujimori's.
</P>
<P>
   As president in the late 1980s, Garcia limited foreign debt
payments and nationalized the banking system while increasing
social spending. His policies dried up credit and promoted a wave
of hyperinflation that discredited his party and led to Fujimori's
election in 1990. He was also criticized for failing to control two
guerrilla insurgencies.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori appeared to relish the reappearance of Garcia as an
opposition figure whom he can easily outmaneuver. He said that
Garcia's assertion ``shows there is complete freedom of expression
in Peru,'' despite the criticisms of human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it inexplicable that the same people who decry my
supposed coup are proposing coups themselves,'' Fujimori told
reporters, referring to his 1992 dismissal of Congress and the
Supreme Court. Then he reminded reporters of Garcia's stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us 10 years to recover,'' he said. ``Finally we now
have one of the most stable countries in the region for
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori is behind in the polls, but in recent weeks his
approval ratings have improved. He said he would decide whether to
run or not by the end of the year, but his removal of three judges
who ruled that such a run would be unconstitutional has led most
political analysts to believe he has already decided.

KATHRYN MURRAY, 92, OF DANCE-STUDIO EMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Conn.)  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kathryn Murray, the hostess of ``The Arthur Murray Party,''
which used comedy and celebrity to sell ballroom dancing to the
masses in television's infancy, died on Friday at her home in
Honolulu. She was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Murray had been the executive vice president of the
dance-studio empire built by her late husband, Arthur Murray, and
played such an important part in promoting their ``dancing in a
hurry'' business that the entertainer Sam Levenson joked that
Murray had become rich ``by the sweat of his frau.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arthur Murray Party'' ran intermittently from 1950 to 1960
on the three commercial networks and on the old DuMont network.
Luminaries of sport and stage joined in songs, skits and contests,
and at the end of each episode, Mrs. Murray told her audience:
``Put a little fun into your life. Try dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she turned, held up her arms to Murray and he waltzed her
away.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Murray made sport of herself for her on-air pronunciation
of ``party'' as ``pahty,'' and blithely repeated the critics'
assessment that she ``talked too fast, smiled too often and wore
unimpressive gowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thompson, the founding director of the Center for the
Study of Popular Television, at Syracuse University, said the
Murrays ``literally danced an era out'' by drawing families
together for quaint variety acts before rock 'n' roll began to
fragment audiences. He said that another way to look at the show
was as a pioneering infomercial _ ``one big advertisement for
people to go to the studios.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the studios were as much about sales as they were about
the cha-cha or tango, and it was Mrs. Murray who wrote the training
manuals for the franchises, including the lucrative advice, ``Don't
try to teach a whole course in one lesson.'' The Murrays and the
business signed a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission
in 1960 promising to stop using high-pressure tactics to sell dance
courses.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Murray liked to tell about the time she got carried away
with a prospective student. ``We tangoed, we waltzed, we pivoted
and chassed,'' she said. ``Rumba music filled our cubicle, and I
did an open swivel and flirtation scallop, then a jitterbug and a
Hollywood Lindy.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect fled in a sweat, and she used the tale to remind
instructors to teach, not show off.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Murray was born Kathryn Kohnfelder in Jersey City, N.J., on
Sept. 15, 1906. Her father, Abraham Kohnfelder, was a newspaper
advertising manager. She graduated from high school at 15, earned a
teaching certificate, then was introduced to Murray when she and a
friend went to a radio station where he was teaching dance steps
over the air.
</P>
<P>
   She was 18, and he was 29. They married three months later.
</P>
<P>
   Murray started by selling mail-order instructions _ all dotted
lines, arrows and outlines of shoes _ and taught a ``magic step''
that he said could be used 30 ways. The couple built their empire
to 500 studios by the time they sold the business in 1952. The
television show took them to new heights of success, and they
continued to manage the business until 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The Murrays were constantly mentioned in the newspapers because
of their glamorous lives and complex business affairs. After they
tired of suburban life in Harrison, N.Y., they lived mostly in
hotels in New York and California. Then Mrs. Murray wanted a
kitchen, and they bought an apartment on Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they dined out almost every night with notables from
radio, theater and publishing. About once a week, they dropped into
Broadway dance halls to watch Latin and other dancers for moves
that could be simplified for middle America. The Murrays arrived
quietly but usually were instantly recognized. In 1968, they moved
to the Honolulu penthouse where Mrs. Murray died.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote two books, ``My Husband, Arthur Murray,'' with Betty
Hannah Hoffman, in 1960, and ``Family Laugh Lines,'' a collection
of anecdotes about celebrity friends, in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Murray died in 1991, a month before the couple's 66th wedding
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Murray is survived by twin daughters, Jane Heimlich of
Cincinnati and Phyllis McDowell of New Haven, Conn., eight
grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

BASTIAAN MEEUSE, 83, EXPERT ON VOODOO LILY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (js) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Bastiaan J.D. Meeuse, a botany professor who withstood one
of nature's foulest floral odors to unlock some of the mysteries of
the voodoo lily, a plant that generates heat along with stench,
died on July 27 at a hospital in Kirkland, Wash. He was 83 and had
lived in Kirkland since 1953.
</P>
<P>
   He retired from the University of Washington in 1986 but stayed
active in his field until recently.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his five decades of research, Meeuse focused on the
voodoo lily, Sauromatum guttatum, because of the intensity of the
plant's behavior. Its huge, smelly flowers, which can weigh up to a
half-pound and get as hot as 108 degrees Fahrenheit inside, made it
``a wonderful botanical guinea pig,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was not the first to discover that some plants can generate
heat; his Dutch mentors did that but did not pursue it. Meeuse,
however, devoted most of his career to investigating the phenomenon
and its implications for horticulture, agriculture and animal
physiology.
</P>
<P>
   His research helped advance the understanding of the oxidation
process in the cells and tissues of plants and animals as well as
plant pollination strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists suspect that the genes that allow the voodoo lily to
heat itself might someday be harnessed to breed frost-resistant
crops. Study of the plant has also helped explain how salicylic
acid regulates growth in many plants.
</P>
<P>
   Meeuse was an authority on pollination, especially by insects
and birds, and wrote the textbook ``The Story of Pollination''
(1961).
</P>
<P>
   He was also the co-author, with Sean Morris, of ``The Sex Life
of Flowers'' (1984). That book was inspired by a 1981 film on
public television, ``Sexual Encounters of the Floral Kind,'' for
which Meeuse served as scientific adviser.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The voodoo lily is related to the equally putrid giant
Amorphophallus titanum, another rare bloomer known in its native
Indonesia as bunga bangui or corpse flower. A corpse flower
specimen in the University of Washington's botany greenhouse
malodorously flowered this year, a rare and usually unpredictable
event, and became an unlikely tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Its less-awesome cousin, the Southeast Asian voodoo lily, has
fascinated botanists for two centuries. When it flowers, perhaps
once a year, its fleshy purple spike emits waves of heat and an
odor not unlike that of rotting meat. The chemicals released by the
heat apparently help to attract pollinators.
</P>
<P>
   ``These plants work like mad,'' Meeuse said once. ``They respire
and respire and respire.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeuse and a series of collaborators published about 200 papers
on the lily over 50 years. In a paper in 1987 he identified the
substance behind the heat-producing ``respiratory explosion'' as
salicylic acid.
</P>
<P>
   That particular acid, related to aspirin and useful as a
pain-killing analgesic, is also present in the bark of the white
willow and wintergreen leaves. It may help to regulate growth in
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Meeuse's team found that the salicylic acid levels in their
lilies rose a hundredfold before flowering.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, while pursuing a different line of research,
Meeuse discovered a moss enzyme that burns oxalic acid. The enzyme
has been used to regulate the blood of people whose circulatory
systems overproduce oxalic acid, a condition that could result in a
potentially fatal kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bastiaan Jacob Dirk Meeuse was born on May 9, 1916, in Sukabumi,
a small town on Java, Indonesia, where his parents, who were
teachers, had been sent by the Dutch colonial service. At age 11,
he and his family moved to Bogor, Indonesia, known to the Dutch as
Buitenzorg, or ``free of care.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogor was then an important colonial outpost with world-famous
botanical gardens. The boy's interest in nature was awakened by
their wonders, and he decided to become a biologist.
</P>
<P>
   His family moved back to Holland in 1931, where he finished high
school and undertook intensive studies of biology, zoology,
chemistry and physics at the University of Leiden, earning his
degree in 1936. He received his doctorate in 1943 at the University
of Delft, where he remained as a laboratory assistant and lecturer
until 1952, interrupted by two years as a Rockefeller Foundation
Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania to study the metabolism of
pea seeds.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the faculty at the University of Washington in 1952
and became a full professor of botany in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Meeuse is survived by his wife of 57 years, Johanne van Ten
Meeuse; a daughter, Karen Meeuse of Woodenville, Wash.; a son,
Peter N. of Kirkland; a brother, Prof. Adriaan D.J. Meeuse of
Amsterdam; five grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Meeuse said his work in the lab at times shrouded him in ``an
odor that would drive skunks away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even my cat Blackie,'' he once said, ``won't come near me when
the smell of the lily is on my clothes.''

VIOLA SHEELY, 41, DANCER PRAISED FOR RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Viola Sheely, an actress, a singer and a founding
member of the Urban Bush Women dance company, died on July 27 in
Tompkins Square Park. She was 41 and lived in Manhattan and Bali.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheely had taken her daughter, Jessye, to the park and
apparently had a heart attack, said Grisha Coleman, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of a 1992 Bessie Award, which is bestowed for
creative work in dance and performance art, Ms. Sheely had a long,
thin body and a slightly prim demeanor that belied her intensity
and daring as a performer. One of her most memorable roles was as
the shy young visionary Hannah, a character inspired by the
primitive painter Minnie Evans, in Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's 1990
``Praise House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Viola Sheely's range here is impressive, but nothing prepares
the audience for her last stunning soliloquy _ a bellowed, ecstatic
release,'' Anna Kisselgoff, senior dance critic of The New York
Times, wrote in 1991. But Ms. Sheely was just as convincing
portraying the lusty, anarchic women who populate many of Ms.
Zollar's pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Belle Glade, Fla., Ms. Sheely trained at Florida State
University. In New York City, she studied with the dancer and
choreographer Dianne McIntyre in the early 1980s. Ms. Sheely
performed with Urban Bush Women from 1984 to 1993. She also
performed in ``Vanquished by Voodoo,'' an En Garde Arts theater
production, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   A founder of Hot Mouth, an a cappella singing group, she belted
out songs in a show-stopping performance in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her daughter, survivors include her husband, Oded
Carmi, and two sisters, Betty and Carey Sheely of Belle Glade.

   NEW YORK _ In refusing on Thursday to release a Florida man
jailed for declining to testify before a grand jury investigating
the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Africa last August, a federal
judge cited an unusual source: the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hide not testimony,'' wrote Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. of
U.S. District Court in Manhattan. ``He who hideth it, verily his
heart is sinful. Allah is aware of what ye do.''
</P>
<P>
   The reluctant witness, Ihab M. Ali, 36, of Orlando, Fla., had
told Patterson that the Koran taught Muslims to do nothing that
``will cause harm to innocents.'' Testifying, he said, would be
regarded by his community as ``a major sin'' and ``a betrayal of
our beliefs as Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, of course, sharply disagreed. In one hearing
last month, a federal prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, read aloud
from the Koran, quoting its admonition not to hide testimony, and
another that ``witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned.''
</P>
<P>
   If the proceedings before Patterson began to sound like a
religious studies seminar, it was not surprising. The contempt case
_ the first known to have occurred in the investigation of Osama
bin Laden, who authorities suspect is the mastermind of the
bombings _ has touched on the sensitive issue of how the government
treats Muslims in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have charged that the government's investigation
into terrorism has unfairly targeted Muslims, an assertion the
government roundly denies.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not said why it wants to question Ali. The
most recent indictment in the case shows that prosecutors suspect
that some of bin Laden's associates have been active in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Ali told Patterson that his refusal to testify was rooted in his
distrust of the government, transcripts show, and he said that his
view was reinforced by the depiction of Muslims in news reports and
in entertainment media. He cited the movie ``The Siege,'' which he
said ``stereotyped Muslims always as being terrorists,
fundamentalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts on Islamic law said they disagreed with Ali's
interpretation of the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   One noted scholar, Khaled Abou El Fadl, who teaches at the
University of California at Los Angeles School of Law, said he
tended to agree that federal law enforcement discriminated against
Muslims. But he added, ``The Koran specifically says that even if
the testimony is going to lead to harming someone, as long as it's
the truth, you must say it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mohammed Al Hanooti, an imam at a mosque in Falls Church,
Va., disagreed. He testified last month in support of Ali, telling
Patterson that Islamic law ``gives him the right to abstain from
giving testimony in case it hurts him or it hurts any other
Muslim.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali, who is being held in a small ninth-floor cell in the
Metropolitan Correctional Center, segregated from the general jail
population, told the judge that further confinement would not
change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather endure the punishment in this world,'' he said,
``in jail or under any conditions, rather than go endure the
punishment in the hereafter, which is everlasting. This is my deep
belief.''
</P>
<P>
   In one hearing last month, the prosecutor, Fitzgerald, tried to
undermine Ali's position with a series of questions about
hypothetical situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw a non-Muslim person kill a Muslim,'' Fitzgerald
asked, ``would you testify about that in an American courtroom?''
Ali said he would. In several other scenarios outlined by the
prosecutor, Ali also agreed that he would probably testify.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald asked how Ali reconciled those responses with his
refusal to cooperate in the investigation of the embassy bombings,
which killed 223 people, including Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's different,'' Ali said, ``because here you have
Muslims of all different nationalities or different countries being
targeted.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In refusing to release Ali, Patterson wrote that he hoped that
more jail time would encourage Ali to reconsider his position. On
the civil contempt charge, Ali may be held for up to 18 months, and
possibly longer, unless the judge concludes he will not change his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the judge and the witness appear at loggerheads
in interpreting the Koran. At one point, Ali told the judge that he
was afraid that if he testified, his family, who live in Egypt,
might be harmed by bin Laden. He said the government's offer of the
witness protection program was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever protection they might offer, no matter how grand it
may be,'' Ali said, ``I doubt very much that they will give me
protection on the day of judgment, when I'm confronted with my
Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson reminded Ali that the grand jury was secret, and that
his testimony would not be disclosed. But Ali noted that when he
was first held in contempt during a secret appearance in U.S.
District Court in May, a newspaper article quickly reported it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, Patterson suggested, the issue of his family's
protection was then moot. ``I don't know whether they use this
expression in Egypt,'' the judge said, ``but it seems to me the
water is over the dam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope not,'' Ali replied. ``Otherwise, millions will
drown.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge tried to make his point slightly differently. ``Maybe
I should say the horse is out of the barn,'' he said, saying he
could not see how unjust harm could come from truthful testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But Ali remained undeterred. ``I stand by my reasons,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Concerned that diamonds are financing and
perpetuating wars in Africa, the Clinton administration is
considering actions aimed at halting the illicit-diamond trade,
administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of uncut diamonds from rebel-held mines to market
centers around the world _ valued at hundreds of millions of
dollars a year _ is keeping rebel armies in Angola, Congo and
Sierra Leone supplied with tanks and assault rifles and even
uniforms and beer, U.S. and European officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Control of these mines has been an obstacle to peace efforts in
African hot spots, and officials hope that by cutting off the
gray-market diamond trade they can also choke off the flow of arms,
stop the endless killing and hasten peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Diamonds are not the only way in which rebels pay for weapons,
but experts in Africa and the trade say cutting it off would have a
substantial impact.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is likely to propose a global marketing
system, by which diamond sales must be accompanied by documents
declaring the source of the precious stones and their destination.
</P>
<P>
   From the fields in Africa, diamonds reach dealers in Belgium,
Israel and Ukraine, where the unscrupulous turn the ready cash into
weapons. The largest weapons pipeline into Africa is controlled by
Russian organized crime figures who work with diamond brokers, U.S.
and European officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight years, the Angolan rebel organization, known
as Unita, has raised $3 billion to $4 billion from diamond sales,
according to a recent report by a U.N. committee on Angolan
sanctions. An arduously worked-out peace accord for that country
collapsed late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The brutal war in Sierra Leone, which left thousands maimed and
mutilated, was prolonged by at least 18 months because of the
ability of the rebels to quickly trade diamonds for arms, an
administration official said last week. A delicate agreement ending
that war was signed in July.
</P>
<P>
   At the middle levels of the State Department, the African
diamonds-for-weapons trade has been under study for several years.
But the problem has not penetrated more senior levels because wars
in Africa are not generally seen as affecting America's strategic
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after an intelligence study, which had been slow in coming,
illustrated how the trade works to perpetuate rebellion in Africa,
top administration officials appear to be ready to back a plan that
would try to regulate the diamond trade.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how such a marketing regime would be implemented in
various African nations and European diamond centers is undecided,
officials say. It could take the form of a U.N. program, a
multilateral treaty or a voluntary agreement within the diamond
industry.
</P>
<P>
   It appears to be an idea that is gaining support outside
government channels. Human rights organizations, including those
that led the campaign to ban land mines, are now talking about a
public education campaign aimed at highlighting the
diamonds-for-weapons trade.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the world's largest diamond company, DeBeers
Consolidated Mines Ltd., said in an interview that it would support
tighter controls on the trade. DeBeers, which controls about 70
percent of the world's diamond sales, views the growing flow of
illicit diamonds as a potential threat to its ability to influence
prices.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Its support would surely be welcomed by the administration,
which had expected DeBeers to resist any move to regulate the
market since the company has done quite well under the current
system.
</P>
<P>
   DeBeers has repeatedly maintained that it does not buy illicit
diamonds, a claim that U.S. and British officials dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all for it,'' a DeBeers spokesman in London, Andrew
Lamont, said about any proposal that the administration might
advance to strengthen controls on the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suits our interests,'' he added. ``The illicit trade only
serves to destabilize the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamont added that he thought the countries of southern Africa
whose economies are heavily dependent on diamond sales _ Botswana,
Namibia and South Africa _ would also welcome more stringent
controls on the trade.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And Belgium, which has resisted entreaties from the Clinton
administration to crack down on the gray-market diamond merchants,
appears to be changing its attitude. In Antwerp, the diamond
trading center of Europe, officials have asked for help from U.S.
law enforcement agencies to combat the growing power of Russian
organized crime figures, who launder money through diamond
merchants, according to U.S. officials in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The diamond trade, which is highly secretive and governed by
informal arrangements, has been difficult to regulate. A U.N.
embargo against buying diamonds from Unita, the Angolan rebel
movement, has been largely ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diamond revenues constitute the essential component of Unita's
capacity to wage war,'' Robert R. Fowler, Canada's ambassador to
the United Nations, wrote in a recent report to the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is reluctant to talk publicly about
what steps it is considering to curb the diamond trade in order to
avoid the perception that a regulatory regime would be imposed on
African states by the powerful West, said an administration
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Britain is also
supportive of tighter controls and is working with the
administration on proposals, U.S. and British officials said.

CAMPAIGN BY CONVICTED OFFICER'S WIFE ATTACKS LOUIMA VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
 (js) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Charles Schwarz spends 23 hours a day alone in a
small Manhattan jail cell, his wife and other relatives are
mounting a campaign maintaining that he was wrongly convicted of
helping a fellow police officer torture Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Andra Schwarz says, is to supplement the legal
arguments that her husband's lawyers plan to make in appealing his
conviction two months ago in a trial involving a case of horrific
police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the public knows and believes in us, it will be easier for
judges to see that something happened that shouldn't have
happened,'' said Mrs. Schwarz, 39, referring to the jury's verdict.
She contends that her husband's trial was unfair because the jury
did not hear all the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I write letters and reach out'' to labor unions,
national police groups, clergy members and other individuals and
organizations, she said, describing an effort to gain support for
rallies and prayer vigils that the family hopes to hold in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a full-time job,'' Ms. Schwarz said Friday, explaining
why she had not returned to her job as a paralegal at a Manhattan
law firm since the trial in federal court in Brooklyn ended June 8.
</P>
<P>
   After the jury convicted him of having joined in depriving
Louima of his civil rights, Schwarz was immediately taken to jail
to await being sentenced to as much as life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Schwarz and her husband's lawyer, Stephen C. Worth, said
that Schwarz was locked in a 6-foot-by-9-foot cell at the
Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan for 23 hours a day on
weekdays and for 24 hours on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Worth said his client was kept isolated from the general jail
population for his own protection. Former police officers are
generally segregated because they are considered prime targets for
assault by other inmates, especially if they have achieved a high
level of notoriety. Although Schwarz and his co-defendant, Justin
A. Volpe, are on the same floor, they ``don't see each other,''
Worth said.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors who convicted Schwarz found that in August 1997, he
held Louima down in a bathroom of the 70th Precinct station house
while Volpe, also an officer at the time, rammed a stick into
Louima's rectum. Louima had been arrested in a street brawl in
which the officers mistakenly thought he had punched Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   Louima suffered severe internal injuries in the attack, which
set off a furor that drew national attention and was racially
suffused because Louima, a Haitian immigrant, is black and the
officers are white.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe pleaded guilty during the trial, but Schwarz maintained
his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   And Schwarz still maintains that innocence, his wife said
Friday. ``The system failed him,'' she asserted, calling his trial
``a travesty'' because the jury had not heard an account from Volpe
that exonerated him.
</P>
<P>
   She was reflecting an argument that has been advanced by his
lawyers, but rejected by the trial judge as well as by prosecutors.
The argument, ``to put it charitably, lacks merit,'' the judge,
Eugene H. Nickerson, said a week and a half ago as he refused to
dismiss the conviction.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Volpe, too, faces up to life in prison. Sentencing dates have
not been set for either man. Both were dismissed from the police
force when they were convicted. And Schwarz faces a second trial on
a charge that he and two other officers conspired to obstruct
justice by lying to investigators about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Louima testified at the first trial that the driver of the
police car that brought him to the station house _ Schwarz,
according to police records _ held him down in the bathroom. Two
other officers testified that they saw Schwarz walk Louima,
handcuffed and with his pants down, toward the bathroom. The
prosecution said such evidence left no reasonable doubt of
Schwarz's guilt, but Worth argued that Louima and one of the other
officers had lied and that the second officer's testimony was
inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The jury did not learn that Volpe, through his lawyer, told
prosecutors during the trial that Schwarz had not participated in
the torture. But Nickerson ruled that this was because Worth had
made a ``tactical decision'' not to call Volpe as a witness, and
thus the jury's lack of knowledge on this point was not grounds for
dismissing the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Schwarz was not persuaded. ``You can make all the legal
arguments about tactics,'' but her husband did not receive a fair
trial, she insisted Friday. ``We are not going to give up.''

BRUSH FIRES MULTIPLY IN PARCHED NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ The drought in New Jersey has turned brush into
kindling along roads and railroad lines, and in forests and parks,
as a surge in unusually large brush fires has caused extensive
traffic and rail delays and further diminished the state's
dwindling water supply.
</P>
<P>
   William Cane, the director of the state's Division of Fire
Safety, said there were 444 brush fires in the state last month,
but only 171 in July last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rainfall has been below normal each month so far this year, and
during that period the state has had 1,557 brush fires, but it had
only 975 in the comparable period last year, said Cane, whose
agency monitors the state's 750 local fire departments as well as
firefighters working in state parks and forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a marked increase in fires because it doesn't
take very much to get them started,'' Cane said. ``Thank God, we
haven't had a major disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Plante, assistant division warden with the state Division
of Parks and Forestry, said that because of the drought, the brush
fires were larger than usual and burned longer. Last year the brush
fires averaged about a half-acre, and this year they are five times
that size, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when it is this dry,'' he said, ``it takes a lot more
water to put them out. Under normal conditions a two-acre fire
would require 1,000 gallons to extinguish. But we have had to put
100,000 gallons on some of them because of the depth of turf
problem below the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Plante explained that the drought had penetrated far below the
surface, especially in the state's expansive peat bogs and the
watershed over the 3 million acres his agency monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Fires on such deeply parched land can smolder for days, he said,
threatening any time to burst back into flame. To control such
fires, he said, firefighters must often lay temporary sprinklers to
keep an area wet for as long as 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence of breezes is one thing that has helped keep
things from getting out of hand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brush fires have caused many delays in recent weeks along the
state's commuter rail lines and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, said
Kenneth Miller, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit. When such fires
start, he said, local firefighters alert train dispatchers, who
hold up trains to prevent them from being damaged or endangering
firefighters working close to the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   On many days in July there were scattered brush fires near rail
lines almost daily, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On July 26 we had three, and that's unusual,'' said Miller.
``On Aug. 5 we had one in Ridgewood on the Bergen County Line that
delayed nine trains from nine minutes to 43 minutes during the
morning rush hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Cane, the state fire official, said fires were frequently caused
by discarded cigarettes, by sparks thrown from train brakes or by
hot metal parts of cars and trains touching dry brush beside roads
and railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 days ago, Plante said, a driver towed a trailer along
Interstate 80 in the far western part of the state, unaware that
one of the trailer tires was flat and that its wheel rim was
scraping the ground and sending off sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were starting little fires all along the roadside and
didn't know it,'' Plante said. ``When we can prove exactly how such
fires started, we will send the people a bill to cover the cost of
putting it out.''

A SMALL CASINO FALTERS IN THE LAND OF THE GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ Almost everybody in town _ from blackjack
dealers to retiree gamblers to the men who push the rolling chairs
along the Boardwalk _ has heard about the financial problems at the
Claridge, the smallest of the casinos, which touts itself as the
friendliest.
</P>
<P>
   But in a place that survives on stubborn optimism, many people
insist that things could get better for the Claridge, which, in
1981, was among the first casinos to open, and which recently
announced that it was planning to file for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Atlantic City casinos have gone or are going through
reorganization, even though the industry is booming _ gambling
revenues here have gone up every year since casinos arrived two
decades ago. And in that time, only one casino has actually gone
out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't too much of a surprise,'' said Lucille Pagach of
Toms River, who had come here the night before to gamble with
friends and had heard about the Claridge's troubles. ``A lot of
these hotels go into reorganization.''
</P>
<P>
   But gambling in Atlantic City today is not what it was when it
was legalized here in 1978, and industry analysts and others say
the Claridge will have to make several major changes to its small,
aging property to compete with its far bigger, far richer rivals in
an ever-more-competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   For the city's smallest casino, just off the Boardwalk in the
shadow of its giant, glitzy neighbors, the trends do not bode well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the Claridge shutting its doors and getting out of
the gaming industry altogether,'' said Michael Pollock, publisher
of Michael Pollock's Gaming Industry Observer, a newsletter that
tracks gambling trends. ``But I do see it'll need at a minimum a
large infusion of capital and to become a part of a larger gaming
company. It's swimming against a large consolidation tide.''
</P>
<P>
   The week before last, Claridge Hotel and Casino Corp., the
casino's owner, missed a deadline for a $5 million interest payment
on its debt, an $85 million mortgage taken out in 1994 in the form
of bonds to pay for expansion. The company plans to file a Chapter
11 reorganization petition, which will free it from the threat of
creditors' lawsuits pending the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   The owners also reported that the casino lost $269,000 from
April through June and lost a total of $1.5 million for the first
six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Casino officials, however, have said they are optimistic about
securing new investors who can plow more money into the company,
and they have assured their 2,200 employees that no layoffs are in
the offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process we're going through is the process established
under the law for a company to have time to do the kinds of things
you have to do to prevent going out of business, and they are not a
precursor to going out of business,'' said Robert Renneisen,
chairman and chief executive of the Claridge.
</P>
<P>
   The Claridge opened as a hotel in 1931, when Atlantic City was a
seaside playground for the middle class, in a stately red-brick
building facing the ocean. It limped through the 1970s, when many
businesses were suffering in this city in decline, until opening a
casino at the start of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many years later, Atlantic City has a dozen casinos, a new
convention center, a spruced-up entry from the new Atlantic City
expressway and a highway tunnel under construction to connect the
marina area to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The city's gambling revenues are even higher than those of Las
Vegas _ $4 billion in 1998 compared with $3.2 billion from Las
Vegas, according to the state casino commissions in both places.
(Las Vegas, however, earns more revenue from nongambling sources,
like entertainment, hotel-room receipts and other retail
enterprises.)
</P>
<P>
   Several casinos have been renovated in the last few years,
bracing for competition from two mega-casinos that are expected to
open soon. But many casino operators said they hoped that if the
bigger casinos lured more tourists for longer visits, every casino
would benefit.
</P>
<P>
   But as the game changes, it will be tougher for the smaller
players to compete. The Claridge's cash flow for the last 12 months
was about $8.5 million, compared with the Trump Taj Mahal's $131
million. Besides its smaller size, the Claridge also has to contend
with not being directly on the Boardwalk. It is about a city block
away, past a park, which makes it easy for some patrons to ignore.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CRAIG, Mont. _ Larry Taramelli stood atop the seat of the picnic
bench in front of the Missouri River Trout Shop and Lodge, smoking
in a peculiar way. Rolling the cigarette from one side of his mouth
to the other, he expelled from his nose blasts of blue smoke that
occasionally got hung up in his beard.
</P>
<P>
   He developed that smoking technique because, for a good many of
his waking hours on a typical day during trout season, Taramelli's
hands are engaged holding a fly rod.
</P>
<P>
   Taramelli removed his cigarette and gestured expansively as he
spoke: ``This rainbow trout, it was so big _ big as a small person.
Just so-o-o-o-o beautiful. I had to sit down on a big rock just to
look at the fish before I released it.''
</P>
<P>
   A growling pickup crept down the road, towing a drift boat that
squealed and clattered at every bump. It was 7:35 a.m. on yet
another cool, bright Montana morning, hard by the Rocky Mountain
front, in what may be the best little trout town on earth. Anglers
who like to flesh out their fishing trips with some quality
shopping here, a little fine dining there, may take exception to
such a lofty assessment. But hard-core trout bums like Taramelli
are a different breed. They are attuned to certain esoteric
realities that may elude the rest of us. For instance, they know
that one sure sign of a good fishing town, like Craig, is that a
railroad runs through it.
</P>
<P>
   Craig has plenty of other features to recommend itself to
fly-fishers. It is a small village, with an estimated permanent
population of about 50, although the mystifying maze of propane
tanks, satellite dishes, corrugated tin roofs, wooden sheds and
clotheslines create the impression that the number ought to be
higher. Taramelli works in the only shop in Craig, but everything
sold therein is fascinating, from the ``crippled'' version of the
Pale Morning Dun (or PMDs to those who care about this dry fly, the
one with the florescent orange, post-style wing for maximum
visibility), to handsome Loomis fly rods to Zap-a-Gap glue.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Craig also had a store called O'Connell's,
which offered bread, gasoline and milk, but the establishment has
closed down. Even though it will soon be replaced by another
restaurant, folks around here apparently care only about
essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Two 30-something fly-fishers, Jerry Lappier and Chris Goodman,
own the trout shop and lodge, an operation that is to Craig what GM
is to Detroit. Still, the word ``lodge'' is probably a misnomer, at
least insofar as it evokes images of fieldstone fireplaces and
mounted trophy moose.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the building was built for Craig Mercantile Co. on Lot
1, Block 1, back in 1887, and the Great Northern Railroad often
stopped in front of it to take on water. But in less idyllic
settings, the L-shaped, one-story building would have a neon sign
in front, reading M-O-T-E-L. There are six rooms, some of which
share a bath with other rooms, and a studio apartment that is the
de facto penthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as close as we get to luxury,'' said Lappier, a
36-year-old redhead with mischievous eyes. ``But then that's not
our stock-in-trade. Around here, it's all about the fishing. And
that's just fine with the crowd we get.''
</P>
<P>
   That crowd includes devoted fly-fishers from as far away as
Japan, France, Britain and Italy, in addition to anglers from all
over the United States. They are lured to Montana and the Missouri
River between the cities of Helena and Great Falls by the challenge
of catching and releasing rainbow and brown trout. The trout here
often grow to over 20 inches, and are more prone to feed on the
surface all day long, at least at certain times of the year, than
the fish on many of Montana's other prime trout rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Shaped by three reservoirs that discharge volumes of cold,
nutrient-rich water, the Missouri is a broad, even-tempered river
with a prodigious population of aquatic insects. Living among the
river's lush weed beds, they hatch en masse, creating rafts of
caddis and mayflies that the trout sip and slurp off the glassy
surface as if they were dim sum.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a catch: In order to fool the fish, a
fly-fisher must use the correct floating fly pattern, and present
it with a natural drift over fish that have all the time in the
world to examine each morsel, and a zillion other choices if they
don't like what they see. On the Missouri, there are no desperate
trout ready to fling themselves on anything that resembles food.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely for this reason that the most hard-bitten of
anglers fish the Missouri and embrace the stark simplicity of
Craig.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy isn't usually interesting or ennobling,'' said Frank
Rodriguez, a Portland, Ore., schoolteacher, who stops regularly on
the Missouri during an annual two-month fishing and camping tour of
the great Western trout streams. Rodriguez, in his mid-50s, has
outgrown the basic challenge of the Missouri for an even more
daunting discipline. He fishes exclusively for ``bank feeders,''
those impossibly difficult _ and, often, impossibly large _ trout
that live and feed in virtually inaccessible lies beneath
overhanging bushes or beside deadfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm consumed by the delicacy and accuracy required by this
kind of fishing,'' he said. ``I don't need to catch dozens of trout
to be happy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But even Rodriguez occasionally needs to come in out of the wet.
After nightfall, he often pulls back the squeaky screen door and
joins other anglers in the only place to eat in Craig _ yep, the
trout shop cafe. Some nights, defeated anglers sit staring into
their coffee, some perhaps wondering what they are doing in Craig.
On other nights, when the fishing has been good, the gathering is
raucous.
</P>
<P>
   The trout shop cafe, long known to anglers for its home-baked
cherry and blueberry pies, now features an authentic chef in Mark
Raisler, but he isn't even tempted to ply his trade in more
gourmet-friendly precincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to cook but I'm working here because of the fishing,''
Raisler said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers are free to shuttle back and forth across the dusty
parking lot to the beer joint, a squat building the color of algae,
languishing beneath a towering cottonwood tree. Real cowboys drink
there, often while picking at guitars. The name of this place, as
it appears in the pink neon sign atop the building, is easy to
remember: Bar.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the trout shop and bar are the only two businesses in
downtown Craig, and that at any given time you're apt to find more
dogs than people wandering the streets, Craig begs to be called a
one-horse town. Technically, though, that wouldn't be accurate: The
gray mare that once pastured next to the trout shop is gone now.
But the Missouri is still there, rolling by the town that would
have no trouble coming up with a tourist friendly slogan: Trout
Count.

PUTTING AMERICA'S CUP AT ONE'S FINGERTIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No longer do the armchair sailors of the world need to feel left
out. With innovations in cyberspace about to revolutionize yacht
racing, coverage of the America's Cup trials this autumn will offer
viewers at home everything but the chance to get seasick.
</P>
<P>
   Gearing up for the challenger trials, which begin Oct. 18 in New
Zealand, is Virtual Spectator Ltd. The new Internet company will
offer viewers live coverage of cup competition; it will be as if
viewers were on the race course itself. If it were baseball, the
firm says, it would be like sitting in a stadium seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will allow you to literally be 1,000 feet in the air
watching, or to zoom down to the water level as if you were beside
each boat watching the yachts move around you,'' Craig Meek,
director of Virtual Spectator, said in an interview from Auckland,
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   The service provides a way around one of the biggest obstacles
blocking yachting's acceptance as a spectator sport: making the
event accessible to fans when it is staged several miles offshore.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers to Virtual Spectator will receive a CD-ROM that will
open animated 3-D graphics in a virtual-reality format. Each race
will be transmitted to individual spectators in real time from the
Hauraki Gulf, the race-course site off Auckland. Telemetry data
emitted directly from each race boat will provide instantaneous
tracking of position and relative speed.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers access the live race coverage by logging on to the World
Wide Web with personal computers. Registration for the subscriber
service opened last Thursday on the company's Internet site, which
is www.virtualspectator.com. Access is limited to 100,000
subscribers worldwide at a one-time cost of $69.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the site's interactive zoom feature, the service will
transmit a split screen that includes a real-time indicator showing
actual wind direction and velocity. A course drawing will show
competing boats' positions followed by the course marked with a
graphics ``snail trial.'' At the bottom of the screen will be a
score card with time differences for each mark rounding.
</P>
<P>
   People whose schedules do not mesh with Auckland time _ 16 hours
ahead of New York time _ can log on to the site and call up any
previously sailed race in the challengers series. The company will
also e-mail its subscribers each day to let them know the day's
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   As a high-profile way of showing off its America's Cup Web site,
Virtual Spectator is arranging to set up a large computer screen
that will transmit race coverage at Wall Street in New York. Louis
Vuitton, the French leather-goods company, will disseminate cup
race results as part of its sponsorship agreement with challengers.
Vuitton has enlisted Virtual Spectator as its official tracking
site.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen international teams, including five U.S. syndicates,
are competing as challengers. Their round-robin trials end in late
January with a best-of-9, two-boat final series. The winner is
scheduled to race New Zealand, the America's Cup defender,
beginning Feb. 19, 2000, for rights to the prestigious 19th-Century
trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Virtual Spectator will most likely offer the most
animated live coverage, there will be other ways of tuning in to
the early races. ESPN, the cable sports network, plans on more than
70 hours of programming. The challengers' trials will be shown
through early feature presentations. Live broadcasts will begin
with the semifinal racing in January.
</P>
<P>
   Another outlet for online coverage of America's Cup 2000 will be
Quokka Sports, a digital sports entertainment company. The firm's
first online endeavor was the 1997-98 Whitbread Round the World
Race. Personal insights on the race from crew members at sea
provided chilling accounts of life on the open ocean for Quokka's
Web-site browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that popularity _ more than 1.8 million different
online visitors during the nine-month event _ Quokka has moved into
other sports arenas, like the Olympics and adventure programming.
</P>
<P>
   Quokka's America's Cup coverage, which will be free to users at
www.americascup.org, will include input from America's Cup 2000,
which is New Zealand's race organizer, and Telecom New Zealand, the
local telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be immersion coverage,'' Brian Terkelsen, general
manager of Quokka's cup programming, said last week. ``We will have
all the same information as Virtual Spectator with the exception of
boat-positioning data. But our reporting will be live with
momentary updates combined with our own photos right off the race
course. We believe there will be a great demand.''

RACIAL DISPARITY: BLACK WOMEN DIE MORE OFTEN IN CHILDBIRTH
</HEADLINE>
 
(REPEATING to delete photo note)  
 (ATTN: Conn., D.C., Ga., Mo.)  (Eds: Kristiina in 3rd-to-last cq.) 
(nk) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eight months pregnant, Deborah Edwards smoothed a
thin hospital gown over her bulging belly, nibbled at a graham
cracker and ticked off the reasons she had spent a week confined to
the maternity ward of George Washington University Hospital here.
</P>
<P>
   At 42 she is, in medical parlance, of ``advanced maternal age.''
She had no prenatal care until last month: after 20 years of
marriage and two adopted children, she had no idea she was
pregnant. She weighs 208 pounds, up from 196. She has diabetes,
which puts her baby in danger. And her high blood pressure has
worsened into pre-eclampsia, a condition that could kill her if it
is not carefully monitored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned,'' she said, ``but I'm not worried. I know I'm
being cared for.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a good thing, because Mrs. Edwards possesses another
characteristic that statistically puts her at risk during delivery:
She is black.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the Clinton administration has set a goal of
eliminating racial disparities in health by the year 2010, medical
experts are struggling to understand one of the most glaring, and
least talked about, disparities of all: death in childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   In a study made public this spring, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta reported that black women in the
United States were nearly four times as likely to die during
delivery, or shortly thereafter, as white women. The disparity,
which has remained about the same for the last four decades, holds
true even for women who, like Mrs. Edwards, are middle class and
have health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The findings _ coupled with the awareness-raising efforts of a
Connecticut man whose wife died in child birth _ have renewed
interest among scientists and legislators in a problem that many
people think no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The issue is also making for strange political bedfellows in
Washington. On Tuesday, Reps. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., and Jo Ann
Emerson, R-Mo., convened a panel of doctors, women's health
advocates and CDC officials to discuss maternal mortality and
garner support for a bill, introduced in June, that would provide
additional federal money to study it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get together, whether Democrat or Republican,
pro-choice or pro-life, white or black,'' Ms. Lowey said, ``to get
the best research, the comprehensive data, the right programs.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dying in childbirth, in this country at least, is still
extremely rare. But several facts trouble federal health officials.
First, while infant mortality has declined steadily over the last
decade, maternal deaths have remained unchanged, and experts think
as many as 70 percent could be prevented. Second, the 4-to-1 racial
disparity in maternal deaths is among the greatest gaps in public
health. (The gap is narrower for more common problems, including
infant mortality.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the most recent year for which statistics are
available, 327 women died in childbirth in the United States. When
the CDC examined deaths over a nine-year period, from 1987 to 1996,
it found that one black woman died for every 5,102 who gave birth;
among white women, the figure was one in 18,868. While the deaths
are few, said Dr. David Satcher, the U.S. surgeon general, ``the
disparity is important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were comparing black women in this country with women in
Tanzania,'' Satcher said, ``we would be talking about how great we
are doing. We are not. In this country, we have a certain standard
of expectation about the risk of women dying in pregnancy, and
black women are off the scale right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this are varied, and not well understood. Black
women are more prone to obesity, hypertension and diabetes,
conditions that can complicate pregnancy. Poverty plays a role, as
does the drug and alcohol abuse that sometimes goes along with it,
experts say. So, too, does poor prenatal care.
</P>
<P>
   Yet black and white women generally suffer the same types of
complications. For every maternal death, CDC officials say, 1,600
women are admitted to hospitals for pregnancy complications that
are not related to delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paradox that we have is that mortality is about four to
five times higher among blacks, but morbidity, or complications,
are only 1.5 times higher,'' as measured by hospital admissions,
said Dr. Hani Atrash, chief of the CDC's pregnancy and infant
health branch. ``What worries me most is that it may be true that
blacks and whites have the same rate of complications,'' he said,
but blacks may seek medical care ``at a later stage and with more
serious conditions, and therefore their mortality is higher.''
</P>
<P>
   In the District of Columbia, where the majority of residents are
black, these numbers come as no surprise to doctors; the rate at
which women die in childbirth is higher here than anywhere else in
the country. At D.C. General Hospital, the city's largest public
hospital, as many as three-quarters of all maternity patients are
high risk.
</P>
<P>
   Most obstetricians are afraid to talk about losing patients. But
the doctors at D.C. General are surprisingly direct. Dr. John S.
Selden, who has worked at the hospital on and off for the last 13
years, told of a death that occurred just a few months ago: a woman
in her early 30s, already a mother of six, suffered an amniotic
fluid embolism, an extremely rare condition in which fluid from her
womb escaped into the bloodstream and lodged in her lung. She died
on the operating table, moments after a Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was alive and alert to the point where the baby was out,''
Selden said. ``The nurses showed her the baby. I'm sure that's the
last thing she remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Selden said there was no way to predict the woman's death, and
outside experts agreed. But, they said, if scientists and public
health officials spent more time researching maternal mortality,
they might find ways to better handle _ or even to prevent _ such
unpredictable complications, so that they did not escalate into
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   One researcher, Dr. Roberto Romero, chief of the perinatology
research branch at the National Institute on Child Health and Human
Development, suspects that amniotic fluid embolism is, in fact, a
``chronic process that could be identified in women who are
admitted to the hospital.'' Romero said he was planning a study of
the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, officials at the CDC, as well as at the
American College of Gynecologists, are pressing state health
officials to resurrect the practice of performing maternal death
reviews. Currently, said Dr. Jeffrey C. King, who is leading the
effort for the obstetricians' group, only 25 states conduct
in-depth examinations every time a pregnant woman dies.
</P>
<P>
   But even where the reviews are conducted, some say, they are not
always thorough enough. Dr. Janet L. Mitchell, a New York City
obstetrician who performed reviews for the city until a few years
ago, said she wanted to interview relatives of women who died, in
an effort to understand how socioeconomics and lifestyle contribute
to the racial gap. But she could not get government financing for
the work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to back away from the medical causes,'' she said,
``and begin to take a much more ethnographic, anthropological
approach to analyzing this tragic outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Black or white, the tragedy of death in childbirth cannot be
underestimated. Five years ago, Arny Goodman, who is white, became
a widower and a single father when his wife, Deborah Sorkin,
suffered a catastrophic hemorrhage while delivering their second
child, a baby girl. Ms. Sorkin was 38; the couple's newborn
daughter died, as well. Goodman was left with the task of telling
his son, who was not quite 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Andrew, Mommy's not coming home again, ever.' He just
froze. He instantly knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, who lives in Manchester, Conn., a suburb of Hartford,
said his wife suffered placenta accreta, in which the placenta
burrows deep into the uterine wall, intertwining itself with the
blood vessels. Goodman responded by suing the state of Connecticut,
which owns the hospital where his wife died, and turning himself
into an expert on placenta accreta. He began a one-man crusade to
heighten scientific interest in the condition and in maternal
mortality in general.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development held a two-day conference on postpartum hemorrhage and
placenta accreta, and invited Goodman to speak.
</P>
<P>
   He said he told the conference, ``There has got to be some
uniform way of having a doctor look at these risk factors, utilize
ultrasound and arrive at a high index of suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman settled his suit with Connecticut; he said he cannot
discuss the terms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mitchell, the New York obstetrician, says Goodman's vehemence
illustrates a cultural difference in the way many blacks and whites
respond to unexpected deaths, a difference she said helped explain
why blacks had not been more vocal. The National Black Women's
Health Project, an advocacy group in Washington, recently has begun
to try to collect stories of black women who have died in
childbirth or been affected by pregnancy complications. But
Mitchell said that when she worked at Harlem Hospital, she tried to
start a support group for black mothers whose babies had died.
Nobody came.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are cultural differences in grieving,'' she said. ``For
communities of color, especially those of African descent, it tends
to be much more individual, spiritual and inward. They don't have a
need to be in a support group. They would much rather do this
privately.''
</P>
<P>
   That same sense of spirituality has been both a guide and
comfort to Deborah Edwards, the George Washington University
Hospital patient, during her difficult pregnancy. Mrs. Edwards, who
is a deacon in her church, said she had no intention of becoming a
terrible statistic. She is now watching her diet carefully,
something she has never done before, and her obstetrician, Dr.
Kristiina Parviainen, says she follows doctors' orders with
precision.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Parviainen debated the length of her hospital stay,
Mrs. Edwards was looking to a higher authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm believing in the Lord,'' she said. ``He knew my health
condition before I got pregnant. He knew my age before I got
pregnant. If he decides, at 42, to bless us with a baby ... .'' Her
voice trailed off for a bit. ``I just believe in the Lord.''

 &HT;    Crossing the line: Goal is more minority lawyers
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _William G. Paul, a fifth-generation Oklahoman and
former general counsel of Phillips Petroleum Co., will be sworn in
this week as the new president of the American Bar Association
during the group's annual meeting in Atlanta. Paul, 68, a member of
the Oklahoma City law firm of Crowe &AMP; Dunlevy, will serve a
one-year term.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the 400,000-member ABA, Paul's main initiative
is to increase minority participation in the legal profession. He
and his wife, Barbara, recently gave $50,000 to the new ABA Legal
Opportunity Scholarship Fund as part of the initiative. In a recent
interview with Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writer Bill
Rankin, Paul discussed his plans for the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the level of minority participation in the legal
profession, and why does the ABA need to increase the level now?
</P>
<P>
   A: The population of our country today is 30 percent of color,
and we're moving to a population of 50 percent of color within a
few decades. The legal profession is 92.5 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   This disparity is extremely important because the legal
profession is the connecting link between the people, society and
the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   We all want to continue to live under the rule of law. The legal
profession must reflect society or it cannot serve as that
connecting link.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the ABA doing about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: We've got five action groups working on it: a legal education
group, primarily deans of law schools; a corporate counsel group,
headed up by Charles Morgan, the general counsel of BellSouth,
who's a real leader in this field; the private law firm and bar
association group; the judicial clerkship group; and a financial
aid and scholarship fund-raising group.
</P>
<P>
   We need to harness all of our resources to gain the interest of
young people who are members of racial and ethnic minorities in
attending law schools. ... But then we've got to help them and
support them. Legal educators tell us that to make significant
progress, we've got to have financial support for them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where will the money come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: At this meeting, we're kicking off the ABA Legal Opportunity
Scholarship Fund. In two weeks, we have already raised $200,000.
Our goal is $1 million this year, and we have higher aspirations
than that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the main obstacles facing members of ethnic and
racial minorities who want to begin a career in the law?
</P>
<P>
   A: ... A phrase I've heard a lot is ``critical mass.'' A person
of color looks at a law school and thinks of going there and looks
at the faculty, and there's nobody on the faculty who's a minority,
or there's only one or two, and that's a negative. Or they look at
the student body and there's just a sprinkling of minority
students, and the words I've heard are, ``There's no critical
mass.'' You've got to have a critical mass for this to work, for it
to be attractive.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the impediments, some of the things we've got
to address. ... There is some good news in the law schools. The
student bodies today of the ABA-accredited law schools, and that's
almost all of them in the country, are about 20 percent people of
color. That's a good number, but it's not good enough when the
population is 30 percent, galloping toward 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are other problems facing the legal profession?
</P>
<P>
   A: Anecdotal evidence shows that we in the legal profession are
becoming separated from the people we serve. One reason is that our
delivery system _ the way we deliver legal services _ just doesn't
fit today's environment the way it fit 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What we're seeing in the world of e-commerce on the Internet is
that people want instant communication.
</P>
<P>
   So technology, through the Internet, may be the road to enable
us to reach tens of millions of clients and potential clients who
are not being served and who do not now have meaningful access to
the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Georgia, the General Assembly enacted a law this year
banning the filing of lawsuits against the gun industry just four
days after the city of Atlanta had filed such a lawsuit. Other
state legislatures as well as Congress have been enacting
legislation curtailing the types of lawsuits that can be filed and
the amount of awards plaintiffs can receive. Is this a threat to
justice?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, it's not a threat to justice. ... We lawyers take the law
as we find it. The people give it to us through the Constitution
and through the legislature. If the people of the state of Georgia
say it will be the public policy of this state that no lawsuits can
be filed by municipalities against the gun industry, that's the
law.
</P>
<P>
   What is important is that the legal profession maintains its
independence. There's got to be a lawyer out there somewhere to
represent every cause, every position, every point of view. The
quicker the people of our country can come to understand that, the
better off we'll all be.
</P>
<P>
   There ought to be a lawyer out there somewhere who's willing to
take a case to test the constitutionality of Georgia's new law. And
society ought to applaud that.

<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ They work from basement offices, with dim
fluorescent light. Faded posters and almanacs depict Fidel Castro,
Che Guevara and martyrs killed long ago, and these aging
Palestinian leaders, too, seem relics of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Once, George Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh were Palestinian
revolutionaries in deed as well as word, leading guerrilla warfare
against Israel from Jordan and Lebanon. One is remembered by some
as a hijacker, the other as a killer, though it has been more than
a decade since they and their groups suspended their armed
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they live in limbo, not wanted by Israel and wanting no
part of the peace sought by Yasser Arafat, the mainstream leader of
the Palestinian Authority. Damascus is their haven, as it has been
for years, and this city is home, too, to even more radical
Palestinians, like Ahmed Jibril, whose group has yet to unshoulder
its arms.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has played host with gusto, even though guests like Habash
and Hawatmeh have for many years remained largely out of Western
view. But the presence of such men now could prove a complication
to the rekindling of peace talk between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly, Syria's role as host served to tweak Arafat, who is
regarded by the leaders here as a traitor to the Arab cause for
making a separate peace. And by allowing the groups to operate in
Lebanon, where it is a dominant power, Syria has kept pressure on
the Israelis as well.
</P>
<P>
   But if Syria is to enter a new and determined peace effort with
Israel, what is to become of these radical Palestinian leaders now?
</P>
<P>
   ``According to one story, when one of the Palestinian leaders
asked the Syrians what he should do if peace comes, the answer was,
`Buy a farm,''' said a diplomat, conjuring up an image of one-time
terrorists in bucolic retirement.
</P>
<P>
   A desire to achieve peace with Israel in the months ahead would
present Syria with competing goals. It would almost certainly
require some reining in of the Palestinian groups, which could lead
to lifting of American economic sanctions on Syria.
</P>
<P>
   But limiting actions by the groups could also cause bad feelings
among exiled Palestinians, who include 700,000 refugees in Syria
and Lebanon _ particularly if a crackdown preceded a comprehensive
settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, which is to
determine the refugees' final status.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said one well-connected Syrian, ``I don't think many of
these guys are looking at a long-term active future in Damascus.''
</P>
<P>
   The radical Palestinian groups in Syria and Lebanon cover a wide
range. On the most radical extreme, perhaps, is Jibril's Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, whose forces
are involved in attacks against Israeli forces in southern Lebanon,
sometimes in conjunction with Syrian-backed Lebanese groups like
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   The group's barracks in the southern suburbs of Beirut and in
the Bekaa region of Lebanon are regularly the target of Israeli air
raids.
</P>
<P>
   Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
which was an active fighting force from 1964 to 1987, is at the
other end of the spectrum. Now it is more of a social and political
body that opposes Arafat's Fatah faction and that operates openly
not only in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, but also in Gaza and the
West Bank, where Arafat is leader of the limited self-rule
Palestinian government.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to terrorism, Syria has usually been deft in
trying to keep its hands just as clean as necessary. It does not
allow the radical Palestinians to carry out any operations from its
soil, and about the most radical statements that emerge from
Damascus are carried on Jibril's radio station, Al Quds.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is no evidence, the State Department has said, of
direct Syrian involvement in terrorist acts since 1986. At about
that time, under American pressure, the Syrians expelled the
notorious Abu Nidal. But the fact that Syria provides safe haven
and support to the most violent of the Palestinian rejectionists,
including Jibril's group and Islamic Jihad, is among the reasons
cited by the State Department for Syria's continuation on the
terrorism list.
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews here, Hawatmeh and Habash, who is the
leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said
they were confident that their operations would continue without
interruption, even in the case of a Syrian-Israeli peace.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, Hawatmeh, a committed leftist who was born a
Greek Catholic in Salt, Jordan, led a Palestinian faction that lost
5,000 men in violence between 1965 and 1987, he said. Among the
acts for which he was labeled a terrorist by Israel was the 1974
takeover of a school in the Israeli town of Maalot by his
organization.
</P>
<P>
   In that hostage operation, more than 20 schoolchildren were
killed. Now Hawatmeh is 63, a slight man with a gentle demeanor who
sits beneath a tattered banner that traces the outlines of historic
Palestine and declares: ``God Bless Our Homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Habash, 72, was born in what is now Lod, Israel, to a Greek
Orthodox family, studied medicine, and went on to lead what became
the second-largest Palestinian group. He was an ardent Marxist
revolutionary and steadfast opponent of Israel's right to exist who
pioneered the tactic of airline hijackings in the late 1960s and
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   His most infamous act came in 1970, when his organization blew
up three airliners after parking them for a week in Jordan's
desert. ``When we hijack a plane it has more effect than if we
killed a hundred Israelis in battle,'' Habash once said. ``At least
the world is talking about us now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Today, Habash tires easily, his right side almost immobile from
a stroke suffered more than a decade ago. In 1992, France allowed
him to enter the country for medical treatment, but that turned
into a political scandal, with Jewish leaders and some French and
Israeli politicians calling for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The paths of the two men took them to Jordan, on to Lebanon, and
then, after the Israeli invasion of 1982 sent the Palestinians in
flight, on different tracks. Habash took refuge in Syria and
Hawatmeh went first to Algeria, where he stayed for nine years.
Their military operations stopped in 1987, when the Palestinian
focus shifted to the West Bank and Gaza, and the beginning of the
intifada, the uprising against the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they run what are effectively political parties, both
strongly opposed to Arafat's pursuit of what they regard as a
deeply flawed peace. Their separate headquarters are near each
other, in a largely residential neighborhood, and their dingy
quarters with dated decor make it appear that time has all but
stood still.
</P>
<P>
   Hawatmeh suggested that the newer Palestinian groups that still
embrace violence, like Islamic Jihad, are more likely to face
Syrian restrictions. ``If there is a comprehensive peace between
Syria and Israel, I think the Syrians will say frankly to these
groups that they cannot continue military struggle,'' Hawatmeh
said.
</P>
<P>
   In subtle ways, it appears that that message is already being
sent, Western diplomats and well-connected Syrians say. After a
meeting last month between the Syrian vice president, Abdelhalim
Khaddam, and the leaders of some organizations, including Habash,
there were news reports that Khaddam had gone so far as to call on
the groups to halt armed activities in Lebanon now, in preparation
for a possible peace.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian authorities denied that, and Habash told a visitor that
he had heard no such instructions. In an interview, Syria's
information minister, Mohammed Salman, said that nothing about the
role played by the Palestinian groups in Syrian or Jordan had
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such measures would be a reward to Barak,'' Salman said,
referring to Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel. ``Why should
Syria reward Barak in spite of the fact that he has done nothing
yet to move the peace process forward?'' But Salman seemed to leave
the door open to future limits on the more militant Palestinian
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian groups that exist in Syria have the right to
exert political and informational activities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   People with knowledge of the talks said that some of the more
radical Palestinian groups in Damascus, including the one led by
Jibril, who is in his 60s, were working overtime to digest what
they had heard as a clear signal.
</P>
<P>
   Khaddam, these people said, had simply observed that a
Syrian-Israeli peace might come within a year, and either
implicitly or explicitly said there might be a need for the
Palestinians to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Damascus-based diplomats say it is unlikely that Syria would
expel members of the radical groups, even after a signed peace.
Such a step could tarnish Syria's claim that it, and not Arafat, is
the true defender of the Palestinian cause and of the right of the
refugees to return to their homeland. The diplomats say Syria would
be more likely to close some training camps and to enforce an order
for the fighters to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Radical leaders like Habash say they have no intention of
leaving Syria any time soon. Only if Arafat can somehow win a
promise that every Palestinian refugee will be allowed a right to
return, Habash said, will he shake hands with his rival and
conclude that the cause has been won.
</P>
<P>
   Hawatmeh, on the other hand, would like to visit the West Bank
and Gaza. He still disagrees deeply with Arafat, but at a time when
the Palestinians and Israel may be about to begin a final stage of
negotiations, it is his duty, he said, to make a personal appeal to
the Palestinian leader not to give up too much.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent past, Palestinians far more notorious than he,
including Mohammed Abbas, the mastermind of the 1985 hijacking of
the cruise ship Achille Lauro, have been able to win the necessary
permission from the Israelis to return. But despite three years of
trying, Hawatmeh said, he has been unable to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The awkwardness of his position was underscored in February,
when a quick handshake with Israel's president, Ezer Weizman, at
the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan, created an Israeli political
firestorm that may have added to his troubles. At the time,
Benjamin Netanyahu, then Israel's prime minister, acidly declared,
``Today he remains committed to the murder of the Jews.''

IN CENTRAL HARLEM, CO-OPS AND STORES ARE RISING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN S. OSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In central Harlem, 125th Street is the principal
commercial thoroughfare as well as having been the main focus over
the years of public efforts to stimulate Harlem's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   But in its own way 116th Street has been coming on strong.
Stretches of this crosstown thoroughfare show the signs of
long-term housing improvement, and more recently new three-story
houses have made their appearance on neighboring streets near Lenox
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Now a $61 million mixed-use project has gone into construction
on the east side of Lenox Avenue from 116th to 117th Street, the
largest expression so far of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
administration's emphasis on neighborhood retail development.
</P>
<P>
   Under the banner of the ANCHOR program, the city has been trying
to induce retail development in locations where houses have been
built under the New York City Housing Partnership program. The
acronym ANCHOR stands for Alliance for Neighborhood Commerce, Home
Ownership and Revitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The 116th Street development, called Renaissance Plaza, will
provide 60,000 square feet of stores, stretching all around the
base of a mixed-use building in which there will be 241 moderately
priced co-op apartments and parking for 200 cars.
</P>
<P>
   The site is diagonally across the street from the Malcolm
Shabazz Mosque, whose religious leader, Imam Izak-el M. Pasha, is
the community sponsor. The site is also at the express subway stop
for the No. 2 and 3 trains, which take riders to midtown in 10
minutes, a notable marketing asset.
</P>
<P>
   The city-designated developer is Suna Levine Inc., a partnership
of Stuart Match Suna and Jeffrey Levine. Suna is a partner in Metro
Management Development, a Queens-based management firm, and
president of Silvercup Studios in Long Island City. Levine is the
principal in Levine Builders of Douglaston, Queens, which is
handling the construction.
</P>
<P>
   The ANCHOR program, administered by the Department of Housing
Preservation and Development in cooperation with the Housing
Partnership, is a departure for a local housing agency.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do housing agencies involve themselves with store
development, especially when the stores serve a wide community
purpose. And among ANCHOR projects Renaissance Plaza is unusual
because the stores are a separately financed element in a building
of scale at a central urban location.
</P>
<P>
   The co-op sales will test the strength of the co-op sales market
in central Harlem. Although the prices will assure a largely
moderate-income occupancy, the eligibility limits are high enough
to accommodate many middle-income buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The apartments are expected to sell for about $160 a square foot
when they go on the market in about six months, once the offering
plan is approved by the New York state attorney general's office.
At that price, a 900-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment with one
bath would sell for about $140,000, with a down payment requirement
of 5 percent, or $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly maintenance charge would be about $1,165, covering
operating expenses, the underlying mortgage and property taxes,
which are abated in the early years. A three-bedroom, two-bath
apartment, with about 1,200 square feet, would sell for $192,000,
with a monthly maintenance of $1,550.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment mix is nine one-bedrooms, 129 two-bedrooms with
one bath, 13 two-bedrooms with two baths and 89 three-bedrooms.
Occupancy is expected to begin in the summer of 2001. Suna Levine,
at Silvercup Studios, is handling buyer applications.
</P>
<P>
   The developer must sell 75 percent of the apartments to buyers
earning no more than 165 percent of areawide median income, which
translates to a maximum income of $88,100 a year for a family of
four. The rest of the apartments can be sold to households earning
up to 250 percent of median income, or $133,500 for a family of
four.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried for a solid, dignified building, which the
community was asking for,'' said Navid Maqami, head of the New York
office of the Atlanta-based firm of Greenberg Farrow Architecture,
who designed the building. It will rise 11 stories on Lenox Avenue,
and step down to eight floors facing 116th Street and six floors
facing 117th Street, with a 10,000-square-foot landscaped courtyard
between these elements on the roof of the stores.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiastic collaboration of Pasha has been a key element
in this and other nearby development projects. Born and raised in
Brooklyn in the '50s and '60s, Pasha worked as a plumber on major
construction jobs, including the low-income Nehemiah project in
East Brooklyn, before he was named to lead the Shabazz mosque by
his late predecessor, Ali Rashid, in 1993. Since then he has been
an advocate of racial harmony and community development. ``We're
all family here in New York,'' he once remarked in a sermon.

</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Pasha cooperated with the city in relocating street
vendors from 125th Street on an interim basis to the cleared 116th
Street development site. Their forced ouster had incited a protest
requiring police action. With redevelopment at hand, the vendors
were moved again last year to another interim site, at 116th Street
and Fifth Avenue, and only two months ago they moved to a long-term
site in the newly built Malcolm Shabazz Harlem Market.
</P>
<P>
   The market consists of 116 small stores with neat signs and
awnings lined up along several narrow pathways on 22,700 square
feet of city-owned land. It was built with city funds on the south
side of 116th Street between Fifth Avenue and Lenox Avenue. David
Danois of Manhattan was the architect.
</P>
<P>
   While city officials were dealing with the vendor issue, the
Suna Levine partnership was trying to line up commercial tenants.
Rite Aid, the drugstore chain, had signed on for 12,300 square feet
in 1997, and Petland Discounts had committed to 2,400 square feet
last February. Rents are expected to average about $25 a square
foot a year.
</P>
<P>
   But it was necessary to prelease 50 percent of the commercial
space, or 30,000 square feet, to creditworthy tenants to nail down
the financing for the $14-million commercial component, Levine
said. The government-backed financing package needed a co-insurance
commitment from the State of New York Mortgage Agency on the first
mortgage loan, and 50 percent preleasing to creditworthy borrowers
was a requirement of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial lease was signed in December by Pioneer Supermarkets
for 20,600 square feet. Pioneer has a market a third the size in
rented space on the northwest corner of Lenox Avenue and 116th
Street. The 20,000-square-foot building will become a redevelopment
candidate when Pioneer moves. Since then, Ashley Stewart, a women's
clothing store, has leased 12,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan Bank is the lead construction lender for the
project. The permanent financing on the commercial condominium
consists of a first mortgage of $10.8 million from the New York
City Employees Retirement System, plus $3 million in state and
federal money at 3 percent interest to reduce the overall debt
burden.
</P>
<P>
   The residential component's first mortgage is a 35-year, 7.15
percent loan of $31.6 million from the city's Housing Development
Corp. To make carrying costs more affordable to buyers, the co-op
will also have two city loans totaling $13.2 million, one of $6.9
million at 1 percent interest from the Housing Development Corp.
and another of $6.3 million at zero interest from the Department of
Housing Preservation and Development.
</P>
<P>
   The Shabazz mosque is also the sponsor of for-sale housing in
the neighborhood. The Bluestone Organization, of Queens, is well
advanced in the construction of Shabazz Gardens, 34 three-family
houses on 117th Street west of Lenox Avenue and seven more on 118th
Street east of Lenox. Sales contracts have been signed for all of
them _ 21 houses at $223,000, and 20 at $278,500, said Ira
Lichtiger, a partner in the Bluestone Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Because federal funds were used, half of these three-family
houses had to be sold to buyers earning no more than about $40,000
a year _ 80 percent of areawide median income. Using Fannie Mae
underwriting standards, the lender is allowed to count as income 60
percent of the total rent the buyer is expected to receive _ in
this case an estimated $1,650 for the two apartments _ making the
houses affordable.
</P>
<P>
   At Renaissance Plaza, Robert Greenstone Realty of Manhattan is
handling the store leasing. With more than half the space already
leased, he is looking for stores that provide services that
complement those already in place, he said. ``I'm looking for
shoes, I'm looking for hardware, I'm looking for electronics, I'm
looking for music,'' Greenstone said. ``It's nuts-and-bolts
retailing going into a neighborhood with nothing to serve people's
needs.''

REAL ESTATE: RESTORING CLEVELAND'S HISTORIC ARCADES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT SHAROFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The renovation of three historic arcades downtown is
sparking hopes that the city's long-moribund Euclid Avenue retail
strip will be reborn as a mixed-use street of shops, hotels and
condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Euclid Avenue is, or was, to Cleveland what Fifth Avenue is to
New York and Michigan Avenue is to Chicago: the main downtown
avenue for shopping and sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the turn of the century, it was compared with the Unter den
Linden in Berlin and the Champs-Elysees in Paris,'' said Ted Sande,
deputy director of the Cleveland Restoration Society, a nonprofit
group dedicated to preserving historic architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the glory has faded. Of the four department stores that
dominated the street, only one, the former Higbee's, now operating
under the Dillard's nameplate, remains. The rest of the street
consists mainly of four- to six-story buildings with first-floor
stores and office space above that. They date from as early as 1870
but are interspersed with a few newer and larger buildings and have
been in decline for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the older buildings do not work as office space any
more,'' said Richard Sheehan, vice president and director of retail
services for the local office of Grubb &AMP; Ellis Co., a national real
estate concern with offices downtown. ``They do, however, work for
hotels and residential units.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, two developers _ with considerable help from the mayor's
office, which has repeatedly singled out the revitalization of
Euclid Avenue as a key development goal _ are stepping forward with
projects that not only promise to inject new life into the street
but also will save and restore three of the most remarkable
structures in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   The three are the Old Arcade, at 402 Euclid Ave., and the
Colonial and Euclid arcades across the street. The developer of the
Old Arcade is Bruce Abrams, owner of LR Development in Chicago, a
company that specializes in historic renovation projects.
</P>
<P>
   The Colonial and the Euclid are being renovated by a partnership
of John Carney, Robert Rains and John Marcus. Carney and Rains have
developed a number of downtown residential projects, while Marcus'
family has owned the two arcades for over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The arcade is a European concept _ one thinks of the Galleria
Vittorio Emanuele in Milan, Italy, and the Burlington and
Piccadilly arcades in London _ that never really caught on in the
United States until they were reborn as enclosed shopping malls
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, for reasons no one is quite sure of, has three of the
covered shopping passageways on the same block. (A fourth, which
was further up the street, was torn down in the 1960s.)
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular is the Old Arcade, which was built in 1890
with $867,000 raised from a consortium of local businessmen that
included John D. Rockefeller. The architects were George H. Smith
and John Eisenmann, both of whom had long careers in Cleveland.
Smith also designed the Colonial Arcade.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 50 years, the building was the home of some of the
city's finest carriage-trade retailers. One of the more notable
tenants was the Stouffers restaurant chain, which began there as a
stand-up milk bar in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Properly speaking, the Old Arcade is actually three buildings _
two nine-story Romanesque office towers separated by a five-story,
600-foot-long arcade topped with an elaborate glass skylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really majestic,'' said Jonathan Sandvick, president of
Sandvick Architects, a Cleveland concern that is handling the
renovation. ``I can remember coming down here as a child with my
grandmother on the streetcar and being awed by the space. It's one
of the things that made me want to be an architect.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The interior is a riot of cast-iron columns and trusses,
terrazzo floors, marble staircases and elaborate glass and brass
storefronts. Around the perimeter of the skylight are 44 cast-iron
lion's heads, the eyes of which at one time lighted up; they will
do so again after the renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The skylight has 1,800 panes of glass, all of which need to be
replaced along with much of the iron-and-steel support structure.
``The skylight is a big issue,'' Sandvick said. ``Right now, a lot
of the glass is only marginally held in place. It needs urgent
repair.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Abrams, the skylight alone will cost $2 million to
renovate. The total project will cost $60 million, $10 million of
which is coming from a combination of grants and low-interest loans
from the city and various private foundations.
</P>
<P>
   After the renovation, the first two floors of the arcade _ which
also has an entrance on Superior Avenue _ will become a food court
and shopping mall, while the rest will be occupied by a 295-room
Hyatt Regency hotel. ``It's a dramatic building,'' said Scott
Miller, executive vice president of development for Hyatt Corp.
``And it has the ultimate atrium.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandvick added that because of the age of the facility and the
fact that none of the space was originally designed with a hotel in
mind, there will be considerably more than 100 different hotel-room
layouts. ``We'll probably set the record,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The project will begin this fall and will be finished early in
2001, Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, the renovation of the Colonial and Euclid
arcades is much further along. The two are part of a
seven-building, 330,000-square-foot complex that occupies part of a
block between Euclid and Prospect avenues. Several of the buildings
are in the middle of the block and are almost unreachable from the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the buildings were built from 1898 to 1911, while the
seventh was built as part of the current renovation. At one time,
the complex housed a hotel on the Prospect Avenue side, offices in
the upper floors of the Euclid side and retail stores along the two
arcades.
</P>
<P>
   Although smaller in scale, the two arcades each have their
distinctive glories. The most arresting is the Colonial, a
two-level, 435-foot-long Georgian Revival structure with a pitched
skylight running the length of the passageway.
</P>
<P>
   The Euclid, which parallels the Colonial, is one level with
terra-cotta walls and a soaring barrel-vaulted ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Now the seven buildings on the site are being renovated into a
180-room Residence Inn by Marriott. The two arcades running through
the buildings are being retained as retail spaces. The architect
for the project is again Sandvick.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the two with the Old Arcade, he said: ``The interiors
were in worse shape here. The skylight was missing in the Euclid,
and the Colonial's needed substantial repair. Also, there's a lot
of highly decorative spaces in the Colonial that were just covered
over with drywall and needed to be restored.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think our customers will find it very appealing,'' said
Mark Hemmer, vice president of operations for Cleveland-based
Amerinns Corp., which operates a number of Marriotts in the area.
``The building has style and architectural features you couldn't
afford to do in a new building today.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the features, in addition to the arcades, are a beaux-arts
ballroom on the second floor with original art-glass skylights and
a lobby area dominated by a series of stained-glass windows left
from the original hotel that occupied the space.
</P>
<P>
   John Marcus, whose family will continue to own the complex after
the renovation, said the project's cost is $30 million, $4 million
of which is coming from the city. The project will be finished by
the end of the year, he said.

IN NEW YORK, ARCHITECTS ARE IN DEMAND AND ON THE MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Freshly recruited from a corporate colossus, the new
president strides into a rapidly growing company in search of even
higher profits, untapped markets and maybe an acquisition or two.
</P>
<P>
   The description could fit many Wall Street firms. But the firm
in question is Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill. You can easily spot its
architects, planners and interior designers. They're the ones
dressed completely in black among all those navy blue and charcoal
gray suits in the canyons of the financial district.
</P>
<P>
   That Skidmore now does business from 14 Wall Street, on a
crossroads it shares with the New York Stock Exchange and J.P.
Morgan, is in one sense coincidental. (The firm just needed
affordable space.) In another sense, it is an apt metaphor for the
state of the profession at the moment. Like Wall Street,
architecture is booming.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Skidmore had 200 employees in New York, down
from a peak of 425 in 1988. The firm moved downtown last October
into space designed for up to 325 employees. There are now 340.
</P>
<P>
   Hellmuth, Obata &AMP; Kassabaum, by some rankings the largest
architectural firm in America, has doubled the size of its New York
office since 1994, from 50 to 100 employees. So has Gensler,
another national giant, whose New York office has grown from 169 to
334 employees in the past five years. The ranks at HLW
International's New York office have risen from 215 to 310 in the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Good fortune is also visiting small firms. Wendy Evans Joseph
has watched her practice at 500 Park Ave. grow from one person in
1994 to six today. ``I could have 20 people, there's so much work
right now,'' she said. Her projects include a V-shaped,
cable-stayed pedestrian bridge over East 63rd Street for
Rockefeller University and, in Dallas, the Women's Museum: An
Institute for the Future.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Washington, too, has as much work as she can handle in
her 10-person office at 271 W. 125th St. But she depends on
government agencies and nonprofit institutions for jobs: a new
station for the Franklin Avenue shuttle in Brooklyn, four clinics
for the Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn, 27 homes in central
Harlem, two schools in New Haven, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the only black architect whose majority of work is
public work,'' she said. ``It goes back to the root of how
potential clients select architects. A lot of it has to do with who
you know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few of us who can say we're benefiting from the
boom,'' Ms. Washington said. ``It would be great to participate and
not just see it through the glass.'' Because salary levels have
risen faster than fees, she cannot afford the extra staff she needs
and so finds herself working longer hours.
</P>
<P>
   To judge from help-wanted advertising, the demand for architects
is greater than it has been in a decade. In July 1989, The New York
Times ran an average of 42 ads for architectural positions in its
Sunday classified section. In July 1994, with the real estate
market in tatters, the average was 25 ads. Last month, it was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the demand is the scarcity of experienced architects in
their late 30s and early 40s. ``There is a missing generation,''
said David Childs, the chairman designate of Skidmore. Despairing
of their prospects earlier this decade, they either got out of
architecture or never got into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were taking jobs that smaller firms would have taken,''
recalled A. Eugene Kohn, a founding principal of Kohn Pedersen Fox.
``Smaller firms were taking jobs that new firms might have taken.
And new people were saying, `Forget it.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did they go?'' asked Walter Hunt Jr., a managing
principal of Gensler. ``Maybe they're running a bed-and-breakfast
in Vermont. Maybe they're fishing.'' It is widely supposed that
those embryonic architects wound up in other parts of the country
or related fields like construction management and real estate
development.
</P>
<P>
   Their absence is keenly felt. ``What's generally available is a
zero- to 8-year experience level,'' said Carl Ordemann, the
managing principal of the New York office of Perkins &AMP; Will. ``Then
there's a substantial gap in the 8- to 15-year level. Every office,
across the board, is suffering from that gap. You can't do jobs as
well without those people as part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity of experienced architects allows some of them to
command salaries in the range of $60,000 to $70,000 _ a small
fortune for architectural staffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing for the profession at one level,'' said
Kenneth Drucker, director of design and senior principal at the New
York office of Hellmuth, Obata &AMP; Kassabaum, ``but at another level,
the fees were lowered to remain competitive and they haven't
rebounded. They've stayed low, salaries have risen and headhunters
are pursuing your professional staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Balsley, a landscape architect who designed Gantry Plaza
State Park on the Queens waterfront, would not want to return to
the old days. ``If anyone complains about working weekends,'' he
said, ``I'll show them the help wanted ads from eight years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he noted that higher salaries and the cost of
computer equipment and programs had pushed up operating costs.
``We're not even close to being as profitable as we were in the
'80s,'' Balsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Balsley's concerns are signs that the Flatiron
district in Manhattan, where he and many other architects have
offices, may be growing too popular _ and too pricey. He would love
to stay in 119 Fifth Ave., at 19th Street, he said, but ``with all
the IPO brats running around with million-dollar bills hanging out
of their pockets, landlords won't even negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Costas Kondylis &AMP; Associates is preparing to leave 3 W. 18th St.
in October for new quarters at 31 W. 27th St.
</P>
<P>
   Kondylis is designing Trump World Tower at the east end of 47th
Street and Larry Silverstein's River Place complex at the west end
of 42nd Street. His office has grown from 28 to 64 people since
1994. ``The rents in the Flatiron district have gone up,'' Kondylis
said. ``So the new area for architects is the West 20s.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, the movement over time has been downtown. The
highest concentration of membership in the American Institute of
Architects is in ZIP code 10003 around Union Square, which takes in
parts of Ladies' Mile, the Flatiron district, Greenwich Village and
the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 50 percent of our firms are now below Union
Square,'' said Rolf Ohlhausen, the immediate past president of the
New York chapter of the AIA.
</P>
<P>
   Another area that architects are discovering is the financial
district. Nearing the end of its lease in 600 Madison Ave., at 58th
Street, Pei Cobb Freed &AMP; Partners is scouting for new quarters and
has cast its net as far downtown as Wall Street. ``Many buildings
that were considered Class B have been upgraded,'' said George
Miller, the managing partner. ``They present what we believe to be
the best value in today's market for the architectural community.''
</P>
<P>
   Gensler, at 1 Rockefeller Plaza, has a ``Wall Street studio'' _
25 people in 1 Liberty Plaza at Broadway and Liberty Street _ to
serve financial institutions like J.P. Morgan and the Federal
Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Skidmore moved 10 months ago to the former Bankers Trust Co.
Building at Wall and Nassau Streets, a landmark completed in 1912
and expanded in 1933, topped by a stepped pyramid like the ancient
Greek Mausoleum at Halicarnassus.
</P>
<P>
   Skidmore is one of the largest firms in New York, if not the
largest. And it probably has the highest public profile, with
commissions that include the new Pennsylvania Station, the new
International Air Terminal at Kennedy International Airport, the
new New York Stock Exchange, the Columbus Centre complex at
Columbus Circle that includes Time Warner headquarters, Bear
Stearns headquarters on Madison Avenue and one of the new Times
Square towers.
</P>
<P>
   As its lease neared an end at the old Daily News Building at 220
E. 42nd St., Skidmore began a search for new space. ``Where we
really wanted to be was the Hudson Street corridor or Ladies' Mile
but there was nothing available in those two areas,'' said T.J.
Gottesdiener, a partner.
</P>
<P>
   The firm was in an awkward position. ``We're not big enough to
threaten the mayor that we're going to move to New Jersey,'' Childs
said, ``but we're also not in the 3,000- to 4,000-square-foot
range.''
</P>
<P>
   After looking as far afield as Long Island City, Queens,
Gottesdiener settled on 14 Wall St. as meeting three key criteria:
floors as large as possible (Skidmore has 72,000 square feet on
three floors); a safe, convenient location, and ``rents we could
sustain when the market turned'' _ low $20s a square foot annually,
compared with the high $20s on 42nd Street.

GETTING ANOTHER CHANCE, AND NOW SHOOTING FOR THE NBA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throughout the game, Horace Jenkins and Shaheen Holloway had
been talking to each other. Each jibe was accompanied by a smile,
each shot matched by the other's. Now, late in a Jersey Shore
Basketball League playoff game at St. Rose High School in Belmar,
N.J., Holloway asked his teammates to clear out so he could take on
Jenkins one on one, just like the two players would do in
off-season playground games.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway's game has been fine-tuned at Seton Hall, but Jenkins
has almost always played on the playground. So before Holloway's
teammates could step away, Jenkins reached in and poked the ball
free, taking off for a breakaway layup almost before Holloway could
cough out the final syllables of his command.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway may have already known the skills that the rail-thin,
6-foot-2-inch point guard possesses from their meetings in
recreation centers and on playgrounds. But Jenkins caught the
attention of many more observers this year. After a career that
appeared to be going nowhere, Jenkins, 24, has pushed open the door
with his considerable talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while I just looked at it and said, maybe it's not meant
for me,'' Jenkins, who plays for William Paterson, said recently.
``If it doesn't happen from basketball then maybe it just wasn't
meant to be. Then, with me getting another opportunity, which you
rarely get in life, I realized that I am getting a chance. I think
someday _ I want you to quote this _ someday I think I'll be
playing in the NBA. It's a dream, but I know I can play with these
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The tale began on the courts of New Jersey around Elizabeth and
Newark, where Jenkins learned his craft. At Elizabeth High School,
though, he confounded his coaches by giving little effort in the
classroom and being academically ineligible his senior year. He
spent a year at Union County College, but the birth of his first
child distracted him from the classroom and the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Still, college coaches remained tempted by his combination of
athleticism and skills, with speed and leaping ability complemented
by a silky shooting touch and a willingness to defend.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Rebimas, the coach at William Paterson, persuaded the
school to take a chance on Jenkins. After only a semester of
classes at Union Junior College, Jenkins had achieved the necessary
grades to join the William Paterson team in January.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped in and immediately made an impact last season,
helping to take a 3-5 team to the national semifinals in Division
III. He averaged a team-high 21.9 points a game and was named the
New Jersey Athletic Conference player of the year and Eastern
College Athletic Conference co-player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It was his play at William Paterson that earned him an
invitation to the Jersey Shore league, and Jenkins believes the
run-and-gun summer league has taken him closer to realizing his NBA
dreams. Last week he was matched against Rick Brunson, the Knicks'
backup point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Rick on him and we had Anthony Mason and Conrad McRae
inside,'' said Greg Kapalko, the RKE Athletic coach. ``He'd go by
Rick and you'd just see this arm rising over Mason and McRae for a
layup.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins finished that game with 38 points, and was named a
first-team all-star, alongside the likes of Lloyd Daniels and Notre
Dame's Troy Murphy, after averaging 34 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me able to prove it against a player like Rick Brunson,
people look up to someone like that, but I take it as a
challenge,'' Jenkins said. ``I was inspired to go out and try to
prove that if this is an NBA guy then I can play with an NBA guy. I
just went out there and did the best that I can do. Fortunately, I
came out with 38 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists and four
blocks. I guess the numbers speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins realizes where he went wrong before. ``I think I always
had the smarts to do it,'' he said, ``but I never put forth the
effort and time for school. I thought it was only about the
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean that he will stay at William Paterson for
his two remaining years of eligibility. ``Playing at William
Paterson really opened up a whole lot of opportunities for me,''
Jenkins said. ``Somebody is going to recognize talent. If you've
just downright got the ability to do it, no matter what the age,
you can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go right and the opportunity presents itself in the
correct way, I don't think I should have to spend two years in
school. I'm not saying I will do that, but with my ability, if the
opportunity comes, I'm going to take advantage of it.''

OUR TOWNS COLUMN: NEIGHBORHOOD IS SUPERSEDED BY SUPERSTORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ To make way for the New York region's third
Ikea furniture superstore, this city has officially declared a
patchwork of working-class homes and mom-and-pop factories
``blighted,'' fit for no better fate than the crunching bulldozers
of urban renewal. But go tell Ruth McGruder that her neighborhood
is blighted and she'll give you a tart piece of her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just like family here on the street,'' she protested,
padding barefoot on her porch. ``It feels to me, if we weren't poor
people, they wouldn't come here.''
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old, five-foot Mrs. McGruder thinks the house she
rents for $600 a month with her sister Willie Mae and where she has
helped raise a dozen nephews and nieces has been a fine home. Sure,
it's not the princely Victorians she cleans for a living, but she
has filled it with touches that have meaning and that tell of her
battle to eke out some beauty in a life of two failed marriages and
other harsh moments.
</P>
<P>
   When she moved here 30 years ago, she painstakingly enveloped
her front porch with the baby hedges she had carried with her from
her mother's yard in rural Alabama. The hedges are now nine feet
tall. She has added pots of zinnia, petunias and geraniums, and a
maple she found as a sapling in the nearby lake where she fishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I set out all these plants _ I bought 'em and set 'em out,''
she said with a molasses drawl impervious to the influence of the
Northern gentry she works for. ``I'm used to sitting out on this
porch, nobody bothering nobody. I feel this is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   She has crowded the porch with faded chaises and charcoal
grills, all handed down to her along with three refrigerators, a
1950s hi-fi set and a mahogany dresser at prices even Ikea will
never beat. ``My white people give me all my stuff,'' Mrs.
McGruder, who is black, says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   New Rochelle's development commissioner, Joseph Madonna, has a
powerful argument that the Swedish retailer, by obtaining a 16-acre
plot for assemble-it-yourself furniture in southern Westchester,
will bring in $2.5 million annually in sales taxes. Less persuasive
is the contention that Ikea will bring in 300 jobs. The
neighborhood's factory owners say there are far more than 300
workers here already, skilled stonecutters, electricians and car
mechanics, not Ikea's low-wage, often part-time clerks.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials never bothered to find out very much about
exactly who lives and works in the neighborhood they will soon
subject to eminent domain. If they did, they would have had to
acknowledge flesh-and-blood people, deeply entangled in their homes
and workplaces, who are frightened at the thought of pulling up
roots and relocating elsewhere, even if the city compensates them
at fair market value.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of the 50 businesses, like Jerry Newmark, whose factory
makes cutting tools, and Stephen J. Wodraska II, who repairs roofs,
have spent lifetimes taking risks, cultivating customers, bringing
their children into the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trading lives for dollars,'' Newmark said. ``Why
should Ikea get the use of eminent domain and not us? You read any
encyclopedia description and they say eminent domain is for public
use, a highway or reservoir.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 34 homes, there are people like Josephine Notaro, who was
born in her green cottage 80 years ago when neighbors raised pigs
in their yards and the corridor that now constitutes Interstate 95
was a swamp. Her parents and her husband died at this address. Now
she owns it free and clear and wants to live out her days with her
aged brother, Martin, reading dime-store novels on the porch.
</P>
<P>
   People here look out for each other. Factory workers watch the
houses when residents are off to work. The residents protect the
factories from graffiti and break-ins at night. Blacks and whites
who may have eyed each other suspiciously decades ago have become
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Ikea's arrival, though, seems like a done deal. If he is forced
to move, Wodraska says, he will worry not only about how to retain
his customers but also where to find neighbors like Mrs. McGruder
to sweeten the sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruth watches out for the neighborhood,'' he said. ``We'd have
to take her with us.''

REAL ESTATE: WAYS TO KEEP YOUR VACATION HOME SECURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Colo.) (rk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The good thing about a vacation home is that it's always there
when you need it. The bad thing is that you're not always there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you leave a property vacant for an extended period of
time, you're going to run into problems,'' said Gary Dunn,
publisher of The Caretaker Gazette, a bimonthly newsletter for
property owners and the people they hire to care for the property.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the obvious challenge of maintaining security in
a vacant property, Dunn said, owners of second and third homes need
to address more mundane issues like frozen pipes, downed wires,
fallen trees and the plants and animals that seek to occupy the
property in the owner's absence. And the potential for running into
problems, he said, increases with the amount of time the house is
left unattended.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a vacation-home owner, and you know you're not going
to be getting out to your property for the next year or so, how
comfortable are you going to feel about leaving it vacant?'' Dunn
said. ``And when you do get back out to it, what are the chances
that it's going to be in the exact same condition as when you left
it?''
</P>
<P>
   One solution, Dunn said, may be to hire a caretaker. ``Caretaker
duties can range anywhere from simple house-sitting assignments to
full-time estate-management situations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have property owners who have second homes in the Hamptons
and some who have apartments in midtown Manhattan,'' Dunn said.
``And we have subscribers who are looking for anything from
`on-call' assignments to full-time, property-management positions
that pay as much as $100,000 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone can afford a full-time caretaker or a
live-in manager for their vacation home. But other options are
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, most people with second homes just want someone in
the area to watch out for them,'' said David M. Killian, president
of Somebody Who Cares, a vacation-home management company in
Breckenridge, Colo. ``So we do everything from making sure their
hot tub doesn't freeze up to having their security alarms ring to
our phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Killian said that virtually all his clients are vacation-home
owners from other states and other countries who visit their second
homes anywhere from once a week to once every few years. And while
the primary concern of most property owners is making sure that
their second home stays safe and secure, some of Killian's clients
use other services his company _ and others like it in resort areas
across the country _ provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can turn on the heat, stock the refrigerator, warm up the
hot tub and pick up a client or his guests at the airport,''
Killian said, adding that while most agreements with clients are
priced for the services requested, the average charge for basic
security, maintenance and guest-preparation services ranges from
$100 to $200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow removal is usually included,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For property owners who want to keep their second home safe and
secure but who can do without having their hot tubs warmed and
their vegetables chilled, there is a less personal but more
high-tech solution: long-distance electronic monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make a product about the size of a paperback book that can
tell you when something happens in your house, no matter where you
or the house happens to be,'' said Cliff Scheller, vice president
of Compuquest, an electronic equipment design and manufacturing
company in Bartlett, Ill. Since the late 1980s, Scheller's company
has been manufacturing the Pagnow!, a $249 device that performs
unattended monitoring of remote locations and delivers a coded
message to any standard pager indicating what the problem is and
where it has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an inexpensive way of keeping track of what's
happening at your property when you're not there,'' Scheller said,
explaining that the device, which is connected to the telephone
line in the property being monitored, has two input connections and
is plugged into a power source in the house.
</P>
<P>
   When either input is activated _ or when the power is
interrupted by a power failure _ the device, equipped with a backup
battery, dials the property owner's pager number and displays a
numeric message that indicates what triggered the call.
</P>
<P>
   So, for example, Scheller said, if one of the inputs on the
Pagnow! is connected to a house's burglar alarm system, and the
system is tripped by someone entering a window or door, the owner
will be notified immediately by pager and can then call the local
police or a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he said, if one of the inputs is connected to a float
switch or a sump pump in a crawl space, the owner will be promptly
notified by pager if unacceptable amounts of water are accumulating
beneath the house. And since the device is connected to the main
power supply, Scheller said, a property owner is immediately
notified of a power failure and can get in contact with friends or
officials in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in cases where a house doesn't have a telephone
installed,'' Scheller said, ``a cell phone can be used to call the
pager.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners can also use electronic gadgetry to improve security
in their vacation homes by doing some of the same things they do in
their primary residence while they're on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Charles McGrath, executive director of the Home Automation
Association, a trade group in Washington, said that there were
scores of remote-activated devices on the market that could be used
to control electronic devices in a vacation home, thereby giving
the home a lived-in look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say you have a ski house in the mountains,'' McGrath
said. ``Instead of hooking your lights up to timers, you can plug
them into X-10-type modules and then turn the lights on and off
whenever you want by telephone.'' He explained that the X-10 system
and others like it generally consisted of a central unit that
controls individual modules attached to electronic appliances like
lights, garage door activators, alarms and even thermostats. And
when the control panel is connected to the telephone line, McGrath
said, the appliances can be activated remotely by phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means you can call the house from anywhere and turn on
the heating system,'' he said, adding that the ability to do that
could prevent things like water-pipe freeze-ups in severely cold
weather. ``It also means that when you're heading up to the ski
house, you can call the house two hours ahead of time and turn on
the heat so you're not freezing for two hours after you get
there.''

HARD FEELINGS LINGER AFTER YANKS' BRAWL WITH MARINERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners engaged in a
game so hideously long and dull Friday night that fans began
streaming out of Safeco Field in the fifth inning. Those who
remained witnessed a nasty ninth-inning brawl that created a binge
of ill will.
</P>
<P>
   Some teammates in the Yankees' clubhouse were annoyed with Jason
Grimsley, whose actions served as the spark for the fight. Joe
Girardi said he would never forget how Seattle's Frank Rodriguez
tried to hurt him. Manager Joe Torre chastised the way the
home-plate umpire, Gary Cederstrom, handled the moments preceding
the fracas. And Chad Curtis and Derek Jeter apparently have an
issue to sort out _ something Curtis wanted to settle in the
clubhouse afterward, in full view of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just part of baseball _ it's been a part of baseball
since Ty Cobb,'' said Chili Davis, who was among those most heavily
involved in the shoving and pushing and tackling in the ninth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams said, ``It was like a war zone out there.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been an eminently forgettable game before the craziness
at the end, both sides seemingly resigned to the fact that the
Yankees were on the way to an 11-8 victory. Paul O'Neill, Williams
and Scott Brosius all banged homers in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez, however, made the shortest start of his
major-league career. Plagued by control problems, he allowed three
hits, three walks and three runs before a perplexed Torre removed
him after a third of an inning. Nonetheless, the Yankees rolled
along toward their 66th victory. The first 4 1/2 innings required 2
hours 28 minutes, and by the sixth inning, players from both teams
were often swinging at the first pitch, in an unspoken
collaboration to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   But a couple of Seattle runners reached base against Grimsley in
the bottom of the eighth, and Alex Rodriguez slammed a three-run
homer, closing the Yankees' lead to three runs. Grimsley's next
pitch sailed over the head of Edgar Martinez, and was followed by a
fastball into Martinez's side.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley insisted later that he had not thrown at Martinez
intentionally _ ``I have too much respect for a hitter like Edgar
Martinez,'' he said _ but if he had not done it on purpose, he was
at least guilty of terrible timing. ``They started it,'' said Lou
Piniella, the Seattle manager. ``It was blatant. I thought the
first pitch at Edgar maybe got away from Grimsley, but the second
was obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Cederstrom ejected Grimsley immediately, a decision Torre
understood completely; all he asked Cederstrom was how much time
Mariano Rivera would have to warm up. Torre, too, was unhappy with
Grimsley, convinced until a later conversation with Grimsley that
the pitcher had hit Martinez intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   Before the eighth inning ended, Torre was ejected after arguing
for the second time in the game with the first-base umpire, Doug
Eddings, on an out or safe call. So Torre would watch the rest of
the ugliness unfold on his television in the visiting manager's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Rodriguez had entered the game for the Mariners in the
fifth inning and took the mound for the ninth, with Jose Mesa
warming up in the bullpen _ an obvious sign that retaliation would
take place, Curtis said later. Luis Sojo grounded out, and after
throwing a pitch low and outside to Chuck Knoblauch, Rodriguez
drilled the second baseman in the backside.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch flipped the bat away nonchalantly and jogged toward
first, the score seemingly settled, the intent of Rodriguez obvious
to all. Perhaps a dozen Yankees said later that they fully
understood Rodriguez's actions, that he had just been retaliating
for Martinez's being hit.
</P>
<P>
   But Cederstrom did not eject Rodriguez. Instead, he walked
slowly to the mound to talk to the pitcher, with players and
coaches on the Yankees' bench screaming at him all the while to
throw Rodriguez out.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella then stepped out of the Seattle dugout and called for a
reliever. Cederstrom, reacting to the angry yelling from the
Yankees, began to stalk toward their dugout, until the third-base
coach, Willie Randolph, interceded, stepping in between Cederstrom
and the bench. Don Zimmer, running the Yankees in Torre's absence,
stepped onto the field to challenge Cederstrom's decision. Frank
Rodriguez, probably thinking the Yankees were yelling at him, began
to scream at the enemy dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi, standing near home plate as the on-deck batter, then
told Rodriguez to stop yelling, adding that if he wanted somebody
in the Yankees' dugout, then he should go after him. Rodriguez
dropped his glove and charged Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   He hit the Yankees' catcher twice, knocking him to the ground,
and players and coaches from both teams rushed onto the field,
Williams and Davis and Jim Leyritz and Shane Spencer all trying to
reach Rodriguez just in front of the Seattle bench. Zimmer, moving
on two bad knees, was knocked down and struggled to get up, his
heart racing; Torre and others said later that they had worried
about Zimmer, in the middle of the scrum.
</P>
<P>
   Davis pinned Seattle coach Steve Smith to the ground, hands
around Smith's neck _ ``I owe somebody an apology,'' Davis said
later _ and Williams knocked down catcher Dan Wilson in a rage.
``Something inside me snapped,'' Williams said, referring to the
moment when he saw Girardi go down.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez punched Leyritz; Paul O'Neill grabbed Wilson and then
felt himself being collared around the neck by Stan Williams, the
Seattle pitching coach. Finally, the fighting stopped.
</P>
<P>
   During the fight, Jeter came face to face with Seattle's Alex
Rodriguez, a close friend, and the two appeared to be joking as the
nastiness drew to a conclusion. Curtis, a hardened veteran, began
saying something to Jeter in front of the dugout _ he seemed to be
telling Jeter that a fight between two teams was an inappropriate
place for fraternization.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Curtis approached Jeter in the clubhouse, with perhaps a
dozen reporters in the vicinity, and sought to continue the
conversation. Jeter made it clear he did not want to discuss his
feelings at that time, gesturing toward reporters, and he refused
to talk any further, eventually walking away.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said afterward: ``There was a little difference of
opinion there, and I think it's something that is just between us.
It's nothing big and nothing I'm going to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Once players from both teams were cleared from the field,
Cederstrom and the other umpires met, and decided to eject one
player: Girardi, who exploded when he learned he had been thrown
out, throwing items from the dugout onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He punches me and I got thrown out,'' Girardi said. ``I'm
having a hard time sorting all this out. I get hit twice in the
head and I get thrown out. I've never punched anyone in my life and
I still haven't. I'm not going to punch him. But he tried to hurt
me and I'm not going to forget that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankie Rodriguez had a job to do and nobody has a problem
with that. It was intentional, and everybody knew that, but the
umpire didn't throw him out. When he doesn't do his job, that's why
the rest of it occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre: ``It baffles me why Girardi was thrown out. I guess
he should've stood there and let somebody kick the heck out of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer argued about Girardi's ejection, griped about the way the
whole game was handled by umpires, and when he mentioned Eddings'
series of questionable calls at first base, Zimmer was ejected,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Mariners have a history of altercations, this
being among the worst. ``It was just ugly, and let's forget it and
play tomorrow,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Piniella: ``We did what we had to do to protect our
players. And if the Yankees do it again tomorrow, we'll do the same
thing again.''

   TAX-IMPACT _ WASHINGTON _ What's in it for me? That's what many
Americans wonder whenever Congress passes a big tax bill, even one
that is sure to be killed by a presidential veto. This time, the
answers are even more complex than usual. For example, when all the
provisions kick in, the basic savings for a household with a
$50,000 income can vary from far more than $1,000 to far less than
$400. Here's why. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

<P>
   CONGRESS-COMPLIANCE _ WASHINGTON _ In a hugely popular move,
Republicans in 1995 required Congress to abide by the laws it
enacts for the rest of the country. It was the first plank of the
GOP ``Contract With America.'' Four years later, the lawmakers have
begun to live under many of the provisions of 11 health, safety,

   MICROSOFT _ WASHINGTON _ Like the blind men grasping the
elephant, government antitrust lawyers and the world's largest
software enterprise see the results of the Microsoft trial in
starkly different terms. Both viewpoints will be laid out in
book-length volumes that go this week to U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson, who will use them to prepare ``findings of fact''
that it turn will provide clues to where the landmark trial will
end up. (Glass, Cox News Service).

   HMO-FUNDING _ WASHINGTON Two years ago, Congress passed
legislation designed to encourage more Medicare patients to join
managed care plans. Since then nearly 200 plans have quit Medicare
or reduced their coverage. HMOs say the government is shortchanging
them, but others say HMOs are still receiving too much money.

   IRAQ-LANDMINES _ BAGHDAD _ Hassan Hussein Darwish and his fellow
villagers in Iraqi Kurdistan had a problem and he and his friends
set out to solve it. Their land in northernmost Iraq was laden with
mines from the areas frequent combatants _ Iraq, Turkey, Iran. For
years and with barely any training or equipment, Darwish cleared
thousands of mines. Finally, he found one he didn't recognize and
it blew out his eyes and blew off his hands. Now disabled and
living in a squalid block home in Erbil, he lives to describe the
dangerous life of what U.N. workers ``village de-miners.'' ``We
didn't come to the mines. The mines came to us,'' Darwish says. ``I
was born there and my living depends on the land . . . of course,
you are face to face with death at any moment.'' (Kaplow, Cox News

   RUSSIA-CRISIS _ MOSCOW _ Bank closings. Food shortages.
Political upheaval. Predictions of social unrest. Last August 17,
the value of Russia's national currency plummeted as the country
slid headlong into an economic crisis -- and the world held its
breath. But the crisis did not result in catastrophe. Things aren't
much better in Russia, but they haven't got worse, either. After
the heady boom years of '96 and '97, economic achievement in Russia
today is measured by the bad things that haven't happened. (Holmes,

   RUSSIA-ECONOMY _ MAGNITOGORSK, Russia _ Once the pride of the
Soviet Union, the massive mining and steel works in this Urals
mountain city illustrate Russia's obstacles in competing in the
world economy. Once the world's biggest steel-producing plant,
Magnitogorsk's output is half of what it was a decade ago and
quality is low. Even Russia's automakers choose to import steel
rather than buy locally because the inferior Russian steel can't
hold paint. The factory survives on barter deals, pays its
employees with credits to be used at the company store and still
measures success the old-fashioned Soviet way _ not by profit, but
by production. (Holmes, Cox News Service). 30. WITH PHOTOS.

 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reggie Jackson came to New York proclaiming he was
the straw that would stir the drink. Robin Ventura is more than
content being one of the ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   But whether he likes it or not _ and it is obvious he does not _
the spotlight is now on Ventura, who is leading the way as the Mets
try to secure their first postseason berth in 11 years. Two-thirds
of the way through his first season in New York, Ventura, the Mets'
third baseman, is hitting .303. He leads the club in home runs,
with 25, and RBIs, with 90. In many ways, he leads the club,
period.
</P>
<P>
   Just two and a half years after it seemed his career could be
over because of a horrible ankle injury, Ventura has turned himself
into a candidate for the most-valuable-player award in the National
League. Not that he wants to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sit here and talk about myself,'' Ventura said
before he doubled and scored the winning run in the Mets' 2-1
victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers at Shea Stadium on Friday
night. ``I realize that's part of playing here. But that doesn't
mean you have to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Schueler, the general manager of the Chicago White Sox,
Ventura's team for his first nine major-league seasons, said:
``Robin's quiet. But he's a quiet leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews are the part of the job that Ventura detests the
most. ``That and traveling,'' he said, ``and sometimes traveling's
all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura also leads the Mets in one-liners, which he always
delivers with a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of being a teammate,'' Ventura said of his sense
of humor. ``I don't mind cutting up with the guys. But I don't
necessarily feel everybody has to know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has had an immediate impact on the Mets, not just on the
field but also in the clubhouse following victories, where the
Doors' ``L.A. Woman'' now blares because of its lyrics, ``Get your
mojo rising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Robin's very reserved, but he's also very funny,'' said Mike
Piazza, citing a gag Ventura pulls on the team plane involving
phony Austin Powers teeth. ``He's a great guy to have on your team.
But he's obviously not looking for the spotlight. That's why he
fits in very well with this ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   John Franco grew up in Brooklyn rooting for the Mets and has
pitched for them for 10 years. While riding to the ball park in
Milwaukee last week and reflecting on Mets history, Franco, without
any prompting, came to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Robin Ventura is the best free-agent signing in the
history of this franchise,'' Franco said. ``He has to be.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, the Mets' top pinch-hitter, Matt Franco, was
sitting in front of his locker. In the middle of a conversation, he
quickly changed the subject as he watched Ventura pass by. ``Has
the MVP talk started yet?'' Franco asked.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk would have seemed unlikely when Ventura, who grew up
in Southern California, somehow ended up playing college baseball
at Oklahoma State. ``That was the only scholarship I received,''
Ventura said. ``It was probably because I couldn't run.''
</P>
<P>
   He could hit, though. He had a 58-game hitting streak for the
Cowboys as a sophomore, won college baseball's equivalent of the
Heisman Trophy in 1988 and won a gold medal with the 1988 Olympic
baseball team in Seoul, South Korea. Ventura would later be named
the college player of the decade by Baseball America magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura still can't run, at least not very well _ he has one
stolen base in two attempts this season. And when he broke and
severely dislocated his right ankle sliding into home plate in a
spring training game in 1997, there were doctors who said Ventura
might never play again.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ventura came back in late July, a week ahead of the
most optimistic schedule. But he hit just .262 the rest of the
season. Last year, he needed to hit .337 over the final month just
to finish at .263.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I ever thought I wasn't back,'' Ventura said.
``But I would feel better at certain times.''
</P>
<P>
   Schueler of the White Sox said: ``It's hard to tell whether he
slowed up because he never ran good. We noticed a lack of range.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura still won his fifth Gold Glove award last season, and he
said he did not think the injury had anything to do with his
struggles at the plate. But the White Sox made only a belated
attempt to re-sign him, and by then he had already decided on the
Mets, choosing them over Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mets wanted me to play third base,'' said Ventura, who
knew that Cal Ripken plays third in Baltimore. ``And a lot of the
guys had called and said this was going to be a really good team
and that I'd be a good fit.''
</P>
<P>
   The main callers were Piazza and pitcher Al Leiter, who had both
just re-signed with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically lied the whole time,'' Ventura said, his
expression unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura added that Yankees first baseman Tino Martinez also
called to say that Shea Stadium would be a good place for him to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Sold.
</P>
<P>
   There were those who thought the Mets overpaid for Ventura at
$32 million for four years. Mets General Manager Steve Phillips was
not one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finished the year very well,'' Phillips said. ``And he only
drove in 90 runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually 91, a total he is about to surpass with seven weeks
remaining in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to try to explain it,'' Ventura said. ``And I
don't care to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who has never hit higher than .295 in a major-league
season, has a good chance of finishing over .300. He is on a pace
to hit 37 homers and drive in 133 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for someone who was not even named to the National
League All-Star team this season. In fact, Ventura _ who averaged
23 homers and 94 RBIs over the six seasons before his injury _ has
been selected to just one All-Star Game, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Five players since 1979 have won the MVP award without having
been selected to the All-Star Game, however. And even if he does
not become the first Met to win the award, Ventura will probably
not care.
</P>
<P>
   Just call it a hunch.

INVESTIGATORS DETAIL A NEW MOB STRATEGY ON CONSTRUCTION TRADES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A three-year inquiry has found evidence that the
Lucchese and Gambino crime families forged corrupt alliances with
local officials of New York City's carpenters, laborers and
bricklayers unions that reaped tens of millions of dollars in
recent years, law enforcement investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The illegal profits included payoffs from construction companies
of $100 a week for each worker kept ``off the books,'' or not
listed as a union member on a construction site, according to
organized-crime investigators in the New York Police Department and
the Manhattan district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that routinely paid the bribes enjoyed lucrative
benefits, too, investigators said. They substantially inflated
profits by paying employees less than union scale and by evading
hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to union pension and
fringe benefits funds, law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A state grand jury in Manhattan is reviewing evidence, including
secretly recorded conversations between suspected mobsters and
union and company officials, the authorities said. Indictments on
racketeering charges are expected to be unsealed in the fall, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators identified the acting boss of the Lucchese family,
Steven L. Crea, 52, as a major figure in the racketeering
operations. Several Gambino family members were implicated in
similar schemes but to a lesser extent than the Lucchese group, the
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lucchese and Gambino families, two of the five Mafia
factions in the New York metropolitan area, have engaged in
construction industry extortion and bid-rigging conspiracies for
more than 50 years, law enforcement officials say. One official
estimated that in the last five years the two families and the
contractors ``ripped off tens of millions of dollars through
payoffs and by cheating employees out of fringe benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the evidence indicated that the mob had
altered its traditional kickback tactics in the construction
industry and was concentrating on medium-size renovation jobs of
less than $10 million rather than on large commercial and
residential projects worth $50 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick O'Neill, a former official in the carpenters union in
the city, said that a medium-size company that employed 20
carpenters could illegally pocket more than $500,000 a year by
evading union fringe benefit payments of about $800 a week for each
worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies cheat by listing only three or four men as
working on the job while they have another 15 or more `off the
books,''' O'Neill explained. ``They get away with it by paying off
someone in the union to look the other way,'' he said, ``and by
exploiting minority workers who need the jobs and new immigrants
who have no access to their rights or to information about what
they are entitled to.''

FOR GIANTS, A LESSON ON REPLAYS 
CORDIAL QUARTERBACKS 
TESTING THE WATERS 
SPECIAL DEVELOPMENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Coach Jim Fassel had a group of game officials
visit the New York Giants' training camp this week to help explain
some of the new rules the NFL will implement this season. The chief
topic of conversation was the reinstitution of instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new guidelines, coaches can challenge an official's
ruling on two plays in each half, though not in the final two
minutes of either half, when such replay reversals are in the hands
of a replay official watching the game.
</P>
<P>
   If a coach's challenge is not upheld, his team will lose a time
out. Fassel believes there will not be as many challenges as fans
expect, but more important, he believes that a lack of
understanding of the replay rules will lead to controversy.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Fassel described a hypothetical play in which an
opposing quarterback fumbles the football while in his passing
motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose we recover the fumble but the officials on the field
have already ruled it an incomplete pass because his arm was moving
forward,'' Fassel said. ``I could challenge it, but I don't get the
ball if they agree with me. That's what people have to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officials would say that the whistle blew on the play as
soon as the ball hit the ground. So even if I win the challenge,
all they would do is put the ball down at the site of the fumble
and give the ball to the other team. All I gain is seven or eight
yards. And that's if it's conclusive. Otherwise, I lose a time out.
So it may not be worth it to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know these things are going to happen and people are going
to be screaming at me in the stands to challenge it and I'm going
to be standing there doing nothing. But they have to understand the
whole rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said he had already told his players not to try to
persuade him to challenge an official's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been so many times when a player has said to me, `I
caught it,' and later you watch the film and find out he didn't,''
Fassel said. ``And I told them not to watch the stadium scoreboard
replay and make a decision either, because that replay is not
always the replay they use to check a call.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordial Quarterbacks
</P>
<P>
   The much anticipated quarterback duel between the starter, Kent
Graham, and his celebrated backup, Kerry Collins, has been calm and
largely uneventful. Both are throwing the ball well in training
camp practices. Collins has probably turned more heads with his
play, in part because he is new to the team and partly because his
teammates might have expected less given his uneven performances in
the league the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But the two passers coexist placidly, giving each other room for
the series of interviews each is asked to conduct daily. Graham is
tactful on the subject of Collins, even if he was angry when the
Giants signed Collins and miffed that the team never raised his
salary to bring it close to Collins' pay.
</P>
<P>
   Collins acknowledges that Graham is the starter and is careful
not to say that his immediate aim is to win the starting job. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Testing the Waters
</P>
<P>
   There continue to be spirited exchanges between the Giants'
offensive and defensive units at camp. There has not been an
all-out brawl as there was earlier in the week, but during Friday's
practice running back LeShon Johnson and linebacker Jessie Armstead
had to be separated after a running play up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Armstead is one of the team's top trash talkers while Johnson is
perhaps the team's most quiet and serene player. But after Armstead
said he was going to test Johnson on the next play, Johnson
answered, ``I'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson carried the ball on the next play, linebacker Corey
Widmer put a crunching hit on him. Johnson kept his feet and raced
downfield _ with his offensive teammates applauding.
</P>
<P>
   Special Developments
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have spent more time working on their special teams
than in either of two previous camps under Fassel. The special
teams coach, Larry Mac Duff, has been noticeably louder, chiding
and encouraging his troops almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were 28th in the NFL in punt returns last season and
tied for 27th in kickoff returns.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia rushed reinforcements to its border with
Chechnya Saturday, after several hundred gunmen occupied three
villages on the Russian side of the border with the breakaway
Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   Russian news agencies said government artillery and helicopters
had fired on as many as 600 militants of an Islamic group who had
taken up positions around the mountain villages in the southern
Russian republic of Dagestan, a mainly Muslim territory bordering
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions in Russia's North Caucasus region have steadily grown
in recent weeks, as Russian units guarding the border with Chechnya
have come under increasingly deadly attacks from assailants
operating out of the rebel territory.
</P>
<P>
   The incursion Saturday into Dagestan marked the first time that
the militants have tried to hold territory in Russia since the end
of a 1994-1996 civil war that left tens of thousands of troops and
civilians dead and Chechnya with de facto independence.
</P>
<P>
   Russian public television said the armed intruders were
commanded by the Chechen field commander Khattab, one of the
leaders of an austere Islamic movement known as Wahhabism.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say Wahhabism, while not widespread in
Dagestan, has grown increasingly popular in the impoverished,
mountainous regions of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency quoted a Russian police official as
saying another commander was involved: Chechen war hero Shamil
Basayev, who has openly called for uniting Chechnya with two
neighboring Russian regions with large Muslim populations, Dagestan
to the east and Ingushetia to the West.
</P>
<P>
   A commentator for Russian Public Telelvision in Dagestan said
the militants' goal could be to take over Dagestan's capital, the
Caspian Sea port of Makhachkala, 60 miles east of the Chechen
border. On Friday, Russian news agencies reported a group of
Wahhabists was plotting to turn part of Dagestan into an
independent Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Khattab promised to launch a series of large-scale
attacks on Russia. Last week, three Russian officers were killed in
a raid on a checkpoint on the Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other regions on Chechnya's border, Dagestan officials
say they do not have the troops or equipment to properly guard
their frontier. Murder is common, and hostage-taking for ransom has
become a daily event.
</P>
<P>
   Dagestan's Security Council requested reinforcements from
Moscow, as well as permission to call up and arm reservists.
Federal authorities dispatched 1,000 police, an Interior Ministry
battalion, and a motorized rifle brigade to the region, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya's rebel government in Grozny, meanwhile, denied any
involvement in the border crossing. But that is not unusual. The
Grozny government has little control over field commanders like
Khattab or Basayev, or put a stop to the border raids and
kidnapping for ransom that has turned the North Caucasus into the
most dangerous place in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The tension in the Caucasus has posed a challenge to Russia's
embattled Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, who Saturday ordered
Russia's Defense and Interior Ministries to ``normalize the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bandits are bandits,'' Stepashin said in televised comments.
``You have to deal with them in the appropriate way. We have the
forces and the means.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stepashin, who played a leading role in Russia's disastrous
campaign in Chechnya, seemed to back away from a full-scale
military action. ``Russia will not repeat its mistakes in the North
Caucasus. No more Russian soldiers will die there.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin is under pressure from President Boris N. Yeltsin to
win back the support of regional leaders, many of whom have joined
a bloc led by a Kremlin antagonist, Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the Kremlin might use the situation in the
Cacausus as an excuse to declare a state emergency, thereby
canceling parliamentary and presidential elections and preventing
Luzhkov from coming to power.

McGWIRE'S ANDRO REPORT NOT GETTING GOOD PLAY 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news story last week was like a blur. Here today, gone
tomorrow. You had to look fast, and in some newspapers, look long
and hard. And then maybe you found it.
</P>
<P>
   ``markmcgwirenolongertakes androstenedione.''
</P>
<P>
   Got that? Got a problem with that kind of news coverage? If not,
you should.
</P>
<P>
   One August ago, under World War III-type headlines, Mark McGwire
was being portrayed as a synthetic slugger, pumped up with muscles
made from chemistry. As he attacked baseball's home-run record, he
was under attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Asterisk Gang marched on Bud Selig's office, demanding that
if the record fell, which it did, McGwire's feat be tagged as
pharmaceutical-aided.
</P>
<P>
   It mattered not that ``andro'' was a legal diet supplement in
major-league baseball. Or that it was sold over the counter. Or
even that muscle mass is an elementary element on the list of what
makes great hitters.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was immediately labeled a cheater once it was learned he
used a supplement that was banned by the NCAA and by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In some minds, McGwire's 70 home runs will always be tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Except...
</P>
<P>
   In the quest for his 500th career home run last week, national
attention became focused again on McGwire. And again, the question
of andro came up, prompting McGwire to say he had been waiting for
someone to ask.
</P>
<P>
   His answer should have become a much bigger story than it did.
McGwire claimed he stopped using andro at the start of this season.
He didn't like the message being sent to youngsters, and if
marketed in a responsible way, this is a supplement to be used by
only fully ]mature adults.
</P>
<P>
   But add it up.
</P>
<P>
   With andro, McGwire is currently on a home-run binge equal to
last season. When he surpassed the 500 mark with two homers on
Thursday night, he had hit 17 in 21 games, and stood at 44 for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   So where's all the retractions from last August?
</P>
<P>
   If McGwire is telling the truth, and there's no reason to doubt
him, andro had nothing to do with what happened last season.
Shouldn't that have been the World War III-screaming headlines last
week?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, I have no way of knowing what fuel McGwire puts in
his body. It might be Wheaties. It might be Exxon Supreme.
</P>
<P>
   But going back to his younger days in Oakland, there have always
been those eager to label McGwire as something other than a guy who
thrived on mom's home cooking.
</P>
<P>
   He was and is a weightlifting addict. Over the years, McGwire
has grown into the most imposing physical specimen in sports. Take
any of those 300-pounders in the NFL, and they all appear fat and
out-of-shape next to McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   But for much of his career, he was often sidelined by injuries.
Whispers of the body breaking down due to steriod use were heard in
baseball. Only, however, when he began his pursuit of 62 homers
last season did McGwire come under full fire. And that was because
a reporter noticed a bottle of andro pills in his locker, then
researched the subject, and wrote a story. McGwire freely admitted
he used andro, unaware of the firestorm that would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, he doesn't ``use,'' and the home runs still come,
yet the story of no more andro was found in some papers just below
the fishing report from Possum Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   But in discontinuing andro, McGwire might be hardly alone in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, it was being treated as the greatest thing to
come along since ice cream,'' said Tim Lang, the Rangers'
major-league and organizational conditioning coach. ``But from that
bandwagon time, the andro thing has really tailed off. I know some
of our players found it to be like a placebo. It did basically
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang, known for being very conservative on diet supplements, was
one of many lost voices who was saying last August the McGwire
issue was being completely overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to try and educate players on all this _ give them
the pros and cons,'' he said. ``From there, it's up to the player,
just as long as it's a legal substance. And andro is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang said a certain number of Rangers players were using andro
last season, long before the McGwire controversy. ``None of them
use it this year, not because of what happened with McGwire, but
because they didn't think it was a factor,'' said Lang. ``These
were big and strong guys when they were taking it, and they are
still big and strong guys.''
</P>
<P>
   A few other Rangers, according to Lang, are trying andro this
season. ``As long as everyone understands possible side effects,
and there may be some, it's not that big a deal as long as baseball
approves it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only with McGwire did it become a large deal. In fact, it became
almost a nightmare. Based on what's happening this season, it was a
nightmare over nothing.

GORE SEES DISCRIMINATION, BUT ALSO GAINS FOR BLACKS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Vice President Al Gore, wooing blacks and liberals at
a conference organized by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, said Saturday
that America had ``not openly acknowledged'' its legacy of
discrimination, especially ``the pain of slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination,
also lashed out repeatedly at Republicans as greedy and unfair, but
did not mention his Democratic rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, who
spoke at the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition conference here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the Clinton administration was doing too little to
help poor children.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first two-term Democratic president since Franklin
Roosevelt,'' Bradley said, ``the number of children in poverty in
America has barely blipped down.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who made unsuccessful presidential bids of his own in
1984 and 1988, has said he has not decided which of the two
Democratic candidates he will endorse.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in introducing the vice president, Jackson described
him as ``perhaps the next president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore praised Jackson as a civil rights hero and recalled the
work of his own late father, Al Gore Sr., in championing civil
rights as a senator from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that blacks in America had benefited greatly from the
economic prosperity of the Clinton era. And he said the White House
had promoted diversity at the highest ranks, noting that seven
blacks had been appointed to Cabinet positions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore won perhaps his biggest applause when he called for an end
to racial profiling, which includes the practice of singling out
blacks for police questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``DWI is a crime _ DWB is not,'' he said, contrasting driving
while intoxicated to ``driving while black.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also reiterated his call for a $1 increase in the minimum
wage, preschool for all American children and strong affirmative
action policies.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said on Friday that he was organizing his campaign
around the theme of racial unity. ``I'm staking my presidential
campaign on the belief that over 50 to 60 percent of Americans,
including white Americans, want to have racial unity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also voiced skepticism at Gore's vow to end the practice
of racial profiling if he became president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `Why wait?''' Bradley said. ``Why doesn't he walk down
the hall, put the executive order in front of the president and ask
him to sign it?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Saturday that the Clinton administration could take a
big share of the credit for a rosy economic picture, which included
substantial gains by blacks. He said the rate of poverty among
blacks was at its lowest point in the nation's history and the rate
of home ownership among blacks was at its highest.
</P>
<P>
   But he said some places of deep poverty and desperation in
America seemed almost untouched by ``these times of plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here today to tell you I am not satisfied and I know we
can do better,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the average family wealth of blacks was about
one-tenth that of whites, a disparity he attributed to generations
of discrimination. He also lamented that nearly a half-century
after the Supreme Court ruling that struck down segregation in
public schools, more than two-thirds of black children attended
schools where minority students predominated. Children in those
schools, Gore said, were some 16 times more likely to be poor than
children in predominantly white schools.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president criticized what he described as the
undercounting of blacks and members of other minorities by the
Census Bureau. And he pledged to support stiffer penalties for
attacks based on a victim's ethnicity or religion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also sprinkled his speech with references to religious
faith. ``I believe that God's hand has touched the United States of
America on purpose and not by accident,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore criticized a Republican plan approved by Congress this week
that would cut taxes by $792 billion, saying that the top 1 percent
of income earners would see as much relief as the bottom 60 percent
combined.
</P>
<P>
   He described the plan as a ``special interest smorgasbord'' that
would ``tear the country apart.''

 &HT;    Forever bound by misfortune
 &HT;    By Brad Schrade and Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kenny Doonan's hope returned with a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Doonan was in a Northside Hospital room watching over his
youngest son, Brent. Mark O. Barton had shot him four times: in the
stomach, chest and arms. A fifth bullet grazed his face.
</P>
<P>
   It was early July 31, two days after the Buckhead shootings, and
doctors had earlier removed a tube from Brent's throat that had
prevented speaking. The clock read 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad. Dad. Get my clothes,'' Brent whispered from his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' Kenny Doonan asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting out of here,'' his son whispered back.
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment of relief for Brent's father, even though his
son is still in the hospital recovering from the flurry of shots at
the All-Tech Investment Group office where Brent is part owner. The
joy from that whisper equaled the happiness when Brent _ the middle
of three kids _ was born 26 years ago today, Kenny Doonan said.
</P>
<P>
   Brent is improving, but, like many of the 13 wounded, he is a
long way from being healed.
</P>
<P>
   He has trouble sleeping. At night memories of the shooting haunt
him. He has asked the hospital to send his get-well flowers to the
gravesides of the nine people who did not survive.
</P>
<P>
   He has had nurses wheel him down the hall to visit one of his
employees, 22-year-old Meredith Winitt, who was shot in the back.
She has been upgraded to fair condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical is going OK,'' Brent said. ``What's so hard for
me to get over is the emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   SEEKING A PAINLESS DEATH
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of seconds, Marci Brookings had prepared herself to
die. She works at Momentum Securities, where Barton started firing
his two handguns around 2:50 p.m. on July 29.
</P>
<P>
   Hit in the left shoulder blade, she fell and played dead. All
she could do was lay on the floor and think of a painless death as
Barton continued his rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the first shot didn't hurt,'' Brookings said. ``I
was comforting myself on the floor. I was thinking the next one
won't hurt either.'' Brookings flew to Houston to attend Monday's
funeral of another shooting victim and co-worker, Kevin Dial. She
has been to other memorial services for the shooting victims. She
feels lucky to have lived and has thought about the people who
died. And their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy is over, but nothing is normal,'' Brookings said.
``My wounds will heal far before my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuzef Liberzon has been close to death on a ventilator at Grady
Memorial Hospital since the shooting. The Ukranian immigrant from
Kiev was a taxi driver who took up day trading because he wanted a
less dangerous job. Barton fired one bullet into Liberzon's head.
Surgery removed the bullet, but his family was unsure whether the
39-year-old man would live, friends say. Liberzon is in critical
condition at Grady but expected to live.
</P>
<P>
   Liberzon had health insurance, but a fund has been set up to
help his family. Many in the tight-knit Russian community continue
to drop off food and money at the condominium he shares with his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``People realize this could have happened to anyone,'' said
Lenny Veksler, a friend who was sitting beside Liberzon when he was
shot. ``None of us know what we could face. So that makes people
become human, become softer.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the shooting, Brent Doonan had planned to celebrate his
birthday by bar-hopping with friends. The limousine was lined up.
Instead, he will celebrate the day, which is also his mother's
birthday, with family at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, as he spoke about his birthday and recovery, Brent
was out of his bed, sitting up in a chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thankful to be alive,'' Brent said.

 &HT;    Golf cart spill gives Santiago a bruising
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ When the Falcons practiced in Jacksonville
last summer, coach Dan Reeves said a solid morning session ``set
the tempo'' for an NFC Championship season.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's practices with the Jacksonville Jaguars at Furman
University, the tempo was set when starting tight end O.J. Santiago
fell off a moving golf cart on his way to the practice fields.
</P>
<P>
   He badly bruised himself on the left side from the butt to his
calf, and might have sprained his knee.
</P>
<P>
   No structural damage is feared, but that clearly annoyed Reeves
on a day when 13 players missed all or part of camp with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time something moves, you can get hurt,'' said Reeves, who
earlier in training camp nearly ran over Furman president David Shi
in a golf cart while Shi was jogging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys were running a little bit late, they get in a hurry,
and all of a sudden a guy falls off the cart.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegedly, the accident occured when several carts were weaving
among each other on an incline.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he went flying when the cart cornered too fast, he
said, ``It was something like that. I'm not going to say much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's from my ankle all the way up the hamstring. We'll know
more later. I'll be out there as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Next
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will be off today, and in fact several veterans
headed back to Atlanta on Saturday night. They must return in time
for meetings at 7 p.m. today. The team will practice Monday,
perhaps just once because so many players are hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The good, bad and ugly
</P>
<P>
   The good _ Strong-side linebacker Keith Brooking had an
interception in morning passing drills.... Rookie wide receiver
Eugene Baker made several nice catches, including one in the end
zone where he barely got his second foot down for a touchdown....
In the afternoon session, quarterback Chris Chandler was sharp, and
completed his first six passes in one drill.
</P>
<P>
   The bad _ Right tackle Ephraim Salaam had a much better
afternoon than morning: At one point in the early session, Jaguars
rookie end Chris White pushed him straight backward on his butt,
and on the next play ran right past him. ``It was one of those
days,'' Salaam said.... Wide receiver Tim Dwight made some nice
catches, including a touchdown in the afternoon where he just got
his feet in. But he dropped several passes Saturday, and
occasionally had problems beating coverage at the line.... Running
back Ken Oxendine fumbled twice on one play.... Jacksonville
cornerback Aaron Beasley got past tight end Rod Monroe to block a
Morten Andersen field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The ugly _ In the afternoon, reserve defensive tackle Bob
Kuberski got locked up with Jaguars rookie guard Anthony Cesario
when their helmets got tangled at the face mask.
</P>
<P>
   Stone Mountain update
</P>
<P>
   Falcons officials could decide by Monday whether to go forward
with plans to build a two-story, 70,000-square foot facility in
Stone Mountain Park in time for the start of next season.
</P>
<P>
   President Taylor Smith, general manager Harold Richardson and
others met Friday with officials from the park and Silver Dollar
City, the Branson, Mo.-based company that manages the park.
</P>
<P>
   Present aches and pains
</P>
<P>
   Missing both Saturday practices were defensive end Chuck Smith
(sprained right big toe), center Todd McClure (right knee), wide
receiver Chris Calloway (sprained left ankle), tight end O.J.
Santiago (bruised left side), wide receiver Eric Harris (back),
defensive end Brett Williams (knee).
</P>
<P>
   Wide receivers Ronnie Harris (groin) and Terance Mathis (back)
left in the midst of the morning session, as did reserve cornerback
Eli Williams (right knee), and defensive tackle Ben Huff (sprained
right foot).
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, reserve middle linebacker Ruffin Hamilton
(right knee) and cornerback Michael Booker (right thigh) were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The future
</P>
<P>
   Brett Williams has cartilage damage in his knee, and will be out
another couple weeks, maybe longer if ligament damage is
discovered. Smith might return to practice next week after missing
every session since opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Elijah Williams will miss at least two weeks with minor tearing
of his medial collateral ligament.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton hyperextended his knee, and strained his quadricep
tendon. He won't practice Monday, but could return next week.
</P>
<P>
   McClure, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament July 30, almost
certainly is out for the season, and running back Gary Downs
already is on injured reserve after undergoing surgery for a torn
lateral collateral ligament in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Byron Hanspard was rested in the afternoon
practice, as planned, while continuing his recovery from last
year's serious left knee injury
</P>
<P>
   Tight checkbook
</P>
<P>
   A season-ending knee injury July 30 to running back Gary Downs
and McClure, who almost certainly end up on injured reserve, will
cost Atlanta $575,000 and $183,333, respectively, or about 1.3
percent of the $57.3 million salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   The team has about $250,000 left under the cap, meaning even if
the Falcons wanted to get a talented player released elsewhere, the
front office would have to create room by cutting players with high
salaries, or restructuring some contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   There was a crowd of about 1,000 in the morning, 2,400 in the
afternoon.... Backup left guard Greg Bishop got some work at No. 1,
and his first work at No. 3 center.... Jacksonville guard Todd
Fordham, a former All-State player at Georgia's Tift County High,
went down screaming Saturday morning. He tore the medial collateral
ligament in his left knee, and more damage may be found today.
While he was screaming, Chuck Smith yelled from afar, ``Hang in
there, big dog.''... The Falcons offense appeared surprised in the
morning during 9-on-7 drills when Jacksonville defensive
coordinator Dom Capers was blitzing safeties.

 &HT;    Falcons `Jag-ged' in joint practice
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ The Falcons' young wide receivers got plenty
of work in Saturday's joint practices with the Jacksonville
Jaguars. That's the first part of the good news.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the bad news is they had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Starting split end Chris Calloway is on crutches after spraining
an ankle Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement, Ron Harris, strained a groin muscle Saturday
morning, and starting flanker Terance Mathis left the field after
twisting his back.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis returned in the afternoon; Harris did not.
</P>
<P>
   Including previous injuries, 13 players missed all or part of
Saturday's work.
</P>
<P>
   In a scrimmage in Jacksonville last year, the Falcons ``set the
tempo'' for their NFC Championship season, according to coach Dan
Reeves, when they got the better of the Jags.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it was the other way around, especially in the
matchup of the Falcons' offense against Jacksonville's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys worked hard, but understand, Jacksonville didn't come in
here thinking it was just a regular practice,'' Mathis said. ``They
want to measure up to where we are. We did decently; we can
practice a lot better. We have a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday started off on the wrong foot, or leg, when starting
tight end O.J. Santiago fell off a moving golf cart on the way to
practice. He badly bruised his left leg, and was limping in street
clothes the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of set the tempo as far as injuries were
concerned,'' Reeves said. ``You see some of the deficiencies you
have when you practice against somebody else. We need our better
players.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other injuries, as reserve defensive tackle Ben Huff
(sprained right foot), reserve cornerback Eli Williams (sprained
right knee), reserve middle linebacker Ruffin Hamilton (sprained
right knee), and cornerback Michael Booker (strained right thigh)
went down.
</P>
<P>
   The news wasn't as bad for the defense, although defensive
tackle Shane Dronett said, ``It wasn't as good as last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Things went better in the afternoon, when the offense was more
crisp, although reserve quarterbacks Tony Graziani and Sherdrick
Bonner struggled.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive intensity was good in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reeves didn't seem thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have not done any extra conditioning after practice
since training camp started, and he said Thursday he felt players
were in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the injuries are typically associated with poor
conditioning. This on a team that had starters miss just 20 of a
possible 352 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing because I thought we came in here in really
good condition,'' Reeves said. ``It doesn't take but one or two
plays offensively, and you get a really bad taste in your mouth.
I've got several bad tastes in my mouth.

 &HT;    Some unfinished business for Waltrip
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Darrell Waltrip, who earlier in the week said he
was leaving Winston Cup driving after the 2000 season, had an early
retirement at the Brickyard 400 on Saturday. The No. 66 Ford drove
off the track after only 58 laps because of ignition problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going down the back, I was thinking about trying to pass
(Dale) Earnhardt and them,'' Waltrip said. ``I pulled out and (the
car) quit ... it just died and wouldn't fire back up.''
</P>
<P>
   The early exit was the final part of an emotional weekend for
the 52-year-old. On top of the retirement announcement, Waltrip had
to qualify because he was out of provisionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I come back next year, I hope I don't struggle like I did
this week,'' said Waltrip, who started 35th. ``The announcement and
barely getting in the race ... then to have a bad day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to a great run today. I thought we had a
good car and were up for that, but obviously we left something
undone here.''
</P>
<P>
   Big words from Little
</P>
<P>
   Chad Little launched an attack on Geoff Bodine after they mixed
it up in consecutive turns on lap 43, with the second tangle
sending Little into the wall and out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a brain-dead maneuver (by Bodine),'' said Little, who
was uninjured. ``I got bumped by a bald-headed cue ball.'' After a
long pause, the Ford No 97 driver said, ``I'm not saying anything
because I'm counting to 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot Wheels on fire
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Petty had the scariest wreck of the day. On lap 72, the No.
44 Hot Wheels car blew a right front tire in turn 1 and slammed
into the retaining wall at an estimated speed of 170 mph. Petty
climbed out with no assistance as the car's front end burst into
flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must have ran over something on the track,'' Petty said of the
flat tire.
</P>
<P>
   Extra Laps
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Craven, who finished 38th, signed with Midwest Transit
Racing to drive the No. 50 Chevy for the remainder of the season.
... While the majority of the field was in the pit, Dave Marcis
sneaked to the front on lap 75. At age 58, Marcis became the oldest
driver to lead a lap at the Brickyard 400. The previous record was
set in the '94 event by Harry Gant _ then 54 years old. Marcis was
forced out on lap 143 because of a smoking engine. ... Jeff and
Ward Burton battled it out for fifth place and family pride during
the final 10 laps. The cars exchanged the lead several times, with
Jeff edging his older brother at the checkered flag. ... Ricky
Rudd, in desperate search of a sponsor for next year, helped his
cause by finishing ninth _ his first top 10 of the season. ``We
needed (this),'' Rudd said. ``We're nervous, with not having a
sponsor yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Busch down to a point
</P>
<P>
   While Brickyard winner Dale Jarrett holds a seemingly invincible
lead in the Winston Cup points standings, the Busch Series is as
tight as it gets. Dale Earnhardt Jr., who finished fifth in
Friday's Kroger 200, has a slim one-point advantage over Matt
Kenseth in the standings, 3,102 to 3,101. Jason Keller of
Greenville, S.C., won the race under a caution flag from the pole.

 &HT;    Perez suspension starts; Simon sent down, Matos brought up
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Eddie Perez settled his problem Saturday. Now the
Braves have one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Perez dropped his appeal of his four-game suspension, not so
coincidently the morning after he caught Greg Maddux, and began
serving his punishment for fighting Philadelphia's Paul Byrd last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to do it now, rather than later, I guess,'' Perez said.
``We just talked with (National League president Len) Coleman on
the phone. There's no chance to get a game less (reduction). He
said, ``No, no, no.'''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot for the Braves: they lose a catcher plus a .314
hitter. The club recalled catcher Pascual Matos from Class AAA
Richmond to back up Greg Myers. But in order to open a spot on the
25-man roster, they were forced to send rookie first baseman
Randall Simon back to Richmond, where by option rules he must stay
for at least 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't go, they have to release someone like Ozzie
(Guillen) or Otis (Nixon) or somebody like that,'' Simon said.
``Bobby (Cox, Braves manager) says he tried to think of all kinds
of way to try to leave me here but they couldn't do anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Rookie Bruce) Chen is here now and there's no one else with
options.''
</P>
<P>
   Matos's stay will last only as long as Perez sits out, when they
Braves will pull the hottest bat they can find in Richmond. There
is not prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a bunch of guys,'' manager Bobby Cox said, naming Brad
Tyler (.290, 21 HR), Howard Battle (.292, 20 HR), Toby Rumfield
(.269, 12 HR) and Marty Malloy (.307, 7 HR). ``All kinds of names
popped up. I'm just leaving it to the organization to bring us a
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon is not only leading the team in average but had helped
solidify defense at first base, with just three errors in 451 total
chances. Ryan Klesko returned to first Saturday, making his first
start there since May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Keith Lockhart lasted just two batters Saturday
before a collision with San Francisco's F.P. Santangelo opened a
gash in Lockhart's lower lip, sending him to Piedmont Hospital for
two stitches and precautionary X-rays on his jaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he comes in here (this morning) not feeling well, it's a
different story,'' said assistant trainer Jeff Porter. ``But as of
right now, he can play (today).
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart was injured trying to cover first base on a Santangelo
bunt, after Klesko, in his first start at first base in 68 days,
got crossed up on covering duties. Lockhart arrived at the base
late to take pitcher Terry Mulholland's throw, just in time to take
Santangelo's elbow to the head, causing him to bite through his
bottom lip.
</P>
<P>
   Odalis returns
</P>
<P>
   Just two days after elbow surgery, rookie Odalis Perez visited
the clubhouse before the game, a more encouraged man than a week
ago. In a ``Tommy John'' procedure by Birmingham surgeon James
Andrews, a tendon from Perez's left wrist was tranplanted in the
elbow to replace a torn ulnar ligament. Andrews also removed a bone
spur. The average recovery time is 12-to-18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me everything this good,'' Perez said. ``I don't
think it'll be necessary to be out for a year. That's what they
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   With a 3-for-5 day, catcher Greg Myers increased his average to
.421 (8-for-19) with six RBIs.... Giants left fielder Barry Bonds
missed the game because of back spasms that forced him out of
Friday night's game.... Newcomer Jose Hernandez made his debut at
first base after a pinch-hit single in the sixth. Although he has
played at every position but pitcher or catcher in his career, he
has spent the least time at first (seven games).

 &HT;    Family ask if they could've saved daughter
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The press of information-hungry journalists. A nation
imposing its attention on a South Georgia town. Gory details of a
family wiped away at the hands of a brutal murderer.
</P>
<P>
   For Leigh Ann Barton's grandmother, Pauline Vandiver, it all
seems nearly as familiar as the sweet tea she makes for her family
on a hot summer day.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six years ago, Vandiver's first love, Aubrey Alday, was
shot to death in the notorious slaughter of the Ned Alday family in
Seminole County. Vandiver's brother also was then married to Ned
Alday's sister. Escaped convict Carl Isaacs and three other men
killed six people execution-style following a bungled burglary at
the Alday home. Isaacs and his accomplices remain in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Now 78, Vandiver has watched her extended family endure murder
trials and years of legal wrangling over the death sentences given
to the Aldays' killers. It has all been background noise in the
life of Leigh Ann Barton's sister, Kelly Argo, but the 35-year-old
mother of four is well aware of the kind of pain that comes from
being so close to one of Georgia's worst mass murders.
</P>
<P>
   Argo considers it something of a blessing that Mark O. Barton,
44, killed himself after killing her 27-year-old sister, his two
children and nine office workers in what is now known as the worst
mass murder in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our family can go through another 20 years of
trials.''
</P>
<P>
   But without a trial to direct the family's emotions, they are
left to seek the clues to Barton's evil that they missed before.
They are left to pick apart a thousand smiles, and wonder whether
they came from a devoted husband or a calculating murderer.
</P>
<P>
   LIKABLE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Argo is clear about this: She didn't just lose a sister, a
niece and a nephew that she loved dearly. She also lost a brother.
</P>
<P>
   Argo and her husband, Gary, 37, had grown close to Barton during
his four-year marriage to Leigh Ann. When visiting Leigh Ann's
family in Macon, the Bartons always stayed with the Argos at their
five-bedroom manufactured home, neatly accented with hunter green
shutters on tan siding. Barton helped Gary dig stumps out of the
sandy dirt to make way for the home off a Jones County back road
southeast of Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Barton was one of Gary's groomsmen for the Argos' 1996 wedding.
He walked two grandmothers and Leigh Ann's mother down the aisle.
The couples' wedding anniversaries were so close they would often
celebrate them together. A game of Pictionary was a regular event
for the foursome.
</P>
<P>
   Gary and Barton grew particularly close. They spent countless
evenings over a hot grill, talking and cooking. They fried turkeys
over holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark liked things hot,'' Kelly Argo recalled. ``He could make
some chili that could tear your mouth up.''
</P>
<P>
   The families' children also grew close. Kelly's son, Derek, 12,
and Barton's son, Matthew, 11, spent hours swimming in the Argos'
above-ground pool and playing video games on Derek's Nintendo 64.
Gary and Barton would often team up against the boys to play a
James Bond game.
</P>
<P>
   Barton's daughter, Mychelle, 7, loved to hike with Kelly's
6-year-old daughter, Calyn. Gary would mow paths for the girls in
the tall brush behind the house. Gary found it odd that Barton
never spoke of his dead wife, Debra Spivey, the mother of his
children, or her 1993 murder. Not once in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get to know a friend like that you just talk about
anything,'' Gary said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly also noted that the Barton rental home in Morrow had no
photos of Spivey, though Barton kept a college photo of her in his
wallet. Family members said Barton wouldn't let his children talk
about their mother or her murder. On Mother's Day, Leigh Ann, not
Barton, would take the children to their mother's grave.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly admitted she had concerns early on about Barton, who was a
suspect in the bludgeoning deaths of his first wife and his
mother-in-law, Eloise Powell Spivey. But the Argos had grown
comfortable in the knowledge that Leigh Ann was ``thoroughly
convinced'' her husband had nothing to do with the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``After spending four years with him, I honestly didn't believe
he was capable of it,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs to the contrary, though.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Leigh Ann told Kelly she discovered a receipt for a
$1 million insurance policy Barton had taken out on her. It
frightened her, Kelly recalled. Leigh Ann had also found a tax
document in which Barton said he earned more than $460,000 the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   When Leigh Ann asked about the money, Barton admitted he
received an insurance settlement from his first wife's death. She
asked whether they could pay off their $6,000 in debt and buy a
house. Barton said no. The money was his and she shouldn't benefit
from his former wife's death, Barton told her. This upset Leigh
Ann, who had been working 60 hours a week to support the family
because Barton was not working.
</P>
<P>
   After Leigh Ann left her husband in October, he finally told her
that he had lost all of the money day trading.
</P>
<P>
   Barton promised to stop. It was a promise he wouldn't keep.
</P>
<P>
   Around March, Kelly helped Barton make a list of 40 things he
had to do in order for Leigh Ann to get back with him. One of them
was to quit day trading. Kelly remembers Barton's insistence that
he could make just as good a living day trading as working at a
salaried job.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Barton told Gary that he had made several thousand
dollars day trading. Kelly scolded Barton, who told her he had his
trading under control. Barton began calling the Argos less. Barton
and his children eventually moved back in with Leigh Ann.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Leigh Ann was killed, Kelly got a nervous feeling at
work, like something was wrong. She called home to make sure her
children and husband were all right and found them fine. Even then,
Kelly wasn't suspicious enough of her brother-in-law to think it
might be Leigh Ann who was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, hours after the shootings in Buckhead, next-door
neighbors flagged down Kelly as she drove her Mazda minivan down
the dirt road to her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark has gone on a rampage and he's killed a bunch of people
in Buckhead,'' Argo recalled a neighbor saying. ``I asked
immediately, what about Leigh Ann and the babies?''
</P>
<P>
   Gary called Leigh Ann's work to find out where she was.
Co-workers said she had taken a couple of days off. Kelly knew all
her sister's days off. Something was wrong. Before long, the news
came: Three people were found dead in the Bartons' Stockbridge
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to get dressed without her helping me pick
out clothes,'' Kelly said tearfully, as she talked about her
sister's clothes still hanging in the bedroom Barton and Leigh Ann
used.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Kelly has an overwhelming desire to apologize for
Barton to the familes of the office workers he killed in Buckhead.
She spoke to someone from each of the families at Wednesday's
citywide memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   A CIRCLE BROKEN
</P>
<P>
   Another of Leigh Ann's three sisters, Dana Reeves, wondered how
such a strong, close family wasn't able to stop Barton before it
was loo late. Maybe it's because the girls kept their marriage
problems to themselves, she concluded, surrounded by shampoos and
conditioners in the Macon hair dressers' supply store she manages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Leigh Ann just got involved with the wrong person. Her
entrapment was the kids,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Before she identified Leigh Ann's body for Henry County police,
the last time Reeves, 32, saw her sister was at a May birthday
party for Kelly Argo's daughter Lea. The fourth sister, Amy
Vandiver, 28, was there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The four of us just sat in Kelly's den and just laughed and
cut up,'' she remembered.
</P>
<P>
   She talked about how Leigh Ann moved out of her mother's home
before her senior year and moved in with Reeves to get some
independence. She remembers how Leigh Ann used to slip Reeves' baby
girl out of the crib at night and cuddle her in her bed.
</P>
<P>
   Now she balances those images with the body bags she saw police
carry from Leigh Ann's Stockbridge apartment. She remembers wishing
it was someone else in the bags, and that the sisters were still
four strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone from a circle to a triangle now,'' she said,
looking toward the holidays. ``That's when it's really going to
hit, when we're not all there.''
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONS OF GUILT
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Ann's father, Joe Vandiver, is the kind of man who gets
his packs of Marlboro lights from a carton, but who remembers the
three times in his life he's been drunk.
</P>
<P>
   He says ``I love you'' after phone calls with relatives and hugs
his close friends. But this Vietnam veteran won't cower from a
threat and he won't hesitate to use one of his guns to defend his
family.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Vandiver isn't the type to meddle in his children's
affairs, but he likes to know where they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to hear from her all the time, as long as
somebody heard from her,'' Vandiver said, exhaling smoke from his
nostrils as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Since his daughter's death, details of the Alabama police
investigation of Barton in his first wife's death have hit Vandiver
like sledgehammers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not blaming myself for the deaths of any of them, I just
wish I had had more information so I could have done something to
spare my daughter and these two children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vandiver said he never got close to Barton because he didn't
trust him. In fact, he told his daughter on several occasions that
he believed Barton killed his first wife and mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of heartburn when I realized they were seeing
each other,'' Vandiver recalled. ``She assured me I was wrong. It
wasn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if he had gotten closer, he could have seen something to
change his daughter's mind, Vandiver said.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Vandiver talked to Leigh Ann, whom the family
called Honey, was two weeks before her death. She had called to say
she was back home after a business trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very brief conversation. I think I was headed out or
something like that,'' he said, peering into the kitchen table. ``A
real, really brief phone call. That won't happen that way ever
again.''
</P>
<P>
   At Leigh Ann's burial, Vandiver insisted on shoveling the dirt
onto his daughter's grave. In the South Georgia heat, at a small
family cemetery out in the fields near Ocilla, he dripped over a
shovel while two of Kelly Argo's children used their hands to scoop
dirt onto their Aunt Honey's grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seen her come into this world and I'm going to see she's put
up right,'' Vandiver told his mother.

TAYLOR LEADS CLASS OF 1999 INTO HALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ Lawrence Taylor stood near the steps of the Pro
Football Hall of Fame Saturday and talked about being knocked down
and about getting up, about honor, class, friendship and family. He
talked about football. Giants football.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Lawrence Jr., had presented him as a member of the
Class of '99 _ Taylor said those moments almost made him cry _ and
they stood together onstage in a long embrace, whispering into each
other's ears an exchange meant only for father and son. A memory
for both that will last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went for Taylor and for each of the inductees, an
overflow of emotion and memories that will last forever, and bronze
busts in their likeness placed in the hall to last as long. Taylor,
Eric Dickerson, Tom Mack, Ozzie Newsome and Billy Shaw pushed the
number in the Hall of Fame to 199.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was the last among the five to be inducted, No. 199, and
thus the last entrant of the 1900s. His number and name in the
hearts of Giants fans, though, will always be No. 56 and LT.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 Giants fans were here Saturday, including team
owner Wellington Mara, who was inducted into the hall last year.
Giants fans filled an entire section in the upper tier of the crowd
and were loud and bold in their blue and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``LT, LT, LT,'' they chanted, all day long.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous before I came out,'' Taylor said, ``but
then I saw all that Giants stuff through the glass door and I knew
I was in Giants territory. I think back; how did I get here?''
</P>
<P>
   Others wondered, too. There was no denying his impact in pro
football, a fearless linebacker who rushed the passer and pursued
ballcarriers with venom and power and then delivered jolting,
punishing tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was the key cog in two Giants Super Bowl championships,
in 1987 and 1991. But his selection to the hall was controversial
to some because of his off-field problems since he retired from the
Giants in 1993, including drug arrests and his admission of cocaine
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hall of Fame voters said he did not belong because his
personal life had tarnished the game. Taylor criticized those
voters, asking who they were to judge him. Because of that
backdrop, many arrived Saturday wondering what Taylor might say.
There were fears that he might lash out and make a spectacle out of
what was supposed to be a special day for all involved.
</P>
<P>
   There was none of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do understand the game and how this is an honor,'' Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was humble. He was reflective. He talked about one of his
teammates, a peer at linebacker, Harry Carson, who was in the
crowd. Taylor and Carson ``had some words'' and ``hadn't talked for
a while,'' Taylor said, but there Carson was in attendance
supporting him.
</P>
<P>
   Carson had said that he and other teammates had tried meeting
with Taylor several times over the last few months and years but
that Taylor avoided them. Carson had been critical of Taylor's
post-football behavior. But Saturday, a new bond between them
appeared born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Carson,'' Taylor said, pointing at him. ``What you have
done here today is the classiest thing I have ever seen. Thank you.
I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson kissed his fingers and pointed back at Taylor, then
touched his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor thanked Mara, former Giants general manager George Young,
and Bill Parcells, his former Giants coach. Taylor said Parcells
``knew the game of football, knew me well and was able to put the
two together.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor excelled. He was the league's most valuable player in
1986. He was a three-time league defensive player of the year. He
earned 10 Pro Bowl berths. He is a member of the league's 75th
anniversary team selected in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   When presenting him, Taylor's 17-year-old son, known as TJ, said
that his friends always used to ask him to get his father to sign
memorabilia. He said that his father ``does many things right,''
and that people ``admired LT the football player but I admire
Lawrence Taylor my father.''
</P>
<P>
   In front of the hall that his son described as ``the place where
legends live,'' Taylor concluded this way: ``I'd like to thank my
kids for understanding that people do make mistakes in life and
somehow they have the ability to love and forgive me anyway. Life
can knock you down, it can turn you out and you have problems every
day of your life. Sometimes you just have to go play. Anybody can
quit. A Hall of Famer never quits. A Hall of Famer realizes that
the crime is not being knocked down. The crime is in not getting
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Each inductee shared Taylor's theme in saluting family,
teammates and friends who helped him reach the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson played with the Rams (1983-87), Colts (1987-91),
Raiders (1992) and Falcons (1993). He owns the league's
single-season rushing mark of 2,105 yards, set in 1984 in only his
second professional season. He is third on the career rushing list,
behind Walter Payton and Barry Sanders, with 13,259 rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   He was presented by Jackie Slater, one of his Rams linemen.
Slater said that in his 20 years of pro football he blocked for 37
running backs. Dickerson, he said, featured attributes of them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father told me that all you do, do with your might; things
done by half are never done right,'' Dickerson said. ``And that's
how I played.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack was a Rams guard from 1966 through 1978 and never missed a
game during his 184-game career. He played in 11 Pro Bowls in 13
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 60 miles from Cleveland to Canton,'' said Mack, who is a
Cleveland native and who waited 11 years before being inducted.
``It seems like a million miles away. But I believed this could
happen. Continue to believe in each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsome played tight end for the Cleveland Browns for 13 seasons
and caught 662 passes, the most by a player at his position. He
caught passes in 150 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   He left three years ago as an executive with the old Browns when
they moved to Baltimore to become the Ravens. He was classy as a
Brown. The Browns fans returned the favor Saturday, cheering
repeatedly for him.
</P>
<P>
   Newsome said this was a family reunion for him and said of the
expansion Browns' debut against the Dallas Cowboys in the Hall of
Fame pre-season game, ``On Monday night, the orange helmet is back
on the football field!''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns fans roared their approval.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, an offensive guard, was presented by his former trainer
with the Buffalo Bills, Eddie Abramoski. He became the first
trainer to serve as a presenter, but Shaw said Abramoski was a
natural choice because he had helped him heal and perform during
his career, which lasted from 1961 to 1969. Shaw is the first
inductee to have played his entire career in the old American
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I represent them all,'' Shaw said of his playing peers.
``These last few days have seemed unreal. There are so many
instrumental in my career. And friends _ what would a man be
without friends?''

COMPLETELY INCOMPLETE SEASON FOR METS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Overlooked because of all the ex-Dodgers at Shea
Stadium this weekend is a strange record the New York Mets are
close to setting. They have a chance to become the first
major-league team to win a division title without pitching a
complete game.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, only one Mets starter has even been permitted to return
to the mound for a ninth inning. That was Orel Hershiser, who went
eight innings against the Marlins on June 29.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it more amazing is that they are doing it despite
losing closer John Franco last month. Armando Benitez has taken
over the job, but the Mets also acquired relievers Billy Taylor and
Chuck McElroy at the trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets aren't entirely alone in this phenomenon: Of the six
division leaders, the Indians have just one complete game, the
Rangers two.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem so long ago that Hershiser pitched 15 complete
games for the Dodgers in 1988, a figure that's been matched only
twice since, by Jack McDowell, with the White Sox in 1991, and
Philadelphia's Curt Schilling last season. &QL; 
Expect some boos
</P>
<P>
   There will be big crowds this week when St. Louis comes to
Philadelphia and it has little to do with Mark McGwire. Phillies
fans want a chance to boo J.D. Drew, the second overall pick in the
1997 draft who refused to sign with them. This will be Drew's first
trip to Philadelphia and teammate Ricky Bottalico, the former
Phillies closer, has advised the 23-year-old outfielder to wear a
helmet in the outfield. ``He laughed, but I was serious,''
Bottalico said. ``I told him it's not going to be like two minutes
of booing, it's going to be all game, all day. He's never been to
Philly and I tried to make him realize it's not like St. Louis.'' &QL; 
Getting younger
</P>
<P>
   In attempts to reach the playoffs the past few seasons, the
Chicago Cubs stockpiled veteran players at the expense of
prospects, including Kennedy High's Jon Garland, who was sent to
the White Sox two years ago for reliever Matt Karchner. Now that
they are well out of the race, the Cubs are trying to reverse the
trend. In the deal that sent Terry Mulholland and Jose Hernandez to
Atlanta, Chicago received left-hander Micah Bowie, who got hammered
Tuesday by Montreal, and right-hander Ruben Quevedo, a 20-year old
Venezuelan who actually was the key to the deal. In his
minor-league career, Quevedo is just 20-20 but has 366 strikeouts
and only 108 walks in 363 innings. &QL; 
Big money
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Marlins and their No. 1 draft choice _ right-hander
Josh Beckett _ are still $3 million apart. But last month they did
sign a 16-year-old Venezuelan shortstop named Miguel Cabrera for a
$1.8 million signing bonus, more money than 22 of the 25 players
make on the Marlins roster. Only Alex Fernandez ($7 million), Cliff
Floyd ($2.5 million) and Jorge Fabregas ($1.85 million) have higher
salaries. Landing Cabrera, who already is 6-foot-2 and 190 pounds,
was considered quite a coup for the Marlins, who outbid the
Dodgers, Yankees and Braves. As for Beckett, if he is not signed he
will enter a junior college or Texas A&AMP;M and the Marlins will not
be able to negotiate until after the spring season. &QL; 
No Giant steps
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, which survived losing Barry Bonds for more than
two months earlier this season, might not be so lucky with Jeff
Kent on the disabled list with an inflamed left foot. The Giants
looked overmatched against West-leading Arizona when they lost two
of three earlier in the week. In Wednesday's series finale, an 8-4
loss, the Giants dropped Mark Gardner (3-9, 6.88) from the rotation
and promoted Joe Nathan from Triple-A Fresno. Nathan allowed five
runs, including three homers, in the first inning and was gone by
the second. He was sent back to the minors after the game. &QL;

SELF POSSESSED SETS RECORD FOR MILE IN HAMBLETONIAN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Trainer Ron Gurfein and driver Mike
Lachance are considered the odd couple of harness racing, but the
two men have combined to dominate the industry in recent years.
Saturday afternoon they teamed up for their third Hambletonian
title in the past six years by capturing the 74th edition of the
most prestigious event in harness racing in the fastest mile ever
trotted.
</P>
<P>
   Self Possessed gave the excitable Gurfein and the quiet Lachance
the $1 million Hambletonian in the bright sunshine at the
Meadowlands in grand fashion. Self Possessed captured the first
event of the triple crown for 3-year-old trotters in 1:51 3/5,
breaking the previous record of 1:51 4/5 set by Beat The Wheel in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Self Possessed crossed the finish line, Gurfein
raced into the middle of the Meadowlands Racetrack and gave
Lachance a bear hug. The two men said afterward that Saturday's
triumph was just as sweet as their others, with Continentalvictory
in 1996 and Victory Dream in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I loved him,'' Gurfein said of his meeting with
Lachance in the middle of the track. ``He made 35 good decisions. I
wasn't happy that he didn't leave early, but he got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Lachance's key decisions was to take Self Possessed away
from the rail after taking the lead near the halfway point. He
avoided any chances of injury and led his horse to a 5 1/2 length
victory over Angus Hall, a stablemate.
</P>
<P>
   Self Possessed did not break stride, the way he did in the
Beacon Course, the biggest race leading into the Hambletonian.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just cruising,'' Lachance said of Self Possessed. ``He
did everything on his own. He's strong and has a good head on his
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   The entry left as the overwhelming favorite and brought their
owners the bulk of the $1 million purse. The two brought $750,000,
with Enjoy Lavec, the third-place finisher, earning $120,000 in the
field of 10. Raffaello Ambrosio, the third horse in the entry,
finished fourth and earned $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   John Campbell, the winner of five Hambletonians, including last
year's, with Muscles Yankee, was the driver of Angus Hall Saturday
afternoon. Campbell had another successful day, adding another
title to his legendary career.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell captured his first title in the $500,000 Hambletonian
Oaks for 3-year-old pacing fillies when he rallied with Oolong down
the stretch to finish ahead of Lovelytobehold. Oolong is a
granddaughter of Superbowl, the last triple crown winner, and she
covered the mile in 1:54 4/5.
</P>
<P>
   ``She raced well last week, but she was better today,'' Campbell
said about Oolong, who was in seventh place most of the race.
Campbell got her into good position after three horses broke stride
before the half.
</P>
<P>
   The $400,000 Mistletoe Shalee for 3-year-old fillies was the
first stakes race of the afternoon, and it was captured by French
Panicure. Driven by George Brennan, French Panicure covered the
mile in 1:50 4/5, equaling the stakes record, and finished a length
ahead of Marfa Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bow Tie took the $131,000 U.S. Pacing Championship with a
strong finish even though he started on the outside. ``He can do
just about anything,'' said Luc Ouellette, the driver of Red Bow
Tie, who covered the mile in 1:48 4/5 for his eighth victory in 14
starts this season. He finished a head in front of Day in a Life.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of excitement was created in the eighth race when

SUPPAN GETS FRESH START WITH ROYALS

<P>
   ANAHEIM _ His Kansas City Royals teammates appreciate Jeff
Suppan's colorful wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Suppan's wearing his Hawaiian shirts the day before he
pitches now,'' reliever Scott Service barked in the visiting
clubhouse at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day in August,'' Suppan hollered back.
</P>
<P>
   The Don Ho look is nothing new for the 24-year-old Crespi High
product. Suppan began the tradition in 1996 while pitching for the
Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his appetite for Hawaiian attire, Suppan's career hasn't
been all flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals are Suppan's third team since the Red Sox made him
their second-round pick in 1993. Considered one of Boston's
brightest pitching prospects, he made his big-league debut at 20
and won seven of 10 decisions in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox found Suppan expendable and left him unprotected for
the 1998 expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a kinship with former Boston pitching coach Al Nipper,
Suppan was excited when the Diamondbacks selected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't frustrated at all about being unprotected. It was fun
for me to go to the West Coast. And I was going to a whole new
team. That was a new start for me and a new start for a lot of
things,'' he said. ``When you get picked by that first
organization, you think you'll be there forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks gave up on him in less than a season. Suppan
went 1-7 with a 6.68 ERA and was sent to the minors for two months
before the Royals purchased his contract last Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, a small-market franchise struggling to contend,
can't afford not to gamble with young pitchers such as Suppan who
have upside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have projects here. We're getting the best talent we
possibly can, but there are a lot of projects,'' Royals manager
Tony Muser said. ``We have a lot of guys that other teams didn't
keep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soupy's earned the chance to pitch every fifth day. He has a
chance to get to the next level. He's taking advantage of the
opportunity he has here.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppan is wise enough to know the Red Sox and Diamondbacks made
business decisions in letting him go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   And he's learned to cope with the game's instability and
constant roster shuffling at a young age.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals had enough confidence in Suppan to stick him in the
rotation right away. With the recent trade of Kevin Appier, Suppan
and Jose Rosado are Muser's most effective starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at a guy like Kevin Appier who's been here his whole
career, and just like that, he's traded. I look at being with three
organizations already as a good thing because I've already
experienced moving around,'' Suppan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of roadblocks last season. The Diamondbacks gave
me a lot of opportunities to perform. I didn't pitch well. They had
to go with who they thought could get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it is, yes this is a game. But it's also a
business. And for that team I didn't get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppan is more focused on giving the Royals some much-needed
innings. His 6-6 record is misleading compared to a 3.86 ERA that's
among the top 10 in the American League. There was even some talk a
couple of months ago of making the All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   He's averaged a shade less than seven innings among 21 starts
and registered his first career shutout last Tuesday when he
five-hit the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works hard. He studies the game. He studies the hitters.
It's hard to find a 24-year-old who studies the game like he's a
28-year-old. He's getting an early start,'' pitching coach Mark
Wiley said.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan admits he's more comfortable in the American League, but
his bat seems conducive to the designated hitter-less National
League. He had six hits in 22 at-bats with Arizona last season.
</P>
<P>
   And on July 18 at Wrigley Field, Suppan collected the first RBI
by a Royals pitcher since interleague play began.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan singled down the left-field line with runners on first
and second in a typical bunt situation. Muser let his pitcher swing
away, and Suppan bounced the ball past drawn-in Cubs third baseman
Tyler Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every pitcher thinks he's a good hitter,'' a grinning Suppan
said. ``I was a pretty good high school hitter. I try to put the
ball in play, get guys over with the bunt. That's all important.''
</P>
<P>
   So too is deciding what color Hawaiian shirt to wear to the
ballpark.

BOGGS STILL ENJOYING THE RIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wade Boggs' run at 3,000 hits was a bit
overshadowed this past week when Tony Gwynn and Mark McGwire teamed
up for some memorable baseball in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs, who has played for three teams, isn't as lovable as
Gwynn, a Padre since 1982. But that doesn't mean he isn't having
fun, especially after talking to another 3,000-hit man, Paul
Molitor, who played most of his career with Milwaukee but reached
the milestone with Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out and sought his advice,'' said Boggs, now with Tampa
Bay. ``I wanted to hear from somebody who had gone through this
kind of thing before. He told me this can be a roller-coaster and
to just enjoy the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggs has received well-wishes from celebrities such as Trisha
Yearwood, Jeff Foxworthy and Bill Cosby, but recognition from other
players has been the most gratifying. ``The biggest enjoyment that
I'm getting are all the guys on the other teams saying they've
enjoyed watching me and playing against me during my career.'' &QL; 
Good story
</P>
<P>
   Toronto rookie closer Billy Koch has a 101-mph fastball and 22
saves in his first 25 attempts. But he isn't too big to remember
his roots.
</P>
<P>
   Before last Monday's game at Yankee Stadium, Koch made his first
trip back to a Long Island hospital to meet the nurse who watched
over him after he was born Dec. 11, 1974. He was 12 weeks
premature, less than three pounds and given a 40 percent chance of
survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom kept in touch with them,'' said Koch. ``She felt since
I was here, it would be a pretty good idea if I met up with the
people who made sure I was here now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other intensive care staff remembered him, too, and
Koch said they couldn't believe he now stands 6-foot-3 and weighs
200 pounds _ ``about 198 pounds heavier than they remembered.'' &QL; 
Good deal
</P>
<P>
   A year and a few days after the Mariners traded Randy Johnson to
Houston, the two pitchers they acquired in the deal _ left-hander
John Halama and right-hander Freddy Garcia _ are a combined 20-8.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 22, has won 11 games in his first big-league season, and
no rookie has won more. Halama, 27, has now won nine consecutive
games _ tying the Mariners' single-season record. Brought out of
the bullpen and into the rotation on May 25, Halama, who starts
today against the Yankees, has gone 7-0 with a 3.35 ERA as a
starter. &QL; 
Off the table
</P>
<P>
   A lot of teams were interested in right-hander Scott Erickson,
but the Orioles now see him as a cornerstone for the future after
he rebounded from a 1-8 start to win six straight decisions before
losing his last time out.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Guzman, who went to Cincinnati, was expendable because he
figured to become a free agent at the end of the season, and the
Orioles weren't going to pay him $8 million a year to re-sign.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson is signed for a relatively modest $6.43 million per
season over the next four years, and should be a bargain if
free-agent prices remain as high as they were last winter. &QL; 
One reason
</P>
<P>
   The Indians keep saying that Travis Fryman (right knee) and Wil
Cordero (left wrist) will be back between Sept.1 and 15. But one of
the reasons they didn't trade for Chuck Finley was that they didn't
want to lose utility man Enrique Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   If Fryman can't come back, and they are unable to land a veteran
third baseman, Wilson is the safety net. GM John Hart toyed with
the thought of trading for a veteran left-handed hitter _ they
talked to Tampa about Fred McGriff, Seattle about David Segui and
Baltimore about Harold Baines _ to stack their lineup with lefties
in the postseason to counter right-handers such as Pedro Martinez
and David Cone. &QL;

 &HT;    Jarrett hot streak `as good as it gets'
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Dale Jarrett dominated Saturday's Brickyard 400
the same way he has the Winston Cup points race.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford No. 88 driver crossed the brick-laden finish line 3.351
seconds ahead of his nearest competitor at Indianapolis Motor
Speedway. Jarrett, who led 116 of 160 laps, increased his advantage
in the standings to 274 points over Mark Martin, the biggest margin
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anybody to shake me to wake me up,'' Jarrett
said. ``It's as good as it can get right now.''
</P>
<P>
   With his second victory in four years at the Brickyard, Jarrett
joined Jeff Gordon as the race's only two-time champions. Bobby
Labonte finished runner-up, while pole-sitter Gordon passed Martin
at the end to capture third place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good car all day long, but we couldn't run with
Jarrett,'' said Labonte, who won at Pocono Raceway July 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale is on a pretty good roll,'' Gordon said. ``It's like they
were bidding their time getting those top fives early in the season
and everything started clicking. Boom, now they are getting wins
and that team deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Jarrett's fourth win, 16th top five, and 18th top 10 in
20 races this season. What made Saturday's victory even more
satisfying is that Jarrett cruised into the winner's circle in the
car that ran out of gas in last year's Brickyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shed a lot of tears (last year),'' owner Robert Yates said.
``We couldn't even joke about running out gas for sixth months.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett gambled again this time and won. During his final pit
stop, crew chief Todd Parrott opted to only change the two right
side tires. It saved 8-9 seconds, and Jarrett was fortunate enough
to finish without any major handling problems.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was a family affair. Jarrett's father, former
Winston Cup driver Ned Jarrett, spotted for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an advantage to have Dad up there as long as we kept
him from commentating,'' Jarrett said with a laugh.

IT'S UP TO PLAYERS' UNION NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mark McGwire took a big step this week when he
announced on the eve of hitting his 500th home run that he was no
longer taking the performance-enhancing supplement Androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is the Major League Players Association's turn to agree
to a policy in an effort to monitor the widespread use of such
drugs in its sport.
</P>
<P>
   All these home runs are not just the result of bad pitching and
juiced baseballs. Supplements have become a part of everyday life.
Most of the time they are done in conjunction with diet and
extensive year-round weight lifting programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term effects are still largely unknown. Until they
are, there is a need for the union, which has bullied baseball to
keep drug testing out of the big leagues, to take the lead in
protecting its own.
</P>
<P>
   The union's solidarity during negotiations with owners is
legendary. When they talk about money issues such as salary
arbitration, they point to the impact it will have on generations
to come.
</P>
<P>
   Now they represent players who take supplements as if they were
candy, and the future doesn't seem quite so important.
</P>
<P>
   If McGwire hits (begin ital)only(end ital) 60 home runs this
year, it could be interpreted that Andro helped get him to 70 last
year. Those 10 home runs, in the mind of a kid battling for a job
with hundreds of other minor leaguers, is enough to make him want
more.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, McGwire spoke to Cardinals minor leaguers during
spring training and was surprised when the questions sounded more
like they were coming from pharmacists than 19-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   He knows he is a role model. That is why even though he doesn't
see anything wrong with Andro and Creatine in moderation, he knows
players striving to make the big time could go overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one scoop can get you this far then they think, wow, 10
scoops could do even more,'' McGwire said at the time. ``That's
what you have to guard against. They have to realize just how much
you have to thrash your body in the weight room. There are no
shortcuts.''
</P>
<P>
   But the union has attempted to make drugs a non-issue. Andro is
banned in the NFL, NCAA and the Olympics, but the Players
Association, through the collective bargaining agreement, has been
able to keep any drug-testing policy off the books.
</P>
<P>
   There are always bigger issues. Revenue sharing,
small-market/big-market discrepancies, arbitration eligibility. The
current agreement expires after the 2001 season and the drug issue
is expected to be ignored again.
</P>
<P>
   The financial strength of the game is too important to dabble in
trivia like health.
</P>
<P>
   In the minor leagues, where players have no leverage, random
drug testing is done. But without the big leagues showing the way,
there is no urgency. High-profile drug suspensions from the 1980s
are long past. Even when the Angels' Tony Phillips was arrested
several years ago for using cocaine during the height of a pennant
race, the club was powerless to punish him.
</P>
<P>
   Is Andro as serious as cocaine?
</P>
<P>
   No, but not enough is known about how serious it can be
long-term. Even a supplement such as Creatine, which no one
considers to be in the same league with Andro, carries a haunting
image. The players who use it constantly carry water to guard
against dehydration. What happens when there is no Evian around?
</P>
<P>
   Trainers are worried about kidney damage but have no control
over the way high-priced players are bulking up. Chicks dig the
long ball. So does Madison Avenue. Who's going to win (begin
ital)that(end ital) battle?
</P>
<P>
   The players' union has a chance to recognize the problem and be
part of the solution. You've made everyone wealthy. Make sure they
stay healthy. &QL;

QUEST TO ERADICATE LAND MINES IS PROCEEDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE _ Inside Nichols Hall on the University of Kansas
campus here, Tyson Malik occasionally clambers into a
750-square-foot concrete box filled with sand and buries objects at
varying depths. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His cohort, Abhijit Apte, then activates weird-looking antennas
along the box's edges. They track to and fro as they deliver
signals into a computer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pair is looking for land mines _ pinpointing exactly what
Malik has planted beneath the sand and the precise location. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who says Kansas is a dull, unexciting place? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The land mines are inert, rendered harmless by their donor, the
U.S. Army. But in shape, size and material they're the real McCoy,
not at all dissimilar to the estimated 60 million to 110 million
mines buried worldwide _ most often left in place after wars and
rebellions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The left-behind land mines kill or maim roughly 70 persons each
day, or one every 20 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's happening here and at several other university research
sites in the country is the hardly noticed, federally funded
program for the humanitarian removal of land mines from fields,
pastures, roads and paths in 65 nations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Land mines and Kansas have come together largely because of KU's
Remote Sensing Laboratory, a pioneer operation that has
participated in every space mission, developed new forms of
ground-penetrating radar and figured out a way to see through
glaciers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lab has spearheaded dozens of other applications of a
scientific discipline _ radar _ that most people know makes airline
flight safer, helped win the Battle of Britain and has something to
do with the innards of their kitchen microwave ovens. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the scourge of land mines has become a back-page issue
(although a blip did occur in the war in Kosovo) since the death of
the most conspicuous advocate of humanitarian mine removal,
Princess Diana. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But work is going apace. Part of what Malik, a senior
engineering student, and Apte, who's working on a graduate degree,
do may end up in devices that can detect mines through a variety of
sensors _ radar, acoustic, chemical, magnetic, even olfactory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting more tools in our box,'' said James Stiles,
assistant professor of engineering at the lab and a lead
investigator in the quest to ferret out land mines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The use of higher radar frequencies _ 100 times what they used
to be _ has been coupled with the quantum leap in computer
processing power, Stiles said. What was a dream just a decade ago
is now showing up as images on monitoring screens. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then we could send out the higher frequencies, but there
was no way we could interpret what they said,'' Stiles said. ``The
computer has changed all that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the computer and increased radar frequencies are new, said
Stiles, the time-tested method of de-mining has largely remained
static through the years _ a metal detector seeking either the mine
itself or some small metallic part inside it and a solitary figure
with a scant life expectancy probing just beneath the soil with a
rod or a knife. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The work is slow and dangerous. The cost of removal is high _
from $300 to $1,000 per mine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not that much different today than from World War II,''
said Stiles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Needed, he said, are devices that can identify a mine quickly,
at far less cost, and with a relatively low risk to people doing
the work. Which, he added, is a pretty big package and one that
nobody should expect to see overnight in the form of a
one-size-fits-all, inexpensive detecting machine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some mines are metal, others plastic, said Stiles. The earth has
magnetic anomalies that can frustrate even the most skillful
scientific solutions. Some mines are big enough to blow a track off
a tank; others will fit in a child's hand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Institutions around the country, said Stiles, working through
what is called the Multi-University Research Initiative, are
investigating dozens of scenarios to end the bane of mines. They
include such jawbreakers as nuclear quadrupole resonance and
photoacoustic spectroscopy to training golden retrievers to sniff
out mines or releasing genetically manipulated fruit flies that
flock to the odor from the explosives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KU, working with the University of Missouri at Columbia and
Rolla, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the University
of Texas at Arlington, is looking at something a little simpler _
the shape of mines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We know radar works when you take a field, plant some mines in
it and then go over it,'' Stiles said. ``You'll find the mines.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what, asked Stiles, if the field has rocks in it, not an
uncommon occurrence? And what if _ also not uncommon _ those rocks
are roughly the same size as land mines? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The result is a false alarm. Digging up one mine and five rocks
or more isn't exactly cost-effective. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The thrust here is to consider that land mines are cheap to
produce, roughly $3 to $10 each. They are cheap because they are
mass-produced, which means each, no matter its size, has a variety
of exact measurements up and down, sideways and crossways. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scientists call such dimensions the plane of vertical symmetry.
The measurements themselves don't matter; what counts is the
uniformity of the objects the radar is looking at. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because no two rocks are exactly alike, said Stiles, the key is
the ability to discern objects that fit the parameters of the plane
of vertical symmetry _ which would be determined by the radar and
the computer, with thousands of signals and computations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course you could defeat what we're doing by making land
mines in all sorts of shapes,'' said Stiles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, that would rule out most mass production and end
the one overriding attraction of land mines _ their big bang for a
small number of bucks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And what about the solitary figure who has to remove the mine?
Stiles said there also might be a simple answer for that _ water. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Put enough pressure behind water and run it through a tiny
nozzle, and you can cut through just about anything,'' he said.
``One of our people thinks something like that may work when the
mine is located. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn the earth around the mine to goo, and you expose the mine
for retrieval. Or use the water jet and just cut the mine in
two.'' &QL;

NEO-NAZIS ARE NO-SHOWS AT THEIR MARCH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a vast array of police sealing the capital's
downtown for his free-speech hate march, Davis Wolfgang Hawke, a
self-described neo-Nazi from Cyberspace, proved himself more of a
Chicken Little Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of counterdemonstrators were waiting near the White
House to shout him down. A force of 1,426 police officers _ more
than double the normal contingent _ provided a security cordon on a
scale last applied here to the NATO spring summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes and vocal cords were directed toward the Pennsylvania
Avenue march route as a security helicopter hovered ominously
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   But at the appointed hour only four followers of Hawke's
American Nationalist party showed up, after 300 were promised, the
police said, and those four quickly sized up the situation and left
town without marching a step or uttering a protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the city ought to sue these people,'' Police Chief
Charles H. Ramsey angrily declared as he stood in his riot helmet
complaining that the city had just spent close to one million
dollars protecting the civil rights of a no-show troublemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if they have no money,'' Ramsey fumed. ``We still
should sue them. I'll take their gym shoes. I'll take their
jackets.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawke is a 20-year-old student at Wofford College in
Spartanburg, S.C., who founded the Knights of Freedom party in 1996
to promote himself as the nation's future ``absolute, supreme
dictator.'' His party, now known as the American Nationalists,
sports Nazi paraphernalia and speaks hate against Jews and
nonwhites.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke, who hate-group researchers found changed his name from
Andrew Greenbaum in denial of his Jewish heritage, has been
belittled by older neo-Nazi groups as a mere ``hobbyist''
hatemonger trolling for disgruntled surfers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty
Law Center, a research organization that tracks American hate
groups, Hawke bragged that, after unsuccessful attempts to attract
attention, ``We started the Web site and that basically catapulted
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Potok estimated no more than 150 enrollees pay the $5-a-month
party dues to Hawke as he denounces ``the Jewish media'' and
aspires to fascist control of the nation. ``It's largely a cult of
personality,'' Potok said, describing the followers as a gang of
high school and college misfits entranced by a self-styled ``evil
genius from a Batman comic.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hawke set off a security and publicity storm in
this city when he obtained a three-hour demonstration permit from
the capital authorities. After a media drumbeat of anticipation,
the net result proved to be an event of gross anticlimax as police
officers with gas masks and truncheons watched and waited and
ultimately slouched by the parade route.
</P>
<P>
   Streets bordering the march route bristled with television
trucks and satellite broadcast antennas last seen here in such
concentration for Monica Lewinsky's grand-jury appearance.
Socialist Worker agitators worked the crowd. Tourists got caught up
in the day, with one hand-scribbling a sign that proclaimed,
``Hillbillies Are Against Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   A regular anti-Clinton demonstrator, miffed that he was
displaced by the police, still wielded his big sign that seemed odd
for the day: ``The Bates Motel: 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.'' Three
separate counterdemonstrations were meanwhile speaking out against
a foe that was never to appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, they're not coming!'' a man wearing an American Labor
Party T-shirt suddenly shouted, delivering the news to a group of
fewer than 200 people waiting at the police barricades in the
Lafayette Park rally site across from the White House. ``Give
yourselves a round of applause!''
</P>
<P>
   The largest group of counterdemonstrators, who were determined
to go nowhere near the neo-Nazis, was gathered by government and
civic leaders on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. ``Democracy is
demanding, but it is worth it,'' Mayor Anthony A. Williams told the
crowd of more than 200 people who prayed and orated against
hatemongering.
</P>
<P>
   Down by the White House, as long lines of police officers
finally retreated from the march barricades, Ramsey openly wondered
who might sound the next false alarm. ``I'm concerned about the
taxpayers,'' he said. ``I mean, you've got all these groups turning
up on the Internet, and so here we are.''

MARTINEZ PROVES DODGERS DEAD WRONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Dodgers haven't forgotten the way they misjudged
Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   And if by some miracle they ever do, Martinez will be there to
tap them on the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, an uninspiring Orioles-Tigers game was on the
television in the Red Sox clubhouse. Suddenly, Martinez stood up,
pointed at the monitor and pierced the silence in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``There he is!'' Martinez said, a haughty grin creeping across
his face. ``There's the man I got traded for.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Delino DeShields, the disappointing infielder the Dodgers
acquired for Martinez following the 1993 season.
</P>
<P>
   DeShields fouled out on the first pitch. Martinez's smile grew
wider. All that was missing was former Dodgers general manager Fred
Claire and a box of tissues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They traded me because I wasn't durable enough,'' Martinez
scoffed. ``How durable has (DeShields) been? How many times has he
been on the disabled list?''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has done plenty on the mound to make the Dodgers regret
the deal. He has won 89 games for Montreal and Boston. He is
working on his second Cy Young award. He has taken Greg Maddux's
place as the top pitcher in baseball. He was the hometown MVP of
last month's All-Star Game at Fenway Park, striking out five in two
innings, including the trifecta of Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and
Larry Walker.
</P>
<P>
   That should be all the revenge Martinez needs. That, and knowing
that Claire forever will live in infamy because of his one badly
flawed deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez isn't satisfied to let his post-Dodger
accomplishments speak for themselves. Almost seven years after the
fact, Martinez still stews over being discounted by then-manager
Tom Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy could be the greatest manager ever,'' Martinez said.
``But he was dead wrong when he said Pedro will never go five
innings as a starter. I've gone seven years in the big leagues, and
I haven't been sitting down, either. I've been pitching, working,
throwing innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, renowned Dodgers physician Frank Jobe, perhaps in an
effort to deflect lasting criticism from Claire, admitted in a
published report that he advised the Dodgers to trade Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe believed that Martinez was a breakdown waiting to happen, a
Ferrari engine in a Yugo chassis. His slight frame simply couldn't
handle the strain of throwing a 95-mph fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Martinez hasn't blown out his arm. His ligaments aren't the
slightest bit frayed.
</P>
<P>
   Bone chips? He's never heard of them.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is the rather large chip on Martinez's
shoulder, the kind that won't show up on a magnetic resonance
imaging scan.
</P>
<P>
   And Jobe's comments only gave Martinez another reason to vent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (messed) up,'' Martinez said of Jobe, the man heralded as
an expert in the field of sports medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be called the best doctor in the world, but I don't
think he knows how to judge a pitcher's stamina. I'll take my
chances against any of them. Tommy Lasorda and his comments, Dr.
Jobe and his comments. They might be the greatest baseball men of
all time, but they really made a big mistake when they doubted
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez finally missed a turn in the rotation this season.
After a horrible outing July 18 against Florida, he was placed on
the DL with soreness in his shoulder and missed three starts. Talk
of a 30-win season evaporated as quickly as it had begun.
</P>
<P>
   But it was hardly a breakdown. Just a little fatigue, Martinez
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seven years, I think it's OK to rest for three weeks,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the Red Sox are concerned, Martinez earned the
breather. He has a 15-3 record in 20 starts this season. He has a
70-strikeout advantage over Chuck Finley for the American League
lead. Aside from that one bad start, he has been unhittable.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox will get about 12 more starts out of Martinez this
season, including today against the Angels, and they need to
squeeze every victory they can out of their ace. Entering the
weekend, they were one game behind Toronto for the wild card, but
had sagged to 10-11 since the all-star break.
</P>
<P>
   Being sidelined for the first time in his career made Martinez a
tad worrisome. Watching his team slide at the same time made him
angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got me in a really bad mood,'' Martinez said. ``It was like
being in the boxing ring and not being able to throw a punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has one more body blow to deliver to the Dodgers,
though. His older brother and mentor, Ramon, is in the final stages
of rehabilitation for the Red Sox. Pedro believes his brother will
return and pitch effectively _ and that the Dodgers will regret
letting another Martinez go.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it for the Dodgers for 11 years. I don't see why he
can't do it here, too,'' Pedro said. ``They thought they'd fly to
the World Series without Ramon. That was another big mistake they
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they didn't learn their lesson with me.''

IMMIGRATION CENTER TO OPEN AS PART OF EXPANSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service will open an office
near Springfield as part of an expansion into emerging immigration
centers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 45 Quick Response Teams will focus on immigrant smuggling,
document fraud, employment violations and other crimes in 11
states. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new office in Strafford, Mo., reflects the changing
demographics of the Ozarks, part of a shift in immigration patterns
nationwide. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent years poultry plants and factories in the Ozarks have
attracted thousands of immigrants from Latin America. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jaromin, the immigration agency's deputy district
director, said, however, that southwest Missouri also was seeing
its share of immigration violations and related crime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe it is a problem. That is part of the reason
we're going out there,'' said Jaromin, whose Kansas City office
will oversee the team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new immingration office will open Sept. 1 about 10 miles
east of Springfield. The office will employ 11, including seven
special agents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 7,000-square-foot center will not offer services such as
issuing visas. Agents will focus on enforcement instead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The center will keep undocumented immigrants for brief stays
during processing. Some residents had feared that the center would
function as a jail, but officials said no one would stay
overnight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest immigration agency figures show about 18,000
undocumented immigrants in Missouri, although Jaromin said he
thought those estimates were low. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bill Hodgson, who works in the Hispanic ministry for
the Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau, said his immigrant
parishioners hoped the agency did not become heavy-handed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be some effect on our community, but it's too
early to say what it will be,'' he said. ``We know (immigration
agents) have their job to do, but we hope they will treat everyone
fairly.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials in Washington and some experts say immigrants
are moving away from traditional drawing points such as Texas and
the Southwest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration
Studies, said those states had become so saturated with newcomers
that ``immigrants themselves are ... looking for greener
pastures.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The immigration agency also will add new teams in Arkansas,
Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Tennessee and Utah. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Krikorian and Jaromin said southwest Kansas, which has drawn
thousands of immigrants to work in beef-packing plants, would have
benefited from a stronger presence by immigration authorities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the agency, which operates an office in Wichita, has no
immediate plans for a center in western Kansas. &QL;

PUBLIC WILL BE ABLE TO DUPLICATE NIXON TAPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ About two or three times a day, someone takes a
seat at the National Archives at College Park, Md., clasps on a
clunky headset, hits a button on a cassette player and eavesdrops
on history.
</P>
<P>
   The people who do this are hearing private White House
conversations between President Richard M. Nixon and his aides in
the Watergate crisis, which culminated in his resignation 25 years
ago Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Most people know the story of Watergate, but relatively few
people _ historians, researchers, tourists, Nixon junkies _ have
taken the time to listen to it unfold in conversations the
president recorded.
</P>
<P>
   That changes Jan. 1, when for the first time 264 hours of White
House tapes will be available for public duplication and sale.
Currently tapes cannot be reproduced, much less distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Historians and archivists are not quite sure what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Will the tapes be packaged into a sort of Watergate greatest
hits of key conversations, such as the so-called ``smoking gun''
tape of Nixon discussing the Watergate break-in or the one in which
John Dean warned Nixon of a ``cancer on the presidency?''
</P>
<P>
   Or will there merely be a flurry of the media playing the same
tapes, followed by general disinterest among all but Nixon buffs
and historians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good question,'' said Karl H. Weissenbach, director of
the Nixon Presidential Materials staff at the National Archives.
``Whether they will be used for late night comedy or whatnot, I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The archives plans to hire a private vendor to duplicate the
tapes for sale to the public, the media, libraries and other
interested parties, Weissenbach said. He did not yet know how the
tapes would be grouped or priced.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes will be issued as part of a 1996 settlement between
the Nixon estate, which has fought their release at various stages
for years, and a group that wanted the process sped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have been out long ago, of course,'' said Stanley
Kutler, who wrote Abuse of Power: The New Nixon Tapes and battled
the Nixon estate over the tapes. ``As long as Richard Nixon was
alive, we were not going to have these. He did not want to confront
the embarrassment once more in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon supporters said the problem with 264 hours of tapes about
Watergate and abuse of power was that they were only a fraction of
the nearly 4,000 hours of White House conversations Nixon recorded
in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Those tapes, forced onto the public record before other tapes
because of the Watergate investigation, distort Nixon's larger
record as president, said John H. Taylor, executive director of the
Nixon Foundation and the Nixon Presidential Library and Birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were extraordinary achievements in foreign and domestic
policy, but because of the way the tapes were released, there has
been a preponderance of focus on Watergate,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 agreement, 2,338 hours of Nixon tapes on issues
mostly unrelated to Watergate will be released in the next several
years. Only then can the full effect of the tapes be known, Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extent to which they may destroy him, they may also rescue
him,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though, the pubic dissemination of the Watergate
tapes probably will bring a new round of disdain for Nixon, even
though some transcripts have been in publication for 25 years,
Kutler and others said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like hearing it,'' Kutler said.
</P>
<P>
   On microphones Nixon planted inside his desk, in the Oval Office
fireplace and on his phone, he is heard plotting with aides to
cover up the Watergate break-in, blunt the FBI investigation and
pay hush money to potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listening to the tapes is a chilling and profoundly depressing
experience, because you are literally an acoustical fly on the
wall,'' said William Doyle, author of Inside the Oval Office: The
White House Tapes from FDR to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is happening in real time, with legs banging on desks and
ashtray scraping.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the key conversations, however, are hard to understand,
even with transcripts, because people moved about and sometimes
spoke softly. Nixon did not tell aides he was taping.
</P>
<P>
   The tape considered to have been the last straw for Nixon's
presidency came to public attention four days before his
resignation. It was a June 23, 1972, conversation in which he
approved a plan to halt the FBI's probe of the burglary six days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On that tape and others, Nixon can be heard giving tacit
approval to crimes suggested by aides. But sometimes Nixon outright
orders crimes to be committed.
</P>
<P>
   A year before Watergate, for example, Nixon ordered then-chief
of staff H.R. Haldeman to have someone break into the Brookings
Institution in Washington to see whether the liberal think tank had
any documents that would undermine his policies in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're to break into the place, rifle the files and bring them
to me,'' Nixon said. ``Just go in and take it. Go in around 8 or 9
o'clock. And I mean clean it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle alluded to that tape in his book, saying it reflected a
blustery Nixon who sometimes gave orders his aides did not take
seriously. No one broke into Brookings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of Richard Nixon's operating style was that many of
these crimes in progress were mere fantasy,'' Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon wrote in his memoirs that he was probably foolish to have
the taping system but that he never thought the tapes would become
public. The tapes, however, are bound to resurrect divisive public
attitudes about Nixon, one scholar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has that capacity to polarize,'' said Roderick P.
Hart, a professor of communication and government at the University
of Texas and an author of several books on verbal political styles.
</P>
<P>
   The Nixon on the tapes is not the Nixon most Americans heard in
public, Hart said. Publicly, Nixon tended to craft his words, to
not exaggerate as some politicians do, Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his public speeches he was a very careful person,'' Hart
said. ``In private, he is just kind of a roustabout. The
public-private distinction there might be pretty stark for most
people.''

dream season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anybody to shake me and wake me up,'' said
Jarrett, shortly after exiting Victory Lane at the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway as winner of the Brickyard 400 for the second time.
``It's as good as it can get right now.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after he embarrassingly ran out of fuel while leading
this race at halfway, Jarrett and crew chief Todd Parrott redeemed
themselves with a Gordonesque show of domination.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett led 117 of 160 laps around the 2.5-mile Speedway,
flicked off the challenges of Gordon, Mark Martin and eventual
runner-up Bobby Labonte, and stretched his championship lead to a
season-high 274 points.
</P>
<P>
   And just to spice it up for car owner Robert Yates and
approximately 320,000 fans, Jarrett and Parrott rolled the dice on
a two-tire pit stop during the day's last caution period. It was a
show of bravado right out of the ``Jeff Gordon/Ray Evernham NASCAR
Championship Handbook''.
</P>
<P>
   ``To compare my and Jeff's seasons ... we've had the kind of
breaks we saw them have,'' said Jarrett, who pulled away in the
final 14 laps to a 3.351-second margin of victory over Labonte.
``You have to give the crew a lot of credit for that. There's a lot
of comparisons, but right now, things are really going our way.''
</P>
<P>
   His fourth victory of 1999 allowed Jarrett to tie Gordon and
Jeff Burton for the lead in that category after 20 of 34 races.
Jarrett, 42, would have to hustle to tie Gordon's single-season
record of 13 victories from last year, and originally compiled by
Richard Petty in 1972. But more important for Jarrett as he chases
his first Cup championship, he now has 16 top-five and 18 top-10
finishes. Those numbers are similar to ones Gordon compiled while
cruising to his third title last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know how to win a championship,'' said Gordon, who
scrambled to finish third in the No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes
Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``I think he's very, very tough right now.
It's like they were just biding their time getting those top-fives
early in the season, and all of a sudden everything started
clicking for him. Boom, now they're getting wins and they're doing
a great job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's too easy for 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett averaged 148.228 mph on the way to his 22nd career Cup
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Jarrett's gasoline gaffe opened the door for Gordon
to become the first two-time winner of the Brickyard 400 last
August. Yesterday, Jarrett became the event's second two-time
champion after he and Parrott left no detail to chance _ especially
in the fuel-mileage department.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the trouble we had earlier in the year at Las Vegas and
the trouble we had here last year, the last thing we wanted was to
have a fuel problem,'' Parrott said. ``We did spend three or four
hours just making sure how much fuel we could pick up and how much
fuel the car used under cautions _ just exactly what it took.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, who took the lead for the sixth time on Lap 118, was
fueled to run to the finish when veteran Dave Marcis blew an engine
and brought out the third and final caution on Lap 143. The lead
pack, including Jarrett, Martin, Jeff Burton, Labonte and Gordon,
all chose to pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd had already told me that we were good on fuel,'' said
Jarrett, who was driving the same No. 88 Quality Care Service/Ford
Credit Taurus he wheeled here last year. ``Then the caution came
out and I said, `Here we go again.' We agreed to come in and take
two tires. We had no idea what it would do to the car. But really,
it was the best it was all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's two-tire stop prompted a similar strategic move by
Labonte, who had been trying to track down the leader despite an
engine that had developed a mysterious miss over the final 40 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I followed the 88 car a lot today,'' said Labonte, a native of
Texas and driver of the No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac Grand
Prix. ``Jarrett didn't slip or slide. He ran a perfect line all
day, a better line than I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see if Dale wins 13 races to see if he's doing
better than Jeff did last year. I'm not sure if they're `dominant.'
But when they're on, they're on.''

 &HT;    Braves hit hard, save Mulholland
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The new pitcher won a game. The new catcher knocked in
a couple runs. The refitted Braves are apparently finished with the
introductions and have embarked on a modest win streak.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Terry Mulholland allowed three of the first four men
he faced to score but still won his 100th game in his debut with
the Braves as they swarmed San Francisco's embattled pitching staff
in 15-4 laugher Saturday afternoon. The victory was their third in
a row, putting them at 12-11 since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   A win today would give the Braves their first sweep in eight
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys are starting to swing the bat,'' said Ryan Klesko,
who hit two RBI doubles. ``You're going to go through the little
ruts during the year when you're not scoring as many runs as you
want. But we're playing good ball the last couple days.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams has stoked the top of the order. He was 3-for-5
with a double and a three-run home run (a career-high 11th),
bringing his totals for the past 10 games to .381 with four home
runs, 13 RBIs and nine runs scored. For the seventh time in that
run, he batted leadoff and all three hits came off right-handers, a
hint to manager Bobby Cox and his search for a dependable leadoff
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to hit whomever is on the mound,'' Williams
said. ``Sometimes the clearest message you send is not through
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan hit his 20th home run and catcher Greg Myers, on
the same day Eddie Perez dropped his appeal and started serving his
four game suspension, had a two-RBI game, giving him six in six
games since rejoining the team.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland spent his first inning is distress, giving up six
hits and a 3-0 lead to the first seven men he faced. When the
Braves reclaimed a 4-3 advantage, he also served a home run to
Charlie Hayes before blanking the Giants through the sixth,
allowing just two hits to the last 15 men he faced.

GOP LEADERSHIP GATHERING IS SHORT OF CANDIDATES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ If Republicans want a competitive fight for their
party's presidential nomination, they did not find much
encouragement here on Saturday at the Republican Midwest Leadership
Conference, which attracted more than 800 delegates from 13
Midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   What the event did not attract was presidential candidates. Six
of the 10 contenders passed up this gathering, which had been
billed as a crucial opportunity for Republican hopefuls to sell
themselves only a week before an important straw poll in
neighboring Iowa _ and to draw precious press attention in that
state.
</P>
<P>
   The only candidates who showed are battling at the bottom of the
pack: Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher; former Gov.
Lamar Alexander of Tennessee; Gary Bauer, former head of the Family
Research Council; and Alan Keyes, a radio personality.
</P>
<P>
   The shabby attendance is an example of the peculiar dynamics of
the Republican contest for the White House in 2000. Although the
first voting is six months away, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is so
dominant in polls and in amassing campaign funds that he can pass
up most events. And with the front-runner not participating, most
of Bush's rivals do not feel compelled to, either.
</P>
<P>
   The contenders who did take part played to this audience in the
heartland by emphasizing their proposals to help farmers. But
mostly, they picked on Bush, characterizing him as a glitzy,
big-money candidate who is not versed in the issues. They presented
themselves as populists who could get by without massive donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very strange way to pick a president,'' groused
Alexander, who is trying to keep afloat a campaign that is nearly
broke. ``The worst thing that could happen to the Republican Party,
or to the country, really, is if we let big money or big media pick
a nominee before the race starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he continued, ``then we wind up in the middle of a
debate with Albert Gore or Bill Bradley and find we've got somebody
who's not ready to be president. And then we get 16 years of
Clinton and Gore _ and maybe eight of Hillary after that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the last gathering of the Republican Midwest Leadership
Conference, in Indianapolis two years ago, the scene was far more
lively. There were double the number of prospective candidates.
Campaigns passed out bumper stickers and set up hospitality suites
(with well-stocked bars and trays of canapes) to court Republican
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush addressed the conference in Indianapolis. It was a
move his advisers later regretted: the governor was not prepared
for the national spotlight and drew critiques for delivering a
lackluster speech. Since then, he has stayed clear of such cattle
calls.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between this event and the one in Indianapolis also
reflects the unusually early unfolding of this presidential
campaign. Because so many states have moved up the dates of their
contests in 2000, the nominees may be known by mid-March. The
compressed calendar has resulted in early fund-raising, early
campaigning, and, perhaps, the unusually early emergence of a
leading candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who is dipping into his inherited fortune to finance his
campaign, depicted Bush as beholden to moneyed interests. ``You'll
have to take it up with Governor Bush why he passes up these
opportunities to talk to interested Republican activists,'' he
said. ``Ultimately, you win not by being anointed by the elites in
Washington or by the lobbyists. The way to do it is to take your
message to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking, rhetorically, to goad Bush into a debate, Bauer
asserted: ``Our front runner has views on a number of issues that
are quite different from where the party has gone in the past. We
need to debate about those things. And I would encourage him,
however much he likes Austin, Texas, to come to events like this
and give Republican voters, Republican leaders, to take the measure
of him. Not just how well he flips a pancake.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, a former State Department official, warned Republicans
against ``anointing the winner before we get to the voting booth.''
He added, pointedly, ``We face a crisis in this country of
arrogance. In that arrogance they spit in the face of the American
voter.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Moore, the Nebraska secretary of state, read the audience
a letter from former Vice President Dan Quayle, who dropped out
because his mother was sick. But Moore did not hide his displeasure
at Pat Buchanan, the conservative commentator, who decided Saturday
morning not to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He decided at the last minute to go to a parade in Des
Moines,'' Moore said. ``So I'll let you do with that information
what you wish.''
</P>
<P>
   But many delegates did not seem particularly exercised at the
no-shows. Beth Long, a state assembly member from Lebanon, Mo.,
said she was glad that her preferred candidate, Bush, was not here
because he is already popular with this audience. ``For him it
might have been preaching to the choir,'' she said. ``His time is
better spent on people who are undecided.''

DAVENPORT ON SOLID FOOTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to say whom Lindsay Davenport stymies more frequently,
her tennis opponents or journalists. The top-ranked player in the
world has what the lay person calls a ``nice personality.''
</P>
<P>
   She's punctual, cordial and good-natured. So in these days of
flashy women's tennis in which tantrums, teenagers and bravado are
daily occurrences, Davenport is comparatively _ gasp _ boring. She
knows her personality and accentuates it to hungry journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be the player who on the Monday after the
tournament is getting all the press for winning the tournament,''
Davenport said. ``I just really let the tennis do the talking. I
don't worry about too many other things. I don't like to create a
lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport and her pleasant personality will command attention
this week as she tries to defend her Acura Classic title at
Manhattan Country Club. The 23 year old, who grew up in Southern
California and lives in Newport Beach, is making a homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Davenport came to Los Angeles ranked second in the
world without a grand-slam title. This year, she is ranked first
and has won the U.S. Open and Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Davenport is hot with the exception of losing, 6-4,
7-5, to Venus Williams Saturday in the semifinals of the TIG
Classic at Carlsbad. After winning last week in Stanford, she is
18-2 in her past 20 matches (she also lost to Serena Williams at
Indian Wells), 35-6 this year and 20-4 on hard courts.
</P>
<P>
   Until she lost Saturday, Davenport was going for a Californian
sweep. She completed the sweep last year, winning in Stanford,
Carlsbad and Manhattan Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of knew I'd lose it this summer because I have so many
points to defend,'' Davenport said, after losing to Williams.
``I'll just try to get it back during the (U.S.) Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Davenport lost Saturday, she said a sweep in
California was a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my best traits is that I'm pretty realistic,'' she said
before the Californian tournaments. ``I love this surface, and I
love California, but two win all three last year was pretty special
and pretty magical.''
</P>
<P>
   There's that humble personality, again. She perhaps did pick an
appropriate word to describe her tennis because it's no stretch to
call her Wimbledon title magical. For several reasons, Davenport
wasn't ``supposed to'' win the prestigious grass tournament. Many
factors were working against her, so bookies made the odds of a
Davenport Wimbledon victory at 15-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   Grass is not her surface. Almost everyone who follows tennis
knows that, and Davenport accepts that power is her strong point,
which usually isn't the key on grass. She doesn't have the quickest
feet in tennis, but makes up for it with a balance of strength and
consistency. Overall, however, she didn't appear to have the style
of play for a Wimbledon champ.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Chris Evert was the last American to win Wimbledon.
And that was in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport silenced critics and made one of the biggest steps of
her six-year professional tennis career by winning where she wasn't
``supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Grand Slam titles instead of one puts me in a more elite
category,'' Davenport said. ``With just one, you may think it was
just lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's tennis keeps developing. She is lean, 6-foot-2{ and
175 pounds. But it wasn't always the case. Earlier in her career,
her weight most likely kept her from becoming an elite player. On
the tennis tour, which can be harsh and immature, a faction of
players nicknamed her Dump Truck.
</P>
<P>
   Although she had the cruel nickname and several players talked
behind her back, Davenport's attitude and tennis weren't affected
significantly. Even when she was new on the tennis tour, she
carried herself with maturity that she learned before she turned
pro.
</P>
<P>
   Her body type can make Davenport stick out in a crowd. This
could be disconcerting for a young woman, but early on, she learned
it wasn't necessarily negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty much 6-2 and almost 15 years old,'' Davenport
said. ``There are traits in kids that you just have to get used to.
Now I couldn't be happier.''
</P>
<P>
   She also couldn't be happier to be returning to L.A. She had one
of her first tennis experiences at the tournament, when it was
called the Virginia Slims, and someone in that position, a
Davenport in making, could be in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been the most special tournament to me,''
Davenport said. ``My mom took me there when I was a girl, and
that's where I was first introduced to pro tennis. It's an
atmosphere that I love with my friends and family there.''

COWBOYS ROOKIE RECEIVER McGARITY WINNING SUPPORT 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ When training camp opened two weeks ago,
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey had a simple assessment of rookie
receiver Wane McGarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``His role on the football team is that he's a rookie trying to
make the football team,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   But after a barrage of injuries to wide receivers, most notably
the season-ending loss of James McKnight to a torn anterior
cruciate ligament three days ago _ and McGarity's early impressive
play _ Gailey has been forced to re-evaluate the former Texas star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for someone to come in and make plays,''
Gailey said. ``Wane's doing some good things. It will be
interesting to see how he takes advantage of this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity, already considered a candidate for punt and kickoff
return duties, is now the primary backup to Michael Irvin and is
being measured for a role in the Cowboys' four-receiver set.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-8, 191-pound speedster is just one of a number of
players the Cowboys' coaching staff will be watching in tomorrow's
preseason opener against the Cleveland Browns in Canton, Ohio. The
coaches will want to find out not only if the players can make the
team, but more important, can they be key contributors this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have to come out and step up,'' McGarity said. ``My
chances of making the club and getting on the field have improved.
It's unfortunate the way James got hurt. I don't want to see it
happen that way, but I am going to take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of McGarity's getting a chance because of an injury
was not lost on him either _ considering his pedigree of five knee
surgeries in high school and college combined. His injury-plagued
history were reasons few people, including himself, thought he
would have a shot at playing in the NFL at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, it was all about having a senior season,'' said
McGarity, who blew out his left knee as a junior and wasn't even
expected to play as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL was not on my mind. Knowing my injury history, I
wouldn't have gave myself a chance to be here at all. I worked hard
to have a good season and didn't worry about the NFL. I just let
that come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity, who now sports a tight Afro hairdo after wearing
dreadlock-like braids in college, came back to become the lightning
to Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams' thunder in the Texas
offense last season.
</P>
<P>
   A San Antonio native, McGarity caught 58 passes for 1,087 yards
and nine touchdowns as a senior, while capturing the attention of
an important person _ Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give Jerry Jones credit for this one,'' scouting director
Larry Lacewell said. ``Jerry Jones liked McGarity. He got enamored
with him as a kickoff return man and his ability to make big plays.
I can remember Jerry oohing and ahhing over it.''
</P>
<P>
   The oohs and ahhs have continued since Jones personally selected
McGarity in the fourth round of the 1999 NFL draft. McGarity has
impressed Gailey with ability to field punts, while his speed,
hands and overall skills as receiver have been noticed by
quarterback Troy Aikman and Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wane has been impressive in my opinion,'' said Aikman, who has
shown little patience with rookie receivers in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know about the injuries he's had over the last five or
six years. If he can stay healthy, I think he's a guy who can play
at this level. I know that. He's looked good in camp and made some
good catches. He's got tremendous quickness. I think he's a guy who
has been very well-coached in college. He's done some good things
that a lot of guys just don't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin went a step further, saying, ``Wane is going to be a
big-time player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got him in the fourth round and that was a steal,'' Irvin
said. ``I study people. I look at Wane a lot like \RSteelers
first-round draft pick\S Troy Edwards. I don't see where
\REdwards\S was much better than Wane to make three rounds
difference. Wane is going to be here and be a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity said he appreciates the support from his teammates and
is grateful to Jones for believing in him. However, he said he's
not taking anything for granted. ``I've come a long way,'' McGarity
said. ``But I'm not finished. I got to get in the playbook more and
continue to work hard to make the most of my chances.''

CAUTIOUS EDMONDS RETURNS TO OUTFIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Outfielder Garret Anderson was a late scratch from
Saturday's game because of a twisted left ankle suffered Friday
night when he slipped chasing down a double by the Red Sox's Troy
O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Anderson meant Jim Edmonds got his first start in
center field this season. He served as the DH in his first five
games after returning from shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds wasn't expected to return to the outfield for another
week or so because the Angels were concerned he might reinjure the
shoulder diving for a ball or running into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds found himself with a decision to make in the second
inning on Nomar Garciaparra's drive to deep center. Instead of
trying to make a spectacular catch and crashing into the wall,
Edmonds played the carom and got the ball in quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I thought about out there today was running
into a wall,'' Edmonds said. ``I just have to use my best judgment,
considering the circumstances. I've got to figure out what approach
to take in each situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds said he was glad to be back out there but would have
liked the game to have a better ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun at first,'' he said. ``But it was a long day.''
</P>
<P>
   For Anderson, the game was only the second he's missed all
season. He is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Silent Salmon: Tim Salmon's eighth-inning home run Saturday was
his first since returning from a sprained left wrist that cost him
62 games.
</P>
<P>
   He went 87 at-bats without a home run _ including 75 since
returning July 17 _ the last one coming April 29 vs. Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   But after losing 14-3, Salmon wasn't in a mood to talk about it.

ANGELS SHARE BLAME FOR LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Blame for the Angels' 14-3 loss to the Boston Red Sox
on Saturday afternoon at Edison Field could not be directed at any
one player or aspect of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the Angels pitched poorly, hit poorly and played
defense poorly. At least it was a team effort.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox starter Pat Rapp (4-5) gave up one run and six hits in
seven innings to get the victory. He was supported by 19 hits,
including three each by Jose Offerman, Nomar Garciaparra, Brian
Daubach and Reggie Jefferson and two apiece from Jason Varitek and
Donnie Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels played sloppy defense, got eight hits and simply
looked like a last-place team. Their only runs came on an RBI
single by Orlando Palmeiro and a two-run homer by Tim Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   At 46-63, they fell 17 games under .500 for the second time this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting personnel back we've been missing all year, but
we're not playing better,'' said Angels pitcher Tim Belcher, who
made his first start in six weeks but was knocked around for seven
runs (five earned) and seven hits in 21/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when you get into a funk like we've been in since
the All-Star break,'' he said. ``I don't think it would make a
difference if we brought in Hank Aaron and Lefty Grove. When teams
get in a funk, they get in a funk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't continue to play like this and go into the winter
feeling good about ourselves. You've got to find something to play
for. For us, it's our sanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher said he had no problems with his right pinky finger,
which he broke June 26. His biggest problem was location.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty normal,'' he said. ``It's like riding a bike. .
. . It was a hell of a crash. No training wheels.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all Belcher's fault, though.
</P>
<P>
   Normally reliable shortstop Gary DiSarcina made errors in each
of the first two innings, the second coming on a ground ball by
Jefferson leading off the second inning, which led to two unearned
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stunk,'' said DiSarcina, who added he hadn't had a worse day
in the field since opening day his rookie year. ``When you stink,
you stink. I feel great, I wish I had an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to play well, especially going into the
offseason. We had two rookies in the infield today (second baseman
Trent Durrington and catcher Ben Molina) and another young guy at
third (Troy Glaus). You want to show those guys the way to play the
game, and when you don't do it, it's disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably the defining moment of the game _ and the Angels'
season for that matter _ came in the third. With the bases loaded
and two out, Offerman hit a chopper to short. DiSarcina chose not
to charge the ball, and his throw to first was too late to get
Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the runner from third score on the play, but so did
Varitek, a slow-footed catcher who scored from second. Molina
received the throw from first baseman Darin Erstad in time, but
Molina apparently never saw Varitek coming and didn't attempt to
make a tag until it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman was credited with two RBI on an infield single.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got caught up the line a little bit,'' Angels manager Terry
Collins said of Molina. ``But he'll learn. He's just a young kid.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, many of the Angels players showered and put
their uniforms back on to play with their children in the annual
family game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play one of the worst games of your career and you've got
to go out there and chase your kids around,'' DiSarcina said.

GORE STOPS BY; CLINTON PLAYS GRACIOUS HOST  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ If Vice President Al Gore is worried that
President Clinton is dragging down his own presidential bid, he did
not show it Saturday as he flew into Clinton's home base here and
exploited the president's legendary ability to draw a crowd _ and
money.
</P>
<P>
   At the first of four fund-raising receptions that the president
was sponsoring for his vice president in the next several weeks,
Clinton lavished the kind of praise on Gore that had repeatedly
eluded previous vice presidents so early in a campaign season. This
came amid reports of a strained relationship between the two as
Gore had sent mixed signals about whether he welcomed such a close
association with a man whose scandals have wearied the nation with
what pollsters call ``Clinton fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that his own actions might have tainted Gore,
Clinton said Saturday night, ``Whatever anybody thinks about
whether I was right or wrong about a given issue, when the history
of the last six-and-a-half years or next year-and-a-half is
written, there is one thing that no one will be able to question,
and that is that Al Gore was by far the most influential and
effective and productive vice president in the history of the
United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The president took credit for putting Gore on his ticket in
1992, called him ``my friend and partner,'' and said the vice
president was ``a good and decent man'' who had supported him
``through thick and thin.''
</P>
<P>
   In conveying that loyalty, Clinton used unusual and sometimes
unfortunate phrasing, saying that Gore ``has been at my back.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, when Gore officially announced his
candidacy, he went to some lengths to separate himself from the
president. He said that Clinton's extramarital affair with a White
House intern, which led to his impeachment, was inexcusable and
bemoaned ``that awful year we went through.'' He also said he had
had many disagreements with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And yet in December, on the day the House voted to impeach
Clinton, Gore declared that Clinton was one of the country's
greatest presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Gore was a gracious guest on Clinton's home turf, but
hardly effusive. ``Now there's a real friend for you,'' Gore said
at Saturday night's fund-raiser in the one setting where his
remarks were made public. ``I've been awful proud to be his partner
and work on the tremendous success that Bill Clinton has provided
for our country.'' He then launched into his usual campaign speech.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was operating on virtually no sleep after continuous travel
and a rigorous three-day backpacking trip with his son, Albert III,
up a snow-covered Mount Ranier. Aides said that Gore and his son
each carried 65 pounds of gear, encountered hailstorms and that the
hike was so challenging, some in their party dropped off.
</P>
<P>
   After the hike, Gore arrived in Seattle about midnight on
Friday. He then flew to Chicago, landing about 6 a.m. on Saturday,
and spoke to the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition conference before flying
here Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Clinton in a discussion with farmers at a coffee shop,
strolled with the president through a food court and met privately
with a group of 200 black leaders. Saturday night they attended a
fund-raising reception, where the vice president wore cowboy boots
with his suit, and a private mix-and-mingle event. He spent
Saturday night here and planned to fly to New Hampshire on Sunday
to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Every step of the way, the president served as his warm-up act.
Introducing him Saturday night, Clinton said of Gore: ``If
everything was on the line and I had to pick an American to make a
decision that I knew would be good for my country when my daughter
is my age, I would pick Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of those who watched the two Saturday were skeptical
that Clinton's ``help'' was a good thing. Standing on a street
corner, Bryan Fink, 36, a Methodist pastor from Conway, Ark., said,
``If Gore weren't so close to Clinton, it would probably help him
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Brady, 72, a retiree from North Little Rock, said Gore
paled in comparison with Clinton. ``He has the same ideas that
Clinton has, but Gore doesn't have the personality and charisma,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Saturday night's reception, Donald Parks, 79, who owns a
telephone company in Prairie Grove, Ark., said he was a big fan of
Clinton, though he wanted to ``wring his neck'' at times. But he
said he was ``a little apprehensive'' about the effect Clinton was
having on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake for Gore to take him on,'' Parks said, ``but he
doesn't really have a choice. Still, if he didn't have the close
connections with the president that he has, he wouldn't be as
effective.''

MAZEL TRICK EARNS HIGH PRAISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR _ Good thing Mazel Trick can't read his trainer's
quotes, or his sturdy legs might be creaking under the weight of
expectations this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Frankel, not shy but also not one to hype his horses
unrealistically, is comparing the winner of Saturday's $245,000 San
Diego Handicap to a certain other ex-turf specialist who found
happiness on the main track.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 4 for 4 on the dirt,'' Frankel noted after the six-length
victory by Mazel Trick and Chris McCarron. ``That's how Cigar
started, remember that?''
</P>
<P>
   Mazel Trick has a long way to go to match Cigar's 16 consecutive
victories and two Horse of the Year titles.
</P>
<P>
   But after sprinting to a Hollywood Park 7-furlong record
(1:19.97) in the Triple Bend Handicap in June, and after destroying
a modest field in the decade's fastest San Diego (1:40.68), Mazel
Trick at least looks like a threat in the one race Cigar couldn't
win.
</P>
<P>
   That's Del Mar's Pacific Classic, the $1 million race in which
Dare and Go prevented Cigar from breaking Citation's winning-streak
record in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Mazel Trick will have to step up in class when he faces three of
the toughest older horses around _ Victory Gallop, Real Quiet and
Malek _ in the Aug. 29 Pacific Classic. And the 4-year-old colt
will have to stretch out to attempt 1\ miles for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Raw talent can never be discounted, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't look too weak today at the end of the race,''
Frankel said after the 1 1/16-mile San Diego, the major local prep
for the Pacific Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Mazel Trick tracked long-shot Tibado for half a mile, zipped to
the lead at the rail on the far turn, then laughed at River Keen in
the stretch while Budroyale ran a poor fourth and last.
</P>
<P>
   Mazel Trick had his first five races in France before being sold
to former Kentucky Gov. Brereton Jones and the 3+U Stable. For the
new owners, Frankel started him in a turf sprint at Santa Anita in
October, and the son of the brilliant sprinter Phone Trick finished
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But since switching to dirt tracks with his next start, Mazel
Trick is unbeaten, the victories coming by increasing margins.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel said this might be the fastest horse he's had in a
33-year, Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might (also) be the best,'' the trainer said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day for horses with ``future star'' quality.
</P>
<P>
   The co-featured, $150,000 Sorrento Stakes for 2-year-old fillies
was dominated as expected by Bob Baffert-trained Chilukki and David
Flores. As with Mazel Trick, Chilukki won by six lengths. She has
won all four starts _ by 25 lengths combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's another breed,'' said Chris Antley, who rode runner-up
November Slew.
</P>
<P>
   Chilukki ($2.40) and Mazel Trick ($3.40) are part of an amazing
run of racing at Del Mar. Twelve consecutive races on Friday and
Saturday were won by favorites before the streak was snapped in a
claiming event.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Hambletonian _ harness racing's Kentucky Derby _ was
won in world-record time by favored Self Possessed and driver Mike
Lachance. The New Jersey-based colt trotted the mile at the
Meadowlands in 1:51 3/5 Saturday to knock one-fifth off the record
Beat the Wheel set five years ago on the same track. . . . At
Saratoga, 3-year-old champion Banshee Breeze and Jerry Bailey toyed
with Beautiful Pleasure and won the Go for Wand Handicap. . . . At
Canterbury Park in Minnesota, 6-year-old Aplomado and jockey Laffit
Pincay won a $100,000 sprint for California trainer Vladimir Cerin
on the Claiming Crown card. . . . Walter Greenman was reported to
be in good spirits at Scripps Hospital in La Jolla after surgery
Friday to remove a brain tumor. The 59-year-old trainer was
expected to go home as early as today. . . . Victory Gallop's
scheduled trip from Saratoga to Del Mar was delayed from Friday to
Tuesday because of a cough, trainer Elliott Walden said. . . .
Manistique goes for her ninth win in 11 starts in today's Chula
Vista.

THIS TIME, FATE IS KIND TO DALE JARRETT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The fuel efficiency of a stock car can mean the
difference between winning and losing in Nascar Winston Cup racing.
Dale Jarrett knows that, having seen the little red light on his
dashboard come on at inopportune times.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed appropriate that fuel efficiency was poised to
determine Jarrett's fate again, Saturday in the Brickyard 400. The
memory of what happened to him here one year ago weighed heavily on
many people's minds. Jarrett was strong and out in front, again.
But did he have enough fuel stay there? No one knew for sure.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, fate was kind to Jarrett. The Winston Cup
points leader didn't have to watch for the little red light.
Jarrett, who ran out of fuel midway though last year's race and
finished 16th, got the break he so desperately needed, in the form
of a caution late in the race. He refueled and drove away from the
field over the final laps to capture his second checkered flag at
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess after last year, you wonder what scenario is going to
play out,'' said Jarrett, who led 117 of 160 laps. ``I had a good
lead, and they told me we could make it on fuel. I was saving a
little bit of fuel at that time. Before the caution came out, I was
saying: `Here we go again. What do we do?'''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Parrott, Jarrett's crew chief, said: ``The last thing we
wanted to do was have a fuel problem. We spent several hours
testing, figuring out how much fuel we were using. Knowing how many
laps we could go really helped us today.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory, Jarrett's fourth this season, gave him a 274-point
lead over his fellow Ford driver Mark Martin, who finished fourth.
Bobby Labonte, in a Pontiac, finished second; Jeff Gordon made a
late charge to finish third in a Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When those guys got to racing side by side, that certainly
made things easier on me,'' Jarrett said of running away from the
pack late in the race. ``This is as good as it can get right
now..''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's car could turn slightly more than 40 laps on a full
tank. But having refueled with 42 laps remaining, it would be
close. That was when he got a break. Dave Marcis, who generally
runs in the back of the pack, slowed on the track after his engine
blew up with 17 laps left. The yellow flag came out, and Jarrett
and the other leaders pitted. Jarrett took on fuel and two tires
and emerged from the pits in front of Labonte, Martin and Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Jarrett avoided another fuel emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I think we shed a lot of tears as we left here,''
said Robert Yates, who owns Jarrett's car. ``We couldn't even joke
about running out of gas for six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than the fuel drama, the race was rather dull. It featured
few lead changes and even fewer exciting moments on the track. Six
drivers led Saturday's race, but the final lead change occurred on
Lap 79.
</P>
<P>
   Many drivers complained during the week that this track had one
racing groove _ the fastest part of the track. And when there is
just one, that means overtaking is very difficult. The result is
often a ho-hum race with few passes. That was certainly the case
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who is the only other driver to win the Brickyard 400
twice, said: ``Jarrett was dominant last year at this race before
he ran out of gas. They've got it together right now. They really
do. They're going to be tough to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who battled handling problems all day, provided the most
exciting moments over the final stages of the race. With seven laps
remaining, Gordon was in sixth place. But Gordon, who was the pole
sitter, picked off Ward Burton, Jeff Burton and Martin over the
final laps to reserve a spot on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we could make our way up through there,'' Gordon
said, ``But we ran out of laps.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett has been the runner-up in the Winston Cup championship
twice. But that doesn't seem likely after Saturday's victory, which
put an exclamation point on his breakout season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I don't want anybody to shake me and wake me up,''
Jarrett said. ``When you're second or third in the points, you have
to rely on the guy in front of you having problems. It's a lot more
fun to be in control of your destiny. It's great to be leading in
the points championship, and my opponents see the races counting
down, and they realize they are running out of time.''

BOGGS HOMERS FOR HIS 3,000TH HIT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For his milestone of the moment, Wade Boggs decided to be
different. On the previous two nights, Mark McGwire had slugged his
500th home run and Tony Gwynn had lashed his 3,000th hit. Boggs
followed with his 3,000th hit Saturday night, but he did not attain
that elite circle routinely.
</P>
<P>
   After putting himself in position by stroking singles in the
third and fourth innings, Boggs cracked a home run in the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays' sixth inning at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg,
Fla., becoming the 23rd player to reach 3,000 but the first to get
there with a home run.
</P>
<P>
   There had been 16 singles, five doubles and one triple as
3,000th hits, but no home run before the 41-year-old Boggs
connected against Chris Haney, a journeyman left-hander, who had
entered the game for the Cleveland Indians at the start of the
inning. When the ball landed in the right-field stands, it was only
Boggs' second home run of the season and the 118th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   As he joyously rounded the bases, Boggs pointed skyward in a
tribute to his late mother, pointed skyward again a few steps
before he reached home plate, then got down on his knees and kissed
the plate as he completed his historic 360-foot trot.
</P>
<P>
   His feat completed an incredible three-night run for major
league baseball. Never before had its players achieved these
legendary numbers on consecutive nights. In 1970, the only previous
season in which three players attained those plateaus, Ernie Banks
hit his 500th home run on May 12, Hank Aaron rapped his 3,000th hit
on May 17 and Willie Mays chipped in with his 3,000th hit on July
18.
</P>
<P>
   In the only other comparable coincidental occurrence, Rod Carew
stroked his 3,000th hit and Tom Seaver pitched his 300th victory on
the same day, Aug. 4, in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire's St. Louis Cardinals played Gwynn's San Diego
Padres on Thursday night, the two players could have become the
first duo to achieve their magic numbers in the same game. Then
Friday night Gwynn and Boggs, whose illustrious careers have been
parallel for 18 years, could have become the first players to hit
3,000 on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they each had a night and the spotlight to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs entered Saturday night's game with 2,997 hits. Facing
Charles Nagy, the Indians' leading winner with 12 victories, Boggs
grounded to second in the first inning. But in what would become a
wild-scoring affair that Cleveland won by 15-10, Boggs batted again
in the third and the fourth innings. Each time he rapped a
run-scoring single to right, catapulting himself one hit away from
his goal.
</P>
<P>
   Haney, who has extended his mediocre career because his species,
the left-hander, is always in demand, relieved Nagy at the start of
the sixth, making his third relief appearance for the Indians.
Boggs, the third scheduled batter in the inning, had batted against
Haney 13 times previously. He had collected four singles and two
walks, certainly no home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Lowery was at first base when Boggs swung at Haney's 2-2
pitch, a hanging breaking ball, and drove it over the right-field
fence. Boggs hit his only other home run this season against Mark
Portugal at Boston's Fenway Park, where he began his career in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   After he arose from his emotional romp around the bases, Boggs
was greeted on the field by his father, Win; his wife, Debbie, and
their 12-year-old son, Brett, who was the Devil Rays' bat boy.
Boggs grew up and played Little League baseball in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs walked in his final time at bat.
</P>
<P>
   While Gwynn was the 11th player to collect all 3,000 hits with
one team, Boggs amassed his with the Red Sox (2,098 in 11 seasons),
the Yankees (702 in five seasons) and the Devil Rays (200 in one
and two-thirds seasons).
</P>
<P>
   Boggs and Gwynn are the sixth pair of players to reach 3,000 in
the same season, but obviously the two who did it the closest to
each other. The last duo to reach 3,000 in the same season were
Robin Yount and George Brett, three weeks apart in September 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs became the seventh player in the 1990s to get to 3,000, a
total that matches the seven who did it in the 1970s. Cal Ripken,
on the disabled list with an ailing back for the second time this
season, will make it a record eight in the 1990s if he gets the 32
hits he needs.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs also is the third-oldest player to get his 3,000th hit,
trailing Cap Anson and Dave Winfield.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs gave notice of his hitting prowess early in his career. In
his second season, 1983, he began a streak of seven successive
200-hit seasons, reaching a career-high 240 in 1985. The only
player to have more than seven straight 200-hit seasons was Willie
Keeler, who did it eight times from 1894 through 1901.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)
</P>
<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending July 31 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)
indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders for a
book.

   &UR; THE MEADOWLANDS: WILDERNESS ADVENTURES AT THE EDGE OF A CITY &LR; 
By Robert Sullivan. Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95. Much is buried in
this swampy region of New Jersey, from the remnants of the original
Pennsylvania Station to (perhaps) the remains of the labor leader
Jimmy Hoffa. The author explores the terrain, noting nature's
triumphs over sludge. Last year in The New York Times Book Review,
Robert Pinsky called this a ``provocative, audacious book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ETERNAL CURSE ON THE READER OF THESE PAGES &LR;  By Manuel Puig.
University of Minnesota, $15.95. The forbidding title is actually
the opening line of the jailhouse journal of Ramirez, a former
political prisoner in the author's native Argentina. Ramirez, 74,
can't remember anything; Larry, 36, who pushes him in a wheelchair
around Greenwich Village in New York, doesn't have much to
remember. The novel, the first Puig wrote in English, examines the
men's symbiotic relationship. ``Puig spins a fascinating web of
words, capturing the reader's attention with his uncanny ability to
develop plot and character through dialogue,'' Allen Josephs wrote
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has also restored to print  &UR; BLOOD OF REQUITED
LOVE &LR; , translated by Jan L. Grayson ($15.95), Puig's novel about
the troubled inner life of Josemar, a manual laborer in Brazil.
``Puig is adept at parodying people's awkward attempts to find a
language for their emotions,'' Jean Franco wrote in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEALING LESSONS &LR;  By Sidney J. Winawer with Nick Taylor.
Routledge, $16. There was a terrible irony in the diagnosis Andrea
Winawer faced: intestinal cancer was a disease on which her husband
was an expert. He describes how her suffering taught him an empathy
that his medical training could not have done. This memoir
``reminds us to live fully, intensely,'' Abraham Verghese wrote
last year.

   &UR; GLORIE &LR;  By Caryn James. Penguin, $12.95. This novel by the
chief television critic of The New York Times has an unusual
heroine: an elderly widow trying to hang on to her house, her
independence and the memory of her husband. ``One cannot help being
moved by her plight and by the unanswerable questions she asks,''
Richard Burgin wrote in 1998.

   &UR; CHILDREN OF CAMBODIA'S KILLING FIELDS: MEMOIRS BY SURVIVORS &LR; 
Compiled by Dith Pran. Edited by Kim DePaul. Yale University,
$14.95. The murder of Cambodians by the Khmer Rouge was so
widespread that it is hard to believe anyone survived. These
testimonies, gathered by Dith Pran, a photographer for The New York
Times who himself escaped the killing, build ``a solid, irrefutable
censure of one of humanity's most shocking crimes,'' Lance Gould
said in The New York Times Book Review in 1997.

   One woman's experience has been restored to print in  &UR; THE STONES
CRY OUT: A CAMBODIAN CHILDHOOD, 1975-1980 &LR; , by Molyda Szymusiak,
translated by Linda Coverdale (Indiana University, $12.95). Writing
under the name given her by her adoptive parents, Polish exiles in
Paris, the author describes how she and three younger cousins
became the only survivors of 20 members of her original family.
``This is a powerful and compelling story,'' Jane Hamilton-Merritt
wrote in 1986.

<P>
   David P. Chandler analyzes the leader of the genocide in
 &UR; BROTHER NUMBER ONE: A POLITICAL BIOGRAPHY OF POL POT &LR;  (Westview,
$16), reissued in a revised and updated edition. The dictator
emerges here as a ruthless ideologue and megalomaniac who also
managed to be a charismatic politician. In 1992 the reviewer
Frederick Z. Brown called it ``an absorbing and authoritative
portrait ... and a fascinating insight into Cambodia's cruel
history.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DOWER HOUSE &LR;  By Annabel Davis-Goff. St Martin's Griffin,
$13.95. Taking place in the 1950s and '60s, this novel captures the
faded glory of an Anglo-Irish family that clings to its aristocracy
despite its lost wealth. ``The book feels like a Christmas dinner:
rich, heavy, extravagant, lush _ and traditional in a way that no
one would dream of objecting to,'' Jacqueline Carey wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER: HOW POLITICS IS DESTROYING THE
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM &LR;  By Susan Estrich. Harvard University,
$12.95. A law professor proposes radical ideas that are really
old-fashioned ones: restricting efforts to shape juries and
allowing jurors' common sense, not expert opinions, to prevail.
``Estrich writes with verve and wit and style,'' the reviewer Akhil
Reed Amar wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ESSENCE OF THE THING &LR;  By Madeleine St. John. Carroll &AMP;
Graf, $11.95. A finalist for Britain's Booker Prize in 1997, this
novel begins with an abrupt end: Nicola, the heroine, returns to
her London flat after buying cigarettes, only to be greeted by her
lover's demand that she move out. It is ``a brisk, sophisticated
and artful narrative,'' Gardner McFall wrote earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FOREIGN STUDENT &LR;  By Susan Choi. Harper Perennial, $13. They
are an unlikely couple: Chuck, formerly Chang, a student who has
fled a war-shattered life in 1950s Korea, and Katherine, the
daughter of a wealthy Southern family. But both have nightmares to
escape. ``Choi brings hundreds of small scenes to life, then uses
them to construct an intricate portrait,'' Kimberly B. Marlowe
wrote in 1998.

CISCO SYSTEMS TO INVEST $1 BILLION IN ACCOUNTING GIANT KPMG
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo) (Exclusive)  
(rk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cisco Systems Inc., the dominant maker of networking equipment
for the Internet, said Saturday that it was making a $1 billion
investment in the KPMG LLP accounting and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of an agreement to be announced on Monday, KPMG,
part of KPMG International, will use the money to hire 4,000
engineers and service professionals over the next 18 months to
develop and deliver Internet-based data, voice and video services
to its business and consulting clients. It will also build six
technology centers _ four in the United States and two abroad. In
return for its investment, Cisco will own a stake of less than 20
percent in KPMG's U.S. unit.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Cisco, which is based in San Jose, Calif., is
evidence that KPMG has embraced the idea of offering professional
services to its business customers via the Internet. Stephen
Butler, chairman and chief executive of the U.S. unit, said KPMG
had selectively wooed potential technology partners in recent
months to complement existing relationships.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the telecommunications upstart Qwest Communications
International announced that it was forming a joint venture with
KPMG to provide services like order processing through Qwest's
Internet network. The Denver-based Qwest now owns 51 percent of the
venture, called Qwest Cyber.solutions, and KPMG owns 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Qwest combination though, Cisco is making a direct
investment. The two companies have cooperated on various
initiatives for six years. But Butler said it was not until two
months ago that he and his colleagues began to think about a closer
alliance with Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   The market for business services on the Internet is growing at a
rate of more than 40 percent a year, Butler said. ``It's a young
market for the types of services we provide,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, here is how the Cisco-KPMG alliance will work: If a
corporate customer wants to transfer business functions like
accounting or financial reporting to the Web, Cisco will provide
the hardware and KPMG will set up and maintain the computer and
software systems needed.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy behind the alliance, executives from the two
companies said, rests on the conviction that dominance in the
Internet economy will be achieved not by being the first to notice
a trend, but by being the first to exploit it effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the realization that you can be out of business in
three years,'' John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive, said
Saturday. ``Whoever moves quickly first are those who will benefit
over the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Carefully conceived alliances and joint ventures represent the
best business model for the burgeoning Internet economy, Chambers
said. And it is likely Cisco will seek alliances with other
consulting firms. The company has already formed strategic
relationships with many of the industry's biggest players,
including software giant Microsoft Corp. and telecommunications
equipment maker Motorola Inc.

Dickerson makes himself at home
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CANTON, Ohio _ From Sealy to Canton, Eric Dickerson took a
circuitous route to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. His
record-breaking career spanned 11 years and four cities, and he
left the game as one of the greatest running backs in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Dickerson was voted into the Pro Football Hall of
Fame on the first ballot. On Saturday, he was enshrined among pro
football's immortals with Lawrence Taylor, Ozzie Newsome, Tom Mack
and Billy Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being here is such an honor,'' Dickerson said before family,
friends and former teammates in the audience as well as a national
television audience. ``It validates every hit I took, every
cold-weather game I played, every contract dispute I went through.
It makes it all worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This weekend, I've been just like a kid in a candy store. I'm
overwhelmed by it all. When I saw Otto Graham for the first time,
it was like, `Wow! That's Otto Graham.' I'm in awe of these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Counting the Class of '99, there are 199 members of the Pro
Football Hall of Fame. More than 50 returned for the annual
festivities that culminate with the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game
on Monday night when the new Cleveland Browns make their debut
against the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I got emotional in the parade (Saturday morning),''
Dickerson said. ``At a luncheon (Friday), I saw so many of the Hall
of Famers walking with canes. I'm sure the day will come when I'm
their age and I'm using a cane, and I hope some new inductee will
say, `Wow! There's Eric Dickerson.'''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference before the induction ceremonies, Dickerson
was asked about his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sealy was a small town when I was growing up, and it's a small
town today,'' he said. ``But football was king when I played at
Sealy High School, and football's still king today.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson rushed for 13,259 yards, third on the NFL's all-time
list behind Walter Payton and Barry Sanders. He played 4{ years
with the Rams, 4{ with the Colts and one each with the Raiders and
Falcons before retiring after the 1993 season.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest seasons were with the Rams. He rushed for more than
1,800 yards in three of his first four seasons, including an
NFL-record 2,105 in 1984, breaking O.J. Simpson's record of 2,003.
His season record still stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking the record meant a lot to me because it kind of
legitimized me,'' Dickerson said. ``My record's stood for 14 years,
but I believe it'll be broken. When it is, I'll be there to
congratulate the player who breaks it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Barry Sanders doesn't come back, I think (Denver's) Terrell
Davis has the best chance among today's backs.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dickerson was one of the greatest running backs, Taylor
was definitely the greatest linebacker in history. He might be the
greatest defensive player in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three people have been instrumental in my pro football career
_ (Giants owner) Wellington Mara, (former Giants general manager)
George Young and (former Giants coach) Bill Parcells,'' Taylor
said. ``When you mention great owners like George Halas, Paul Brown
and Art Rooney, you have to mention Wellington Mara.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did he take care of me professionally, but he cared
about me on a personal level probably more than he should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's legal, financial and substance-abuse problems have been
well-documented. But he kept his problems off the field and never
gave less than 100 percent in games. He helped the Giants win two
Super Bowls under Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, the Jets coach, was unable to attend because of a team
scrimmage Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's the coach of coaches,'' Taylor said. ``My relationship
with Bill is kind of like a 30-year marriage _ you really don't
talk any more, but you know you love each other. Our relationship's
not the kind where we have to keep reaffirming our feelings for
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was having a difficult time choosing between Parcells and
Mara to be his presenter. His son, Lawrence Taylor Jr., who goes by
T.J., made the decision easy. The 17-year-old, who resides in
Charlotte, N.C., asked his father if he could introduce him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such an exciting day for me and my family, especially
my son,'' Taylor said. ``I think he'll be proud of me and himself.
Plus, he might be able to get some girls out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank my children for understanding that people do
make mistakes in life and being able to forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   A huge crowd of Giants fans in the audience shouted ``L.T.''
over and over during the three-hour ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what it means to be inducted, Taylor said, ``Hall of
Famers realize the crime isn't getting knocked down; the crime's
not getting back up.''
</P>
<P>
   As loud as the Giants fans were, they were often drowned out by
fans of the new Cleveland Browns, who barked and chanted, ``Oz-zie,
Oz-zie,'' each time Newsome's name was mentioned or his picture
appeared on one of the Jumbotrons.
</P>
<P>
   Newsome, who caught more passes than any tight end in history,
played for Bear Bryant at Alabama before the Browns drafted him in
the first round in 1978. After his 13-year career ended, he moved
into the front office, where he ran the football side of the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   When owner Art Modell moved the team to Baltimore and they
became the Ravens, Newsome went with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never betrayed the Cleveland Browns,'' Newsome said. ``If
the team hadn't left, I'd still be working for the Cleveland
Browns, and this would probably be a little bit bigger enjoyment,
but it's still great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to mentally prepare for this moment in a lot of
different ways, but one thing kept coming back to me. Coach Bryant
once told me, `Ozzie, in all circumstances, show your class.'
That's what I'm trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Modell, who is still vilified in Northern Ohio, didn't attend
the ceremonies. He has vowed never to return to Ohio because of
threats against his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day I was elected, Art called me and told me not to
mention his name because he didn't want to be a distraction,''
Newsome said. ``I wish Art were here because he's played such a big
part in everything I've done since the Browns drafted me in 1978.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Newsome mentioned Modell at the news conference, he
didn't mention him in his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Newsome sent the pro-Browns crowd into hysterics when he
said, ``It's going to be great to see those orange helmets and
white jerseys by the lake (Erie) again. I still have such
compassion for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland has the greatest fans in the world. It (moving the
team) was nothing the fans did, but they're the people who
suffered. I'm happy for them that football's back, hopefully, for
the rest of their lives.''

Texas' Applewhite hasn't missed a beat
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AUSTIN _ Well, Major Applewhite didn't lose his starting spot at
the first practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, but I might lose it at the second one,'' the Texas
quarterback joked after a Saturday morning workout at Whitaker
Field, the Longhorns' first full-squad practice.
</P>
<P>
   Jokes aside, Applewhite, who as an unheralded redshirt freshman
had one of the finest seasons statistically of any quarterback in
school history, is not likely to think his starting spot
threatened. Especially if he continues to be as sharp as he was in
the team's first installment of its two-week-long two-a-days.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was deep balls and crossing routes to Kwame Cavil,
ins and outs to Ryan Nunez, or hooks and stops to a slew of tight
ends and running backs, Applewhite was on the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense really clicked for a first practice,'' offensive
coordinator Greg Davis said. ``The skill position players were on
time, with very few miscues. That is a direct reflection of how
hard they worked over the summer to come in ready to go. There was
a lot of retention from the spring. It looked nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen Chris Simms and Adam Hall had their shining moments,
much to the delight of a crowd estimated at 1,200, but Applewhite
was the highlight. And that is how it should be for an offensive
squad that lost its top running back, receiver and starting and
backup tight ends. Make no mistake, this is Applewhite's offense,
Major's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my team,'' Applewhite said. ``I'm not going to take
credit for wins or take blame for losses. It's everybody's team _
special teams, defense and offense. All I can do is be the best
quarterback I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't buy that. Applewhite is in charge, and you can see why. No
one on the team works as hard in the film room to prepare, so he
rarely sees anything unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   He walks with an air of confidence and control, yet there he was
sprinting downfield at the first workout, trying to be the first to
pump up fullback Ricky Brown after a spectacular diving grab.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite said his weight (205 pounds) is the same as a year
ago, but he looks stronger thanks to added bulk in his torso.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the most telling difference between himself and the two
freshmen battling for the No. 2 spot is noticeable during passing
drills. Simms and Hall will drop back and loft beautiful 50-yard
spirals downfield that a few seconds after release fall harmlessly
to the ground. Applewhite's spiral, while above average, might not
be as tight and his ball might not come at the same velocity, but a
few seconds after his release, a Longhorns receiver gets an ovation
after a reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still learning, but they're getting better and they're
going to get better each practice,'' Applewhite said. ``Right now,
they just have a lot to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing they, and those anticipating trouble at the top
because Applewhite does not have running back Ricky Williams to
carry the load, have to learn is Applewhite is the man.
</P>
<P>
   He just won't admit it. &QL;

NURSE PAIR PORN EXCUSE FOR PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because the subject matter is of a mature nature, we've tried to
approach it as adults, which is the opposite of what we should be
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, married nurses George and Tracy Miller were fired
from their jobs at Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn because they
operate an X-rated Web site proclaiming Tracy as `Dakota Rae . . .
a housewife . . . a nurse . . . a Web Goddess that enjoys sex live
on the Internet!''
</P>
<P>
   The couple say their dismissal was a violation of their First
Amendment right to free speech. They say their firing was
retaliatory and not related to their work.
</P>
<P>
   They say _ and newspapers, TV and radio seem to agree _ that we
should discuss the ``porno nurses'' controversy in a manner
befitting reasoned, intelligent men and women. And we have.
</P>
<P>
   And we're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Now is not the time to start acting like grown-ups. Now is the
time to be kids. ``Their'' kids. The Millers have two children, a
boy, 11, and a girl, 5.
</P>
<P>
   Quit being an adult for a minute. Think of yourself in the fifth
grade.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, there was only one thing worse than imagining
your parents having sex, and that was actually SEEING them have
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son's never seen it,'' George Miller told me Friday. ``Our
parental controls on our computer are as tight as they can be.'' &QL; 
WHAT ABOUT OTHER KIDS? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's not true at every household. With a few simple clicks, a
savvy kid can find, for free, images of ``Dakota Rae,'' known to
her children as ``Mom,'' doing things no kid should see. Copies can
be made. And shared.
</P>
<P>
   Could you have handled that as a kid? George was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``My parents were very conservative.
I have never seen my mom naked in my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that a bad thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he answered. ``It's just how my parents
are.''
</P>
<P>
   How are you and Tracy as parents?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't drink. We don't smoke. We don't abuse. We've always
been there for our kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says his son knows his mother poses nude, but doesn't
know about the sex acts shown on the site.
</P>
<P>
   As for that, he said, ``Anything that's been done (for the
camera) is strictly between me and her, or by herself. It could
always be worse than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   I believe that, but since when is ``could be worse'' acceptable?
</P>
<P>
   The Millers say they're using the money they earn from cyberporn
to create a college fund for the children. &QL; 
IMAGINE THIS
</P>
<P>
   Again, imagine yourself as a youngster. If your parents had
presented you with two options:
</P>
<P>
   (1.) Having to take out a loan for college. Or

   ``I think we're pretty liberal,'' George said. ``My son's grown
up with liberal views. He's mentioned to us that this is how a lot
of these starlets got their start. Posing for ``Playboy'' or
whatnot.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just posing, however. And this isn't some starlet.

<P>
   It's Mom.

   ``In the last few weeks, we've gotten about 60 letters from
people in the Valley who've wanted to do an adult Web site but
didn't know how to get started,'' George said. ``So, we're in the
process of sponsoring these people, helping them out and adding
content to our site.''

   The Millers believe some of their critics are hypocrites.
</P>

   ``There's a lot of hypocrisy in people's lives,'' he said. ``I'm
sure there are plenty of people who are members of our site or have
viewed our site who would never admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   I've viewed their site.
</P>
<P>
   I admit it.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, having deliberated in a mature, reasoned way the
entire ``porno nurses'' controversy, I can tell you I don't believe
the Millers should have their First Amendment rights infringed
upon.
</P>
<P>
   And I don't believe they should lose their jobs as nurses.
</P>
<P>
   I just wish we could fire them as parents. &QL;

Astros' up-and-comers combine with Everett to crush Cubs
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHICAGO _ The Chicago Cubs still haven't found a way to get Carl
Everett out, and now they have Russ Johnson to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   The hot-hitting tandem combined for eight RBIs, including a
career-high six by Johnson, in the Astros' 10-4 victory over the
Cubs on an overcast Saturday afternoon at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   The first pitch was delayed 26 minutes because of rain, and the
Cubs no doubt would have waited longer if it meant stalling Everett
and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Everett homered from both sides of the plate and Johnson was
4-for-6 as the Astros won for the 11th time in their last 15 games
in the Windy City. The offensive support was more than enough for
Scott Elarton, who allowed two runs on four hits and tied his
career-high with nine strikeouts in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of things going our way today,'' manager Larry
Dierker said. ``We had some good clutch hitting by Russ, Carl had
another good game, and Scott threw the ball really well. You can't
ask for much more than what we got today.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton quickly righted himself after a couple of mediocre
innings to start the game _ he retired 14 in a row at one point _
to win his first major-league game as a starter. His fastball,
slider, curve and changeup finally showed up on the same day, which
was bad news for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   After making 26 relief appearances to start the season, Elarton
(6-3) had struggled to gain command of his entire arsenal in his
first six starts. If Saturday was any indication, the adjustment
period may be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest key was my changeup,'' Elarton said. ``I haven't
really had it since I went into the rotation. I really had all four
pitches working, which surprised me because this is the first time
I've put everything together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to know that I've still got it. I wasn't sure how
long the adjustment period would take.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, it was just a matter of repetition. Perhaps
the same is true for Johnson, who struggled to find his rhythm at
the plate as a part-time player but is flourishing with more
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has started seven of the last 12 games at third base,
the last four in a row.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed the best day of his brief big-league career with a
two-run single in the third inning, a two-run double in the fourth
and RBI singles in the eighth and ninth. It was the fourth time
this season an Astro has delivered six RBIs in a game and the first
since Everett did it against the Expos on June 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself a big RBI guy,'' said Johnson, who
only had 11 RBIs in 46 games before Saturday. ``I'm more of a
table-setter _ get on base and try to score a run. But that's not
the way it worked out today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing the ball really well right now and I'm making good
contact. When you're doing those two things, good things can
happen. I'm getting a chance to play right now, and I want to
perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has started 23 times, has 10 RBIs and seven runs
scored in his last seven games. He has added 34 points to his
batting average during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as that is, it may not be enough to call him the
hottest Astro.
</P>
<P>
   That title goes to Everett, who was activated from the disabled
list Friday. After going 4-for-5 with five RBIs in the first game
of Friday's doubleheader, Everett was 3-for-5 Saturday. He homered
from the left side against Cubs starter Kevin Tapani in the second
inning and from the right side against reliever Felix Heredia in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine a guy being out (20 games) and coming
back the way Carl has,'' Dierker said. ``He's hit three home runs
in his last two games and hasn't shown any signs of lingering
problems from his (strained hamstring) injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said, ``He hurt us last year and he's
hurt us this year. We've got to make better pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's first homer gave the Astros a 1-0 lead. The Cubs
rallied in the bottom of the second on Gary Gaetti's two-out,
two-run double after Elarton walked two batters.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Everett took care of that, combining for five RBIs
from the third through the seventh innings. Their production made
it easy to overlook a mini-slump by Jeff Bagwell, who has just
three hits in his last 24 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just look to your horses to win games every single
time,'' Everett said. ``St. Louis is a prime example of that. You
have to get a contribution from everyone, and that's what this team
has been able to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really comfortable at the plate right now. I'm trying not
to think too much. I'm just trying to hit the ball hard somewhere.
I'm going to ride it out for as long as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Everett didn't drive in all the runs; it only seemed
that way. Craig Biggio had a RBI single in the eighth and Glen
Barker drove in a run in the ninth with a single to center.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs scored late on Henry Rodriguez's two-run homer in the
ninth off Doug Henry, who has allowed seven home runs in 17
appearances _ the most by an Astros reliever despite Henry missing
58 games because of elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Tapani (6-10) gave up five runs _ three earned _ and seven hits
in six innings as he lost his seventh straight decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play very good behind him,'' Riggleman said. ``We're
not a good defensive ballclub. It's not a strength of ours. We have
to make the plays for our starting pitchers.''
