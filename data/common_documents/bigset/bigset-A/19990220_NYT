HOUSTON PROPELS KNICKS PAS 76ERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Waiting for Allan Houton to find his feathery
stroke can often take days, sometimes weeks. But when it finally
arrives, when the Knicks' shooting guard squares up and forgets how
to miss, there are not many prettier things to behold from New
York's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   In his most complete game this season, Houston put on a
long-distance exhibition in the third quarter Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dueling Allen Iverson shot for shot, Houston scored 15 of his
season-high 25 points on perimeter bombs, and the Knicks held off
the Philadelphia 76ers, 78-67, at the First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   Recovering from their most lackadaisical performance of the
two-week-old season 24 hours earlier in Cleveland _ a blowout loss
_ the Knicks played as if they cared about getting back on defense
and about moving the basketball when it mattered most against the
76ers.
</P>
<P>
   They not only improved their record to 5-3, but they also
regained the cohesion that had characterized their four-game
winning streak before they fell apart against the Cavaliers.
Philadelphia had only 11 points in the first quarter and 27 in the
half.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson scored 29 points on 11-of-20 shooting, racking up 16 of
them in a run-gun-and-have-fun third quarter. But he had little
left in the fourth quarter, and the Knicks executed well down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing finished with 11 points and eight rebounds. Larry
Johnson, playing on a painfully sore knee, added 12 points and
seven assists, and Kurt Thomas contributed 14 points and six
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, though, was the main reason the Knicks won. He came
into the game shooting 38 percent and had missed 14 of the 20
3-point attempts he had taken.
</P>
<P>
   Against the 76ers, he was 5 for 5 from behind the 3-point line
and 10 for 17 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   At one juncture in the third quarter, he spotted up from the top
of the arc three times in two minutes. Each time, the ball went
softly through the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful it will come,'' Houston said before the game when
asked about his shooting stroke. ``That's what I do, I shoot the
basketball. To me, there's no such thing as a slump. I'm going to
continue to shoot the ball and make plays for other guys. Mentally,
there is no such thing as a slump in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   With the fans on their feet after Iverson had cut the deficit to
66-59 with a short jump shot, the Knicks composed themselves for
one last run.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing scored the most significant basket, spinning past the
portly Matt Geiger and putting in an awkward left-handed layup to
quell the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Then Houston dropped in a baseline jump shot and Charlie Ward,
making good decisions all evening, found Ewing alone under the
basket on the break for two points that pushed the lead back up to
15.

 &HT;    Berry execution completed
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUCASVILLE, Ohio _ Wilford Lee Berry Jr., strapped to a gurney
with tubes in his arms, stared at the ceiling as lethal drugs
flowed into his veins, then he took three labored breaths and died
at 9:31 p.m. Friday, said witnesses to Ohio's first execution in 35
years.
</P>
<P>
   Berry was ``gasping for breath, then he took a big sigh and quit
breathing,'' said a noticeably shaken Kristy Steeves, a reporter
with WJW-TV in Cleveland, one of five media witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``His eyes never closed. When I saw him gasping for air, that's
when it hit me: This man is dying in front of my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very peaceful death'' said Cleveland private
investigator William Florio, one of three witnesses selected by the
family of the man Berry murdered, Cleveland Baker Charles Mitroff
Jr., Jr. ``I just wish Mr. Mitroff (was able) to die the way
Wilford Berry died.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 9 p.m. Friday, the scheduled execution time,
Attorney General Betty Montgomery called Gov. Bob Taft to notify
him there were no further legal motions standing in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Taft, who on Thursday announced he would not grant clemency, had
an open phone line to the warden at the Southern Ohio Correctional
Institution in Lucasville and was to give approval for the
execution to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, 36, made no last statement before officials administered
a three-part lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known precisely when the injections started.
</P>
<P>
   Media witness Michael Hawthorne of The Cincinnati Enquirer said
Berry was already strapped to the gurney with IV's in his arm when
the media witnesses were escorted into the death house at 9:22 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared Mr. Berry was chanting something or mumbling
something we couldn't hear what he was saying.''
</P>
<P>
   The lighting was low. Warden Stephen Huffman stood at Berry's
head, a guard at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilford Berry started talking. The warden talked back to him
and actually patted him on the shoulder. I took that as he was
comforting him,'' Steeves said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Berry's fingernails appeared bitten to the quick.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne said at 9:25 p.m. Berry took three labored breaths and
9:30 p.m. he appeared to stop breathing. A white nylon curtain was
drawn. And when it was reopened a moment later, Huffman announced
that Berry was pronounced dead by a physician at 9:31 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, his mother sobbed,'' Hawthorne said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, 36, had chosen lethal injection over the electric chair.
He was given intravenous doses of sodium pentathol to make him lose
consciousness, pancuronium bromide to paralyze his muscles and stop
his lungs, and potassium chloride to stop his heart. A curtain hid
the electric chair as Berry was put to death.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the prison, about 250 death penalty opponents and 50
supporters were gatherered. A period of silent prayer, started
around 8:30 p.m. for Berry, his family and his victim's family, was
marred by a small scuffle, quickly broken up by state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents responded by singing hymns, including ``Amazing
Grace,'' and ``Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.''
</P>
<P>
   Some time later, when word came of Berry's death, supporters
cheered. ``Thank you, Wilford,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry was the first man to be put to death in Ohio since Donald
Reinbolt was electrocuted in the old Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus
on March 15, 1963. Reinbolt, 29, was convicted of killing a
Columbus grocer on Aug. 26, 1961, for the $60 in his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Berry got the death sentence for killing Mitroff on Dec. 1,
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Mitroff, a Cleveland baker, had hired Berry as a night porter
only days earlier. Berry and accomplice Anthony Lozar were
burglarizing the bakery when Mitroff, 52, interrupted them. Lozar
shot Mitroff in the chest and Berry shot him in the head as he
begged for his life. The robbery netted $140.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, considered the principal offender, got a death sentence;
Lozar got life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's execution leaves 190 other men on death row in Ohio,
some of whom are close to exhausting their appeals. Officials say
it's possible, though unlikely, another execution could occur this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Berry spent the day quietly in a holding cell at the death
house, a small building at the Lucasville prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been very polite, calm,'' Warden Huffman said at a 7 p.m.
press conference. He said Berry's demeanor hadn't changed since he
arrived at the prison at 8:15 p.m. Thursday. ``He slept very well,
actually,'' on Thursday night, Huffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrews, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation
and Correction, said Berry visited on and off since 10 a.m. Friday
with Cynthia Yost, an assistant Ohio public defender, who was one
of three people Berry choose to witness the execution.
</P>
<P>
   He also visited through the holding cell bars from 4:55 p.m. to
6:10 p.m. Friday with his mother, Jennie Franklin, and sister,
Elaine Quigley, who also witnessed the death. ``It was a very good
meeting for both sides,'' Huffman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitroff family chose as witnesses Florio, who helped to
track Berry down, and northern Kentucky police officers Charles
``Stan'' Voorhees and Duane Rolfsen, who arrested him, a few days
after the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice was served'' said Voorhees, a retired Kenton County,
Ky., police officer. ``It was a long time coming but justice was
served.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitroff's brother-in-law, Richard Bowler said he was relieved
when Florio told him by phone that the execution was over, Florio
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basics of this is, this is the end of a 10-year funeral
for them,'' Vorhees said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said Berry neither made nor received phone calls and had
no other visitors Friday. He didn't watch television or listen to
the radio, and he read nothing but the half dozen or so cards and
letters he got in the day's mail.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered a last meal of lasagna, garlic bread, cheesecake and
cola. ``He ate some of it,'' Andrews said. Berry also showered in
the morning and afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   There was a Bible in the holding area, but Berry didn't read it,
Andrews said. Berry did not want to be visited by the Rev. David
Chase of the Columbus Christian Center, who has been working with
him the past several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He appears to continue to be pretty stoic,'' Andrews said.
``He appears to be on a pretty even keel.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase has said Berry showed no remorse for killing Mitroff, but
has made his peace with God.
</P>
<P>
   Berry was nicknamed ``Volunteer'' because he steadfastly refused
to appeal his death sentence, saying he'd rather die than spend the
rest of his life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Ohio Public Defender's Office pursued the case
in the name of Berry's mother and sister, saying Berry was not
mentally competent to waive his appeals. He was physically and
sexually abused as a child, diagnosed a schizophrenic, and made the
first of several suicide attempts at age 9.
</P>
<P>
   Various courts, however, found him competent and attempts by the
public defender to raise the question again in light of a severe
prison beating Berry received in September 1997 were ultimately
unsuccessful. The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals noted that
Berry's competency was decided before the prison beating, at a time
when he was already waiving appeals.

DEVILS WIN FIGHT BUT LOSE A HOCKEY GAME TO RED WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The days leading up to the game had been filled with
talk of retribution and retaliation. While the Devils were ready
for the task, they were unable to contend with the Red Wings in the
more basic tasks of skating, passing and shooting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One game after scoring seven goals, the Devils struggled just to
get seven shots on goal for much of the night as the Red Wings
dominated them in a 3-1 victory at Joe Louis Arena Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minutes, the crowd chanted, ``Ozzie, Ozzie,'' for
Red Wings goaltender Chris Osgood. But until those final minutes,
Osgood was hardly challenged. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings entered the game with a 2-14-1 record against
teams with winning records and needed this, their sixth straight
win, to make a point. For the Devils, who hardly appeared to fit
that description , the game showed the difference between a
six-goal margin of victory over the league's worst team, the Tampa
Bay Lightning, in their last game, and facing the two-time
defending Stanley Cup Champions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were badly outplayed, managing just 10 shots on goal
through the first two periods. They had only 11 shots with 15
minutes remaining in the game until a late flurry raised the total
to 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got off to a bit of a slow start,'' Randy McKay said.
``Definitely, our best period was the third. We tried to come at
them, but down two goals you're facing an uphill battle.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, the Devils faltered, falling behind by 2-0
after a blast by Igor Larionov. Bobby Holik answered with a goal
just 21 seconds later to make the score 2-1, but he was penalized
for elbowing 10 seconds later. The Red Wings made the Devils pay,
increasing their lead to 3-1 when Steve Yzerman, the Detroit
center, took the puck end-to-end and ripped a wrist shot past Chris
Terreri for his second goal of the game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings scored first when Yzerman skated in on Terreri and
fired a shot through the goalie's legs at 15 minutes 36 seconds of
the first period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scoring seemed almost secondary to that point as the Red Wings
focused on Krzysztof Oliwa.
</P>
<P>
   In the teams' last meeting, a 2-2 tie on Feb. 1, Oliwa became
the object of the Red Wings' ire after he was involved in a series
of questionable plays. He collided into the boards with Detroit's
Larry Murphy, and Murphy, who was knocked unconscious, suffered a
concussion. The Red Wings felt that Oliwa gave Murphy an extra,
unnecessary shot on the play. Later in the game, Oliwa broke Todd
Gill's forearm when he hit him with the butt end of his stick. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the days following the game, Barry Smith, Detroit's associate
coach, called Oliwa ``an idiot,'' and the Red Wings spoke of
retribution.The Red Wings made their attempt at payback seven
minutes into the game when Darren McCarty came off the bench and
blasted Oliwa. The two squared off briefly, but threw no punches
until the officials got between them and McCarty reached over and
landed one. They were assessed two-minute unsportsmanlike conduct
penalties, but when they got out of the penalty box, they
immediately resumed the fight, this time dropping their gloves. The
6-foot-1-inch McCarty, who, with injuries to Joe Kocur and Martin
Lapointe, inherited the role of enforcer, was beaten soundly by
Oliwa, but still drew a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play hard and tough, and the guys play hard and tough
against me,'' Oliwa said. ``I don't feel like I've done anything
wrong. I just finished my check. If I don't play hard, I won't be
in the lineup. &UR; '' &LR;

YANKEES MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN JIMMY KEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also BBA-YANKS-CLEMENS)

 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush, two-thirds of the
package sent to Toronto for Roger Clemens, were luxuries to manager
Joe Torre, specialists on a roster of stars. The Yankees will win
without them.
</P>
<P>
   But sometime before the July 31 trade deadline, the Yankees will
have to replace Bush and Lloyd _ maybe with someone like Jimmy Key,
the veteran left-hander who announced his retirement late last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, the five-time Cy Young Award winner, is expected to
arrive here Saturday, perhaps in time to join his new teammates for
a workout. He will wear No. 12 and house his equipment in a locker
between Jeff Nelson and Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just anxious to have him come here so we can sit and
talk,'' Torre said. ``He's been throwing, so he'll be ready to go
when he gets here.''
</P>
<P>
   The expectations for the Yankees, now that they have added
Clemens, seem to be even greater than last year, if that is
possible. ``We snuck up on some people last year,'' said George
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner. ``The team has to be
twice as good this year as it was last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. The American League contains so many poor teams,
like Minnesota, Kansas City and Oakland, that it is hard to imagine
a scenario in which the Yankees _ with a pitching rotation of
Clemens, David Cone, Orlando Hernandez, Andy Pettitte and Irabu _
will not dominate during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Games against upper-echelon teams, however, like Cleveland and
Anaheim, are usually decided in one play, one particular at-bat.
The Yankees were vulnerable in the American League Championship
Series against Cleveland until the moment Hernandez struck out Jim
Thome with the bases loaded in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   That is where specialists like Lloyd and Bush can turn a game,
and why the Yankees must replace them. Lloyd's role was to face one
or two left-handed batters in the middle innings, with his
three-quarter delivery and sweeping breaking ball; the slugger Ken
Griffey Jr. had just one hit in nine career at-bats (.111) against
Lloyd, Rafael Palmeiro only three hits in 19 at-bats (.158). If an
opposing left-handed batter came up in a crucial situation in the
sixth inning, and again in the eighth, Torre could use Lloyd early
and Mike Stanton, his other left-handed reliever, in the late
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Now Stanton is Torre's only experienced left-handed reliever,
and there are no other left-handed bullpen candidates in camp.
Torre actually has right-handed relievers who are more effective
against left-handed batters, in Darren Holmes and Dan Naulty.
Left-handers batted .245 against Holmes, right-handers .294;
left-handers have batted just .216 against Naulty during his
injury-plagued career with the Twins, right-handers .289.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees will want another left-handed reliever for
October, assuming they make the playoffs. Anaheim is stacked with
left-handed batters, in Darin Erstad, Mo Vaughn, Jim Edmonds and
Garret Anderson; Cleveland has first baseman Thome and second
baseman Roberto Alomar (a switch-hitter who is much better against
right-handed pitchers), and Texas has Palmeiro and Rusty Greer.
</P>
<P>
   There are few effective left-handed relievers available. The
Yankees could pursue Mike Myers of the Milwaukee Brewers. If the
Blue Jays fall out of the race, the Yankees could reacquire Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   An intriguing name bandied about by Yankee pitchers Friday was
that of Key, a former Yankee who others say was approached by club
officials during the off- season. Key pitched for the Orioles last
season. General manager Brian Cashman would not comment on the
Yankees' interest in Key, who held left-handers to a .237 batting
average over the last five seasons. The questions with Key are
whether he is healthy, whether he can warm up quickly enough to
work out of the bullpen, and whether he would be willing to be a
specialist for minimal pay (the Yankees' payroll may approach $90
million).
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always looking for ways to improve yourself,'' Cashman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a backup infielder, was employed as a pinch-runner in the
late innings, stepping in for the likes of Darryl Strawberry and
Chili Davis if the Yankees were behind by a run or tied and Torre
wanted to force the issue. Bush had just 71 at-bats, but he was
extremely effective as a runner, disrupting pitchers, taking the
extra base and putting pressure on the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's departure means the Yankees could carry an extra
outfielder _ perhaps Shane Spencer as well as Ricky Ledee, or maybe
Mike Figga, the reserve catcher who is out of options. Cashman said
there is a chance Torre could carry three catchers. ``We've got
some things to think about,'' Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees also must identify another middle infielder in their
organization who would be promoted in the case of an injury. Luis
Sojo is the Yankees' utility infielder, and he can play first,
second, third or short. But if the Yankees were to lose two
starting infielders to injury for a day or a week or months, they
might have to call up Alfonso Soriano, the Yankees' top prospect
and best minor league infielder in camp. Soriano, 20, played in
Japan last year, but he has only two months' worth of professional
experience in the United States. He is expected to open the year at
shortstop for Norwich, the Yankees' Class AA affiliate.

HIGH SCHOOL OPENS TRAINING PROGRAM FOR FUTURE FIREFIGHTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Under the gaze of dignitaries and scores of proud
parents, 42 Monroe High School students dedicated themselves Friday
to a future in firefighting, taking an oath to develop themselves
intellectually, ethically and physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a student of the Michael D. McComb Fire Academy and as a
future firefighter, I pledge to prepare myself to serve my
community, protect lives and property, and respect the
environment,'' the teen-agers pledged in unison, wearing blue
training uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Friday marked the official dedication of the nation's first high
school fire academy, designed to introduce ninth- and 10th-graders
to firefighting and help them prepare for a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to be a part of something special,'' said
16-year-old Ernesto Venegas, one of the older students involved in
the program. ``The physical ed and all of the other stuff makes me
want to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fulfilling, too,'' 14-year-old Victor Alvarado chimed in,
adding he wants to be an arson investigator. ``It's a dangerous
kind of work, but everyone has to take risks to help the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Fire Chief William
Bamattre helped dedicate the program, which is named for one of
three Los Angeles firefighters killed in March when a department
helicopter crashed in Griffith Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a firefighter is a lot more than putting out fires. It's
about fire prevention and saving lives,'' Riordan said. ``That's
what Firefighter McComb was doing on March 23, 1998. Thanks to this
program, his spirit will live on, and that spirit will be passed on
to people like yourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   McComb, 48, a 1968 Monroe High School graduate, was airlifting
an 11-year-old girl to Childrens (cq) Hospital Los Angeles when the
chopper went down. The girl _ a traffic crash victim _ and two
other firefighters died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   McComb left behind a wife, Lorne; three children; and four
grandchildren. His former high school classmates later set up a
scholarship fund in his name for fire academy students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike would be smiling today to know he left this legacy to
Monroe High School,'' Assistant Chief Robert De Feo said.
</P>
<P>
   The three- to four-year program introduces students to the
physical, mechanical, mental and culinary aspects of being a
firefighter, Capt. Steve Ruda said. The Fire Department is working
in conjunction with the schools to provide mentoring, field trips
to stations and demonstrations like training on extinguishing car
fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids have stepped up to the plate and have not gone the
way of society, getting into gangs or drugs,'' Ruda said. ``We
expect them to all be young people of discipline. If not, that job
won't be there. I hope they are all successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy may eventually expand to other schools, De Feo said.
He was glad to see so many teen-age girls involved in the program,
as well as students who are bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are exactly the kind of candidates that, if qualified,
we would like to recruit,'' De Feo said. ``Especially in Los
Angeles where there are so many Spanish speakers. We need to be
able to communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Monroe High program coordinator Jeff Marciano said the program
will focus on mathematics that are important for calculating
hydraulics, language emphasizing bilingual training, reading,
writing and speaking skills. They practice military-style formation
marching to develop discipline, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Students also will spend two days a week in the weight room,
climbing ropes, scaling walls and dragging around 150-pound dummies
_ getting them used to carrying people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will get to experience the different aspects of this
field. They've already gone on three field trips and watched them
put out fires,'' said Marciano, an English teacher. ``Any time kids
volunteer for programs like this, I want to be involved in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The school already has a police academy, plus other programs
specializing in banking, nursing, automotive repair and culinary
arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to see students at this school so interested in
their futures,'' Monroe Principal Joan Elam said.
</P>
<P>
   The first class is set to graduate in 2001.

BIG TIP FOR NISSAN SPECTATORS: BRING SENSE OF HUMOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Essential stuff to know before throwing everything
into the 4Runner and heading out naively to the Riviera Country
Club for the final two rounds of the Nissan Open:
</P>
<P>
   __ Best things to bring:
</P>
<P>
   1. Cash. But don't expect to use it.
</P>
<P>
   They've got a new system for buying food. It's a debit card.
Here's how it's supposed to work:
</P>
<P>
   You give one guy a bunch of your money. He gives you a card. Can
you pay for this card with one of your real credit card? No. Plus,
that'd be too confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Then you move two steps over to the food guy and ask for
whatever you'd care to consume. You give him the debit card. He
runs it through a machine that subtracts the total. Then you move
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sanitary thing,'' said one believable volunteer at the
card kiosk. ``You don't want someone who handles your food to also
handle money, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the last thing we need when paying $4.33 for a hot dog _
that's the actual price _ is another pair of dirty hands all over
that piece of ground-up pork product.
</P>
<P>
   (Although during the first round Thursday, Ernie Els hit a ball
under a hot dog cart on the back nine and, while waiting for a
ruling, got a free dog _ he didn't pay cash
 &UR; !ital! &LR; or use a debit card. An illegal move? This is all new
territory.)
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, if you remember, you can take the card
back to the guy you got it from, or any of the other inconvenient
``Cash Card Sales and Reload Center'' booths and ask for the proper
currency on what's left.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't go back, the money left on it will be donated to
charity. Then it's up to them if they want to spend $5.50 for a
Bloody Mary.
</P>
<P>
   2. Reading material. Such as ``War and Peace,'' to read while
you wait for the shuttle bus going to and from your car, should you
ever find it once it has been crammed into one of the
well-congested lots somewhere outside of Brentwood.
</P>
<P>
   3. A wristwatch. Sure, there are clocks all over the place near
the clubhouse and driving range at Riviera, but under each is a
sign that says ``unofficial time.''
</P>
<P>
   Your watch will also probably give you pretty much the same
``unofficial time,'' but let it be known it's your responsibility,
not Riviera's, to accurately calculate just how long you waited for
that shuttle bus to bring you there.
</P>
<P>
   4. A warm piece of clothing. The hottest item at the pro shop
Friday was a down sweater. It cost $95.
</P>
<P>
   __ Best things not to bring:
</P>
<P>
   1. Cell phones. There should be a rule that every spectator be
strip-searched before entering the premises and, if any cell phone
is found, have it not only taken away but destroyed in front of the
children and pets.
</P>
<P>
   As a means of personal communications, a cell phone might be the
best thing to have on a golf course. If you're planted at the 15th
green and some pals are over at 18 want an update on how a certain
golfer is coming on, they can call you.
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, those around you not only don't care to hear your Gil
Stratton imitation, but when your phone rings in the middle of
Rocco Mediate's backswing, guess who gets a Big Bertha wrapped
around his neck?
</P>
<P>
   2. Cigars, cigarettes or other things that can be lit with a
match and sent wafting into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   True, Tiger Woods' caddy, Puff Cowan, probably puts a pack and a
half away himself on the first nine and isn't setting a great
example for the kids. But you wonder how he got his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, the canyon in which this golf course sits
develops a haze that can't be escaped with a quick dash into an
Andy Gump.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for those who still smoke, cigars are sold at the course
_ up to $15 for a Cohiba Churchill, if you've got money left on
your debit card.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, they're priced high enough so one will have to think
twice before deciding whether to buy the cigar, or another $5
Hoagie sandwich to eat at Hogan's Alley.
</P>
<P>
   __ Best places to watch the most picturesque shots even if
you've got to fight for a seat by showing up at the crack of dawn:
</P>
<P>
   1. The natural amphitheatre surrounding the 18th green, even
when the sun's in your eyes and the wind's in your face at about 3
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   2. The cliff used as the first tee.
</P>
<P>
   __ Worst place to watch that involves fighting the crowd:
</P>
<P>
   1. Along the left side of the sixth-hole green _ the one with
the bunker in the center. It also gives a view of the seventh tee.
</P>
<P>
   It also has construction workers pounding away big blocks of
cement into little blocks of cement with giant hammers up on the
hill behind it, to serenade the spectators and rattle the golfers'
nerves _ the ones that aren't already shaken by the sound of table
saws from a house being constructed off the sixth tee.
</P>
<P>
   __ Best place to watch picturesque shots without fighting the
crowd _ and there's bleachers:
</P>
<P>
   1. The driving range, whenever Tiger Woods isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, you could have talked to Kenny Perry as he was
trying out some new Taylor-Made fairway woods he just got in the
mail. Or you could have learned a practice trick from Larry Mize _
he held a towel across his chest and under both arms as he
practiced to make sure he was keeping his arms in.
</P>
<P>
   Or you could have stretched out on the wooden bleachers and
actually taken a nap while the kids ran around underneath looking
for loose change that didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Because everyone has a debit card.

SCORING FIRST AND OFTEN, RANGERS BURY PENGUINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yes, the Rangers were hurting, with three important
regulars injured and out of the lineup. Sure, they were tired,
playing their fifth game in eight nights. Of course they were
slumping, having lost 10 of their previous 14 games and eight of
their previous nine at home. And their guests Friday night at
Madison Square Garden were the Pittsburgh Penguins, one of the
National Hockey League's hottest teams.
</P>
<P>
   So how bad was the result? Terrible _ for the Penguins. The
Rangers scored four goals on their first 10 shots against goalie
Tom Barrasso and cruised to a 6-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The result moved the Rangers (22-27-7) from 12th place to 11th
in the Eastern Conference and left them only 4 points behind the
eighth-place Florida Panthers, who hold the last playoff berth in
the bracket. With 26 games left in their regular season, the
Rangers are within range of post-season play.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins (30-17-7) had won 10 consecutive games until they
were defeated by the Islanders, 3-1, on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The game was a homecoming for Aleksei Kovalev, the former Ranger
who was traded to the Penguins early this season in the deal that
brought Petr Nedved to the Rangers. Although Kovalev had his
entertaining moments, he finished with a minus-3 in the plus-minus
ratio. The more productive player was Nedved, who scored a
short-handed goal and added an assist. Another former Penguin,
Kevin Stevens, scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   Another star was Dan Cloutier, the 22-year-old goalie, who
stopped 32 of 33 shots but lost his shutout with 5 minutes 34
seconds remaining on a goal by Kevin Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   It was Cloutier's fourth appearance in four games this week. Two
of them were starts, and he won both. ``Obviously, I've been
feeling pretty good lately,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible he will start at least one of the two games the
Rangers play in Alberta, at Edmonton on Sunday and at Calgary on
Monday. Coach John Muckler refused to say if Cloutier would start
the next game, adding that he would decide between Cloutier and
Mike Richter, the first-stringer, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Brennan, Adam Graves and Ulf Samuelsson scored the other
goals for the Rangers, who scored three times in the second period
and eventually led by 6-0. John MacLean and Marc Savard each had
three assists.
</P>
<P>
   Samuelsson's goal was the last of the game, right after he burst
from the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had fresh legs,'' Samuelsson said. ``The guys around me were
dying, so I looked like I was flying.''
</P>
<P>
   MacLean, who missed most of the previous game with a nerve
injury in his neck, finished at plus-4 and put four shots on goal.
``It's kind of fun to be involved,'' MacLean said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens scored once at even strength and once on the power play
and has 14 goals for the season. In the final seconds, he prevented
a goal by knocking over the Rangers' net from behind when Cloutier
was facing a barrage of Pittsburgh shots. This caused a whistle to
stop play and the Penguins to argue about the sportsmanship of it
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I might as well push the net over and see what
happens,' '' Stevens said, adding that he expected Pittsburgh to be
awarded a penalty shot.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler had praise for most of his players, particularly the
five-man unit that skated against Jaromir Jagr's line. Jagr,
leading the league in points, is a top candidate for the Hart
Trophy as the league's most valuable player. ``Jagr is the best
player in the league right now,'' Muckler said. ``He's not an easy
man to play against.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ranger unit played what Muckler calls a ``shallow
forecheck,'' which looks like the neutral-zone trap. Muckler
praised his unit for ``clogging up the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Savard led frequent forechecking forays with his linemates,
Stevens and MacLean. By forcing a turnover from Darius Kasparaitis,
Savard set up Brennan's goal to give the Rangers a 1-0 lead at
11:27 of the first period. ``We talked about putting pressure on
their defense,'' Savard said. ``We jumped on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the game over all, Savard said: ``We were smiling on the
bench, and we were kind of pumped. We want to get something going
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler called it ``our best game at home in a long time; a
super effort from the time they dropped the puck till the end of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to recent criticism of Nedved _ from the coaching
staff, fans and members of the news media _ Muckler said: ``Petr is
aware of the criticism. In some cases, it's fair. The last two
games, he has worked very hard. He did a great job.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers played without Todd Harvey, their aggressive right
wing, who was scratched after warm-ups because the fractured bone
in his right thumb prevented him from shooting. Harvey, who
returned from a knee injury on Feb. 12 and injured his thumb that
night, has been playing, often well. He also pulled a hamstring on
Wednesday night during a 6-3 loss to the Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Beukeboom, the big defenseman, will miss at least two more
weeks with the aftereffects of his second concussion of the season.
Beukeboom missed his fourth consecutive game Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also played without Peter Popovic, another big
defenseman, who missed his third consecutive game because of blood
in his right eye, a result of a puck hitting it.

CABLE BLACKOUT AN EMERGENCY FOR TV DRAMA'S FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Some San Fernando Valley fans of the television
show ``ER'' had their own traumas Thursday night -- their cable
service flatlined during the climax to one of TV's biggest
mysteries since ``Dallas'' asked, ``Who shot J.R.?''
</P>
<P>
   In areas of Tarzana and Woodland Hills served by Century
Communications, cable reception began to blink out intermittently
about 8:30 p.m., and went off completely just before 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   That left Century viewers in a tizzy: They lost connection with
Doug Ross, the brooding, womanizing pediatrician played by George
Clooney, cleaning out his locker. Was he leaving for good? Would
his girlfriend, nurse Carol Hathaway, leave with him?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst episode to go out. It was like the Super Bowl
going out,'' said one irate Woodland Hills viewer, who refused to
give his name. ``I think maybe I'll be better off with a
satellite.''
</P>
<P>
   A three-way cable splitter somewhere in the area failed, akin to
a light bulb burning out and stopping the flow of current, said
Bill Rosendahl, Century Communications' senior vice president. The
relay started to go bad about 8:30 p.m. _ causing the intermittent
outages _ and failed for good just before 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Crews began searching for the problem as it began, but couldn't
find and replace the device that sends cables in three directions
until after 11 p.m., Rosendahl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider an outage like a heart attack _ the longer it goes,
the more damage it does to the system,'' he said. ``I'm as upset as
the folks who missed the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously when it happened it was prime time and people were
watching their favorite shows. All I can do is apologize that the
splitter went out.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 customers of the 5,000 served in that area were
affected, he said. Century has about 40,000 customers throughout
the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred callers jammed the company's phone lines to
complain, Rosendahl said. Even though the outage lasted less than
the threshold for refunds, the most irate callers were given
credits for a day's service on their bill.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Los Angeles Information Technology Agency,
which regulates cable companies, the Century Communications service
area involved in Thursday's outage topped the city in customer
service complaints in 1998. And the company ranked third for the
year in customer complaints about technology, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosendahl said he hadn't seen the report, and declined to
comment on the figures.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Warner Bros., which produces ``ER,'' said the
episode will be repeated. He's just not sure when.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't see the show and want to wait and see the rerun in
its entirety, skip ahead. But for those of you dying to know what
happened:
</P>
<P>
   Clooney _ who is leaving the series to expand his career in
motion pictures _ didn't drive off in the Batmobile or die of a
heart condition, like Jimmy Smits' long-running character did
earlier this year on ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he came out of a bus crash unscathed, was confronted by
the father of a young euthanasia patient who regretted not being
able to say good-bye to his son, and was told by police that
charges had been dropped in the child's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end everyone survives the bus crash,'' according to
NBC's episode synopsis, ``and it becomes clearer to Ross that he is
no longer welcome to practice medicine at County General. He asks
Hathaway to go to Seattle with him, but she declines. Ross
leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen ratings showed 35.7million people watched ``ER'' on
Thursday, the highest rating for any regular network series show
this season, said Mike Nelson, director of entertainment
programming information at NBC.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the only show people missed, however.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Rosenthal was engrossed in a Stephen King movie on ABC
when ``Storm of the Century'' turned to snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset,'' she said. ``Now I have to buy the book.''

MODANO'S HAT TRICK LEADS STARS' VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ So much for Mike Modano's tired legs.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' leading scorer bounced back from his worst game of
the season last night with one of his best, scoring three goals and
leading the Stars to a 5-1 thrashing of the Chicago Blackhawks at
Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``He
has a lot of pride as a player. It just shows how far Mike Modano
has come.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Modano's second hat trick of the season and the sixth of
his career. More importantly, it was a sign that Wednesday's
stumble against the Florida Panthers was more of a hiccup than a
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a player who plays that well for that long, we
take that for granted sometimes,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Modano scored twice in the second period and once in the third
to help the Stars stretch a 1-0 first-period lead provided by Brett
Hull's power-play goal. It was the kind of killer instinct
Hitchcock said the Stars have been lacking in previous games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a game in which, as a team, we went out and extended a
lead,'' he said. ``That was important.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory moves the Stars' NHL-best record to 35-10-8, good
for 78 points _ 10 points ahead of the Phoenix Coyotes in the
Western Conference. It also was the fifth consecutive victory for
the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a stretch like this, you just want to keep
playing,'' Hitchcock said. ``This is just like it was earlier in
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are 8-1-1 in their past 10 games, a similar run to the
15-game unbeaten streak the team experienced earlier in the season.
Last night, they buried a Blackhawks team that is last in the
Western Conference at 16-34-8.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's power-play goal was a blast from the left circle off a
cross-ice pass from Sergei Zubov, giving the Stars an early lead.
Joe Nieuwendyk set up the power-play opportunity when he drew a
tripping call from Ed Olczyk.
</P>
<P>
   Modano then put the game away in the second period, sandwiching
a power-play wrister and an even-strength slap shot around Brent
Severyn's first goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   While Modano would push his goal total to 20 on the season and
Hull would pick up his team-leading 24th, the loudest cheer was
reserved for Severyn. The tough guy, who typically has to fight to
get into the lineup, blasted in a rebound for his first goal as a
Stars player.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the game was out of reach. The Stars were beating the
Blackhawks to loose pucks, keeping them away from goalie Ed Belfour
(who pushed his record to 25-9-6 and lowered the Stars'
league-leading goals-against average to 1.98) and delivered the
kind of performance Hitchcock has been seeking.
</P>
<P>
   All four lines played well, with the Nieuwendyk line providing
energy, the Modano line providing scoring and lines led by Tony
Hrkac and Dave Reid providing consistent pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, nobody looked tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a team with controlled emotions and it takes us a little
time to get revved up,'' Hitchcock said of the Stars' current
string of playing every other night. ``That's why I feel confident
in the playoffs we'll be a good team, because you're playing every
other night then.''

UNITED BID FOR AMWEST COULD TAKE YEARS TO COMPLETE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAX JARMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A reported cash offer by United Airlines to buy America West
Airlines could be the first step in a process that could take years
to complete, analysts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The offer is said to be contingent on certain prior union
approvals, a hurdle experts say could be challenging, at best.
</P>
<P>
   And, beyond the union approval, there is a likely antitrust
challenge from the Justice Department and an issue of Continental
Airline's first right of refusal to purchase a majority of America
West voting stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard feeling is that this is just the beginning. There
are legal hurdles, board hurdles, competitive hurdles and
regulatory hurdles, before this can be consummated,'' said Bill
McGlashen, president of the local flight attendant's union in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   News of United's offer appeared Friday in the ``Wall Street
Journal,'' but the story did not name a price and attributed much
of the information to ``people familiar to the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both airlines would neither confirm the offer
nor comment on the development. On Jan. 20, the airlines
acknowledged that they were engaged in conversations involving a
possible merger.
</P>
<P>
   America West Chairman Bill Franke was said to be huddling Friday
with Doug Parker, the chief financial officer, and several board
members, although details of the meeting were not available. The
company reportedly has two weeks to respond to the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the price of America West was up 2 3/4, or 13.8
percent on Friday. The stock closed at 22 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   James Higgins, an analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,
speculated in a report Friday that a per-share price in the mid
$20s appeared reasonable for America West, although he acknowledged
a bid near $30 might be possible. America West has about 40 million
shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's closing price, the transaction would be worth about
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts doubt whether the deal can be put together at all.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins drew attention to the significant hurdles facing a
possible transaction and concluded, ``Not only would a merger with
America West be costly and dilutive, but it may not leave
the &UR; acquirer any better off strategically than if nothing had
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison Walton, a representative for the United Airline Pilots
Association, which represents about 9,600 United pilots, said the
union had no knowledge of any offer, nor had it been able to
confirm its validity. However, he said he ``assumed'' it was true.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; He said the &UR; company has assured the union that any deal would
be contingent on any labor issues being resolved beforehand. While
he &UR; acknowledged that the union has no such official bargaining
position in its contract, he was confident the company would abide
by its word.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employees are the major stockholders of the airline and
the pilots hold an important position,'' Walton said.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, Airline Pilots Association spokeswoman Yvette
Freeman also said the union had no advance knowledge of any offer
and also had been unable to confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots union adheres to a strict seniority system. Both
Freeman and Walton agreed that any deal &UR; would have to include
merging the seniority lists at the two master &UR; executive councils,
or union locals, to the satisfaction of the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would want to make sure our pilots would not be adversely
affected by the joining of the two lists,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots for both America West and United Airlines are represented
by the Airline Pilots Association, albeit they each have their own
master executive councils.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants at both airlines also share the same
union, the Association of Flight Attendants. Jeff Zack, a spokesman
for the union in Washington, D.C., acknowledged that seniority
would be an issue in putting the groups together, but added that he
thought any differences could be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can get along and do what needs to be done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Zack said any deal would have no effect on the status of the
flight attendants' contract negotiations in Phoenix. The union
represents about 2,400 America West flight attendants and is in the
middle of an impasse in contract negotiations with the company.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-day cooling-off period expires March 19. The union said it
will go on strike sometime after that, if no agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to keep bargaining,'' he said. ``Once they start
talking, these mergers can take years. Our members need a contract
they can live with during that period.''
</P>
<P>
   While the same union represents the flight attendants at both
airlines, &UR; there are vast differences in the pay and benefits
between the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is better at United, the pay and the work rules,''
Zack said. He noted that American West flight attendants earn
between $15,000 and $22,000 and at United they earn $18,000 to
$46,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also taken by surprise by the offer, according to a story from
the Bloomberg news service, was investor David Bonderman. His TPG
Partners Ltd. own a bock of Class A Shares that carries 49 percent
of the voting rights for America West. Bonderman helped bail the
airline out of its financial problems in the early 1990s and is now
looking for an exit strategy.
</P>
<P>
   It has largely been Bonderman's interest in selling what amounts
to a controlling stake in America West that has prompted the
takeover talks.
</P>
<P>
   While Bonderman's stake is thought be worth about $50 million, a
stipulation in the financing agreement dictates that any buyer must
also acquire the rest of the airline.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Muddying the waters is the fact that Continental Airlines holds
a &UR; first right of refusal to buy Bonderman's stock, should a firm
offer materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Messing, a spokesman for Continental Airlines in Houston,
said that company would ``do whatever is in the best interest of
its employees and stockholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Continental earlier expressed an interest in acquiring America
West, but said last week it would not pursue such an action. Delta
Airlines, which is said to have looked closely at a possible deal,
took itself out of the running earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   But while Continental said it is not pursuing a formal bid, at
least one source said it could jump into the fray if America West
were to accept an offer from United. Such an action could spark a
bidding war.
</P>
<P>
   A final factor is possible antitrust violations. A merger of
America West and United would give the new entity more than 40
percent of the domestic market west of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly suspect the Department of Justice would take
exception to such a concentration,'' Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   One way to get around the potential labor problems and possible
Justice Department challenge would be to operate America West as an
autonomous subsidiary instead of absorbing it.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say such a scenario would be easier if Continental were
the buyer and not United. They said United's union may require
pilots of a subsidiary to be merged into their seniority roster.  &QL;

RUSTY WALLACE RETHINKS PIT DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKINGHAM, N.C. _ NASCAR Winston Cup star Rusty Wallace says
that if he had it to do over, he would do it over and pit for four
tires and fuel in the waning stages of the season-opening Daytona
500.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had new tires ... I could have made more aggressive
moves,'' Wallace said as rain washed out the first round of
qualifying for tomorrow's Dura-Lube/Kmart 400 at the North Carolina
Speedway. ``And the fuel in the back \Rof his Ford Taurus\S would
have kept the car running lower. So, if you're asking me would I
change my strategy again now looking back, yeah _ I would have
pitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at that particular point it wasn't even a consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and crew chief Robin Pemberton have been second-guessed
since Sunday for their decision to retain track position when the
race's fourth and final caution flew on lap 174 at the 2.5-mile
Daytona International Speedway. Wallace and Penske-Kranefuss
teammate Jeremy Mayfield eschewed pit stops while running first and
third, respectively. Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt _ who finished
first and second _ led a group of drivers who opted for four fresh
tires and fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who led a race-high 104 laps, eventually was shuffled
out of the draft after the restart on lap 179 and finished eighth.
Mayfield cut a tire on lap 192 and finished 20th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daytona is behind us. It's over with,'' said Mayfield, who led
both practices yesterday on the 1.017-mile oval and posted the top
hot lap at 156.965 mph. ``All we can say is we shoulda, woulda or
coulda.''
CUP SCHEDULE REVISED
</P>
<P>
   Cup teams were scheduled to run two laps yesterday to determine
the top 25 starters for tomorrow's race. But rain washed out the
session in mid-afternoon, and NASCAR has rescheduled qualifying for
all 43 positions today. Teams are scheduled for a 45-minute
practice this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Single-lap qualifying is booked for 9:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   If that session is rained out, the order will be set by
car-owner points from last season for the first 30 spots. The
remainder of the 43-car field will be filled by postmark on the
official entry blank.
</P>
<P>
   The final 1998 owner points were led by Rick Hendrick (5,328)
and Jack Roush (4,964). That means if Cup qualifying is rained out
today, reigning series champion Gordon will claim the pole (for the
second consecutive race) and Mark Martin will start No. 2.
BUSCH LINEUP SET
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR had hoped to squeeze in qualifying for today's Alltell
200 Busch Grand National Series race late yesterday, but the rain
persisted and forced officials to set the lineup by car-owner
points from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Reigning BGN series champion Dale Earnhardt Jr. will start from
the pole and be joined in the front row by 1998 points runner-up
and defending race champion Matt Kenseth. The first 33 positions
were filled via owner's points. The 34th spot was awarded to Cup
regular Johnny Benson on a past BGN champion's provisional, with
positions 35-43 determined via entry postmark. Texan Bobby Hillin
Jr. will start 27th based upon points.
</P>
<P>
   The list of 14 drivers who missed the race was topped by rookie
Adam Petty, who finished sixth in the season-opening NAPA Auto
Parts 300 at Daytona. But his new team, owned by father Kyle, has
no car-owner points to fall back on.
JARRETT BACKS IRWIN
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett says teammate Kenny Irwin Jr.'s third-place finish
in the Daytona 500 has been overshadowed by the 12-car pileup Irwin
inadvertently touched off on lap 135.
</P>
<P>
   And Jarrett, whose car actually triggered the crash in Turn 3
after it was nudged by Irwin from behind, said that is not right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing about the whole situation is Kenny is not
getting to enjoy his best run as a Winston Cup driver,'' said
Jarrett, who is Irwin's stablemate at Robert Yates Racing. ``He did
a tremendous job and put himself in a position to win the Daytona
500, and people aren't letting him enjoy that. He's having to
answer questions about whether or not he hit his teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did touch. Yes, that did happen. But it was racing and it's
as much as my fault as anybody's. I put myself in a position for
something like that to happen.''

SELE, HELLING NOT RANGERS' STAFF ANCHORS ... YET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The Rangers' failure to land Roger
Clemens or Randy Johnson has them still searching for that elusive
No. 1 starter.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Kevin Appier ends up being the answer, the burden will
fall on Rick Helling or Aaron Sele. That might not be a bad
alternative, especially because it doesn't involve the completely
insane idea of trading away outfielder Ruben Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Helling and Sele aren't considered true No. 1 starters on
anybody's list, but consider their credentials from last season.
</P>
<P>
   Helling won 20 games, which is usually a prerequisite for being
a No. 1 starter. He was also 5-0 with a 2.76 earned-run average in
September at the height of the pennant race, including a huge
victory at Anaheim in the final week.
</P>
<P>
   Sele won 19 games and was selected to the American League
All-Star team. He also was superb in the pennant race, going 3-1
with a 2.40 ERA in September.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important was a Sunday afternoon in May against the
Cleveland Indians. The Rangers had lost two consecutive at Jacobs
Field before Sele took the mound and held the Indians scoreless
through eight innings in a 1-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, at least, he showed the grit of a No. 1 starter.
</P>
<P>
   But one game or one All-Star selection _ as Roger Pavlik proved
_ does not put a pitcher in the same league with Clemens or
Johnson. If Helling and Sele were, then the Rangers wouldn't have
had to trade for Todd Stottlemyre midway through last season.
</P>
<P>
   It does, however, give the Rangers reason to hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing a Clemens does or a Johnson is he gives you a
track record,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``Helling and
Sele don't have the track record, but who's to say they won't win
39 games again this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were a betting man, who would you say would win more
games this year, Clemens or Helling? Obviously you'd say Clemens
because he's done it so many more times. But who knows? Ten years
from now, Rick Helling may be looked at as a No. 1 starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling and Sele had considerable help last season. The Rangers
scored 6.7 runs per nine innings when Sele pitched and 6.1 for
Helling, the fourth- and fifth-best run support for any American
League pitcher. That kind of offense played a big part in those 39
victories, and No. 1 starters must have better than the 4.41 ERA
that Helling finished with or Sele's 4.23 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to be considered up there with guys like
Clemens and Johnson,'' Helling said. ``I've had just one year in
the big leagues as a consistent starter. I'd have to do what I did
last year for four or five years to be considered that caliber.''
</P>
<P>
   A pitcher still has to start somewhere, and last season was
Helling's first full season as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux was 6-14 with a 5.61 ERA in his first full season,
and Johnson was 7-13 with a 4.82 ERA. Tom Glavine went 7-17 with a
4.56 ERA for the Braves in 1988. Curt Schilling was a middle
reliever his first two seasons in the big leagues, and the Rangers
know better than anybody it took Kevin Brown several seasons before
emerging as the big-time ace he's considered today.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of No. 1 starters are Cy Young-type of candidates, and
you just don't think about Helling and Sele like that at this stage
of their careers,'' Melvin said. ``But I think that through
consistency, they're young enough to where they could establish
themselves like that.''

HOST CITY'S OFFICIALS NO-SHOWS AT FILM LOCATION CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- So where was L.A.?
</P>
<P>
   Beneath a plethora of glad-handing and giveaways at the
Locations '99 trade show at the Los Angeles Convention Center,
California and Canada battled Friday for billions of dollars doled
out by Hollywood producers.
</P>
<P>
   But the city and county of Los Angeles, which saw off-lot
production activity drop 4.2 percent last year, were MIA.
</P>
<P>
   California's film commissions weren't missing: Various state
agencies and commissions took up 15 percent of the 330 booths at
the trade show. Still, the state's largest city and nation's
largest county weren't among them, and Patti Stolkin Archuletta,
director of the California Film Commission, said she was baffled
over Los Angeles' no-show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Los Angeles not having a presence here sends the
message that it isn't worried about runaway production,'' she
added. ``The rest of the state is here in full force, which means
that producers may choose to go to Imperial County, San Diego or
Ventura County instead. It also shows that Los Angeles isn't the
only place people think of when they think of California.''
</P>
<P>
   Not true, said Cody Cluff, chief of the Entertainment Industry
Development Corp., which handles off-lot production permits in the
city and county of Los Angeles. Cluff said the EIDC didn't put up a
booth for the second consecutive year because, frankly, it's too
much money for too few top Hollywood executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``After attending for four or five years, we found the
convention was not a cost-effective way for us to market the
city,'' said Cluff, who did attend Friday's opening. ``The
decision-makers are all in our back yard and we meet with them on a
regular basis. It doesn't do me any good to spend $30,000 on a
booth when none of the people we need to contact are going to come
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over L.A.'s role in Locations '99 comes amid several
alarming signs for entertainment production in California. Among
the trends that have industry officials concerned:
</P>
<P>
   -- A 4.2 percent decline in off-lot production last year in Los
Angeles County. Cluff predicts 1999 is likely to remain at the same
level as 1998 partly because studios are spending less money on
major features.
</P>
<P>
   -- A 20 percent decline in starts on feature films last year in

<P>
   -- The loss of 11,500 acting jobs from California to Canada last
year.
</P>
<P>
   -- A 28 percent increase in production activity last year in
British Columbia. Its total of $808 million (Canadian currency) in
economic impact makes the province the world's third-largest
production center after Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, which has been aggressive in luring production by
touting tax breaks, rebates and lower costs, ha &UR; d &LR;  two dozen booths

<P>
   ``Film commissioners come here because they need to keep track
of what Canada and the rest of the world is doing,'' said
Archuletta, who is leaving her post with the California Film
Commission next week for a film marketing job. ``It reminds me of
the saying, Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Cluff said Locations '99 represents a good opportunity for film
commissioners from outside Los Angeles to contact Hollywood
executives. ``I don't want to bad-mouth the show,'' he added. ``But
we can spend our resources in more effective ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp., said the nonpresence of Los Angeles at the event
was understandable due to the EIDC's limited budget. On some days,
the agency has to track more than 200 separate production crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of puzzling that the EIDC wouldn't show up because
you do have a concern over the erosion of film production but they
have a lot of other things going on,'' Kyser said. ``We have to
understand that they have limited resources.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The bottom line for many at the three-day show, which runs
through Sunday but is open only to trade and media, is schmoozing
with studio executives, scouts and production managers who make the
critical decisions on where to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm down here four or five times each year because I have to
keep making the rounds,'' said Carole Vivier, head of the Manitoba
Film Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Canada currently offers an 11 percent rebate on labor costs to
producers but several provinces have sweetened that deal
considerably. In late 1997, Manitoba became the first province with
a 35 percent rebate on the costs of local labor; Saskatchewan, Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick also have instituted similar rebates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the rebate approved was not a tough sell,'' said
Vivier, who saw production activity more than triple during the
fiscal year ending March 31 to about $55 million. ``There's a lot
of support because of the job-creation aspects of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivier said she expects Manitoba's production activity to nearly
double in the fiscal year beginning April 1 and hit $100 million as
the province gains prominence in the entertainment world. Besides
the rebate, she noted, other attractions include the favorable
exchange rate and lower costs of wages, goods and accommodations.

   As for British Columbia, where the combined rebate is 21
percent, film commissioner Peter Mitchell predicted this year's
activity will match 1998's, which represented a 28 percent
increase. The province is attracting a broader selection than its
usual array of low-budget movies of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting a lot of feature films shot in Vancouver,''
said Mitchell, citing ``Detox,'' ``Reindeer Games'' and ``Romeo
Must Die.'' ``We're getting heavy-duty projects.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The prospect of more entertainment productions leaving
California prompted two legislators _ Assemblyman Scott Wildman,
D-Glendale, and Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl, D-Encino _ to recently
propose laws to stop runaway production. Wildman's bill calls for a
10 percent tax credit on labor taxes for California projects;
Kuehl's bills create tax incentives for productions costing under
$5 million and ease restrictions on set-building in coastal zones.
</P>
<P>
   Wildman said he has received massive support from Hollywood
labor unions and production companies. ``The idea is that the labor
and income generated by jobs we won't lose will be replaced by
people spending money,'' he added. ``The bill is essentially
revenue-neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Archuletta predicted a toned-down version of Wildman's bill
could pass. ``It's the first time in a decade that the door to this
idea has cracked open,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Canada was not the only place seeking to steal Hollywood's bread
and butter. The state of Oklahoma, for example, was touting its
3-year-old program of offering producers a complete rebate of any
sales tax incurred during production.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a `no questions asked' program,'' said Bud Elder,
assistant director of the state's film commission. ``They just send
in their receipts.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma, which generated $22 million in production last year,
also brought out Will Rogers impersonator Gene McFall, who lured
passers-by with rope tricks and comic patter. ``Gene came out here
on his own dime, which just shows how cooperative we are in
Oklahoma,'' Elder said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign commissions also used a variety of come-ons with

HOST CITY'S OFFICIALS NO-SHOWS AT FILM LOCATION CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- So where was L.A.?
</P>
<P>
   Beneath a plethora of glad-handing and giveaways at the
Locations '99 trade show at the Los Angeles Convention Center,
California and Canada battled Friday for billions of dollars doled
out by Hollywood producers.
</P>
<P>
   But the city and county of Los Angeles, which saw off-lot
production activity drop 4.2 percent last year, were MIA.
</P>
<P>
   California's film commissions weren't missing: Various state
agencies and commissions took up 15 percent of the 330 booths at
the trade show. Still, the state's largest city and nation's
largest county weren't among them, and Patti Stolkin Archuletta,
director of the California Film Commission, said she was baffled
over Los Angeles' no-show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Los Angeles not having a presence here sends the
message that it isn't worried about runaway production,'' she
added. ``The rest of the state is here in full force, which means
that producers may choose to go to Imperial County, San Diego or
Ventura County instead. It also shows that Los Angeles isn't the
only place people think of when they think of California.''
</P>
<P>
   Not true, said Cody Cluff, chief of the Entertainment Industry
Development Corp., which handles off-lot production permits in the
city and county of Los Angeles. Cluff said the EIDC didn't put up a
booth for the second consecutive year because, frankly, it's too
much money for too few top Hollywood executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``After attending for four or five years, we found the
convention was not a cost-effective way for us to market the
city,'' said Cluff, who did attend Friday's opening. ``The
decision-makers are all in our back yard and we meet with them on a
regular basis. It doesn't do me any good to spend $30,000 on a
booth when none of the people we need to contact are going to come
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over L.A.'s role in Locations '99 comes amid several
alarming signs for entertainment production in California. Among
the trends that have industry officials concerned:
</P>
<P>
   -- A 4.2 percent decline in off-lot production last year in Los
Angeles County. Cluff predicts 1999 is likely to remain at the same
level as 1998 partly because studios are spending less money on
major features.
</P>
<P>
   -- A 20 percent decline in starts on feature films last year in
California.
</P>
<P>
   -- The loss of 11,500 acting jobs from California to Canada last
year.
</P>
<P>
   -- A 28 percent increase in production activity last year in
British Columbia. Its total of $808 million (Canadian currency) in
economic impact makes the province the world's third-largest
production center after Los Angeles and New York.

IT CAN'T GET ANY SWEDER THAN THIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You expect Sweden's sports stars to have names
like Bjorn and Ingemar and Gustav and Gunnar and cavort on courts
and slopes and ice and pools. The last thing you would figure on is
this icebox of a country producing a professional golfer _ or a few
dozen.
</P>
<P>
   And yet this Scandinavian country of 8.8 million keeps
manufacturing them, one after another, as efficiently as a deluxe
freezer does ice cubes. Robert Karlsson is the latest Swede to come
to the U.S. and defrost his game.
</P>
<P>
   He followed a first round of 71 with a 5-under-par 66 Friday to
almost certainly cinch his biggest payday in six PGA Tour starts.
Unless he's buried by an avalanche of bogeys over the weekend,
Karlsson will surpass the $5,750 he earned for finishing in a tie
for 65th at last year's PGA Championship outside of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   A greenskeeper's son, Karlsson is one of 11 players looming four
shots behind Bob Estes. By all accounts, Karlsson should have
keeled over from jet lag by now. Since the start of the year he has
traveled from Florida to California to Great Britain to Thailand to
Australia to Malaysia to the United Arab Emirates to Hong Kong and
back to California.
</P>
<P>
   Karlsson, an esteemed member of the European PGA Tour, is
chasing the fame and fortune that his compatriots Jesper Parnevik,
Annika Sorenstam, Liselotte Neumann, Catrin Nilsmark and Helen
Alfredsson already have cornered. Or were you so flummoxed by
Dennis Rodman's ongoing flirtation with the Lakers you failed to
notice that Swedes finished first, second, third and sixth at the
LPGA event in Glendale last week?
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, Gabriel Hjertstedt is widely credited with
becoming the first Swede to notch a PGA Tour win, at the 1997 B.C.
Open. While it's true Hjertstedt was born in Sweden, he moved to
Australia when he was 11 and took up golf after that. Which leaves
Parnevik, the winner of the 1998 Phoenix Open, as the true pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, had he remained in his birthplace of Umea, Hjertstedt,
27, said Friday he doubted he would have become a golfer. It's
understandable. Why would he have wanted to embrace a game that was
about as popular among kids back then as cooties?
</P>
<P>
   When Karlsson took up the game as a youngster in the late 1970s
after dabbling in soccer, ``I was looked at funny,'' he said.
``People said, `Why would you want to do that?' It was like you
weren't really an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   His own father, Bjorn, tends the greens of the Katrineholm
course where Karlsson honed his game, but the father has never
putted on them. Bjorn is not a golfer. Never was, Karlsson said. He
was, rather, a car mechanic who decided a change of scenery would
do him and his family good.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Karlsson came to the game. If a soccer pitch had been
his backyard and not a golf course, he probably would have tried to
follow in the cleats of Gustav Wetterstrim, who once scored four
goals in an 8-0 World Cup win over Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Karlsson forged his own path. When he was 16, he joined
the Swedish national team, which enjoys the kind of corporate
support lavished on colleges and pro leagues here, and the world
became one endless fairway. At 19 he turned pro and he has been
bouncing around Europe ever since.
</P>
<P>
   NHL stars Peter Forsberg and Mats Sundin, former Olympic and
World Cup skiing great Ingemar Stenmark and Olympic speedskating
champions such as Tomas Gustafson continue to hold the Swedish
sporting public in sway.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the success of Parnevik and Sorenstam and Co.,
golfing is gaining popularity. Pia Nilsson, the first Swede to
attend a U.S. college on a golf scholarship, has played no small
role in the transformation of the sport from its geek stature some
20 years ago to its cachet of cool today. Under her direction, the
Swedish junior golf program has become just about the hippest club
around.
</P>
<P>
   You can't help but marvel at the results. A country with 250,000
golfers and some 300 golf courses has more players on the European
PGA Tour than any country save England, Karlsson said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Sorenstam, Alfredsson, Neumann and Nilsmark, who
have 33 LPGA victories (including four majors) among them. Their
success has fueled the popular perception that the Swedish women
are a few strides ahead of their male counterparts. (Scandinavian
Airlines last year fueled the debate by sponsoring a showdown of
the sexes, a sort of Bobby Riggs-Billie Jean King for the 1990s.
The match between the two threesomes ended in a draw, Karlsson
said).
</P>
<P>
   If the women appear to be outperforming the men, it could be
that there's more reason for the women to commit to playing a full
schedule in the U.S. than the men. The men's European Tour is more
established than the women's equivalent, the result being that
Swedes such as Karlsson are able to make a comfortable living and
keep improving their games _ ``the most important thing,'' Karlsson
stressed _ without leaving the continent.
</P>
<P>
   The women, as Karlsson explained it, ``are sort of forced to
come here,'' so considerable is the difference in the competition
and the cash prizes in Europe and in the U.S. Too, it helps that
the LPGA Tour includes events in Japan, Australia and England,
whereas the PGA Tour is confined to these shores.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, one thing is as clear as all those Scandinavian
complexions: The Swedes no longer are content to follow, they're
out to take the lead.

THE LATER THE BETTER FOR ESTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just when it started getting crowded atop the
Nissan Open leaderboard, Bob Estes passed the pack.
</P>
<P>
   A first-round co-leader with David Duval at 5-under-par 66,
afternoon starter Estes was toiling on the course Friday as first
Ernie Els (66), then qualifier Alan Bratton (67), Rick Fehr (66)
and Davis Love III (65) moved to the front of the field at 8-under
134.
</P>
<P>
   Estes zipped past all of them with two birdies on his final six
holes to finish with a 66 at the par-71, 6,953-yard Riviera Country
Club. His midway total of 133 left the former University of Texas
star clear of the field but hardly in command of his hot-shooting
pursuers, who included 41 second-round scores in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing I've got a short game,'' said Estes, who
scrambled to save par four times after missing greens. ``But that's
what I do best.''
</P>
<P>
   He called his five-birdie round of 67 more solid than stellar,
especially after he recorded seven birdies in the opening round.
But workmanlike is the name of the game for Estes these days as he
tries to upgrade his wood play to the level of his greenside
brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   His second straight blue-collar effort left Estes leading many
of the world's most notable golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Defending Nissan champ Billy Mayfair, the 1995 Tour Championship
winner, was tied with Kirk Triplett and Greg Chalmers at 136. Tiger
Woods and Duval _ ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the world _ were in an
11-way tie at 137. Two-time PGA champion Nick Price was deadlocked
with seven others at 138. And past major winners Steve Jones, Mark
Brooks, Fred Couples and Bob Tway were at 139, part of a 12-man tie
that included former Cal State Northridge star Bob Burns.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors' 1990 NCAA Division II champion joined that select
company with a flourish, knocking his tee shot into the cup for a
hole-in-one on the 155-yard 16th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see it,'' said the 1998 Nike Tour champion and money
leader. ``(The crowd) gave a roar and a sign that it went in. I hit
a six-iron into the wind. It's really about the only thing that
went in today. I didn't have a lot of luck on the greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns' luckless play on the greens concluded with a double-bogey
on No. 18, but he made the cut by three strokes and will have a
favorable early tee time today (8:37 a.m.) to punctuate a happy
homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, who grew up barely 20 miles from Rivera, is playing in
his first Nissan since losing his PGA Tour card at the end of the
1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   Bratton is another who can appreciate playing in the big time.
The 1994 college Player of the Year at Oklahoma State, he has
labored four years in golf's minor leagues, playing on mini-tours
and failing PGA Tour qualifying school three times before finally
passing in November.
</P>
<P>
   But Bratton isn't exempt for every event, and he puts in his
share of playing in qualifying tournaments, as he did Tuesday at
Los Serranos North, where he shot 6-under par 66 then won a playoff
in gathering darkness for the final Nissan berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I always wanted to do,'' Bratton said after
rolling in five more birdies Friday. ``I felt like I could play
with the guys out here. I was going to keep trying until I made
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Els, the 29-year-old South African who has already won two U.S.
Opens, continued his solid play in his first PGA Tour event of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to playing the weekend,'' he said after
rolling in seven birdies. ``It's always nice to play well at
Riviera.''

   Brad Fabel, looking for his first victory in his 15th year on
tour, got into position at 137 with a 7-under-par 64 that was the
best round of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove the ball well today and that's the key to this
course,''he said. ``The fairways are so good you can do what you
want to the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval and Woods, the marquee names in a tournament filled with
exceptional talent, remained in contention to make weekend pushes
that have become expected. Woods included three birdies in a
bogeyless round of 68, while Duval shot 71.
</P>
<P>
   Estes, for sure, was aware of their presence, as well as the
potential for many others to close fast in a field spiced by the
proximity to next week's World Match Play Championships at La
Costa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can be leading after 36 holes, but even leading after 54
holes is not that much,'' he said. ``We all remember what Duval did
at the Hope (a final-round 59 to win from seven strokes off the
pace).''
</P>
<P>
   Woods demonstrated similar late fire last week with a
third-round 62 that brought him from back in the pack to win the
Buick Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Estes didn't think a 59 was probable at Riviera but said, ``I
think a 62 or 63 is reasonable.''

RODMAN ACTS RODMAN-LIKE ON TV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Dennis Rodman spent 30 minutes on national
television Friday but offered more insight into his sex life than
into his career intentions, or the status of his negotiations with
the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, wife Carmen Electra sometimes calls him
``Daddy,'' and Rodman enjoys having sexual relations with her very
much. As for playing for the Lakers, it's still anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview on ESPN, Rodman said he's ``nowhere near close
to signing with the Lakers,'' yet called the opportunity ``a match
made in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing black sunglasses, a floppy, blue-and-green floral tam
and piercings in his ears, both nostrils and his lower lip, Rodman
said he would make an announcement Monday morning. He has called a
press conference for Monday in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson, for one, is sick of waiting. In a break from the
team's party line, Johnson ripped Rodman and said the Lakers should
cease attempts to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of this. I am,'' Johnson, a Lakers vice president
and part owner, said on Thursday's David Letterman show. ``It's
like a circus now. We are a first-class organization. We do things
the right way, and right now, he's like trying to hold us hostage.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``He's driving me crazy because he's hurting the team, he's
hurting the organization, so I would love us just to say forget
it.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove Johnson's point, Rodman spent Friday's interview
ducking questions about his intentions, said he's still interested
in signing with the Miami Heat as well and contradicted himself
several times. He said the decision wasn't about money, then railed
against the NBA's new labor agreement, which limits the Lakers to
paying him just $12,195 per game _ millions less than he's earned
the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't about Dennis Rodman trying to be greedy, its not
about that,'' he said. ``They've put me in a bind where I can't do
anything but make the minimum. . . . I'm the most popular and most
recognized individual aside from Michael Jordan in the world today,
and I can't get but (the minimum). I think that's unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, who has advocated signing the Worm, had no
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't have retired then. He should have forced a trade
(from the Bulls, who held his rights),'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers owner Jerry Buss personally invited Rodman to join the
Lakers about three weeks ago. Reports of Rodman joining the Lakers
began a week ago and Rodman himself was quoted Thursday saying he
would sign a deal by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's targeting Monday morning for a decision, saying he
needs the weekend to ``put my mind at ease and at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He also is aiming for more money, despite the Lakers'
constraints, and appeared to be lobbying the NBA for a special
salary-cap exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came to Michael Jordan, the league literally stood in
line . . . and everybody just kissed his (rear),'' Rodman said. ``.
. . So I should stick my (rear) out there and somebody can kiss my
(rear) now and say, `Great, Dennis, thanks for giving us all this
enjoyment.'. . . They should make an exception for Dennis Rodman.''
</P>
<P>
   He did offer praise for Buss, calling him ``a cool son of a
(gun). He is one of the coolest owners in the business today. . . .
He's proven time and time again that he's taken care of his players
and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman said Buss regrets not being able to pay him his market
value and according to Rodman, went so far as to say, ``If I was
you as a businessman, I would say don't play.''

OUT OF NOWHERE BUT GOING PLACES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Where did HE come from?
</P>
<P>
   When the morning's upstart co-leader is a pleasant, fresh-faced
young Texan named Alan Bratton, there is no short answer to that
question.
</P>
<P>
   He came from the Lone Star Tour.
</P>
<P>
   He came from the Nike Tour.
</P>
<P>
   He came from Singapore, Malasia, Indonesia, India, Japan, South
Korea, Thailand and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   After one winless but lucrative spin through the Asian Tour not
long ago, Bratton flew home with earnings of $17,000. That was the
good news.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news was that the Asian Tour paid its players in cash.
So Bratton got on the plane with 1,700 $100 bills strapped to his
nervous stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet I took it out and counted it 20 times,'' he said. ``It's
amazing I didn't get robbed.''
</P>
<P>
   The indignities pile up when you're a one-time College Player of
the Year who scratched and scrambled and swam professional golf's
backwaters before passing the PGA Tour qualifying school on the
fourth try.
</P>
<P>
   __ The announcer on the first tee at Riviera Country Club, home
of the Nissan Open this week, butchers your name as ``Brayton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've mispronounced it every week,'' said Bratton, who is
playing the fourth tournament of his rookie season. ``Last week I
think I was `Branton.' ''
</P>
<P>
   __ Your fellow members in the exclusive PGA Tour fraternity
wonder aloud who you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a `Hey you!' guy,'' said veteran Brad Fabel, who has
never met the 27-year-old. ``Does he have his (Tour) card?''
</P>
<P>
   __ And dismissive talk like that is your !ital!reward for
gritting your teeth for four rough years while amateur
contemporaries like Tiger Woods, David Duval, Justin Leonard and
Phil Mickelson made headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played against all those guys in college (Oklahoma State) _
and successfully,'' said Bratton's wife Gretchen, an eighth-grade
teacher in Fort Worth, Texas, who is using a week off to follow him
at Riviera. ``It's been kind of a hard rock to swallow for him to
not be out here.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's top college golfer in 1994, Bratton has won nothing
bigger than a couple of mini-tour events since then.
</P>
<P>
   He finished 19th in the PGA Tour qualifying tournament at La
Quinta in November, making him one of 35 to receive Tour cards.
</P>
<P>
   But after missing the cut in Hawaii, tying for 25th at Pebble
Beach and tying for 60th at Torrey Pines, he came to Riviera
without a guaranteed spot in the 144-man field. He had to beat a
16-year-old in a playoff in the near-dark in the Nissan qualifying
event in Chino Hills on Tuesday to secure the last entry.
</P>
<P>
   Getting back-to-back 67s at par-71 Riviera, good for a
second-place tie with two major-event winners, indicates he belongs
in the big leagues. Even if he's almost invisible in the
early-season Tour statistics, ranking 123rd overall, between
who-theys Mike Brisky and Barry Cheesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played well in college against these (PGA) guys,'' said
Bratton, son of a Texas A&AMP;M professor. ``I wasn't intimidated by
them.''
</P>
<P>
   So why did he fall behind the twentysomething Tour hotshots the
past few years?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew,'' he said good-naturedly, ``I guess I would've won
a major too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably lucky,'' he added quickly. ``If I had gotten my
card right away, I probably wouldn't have been as prepared as I am
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the Asian Tour meant packing his own American food,
28-hour plane trips and long bumper-to-bumper bus rides.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this week is a lot different in the traffic department,
since he and Gretchen are staying with his college roommate in
Orange County, forcing Bratton to get up at 5:30 a.m. to be sure of
making an 8:30 tee time.
</P>
<P>
   He began the breezy day in a five-way tie for third, a stroke
off the pace. Then, with the help of former Riviera caddy Jose
Luis, he sank birdie putts on four of the first six holes to put
``BRATTON'' at the top of the leader boards.
</P>
<P>
   Early-arriving fans followed the lanky player in the fresh
haircut and Gap clothing even though his first name remained a
mystery to most.
</P>
<P>
   At the eighth green, a woman groaned in disappointment when
Bratton's wedge shot landed 15 feet below the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Family? somebody asked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's just fun to see how well he's done,'' she said. ``I
really don't know who he is.''

NORTH TEXAS CLINCHES DIVISION TITLE ON DAY COACH'S FATHER DIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho _ North Texas pulled off the biggest victory of
coach Tina Slinker's career _ on maybe the worst day of her life.
UNT clinched the Big West Conference Eastern Division title with a
56-50 victory against defending champion Boise State. Slinker's
father had died earlier in the day; he had suffered a massive heart
attack in New Mexico earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not anything we could have done better for her,'' said
senior guard Teri Gunnels, who scored 10 points. ``When something
like that happens, you can't put it behind you. There was a lot of
emotion, and we just tried to turn the negative into a positive. ''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles (17-6, 9-2 in conference) overcame a sluggish start
and early rebounding dominance by the Broncos (13-11, 7-5) to win
their seventh consecutive game. UNT shot just 25 percent from the
field in the first half, but still took a four-point lead into the
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a pretty good spot,'' said junior Empress Drane,
who scored nine points _ including five in a row during a stretch
late in the game _ and grabbed eight rebounds. ``We weren't
shooting the ball, but we were still up. We just had to be patient
and put that behind us. That shows the character of our team that
we were able to pick it up in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   UNT had to pick it up without freshman Jalie Mitchell, who
scored 13 points but had to sit for an extended stretch in the
second half with four fouls. In her absence, Drane's five-point
sequence and a 3-pointer by Nicole Thomas helped UNT finally break
away.
</P>
<P>
   Boise State's biggest weapon was Crista Peterson, who came off
the bench to score a game-high 17 points. However, no other Broncos
player scored in double figures as UNT held Boise to 29 percent
shooting from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Slinker won't be with the team for tomorrow's game at Idaho, but
she said she felt obligated last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where he would have wanted me to be,'' Slinker said.
``And this team did the best thing they could have done for me
personally.''

<P>
   Video-games prop open a door in kids' brains, creating an
opening through which knowledge can march with almost no
resistance. Game-playing children absorb enormous amounts of
information and develop outlandishly high skill levels.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, virtually none of what they learn has any value
beyond the joystick and glowing screen.
</P>
<P>
   But medical researchers are also exploiting the magical power of
video games to convey useful information.
</P>
<P>
   Recent findings provide compelling evidence that the right games
can train kids with diabetes and asthma to keep their conditions
under control.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Stanford University Medical Center worked with
about 60 kids, aged 8 to 16, suffering from diabetes. The children
were given a video game to take home.
</P>
<P>
   Some got an ordinary game, such as ``Tetris''; the other half
took home a specially designed game, called ``Packy &AMP; Marlon,'' in
which two elephants try to survive on an outing by collecting food
in a simulated environment _ all the while remembering to check
their blood glucose and administer insulin to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Over the study's six-month period, the kids who
played ``Packy &AMP; Marlon'' needed 77 percent fewer urgent-care
visits to a doctor or emergency room than the kids who played the
placebo game.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers told kids in both groups to play their games as
much or as little as they wanted. The study reports that the
children spent about the same amount of time playing ``Packy &AMP;
Marlon'' _ about 1.5 hours a week _ as the control group devoted to
the noninstructional game.
</P>
<P>
   Another game from the same company that makes ``Packy &AMP; Marlon''
_ Mountain View, Calif.-based Click Health _ teaches asthma
sufferers the basics of how to keep breathing well.
</P>
<P>
   Year-long trials of ``Bronky the Bronchiasaurus'' are under way
with 200 asthmatic kids _ half in Oakland and half in rural
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bronky,'' players have to maneuver a dinosaur hero through
a standard-looking video-game-style world, picking up treasures and
stomping on enemies as the screen scrolls horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple-choice questions pop up on the screen, interrupting the
action by quizzing the player on tactics for avoiding asthma
``triggers'' and on the proper technique for measuring one's own
``peak flow.''
</P>
<P>
   After a wrong answer, the game directs the player to find Hazel,
a character who will reteach basic asthma-care techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Next up from Click Health will be an electronic pet, similar to
the wildly popular Tamagotchi, that will help teach kids with
cystic fibrosis how to keep their often fragile bones in the best
possible working condition.
</P>
<P>
   Another game could aid children with sickle-cell anemia, says
Click Health's founding chairman and CEO Alan Miller, who
previously founded two successful video-game companies, Activision
and Accolade.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of video games in teaching real-life skills to
children cuts both ways, says one new-media researcher. ``People
are always asking about the negative effects of video-game
violence,'' says Georgia Tech professor Amy Bruckman.
</P>
<P>
   Showing that Click Health's games can change kids' behavior for
the better also accentuates the concern that violent games are
equally effective at imparting their less benign lessons, Bruckman
says. &QL;

previously founded two successful video-game companies, Activision
and Accolade.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of video games in teaching real-life skills to
children cuts both ways, says one new-media researcher. ``People
are always asking about the negative effects of video-game
violence,'' says Georgia Tech professor Amy Bruckman.
</P>
<P>
   Showing that Click Health's games can change kids' behavior for
the better also accentuates the concern that violent games are
equally effective at imparting their less benign lessons, Bruckman
says. &QL;

SUNS GO UP IN SMOKE  
 FIRE MISSING IN SLOW-STARTING LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It was enough to make the NBA lockout look like the
good old days.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns and the Detroit Pistons played a version of basketball
Friday night that belonged back under lock and key.
</P>
<P>
   There were missed shots, errant passes and inconsistency at
almost every stage of Detroit's 101-93 victory. It's a problem
throughout the league, everybody in the NBA keeps saying.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is.
</P>
<P>
   But at America West Arena, it was definitely a problem for the
Suns, who managed to do almost everything other than issue a
drop-dead date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got outhustled, it's that simple,'' Suns Coach Danny Ainge
said after his club fell to 2-3 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Boil the game down to its first 15 minutes, and, yes, it was
simple in stark terms. The Pistons hit their first six attempts
from the floor and grabbed a 17-point lead before most of a late
arriving, capacity crowd of 19,023 settled into its seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest factor is the way they came out,'' Ainge said of
the Pistons, who snapped a five-game skid. ``They came out with
more urgency, more toughness, more energy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's anybody's guess as to why the Pistons seemed to have more
energy at tip-off. They arrived in the Valley in an apparent
decline. They lost their third game in three nights to Miami on
Wednesday night. But the loss came at home.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Suns won their third in three nights over San
Antonio. On the road.
</P>
<P>
   All the usual, tried and true signs pointed to two teams headed
in opposite directions. But nothing about post-lockout basketball
is usual, much less tried and true.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, not even Ainge, can get a fair reading on what his team
or any other will do next. Through nine games, it's been tough to
recognize the Suns from quarter to quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it looked as though the Pistons had delivered an early
knockout blow, Team Schizo suddenly revealed another side.
</P>
<P>
   Within 3:13, the Suns outscored the Pistons, 17-0, late in the
first half. They wiped out a 14-point deficit and led by three
during an explosive run that included two three-point goals by
Clifford Robinson, two by George McCloud, one by Jason Kidd and a
beautiful sequence that ended with a twisting, left-handed layup by
Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   A restless crowd was suddenly inflamed. But, as it turned out,
there was more smoke than fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns trailed by as many as four and never fewer than three
until midway in the fourth quarter, when the Pistons went on a 10-2
run that was capped by a slam from Bison Dele, an ex-University of
Arizona center formerly named Brian Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It was over. Detroit's bull market trampled the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you can spell harmony, you have to spell harm,'' Dele
said as he talked about a renewed sense of camaraderie in the
Detroit dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   Before you can understand that bit of Bison, you probably need
tea leaves. Nevertheless, the Suns understand harm after losing
their first game against an Eastern Conference team.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration was especially evident in the face of Rex
Chapman, who continues to search for some long-lost shooting
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Pistons, he was 3 for 10 from the floor. When he
missed, he would clench one hand into a fist and cast his eyes
toward the ceiling, as if pleading for help from a higher source.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his struggles, there has always been a moment when it
appears he is about to rediscover his touch. With 1:52 left, he
sank a three-pointer that drew the Suns within six. You could
almost hear the crowd murmur in unison:
</P>
<P>
   Finally.
</P>
<P>
   But the old game-saving jumper is still missing. In some ways,
Chapman's struggle sums up the Suns. There are a few brilliant
moments, but never enough of them to erase signs that the Suns
could be in for a mediocre season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned about Rex,'' Ainge said. ``In time, he'll be
back. But I can see the concern in his eyes, and that concerns
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapman was somewhat mystified by what Ainge meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got to continue playing and working at it without
much chance at practice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Concern? It's just another word. You can find it any old
dictionary. Chapman is looking for his shot, and for now, it is
buried in a well-read book that applied to a game before the
lockout. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has recently kept a bedside vigil in a hospital's
intensive-care unit (ICU) is likely to have been impressed by just
how much information is now gathered on a critically ill patient.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated monitors surround the bed, the electronic screens
spewing out a torrent of data.
</P>
<P>
   That information can be vital, particularly for those near
death. But it also poses a critical challenge for today's hurried
nurses and physicians: how to make sense of all that data.
</P>
<P>
   To help out, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania
Medical Center are testing a ``smart'' ICU technology that collects
and analyzes a patient's vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial-intelligence system produces a 3-D graph that
could make it easier for a clinician to quickly pick up any warning
signs.
</P>
<P>
   The smart ICU uses adapted off-the-shelf software for neural
networks and fuzzy logic that allows it to analyze several
measurements simultaneously, looking for dangerous trends; it can
also ``learn'' the patterns of a patient, including their ideal
vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not intended to replace a physician,'' says C. William
Hanson, section chief of anesthesia/critical care at the medical
center and developer of the technology. ``It's intended to act as
an intelligent assistant that's vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients in the ICU, says Hanson, are ``monitored for everything
we can monitor electronically, and there's very sophisticated
minute-by-minute information'' on everything from respiratory rates
to blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   But actual analysis of the data ``is, in reality, totally
unsophisticated,'' says Hanson. ``There's hidden information in a
lot of that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   By uncovering that information, the smart ICU will, if it works,
flag dangerous conditions soon after they develop.
</P>
<P>
   For example, says Hanson, blood accumulating around the heart
can be a serious problem for some patients, but it's often not
noticed until the individual's blood pressure significantly falls.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are early warning signs, including a series of
interrelated, predicting signals, such as a drop in blood pressure
and an increase in heart rate.
</P>
<P>
   While a ``really good clinician'' would likely notice those
indicators, says Hanson, that ``presupposes that there's a really
good, experienced clinician _ and that they're at the bedside.''
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary real-life tests of the system are under way. Hanson
notes that the medical center's ICU is already installing a PC at
every bedside that will collect information from the monitors and
act as an electronic spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the world of information technology, that's a fairly
trivial thing to do,'' says Hanson. ``There are a lot more
interesting things the PCs can do. There's still a lot of
smartening up that can go on in the ICU.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's busy hospitals, a more intelligent ICU can only be a
good idea. &QL;

<P>
   At a symposium at the Boston University (BU) Photonics Center
last fall, the attendees broke for coffee as usual. But something
was amiss.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of professors munching cookies and chatting about the
latest research, men in suits stood facing blank walls, whispering
into cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   They are high-powered investors, but they're not from Silicon
Valley _ they're from the research center's ninth floor.
</P>
<P>
   Better toss out the old stereotypes about academia and get with
the latest rage _ ivory tower goes venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding to spin off more technologies, boost local economies,
and just plain make money, many research institutions and
universities are creating their own venture capital funds.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital has traditionally been the domain of private,
deep-pocketed investors hoping to earn a windfall, often by picking
off promising university research. Most of the action has centered
around big-name schools, such as MIT and Stanford University,
located near East Coast and West Coast hubs of venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   But now an increasing number of universities around the country
want their piece of the pie _ and are willing to do what it takes
to get it.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example is BU's Photonics Venture Partners. The fund
is privately managed, but the university is both an investor and a
manager _ one of the firm's three generals partners is Donald
Fraser, also the Photonics Center's director.
</P>
<P>
   Working cheek-by-jowl with BU researchers studying blue lasers
and quantum communication, the venture capitalists plan to leverage
the center's technical acumen to invest in the rapidly growing
field of photonics.
</P>
<P>
   No two of the university funds turned up by a ``Technology
Review'' survey are exactly alike. Some are wholly-owned
subsidiaries, others are independent firms awarded preferential
rights to an institution's technology.
</P>
<P>
   They also have varying aims. At BU, the strategy is to invest in
any photonics company likely to return a profit.
</P>
<P>
   At Vanderbilt University, on the other hand, administrators have
christened a $10 million fund that will invest in companies built
around the school's technology.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Steranka, Vanderbilt's director of technology licensing,
says the main reason for the do-it-yourself funds ``is that many
promising university inventions are simply too early-stage and too
risky to interest mainstream venture capitalists.''
</P>
<P>
   But based on a study of schools that have previously tried
venture funds, Josh Lerner, a professor at Harvard Business School,
thinks university administrators often have unrealistic
expectations for financial success.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner thinks they also underestimate the challenge of combining
the quick-to-move venture culture with rule-bound academia. ``It's
very hard to marry these organizational forms,'' says Lerner. &QL;

KANSAS COACH-PIONEER EARNS RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Kansas coach Marian Washington ran practice at
the same time every day. At the same time, construction crews would
turn on their jackhammers and saws to continue refurbishing Allen
Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   After each practice, Washington went home and stewed. What was
it going to take to earn respect?
</P>
<P>
   It was going to take the same thing Washington has done
throughout her career: fight. Fight for what she believes in, for
change, for what she knows is right. And fight to let people know
that she cares.
</P>
<P>
   This was not something new for the woman who took over a
go-nowhere Kansas team in 1973, the same woman who earned $15,000
to be women's director of athletics, coach basketball and founded
the track and field team in 1974. This was the same person who
helped put Lynette Woodard on the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do care about people and I work hard to see the best in
everybody,'' said Washington, one of the pioneers in women's sports
in the 1970s. ``I wanted people to respect and appreciate women in
sports. I learned some time later the attitudes won't change, and
there were some years I was so tired and sick of it only those
close to me knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six years later and one win away from career victory No.
500, it has paid off. She has made an impact in her world. Women's
salaries, academic resources and facilities are equitable. For
years, Washington was at the forefront of those fights.
</P>
<P>
   And for a long time, there were people in her own athletic
department who wished Washington would just take her tiny lot and
play happy with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you think about people who are willing to give back and
make a difference, Marian has done that,'' Tennessee coach Pat
Summitt said. ``I know from recruiting against her that kids like
and respect her, and I have a lot of respect for what she has done
throughout her career.''
</P>
<P>
   What's left for Washington is to enjoy this. Enjoy the plush
office. Enjoy the nice salary. Enjoy the wins and seven consecutive
NCAA Tournament appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would be here, and I can't help but not
think about it now because everyone else is,'' said Washington, who
will try for the milestone tonight against Oklahoma. ``This
embraces the efforts of a lot of players and coaches who have been
a part of my program that's kept me going. This isn't about
gloating, it's about being thankful.''
CULTURAL GAP CLOSING FOR REBELS' FROEHLICH
Nevada-Las Vegas' Linda Froehlich had more than a few adjustments
to make when she left her native Germany this summer and headed for
Elvis's Playground of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   There was the American culture, the difference is schools, the
difference in competition and the difference in basketballs,
literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball they use here is smaller,'' Froehlich said. ``In
Germany, we play with a men's basketball. There I play against
women; here I play against girls my age. It's all very different
and exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Froehlich adjusted quickly. She is the nation's sixth-leading
scorer, averaging 23 points and nine rebounds per game in her
freshman season with the Lady Rebels. She has led the team in
scoring 20 times this season and has been named the Western
Athletic Conference player of the week twice.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some Europeans who come to America to play for a season
and return home, the 19-year-old plans to return to Germany this
summer and play for the national team and then return to UNLV in
the fall. It's a good thing. After winning seven games the past two
seasons combined, Froehlich is a major reason UNLV is 15-8 this
season.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 20 points in a losing effort at TCU on Thursday,
TCU coach Mike Petersen summed it up best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, she's big time.''
QUICK HITS LOCAL CONFUSION
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the Western Athletic Conference, TCU and SMU have
been travel partners. No problem, right?
</P>
<P>
   The people in Fort Collins, Colo., don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   After the Horned Frogs played at Colorado State on Feb. 11, the
Mustangs played there two days later.
</P>
<P>
   During player introductions for the SMU game, the public address
announcer said: ``And from Fort Worth, it's the SMU Mustangs.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, after the game the box score had TCU's record
rather than SMU's. The next day the local newspaper attributed SMU
coach Rhonda Rompola with a quote.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad TCU coach Mike Petersen said it.
MOVING ON
</P>
<P>
   After the suicide of former Stephen F. Austin star Katrina
Price, SFA lost consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the Ladyjacks have gone on to win five
consecutive games and six out of seven. This season, however,
likely will not be measured by ``Ws'' or ``Ls''.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put on a good face, but we have daily reminders of
the things that we have gone through and we will carry those
remembrances for the rest of our lives,'' SFA coach Royce Chadwick
said. ``Our biggest foe right now is our minds and focusing on what
we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   SFA is 12-10 and 9-5 in Southland Conference play. SFA must win
the conference tournament to keep its string of 11 consecutive NCAA
Tournament appearances alive.
A HUSKIES FIRST
</P>
<P>
   Svetlana Abrosimova's jump shot in the second half of
Connecticut's 88-53 victory against Providence on Thursday was
significant for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One, it was her 22nd and 23rd points, and coach Geno Auriemma
sat her down the rest of the game. Second, she became the first
UConn sophomore to reach 1,000 career points. At this point in her
Huskies career, she has more points than Nykesha Sales, Rebecca
Lobo and Jennifer Rizzotti did at the same time in their respective
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play again, but it's senior night,'' Abrosimova
said. ``It wasn't a problem for me to sit on the bench.''
BYE-BYE, STEPHANIE
</P>
<P>
   The first home sellout for a women's game at Mackey Arena
(14,123) was also Purdue senior Stephanie White-McCarty's final
home game. The Boilermakers defeated Ohio State, 88-58.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see the place packed took my breath away,'' White-McCarty
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before she came to Purdue, the Boilermakers were averaging 4,664
fans. This season, that number has reached 9,307.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because of Steph,'' Purdue coach Carolyn Peck said.
THE MOVIE WAS BETTER
</P>
<P>
   At one point during Tennessee's 113-39 victory over Memphis on
Tuesday, Tigers coach Joye Lee-McNelis called a timeout to pose an
introspective question to her team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked had they ever watched the movie ``The Bad News
Bears,'''' she said. ``I told them that's kind of what we looked
like.''

   At a symposium at the Boston University (BU) Photonics Center
last fall, the attendees broke for coffee as usual. But something
was amiss.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of professors munching cookies and chatting about the
latest research, men in suits stood facing blank walls, whispering
into cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   They are high-powered investors, but they're not from Silicon
Valley _ they're from the research center's ninth floor.
</P>
<P>
   Better toss out the old stereotypes about academia and get with
the latest rage _ ivory tower goes venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding to spin off more technologies, boost local economies,
and just plain make money, many research institutions and
universities are creating their own venture capital funds.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital has traditionally been the domain of private,
deep-pocketed investors hoping to earn a windfall, often by picking
off promising university research. Most of the action has centered
around big-name schools, such as MIT and Stanford University,
located near East Coast and West Coast hubs of venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   But now an increasing number of universities around the country
want their piece of the pie _ and are willing to do what it takes
to get it.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example is BU's Photonics Venture Partners. The fund
is privately managed, but the university is both an investor and a
manager _ one of the firm's three generals partners is Donald
Fraser, also the Photonics Center's director.
</P>
<P>
   Working cheek-by-jowl with BU researchers studying blue lasers
and quantum communication, the venture capitalists plan to leverage
the center's technical acumen to invest in the rapidly growing
field of photonics.
</P>
<P>
   No two of the university funds turned up by a ``Technology
Review'' survey are exactly alike. Some are wholly-owned
subsidiaries, others are independent firms awarded preferential
rights to an institution's technology.
</P>
<P>
   They also have varying aims. At BU, the strategy is to invest in
any photonics company likely to return a profit.
</P>
<P>
   At Vanderbilt University, on the other hand, administrators have
christened a $10 million fund that will invest in companies built
around the school's technology.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Steranka, Vanderbilt's director of technology licensing,
says the main reason for the do-it-yourself funds ``is that many
promising university inventions are simply too early-stage and too
risky to interest mainstream venture capitalists.''
</P>
<P>
   But based on a study of schools that have previously tried
venture funds, Josh Lerner, a professor at Harvard Business School,
thinks university administrators often have unrealistic
expectations for financial success.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner thinks they also underestimate the challenge of combining
the quick-to-move venture culture with rule-bound academia. ``It's
very hard to marry these organizational forms,'' says Lerner. &QL;

A HIDDEN BLESSING IN NOWHERE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There is a tattoo on his chest. A black panther. A
vision Jason Kidd has carried around for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sleek animal,'' he said. ``Fast. Powerful. The kind of
animal that can do anything it wants.'' He smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out it was a little bit tough to own one, so this is
the next best thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Friday night, and all around the budding superstar, there
is the silence of failure. Tom Gugliotta is in a corner, face in
his hands. Chris Morris is leaning back, arm resting on a vacant
chair. And Rex Chapman . . .
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to feel for Rex Chapman, whose game is a casualty
of the shooter's domino effect. Sore hamstring hinders conditioning
which limits legs which kills jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   And it's hard to find an identity, a pulse, something which
defines this 5-4 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know what it is,'' Chapman said. ``Hard to get
a handle on it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a 101-93 loss to the Pistons, we know a few
things:
</P>
<P>
   These Suns are not short on guts, and there will be times when
pride alone leads them to the winner's circle. But they are no
longer glamorous, only gritty. No longer sure-footed, but
resiliently awkward.
</P>
<P>
   You can't count them out, but you can't count on them for much
else.
</P>
<P>
   As stated before, the only dramatic statement the Suns can make
next season is through their two draft picks, the consolation for a
season that looks rather shaky. But there is something else, and
it's happening now, before our eyes.
</P>
<P>
   With Kevin Johnson drifting out of memory and Antonio McDyess
hiding under security blankets in Denver, there is nothing but room
for Jason Kidd. Room to grow, explode, to take over a team crying
for leadership.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, his line was nice, but nothing like his two
triple-doubles earlier in the week. Nothing like that amazing night
in San Antonio when he put a team on his back. Like superstars do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the difference,'' Kidd said when asked if he's
crossing the bridge. ``My job is to win ballgames, help the team
win. It's up to you guys to label us as bad, good or super.''
</P>
<P>
   You want to know how Michael Jordan became a superstar? He
played on a lot of bad teams, ones that needed his talents to be
extraordinary just in order to compete. And they did. With an
enormous leash, Jordan's game sprouted in all directions. And once
he became an expert jump shooter, he was there.
</P>
<P>
   The path is starting to look familiar.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on a Nike tour of Japan in 1996, Kidd requested an
audience with Jordan. Kidd was dealing with all that chaos in
Dallas and needed some help. They sat down, and Jordan patiently
answered all his questions.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing you should know: There are players Jordan liked as
friends and players Jordan respected, ones he deemed worthy of his
knowledge. Jordan already sensed that Kidd fit in the latter
category, so he continued talking. For 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was giving me advice,'' Kidd said. ``I was soaking it up
like a sponge.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to think of Kidd as an NBA veteran. It is his fifth
year in the NBA, but it has been only seven years since he left
high school. In contrast, this is Tim Duncan's second year in the
NBA, but his sixth since entering college.
</P>
<P>
   It's also Kidd's first year in Phoenix without the lengthy
shadow of KJ.
</P>
<P>
   It is simply Kidd's time, finally his team. And the climate is
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect KJ,'' Kidd said. ``When I was traded, the biggest
thing I didn't want to do was step on his toes. It could've gotten
ugly, me coming in, saying I wanted the ball. But I'm not that kind
of player. I'm not that kind of person.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the midst of an ugly season, he is on his way. With room
to grow, on a team that needs him to do everything. And in the end,
it could be another blessing from a season going nowhere. &QL;

COYOTES SPIRAL DOWNWARD  
 `DISORGANIZED' TEAM LOSES TO LIGHTNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ When one of the NHL's supposedly elite teams plays the
woeful Tampa Bay Lightning, a tie is considered a loss.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, how can the Phoenix Coyotes' 4-2 loss
Friday night to the Lightning before 11,057 stunned fans at the Ice
Palace be categorized?
</P>
<P>
   Rock-bottom is good.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the Lightning _ which registered just its 12th win
of the season while snapping a 10-game winless streak _ started a
goalie, Derek Wilkinson, who hadn't played in the NHL in more than
a year and had a career NHL record of 2-7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Rock-bottom is perfect, considering the Coyotes, who have lost
three straight games, also lost center Juha Ylonen to a knee injury
in the second period. His knee will be evaluated today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's rock-bottom, but the last three games we
haven't played playoff-caliber hockey,'' said Coyote Rick Tocchet,
who scored both Phoenix goals to raise his total on the season to
20. ``The way we're playing, we're not even a playoff-caliber team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disorganized and not helping each other out. That
happens to teams that don't make the playoffs. We are within
striking distance of Dallas for first in our division. You'd think
we'd be playing together, but we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it time for an air-clearing, players-only meeting?
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a good idea. It's tough to say anything after a
game like this,'' Tocchet said. ``It's better to sleep on it
first.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the setback more disappointing is it was the
designated ``confidence builder'' to kick off a seven-game trip
that progressively gets tougher, with stops in Florida tonight,
Pittsburgh Monday, then Washington, New York (Rangers) and New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not playing our best hockey and haven't been for
awhile,'' said Coach Jim Schoenfeld, whose team has lost four of
its past six. ``The biggest trademark of our team early on was we
played the game for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had adversity, and we've forgotten that's what we need
to do to win. We have to get back to playing unselfish hockey and
playing for the guy next to you instead of for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes outplayed the Lightning for the first period and
much of the second but still entered the third period tied at 1,
thanks to Wilkinson's heroics. Then they simply allowed Tampa Bay
to dominate the game.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest killer was the Coyotes' power play. They now have
scored just three times in their past 35 power plays, coming up
empty on five attempts Friday. Worse, during a pair of third-period
advantages, the Lightning equalled the Coyotes' scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more odd-man rushes against us than we usually have in
a month,'' a disgusted Schoenfeld said. ``We didn't score on the
power play. When you get opportunities, you need to score.''
</P>
<P>
   really going to cost us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes only had three penalties, but two came on Gerald
Diduck's boarding and game misconduct, which left Tampa Bay captain
Darcy Tucker with a cut above his eye. It also led to a five-minute
Lightning power play that veteran Wendell Clark cashed in for a
game-tying goal at 7:50 of the first period to offset Tocchet's
first goal at 4:13.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gratton's goal at 17:15 of the third period proved to be
the game-winner. Benoit Hogue also cashed an insurance goal at
18:28 and an empty-netter at the final buzzer. In between, Tocchet
made it 3-2 after Nikolai Khabibulin was pulled for an extra
attacker at 19:00. &QL;

PRESSURE OFF D-BACKS CATCHERS  
 STINNETT, MILLER HAVE SLOTS LOCKED UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Catcher Damian Miller was rummaging through his
locker recently when he heard a small voice behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Miller, I thought we traded you,'' said 7-year-old Nathan
Showalter, the son of Miller's boss, Diamondbacks Manager Buck
Showalter.
</P>
<P>
   Miller chuckled and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez, is my spring starting out good or what?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Life is better than you might think for Miller and fellow
backstop Kelly Stinnett as they prepare for another long, grueling
trek through the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, both were battling for roster spots, as were most
players in the club's inaugural camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really no pressure now. We both know we're going to
make the club. Now we can get our work in,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was one of the final cuts of the spring, went to Tucson
and was recalled for good May 6. Stinnett began the season as the
No. 2 man behind Jorge Fabregas, got some starts when Fabregas went
down with an ankle injury and then got a lot of starts after
Fabregas went with right-hander Willie Blair to the New York Mets
in a July 31 trade for outfielder Bernard Gilkey and right-hander
Nelson Figueroa.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stinnett is expected to be the primary starter,
Showalter said Miller will get a large share of time. Stinnett hit
.259 with 11 home runs and 34 RBIs in 92 games and had a
club-record 13-game hitting streak. Miller hit .286 with three
homers and 14 RBIs in 57 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a `I hate you, I hope you do poorly' relationship. We
support each other. We talk to each other. We even go out to eat
together on occasion,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough not to respect those guys after the job they did
for us last season,'' Showalter said. ``They give us depth. We're
going to try to alternate whenever we can, but if one guy gets hot
(offensively), it will be hard not to ride that horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with a new stable of veteran pitchers will help the
catchers do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like us, we can't complain,'' Miller said. ``These guys
know what they're doing. Having worked with the pitchers last year
and the experience of the new guys, we're in more of a comfort
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett said, ``It makes you want to work harder. There's more
of a swagger around here, not in a cocky way, but in a confident
way. There's more of a chance that we're going to be in every
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Catching coach Glenn Sherlock took the six catchers in camp off
to a side field Friday and worked for more than an hour on blocking
pitches, fielding bunts and catching foul pop-ups, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   The other receivers are non-roster invitees Rod Barajas, Marcus
Hanel, Ramsey Koeyers and Izzy Molina. The emergency catcher will
be Greg Colbrunn, who signed as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   But the focus remains on Stinnett and Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelly and Damian have really developed into solid receivers,''
Sherlock said. ``Their main responsibility is to handle the
pitching staff, and they've both done that. They block pitches
well, they call a good game, and they prepare well. It's no secret
that the catcher is there for the pitcher, and communication is the
key.''
</P>
<P>
   Electricity already is moving through the wires. Stinnett began
working with left-hander Randy Johnson about two weeks ago at Bank
One Ballpark in Phoenix and worked again with him during Thursday's
first workout.
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett's eyes lit up when asked about Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw his fastball and change-up but no slider, but that
will come,'' Stinnett said. ``I put the glove up and he kept
hitting the spot. It will be even better when the season starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller had a session Friday with another new starter,
right-hander Todd Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be able to work with these guys, learn how they
like you to set up back there, get a better idea of what they
throw,'' Miller said. ``I'm glad they're on my side, that I don't
have to face them. They'll save me a few strikeouts and a few
points on my average.''
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett is limiting the wear and tear on his knees by using
``knee savers,'' pads strapped to the calf area. When he squats
behind the plate, he more or less ``sits'' on the pads.
</P>
<P>
   He said the knee is a bit sore ``but will work itself out when I
get into baseball shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Colbrunn was allowed to show up early to get acclimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to feel like a fish out of water,'' said
Colbrunn, who caught part of one game with the Colorado Rockies in
1998 before going to Atlanta in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's shaken the cobwebs off, and he seems to fit perfectly.
He's a bulldog,'' Sherlock said. &QL;

BROWN CLOSE TO RE-SIGNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Cardinals offensive tackle Lomas Brown said on
Friday he expects to re-sign with the team by the end of the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking, and we're just trying to finalize
things,'' said Brown, whose agent, Lamont Smith, met with Cardinals
executive Rod Graves Friday at the NFL scouting combine in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have (agreed) on numbers and everything. We're just waiting
for approval (from team ownership).''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the two sides have talked about a two-year deal, but
he wouldn't give any details.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had talked to Brown in December about a one-year
contract worth about $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who will be 36 next season, recently completed a
three-year deal that averaged $3 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Brown around the league has increased the past few
days. The expansion Cleveland Browns and Washington Redskins asked
about him.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Cardinals acknowledged that they had talked to
free-agent offensive tackle Wayne Gandy, formerly of the St. Louis
Rams, in case Brown didn't re-sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Cardinals offensive line coach George Warhop) called me to
tell me about them talking to Gandy,'' Brown said. ``He said the
only reason the whole thing came about was because (Gandy) played
for him in St. Louis, but that they wanted me back.''
</P>
<P>
   If Brown does re-sign, the Cardinals might be hard-pressed to
also re-sign outside linebacker Jamir Miller, considered one of the
NFL's most attractive free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have said all along they wanted Miller to return,
but they didn't know if they could afford him. They have only about
$5 million to spend on free agents to stay under the $57.2 million
salary cap for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Jamir back,'' Brown said. ``We're a better team with
Jamir.''
</P>
<P>
   One source close to the team said the only way the Cardinals
could sign both players was if some veterans were asked to
restructure their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The source said the most likely candidate would be cornerback
Aeneas Williams, who is scheduled to earn $3.4 million each of the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   It is not believed the Cardinals have asked Williams to re-do
his contract. &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Chargers have shown interest in Cardinals safety
Kwamie Lassiter, an unrestricted free agent, who had four
interceptions against them last season. Lassiter, who has been
offered a three-year deal by the Cardinals, is expected to visit
San Diego on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the Fiesta Bowl scheduled for Jan. 2 at Sun Devil Stadium,
the Cardinals will have to finish their regular season on the road.
The league's regular season is scheduled to end that weekend. &QL;

PEPPERDINE MAKES STATEMENT WITH VICTORY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Jelani Gardner and Kelvin Gibbs. What a pair.
As they go, so goes the Pepperdine men's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Last week they stunk and so did the Waves. But Friday night,
with the best team in the West Coast Conference as the opponent,
Gardner and Gibbs were back to their old ways.
</P>
<P>
   Their timing was perfect. The duo combined for 40 points and the
Waves snapped a two-game losing streak with an emotional 75-70 win
over Gonzaga in front of 2,685 at Firestone Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine, riding the bubble of a possible NCAA Tournament
at-large berth, improved to 9-4 in the WCC, 18-10 overall. The
Waves could make it a moot point, though, if they win next week's
conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   A win like Friday's over the regular-season champion Bulldogs,
who dropped to 21-6, 11-2, gives Pepperdine a shot in the arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to get to the NCAA Tournament by way of the
conference tournament, you'll probably have to get through
(Gonzaga),'' Pepperdine head coach Lorenzo Romar said. ``Now our
guys know that they have a chance to beat those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs and Gardner give Pepperdine that chance.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs, a sophomore forward, scored a career-high 23 points and
also grabbed 12 rebounds. His offensive rebound and layup with 16
seconds left gave the Waves a 74-70 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs, motivated by what he said was a lot of trash-talking by
the Gonzaga players during the game, caught an airball by Tezale
Archie and in the same motion put the ball up and in with one
second left on the shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there would only be one or two seconds left,'' Gibbs
said.
</P>
<P>
   Romar said, ``Kelvin played with fury, a vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner also was a motivated player; he came off the bench for
the first time in his two-year Pepperdine career. For the first
time in 54 games, he wasn't in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Romar described the move as ``a little shakeup . . . a little
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner said the coaching staff put him on the bench as
punishment for his poor play last week in losses at San Francisco
and Santa Clara. Here's the kicker: Gardner didn't disagree with
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to make it a mental challenge for me,'' Gardner
said. ``I think I did well. I think I came in and was productive. I
didn't pout.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner scored five of his 17 points in a spurt that gave
Pepperdine a 72-68 lead with 2:03 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt, when Jelani Gardner is playing well we are
a better team,'' Romar said. ``He came in and was poised; he didn't
force the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves overcame a 12-0 run by the Bulldogs over a
three-minute span in the second half. Matt Santangelo's 3-pointer
gave Gonzaga its biggest lead _ 68-62. But Gibbs ended the streak
with a rebound and basket and Pepperdine regained the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The balanced Bulldogs, who had won 17 of their 19 games prior to
Friday, had four players score in double figures, but none had more
than 12. Richie Frahm, who came in averaging 14.7 points per game,
was held to just nine.

INJURIES HELP CUT ROSTER TO 12 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Suns trimmed their regular-season roster from 14
players to 12 by placing rookies  &UR; Gerald Brown and  &UR; Toby Bailey on
the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   Brown officially is listed with chondromalacia patella in his
left knee, which is a way of saying he has pain under the kneecap.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has patellar tendinitis in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   They join second-year center  &UR; Horacio Llamas, who is out because
of a strained Achilles tendon and bruised right foot, on the
injured list.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns hoped Brown could be their backup point guard, and he
played well in two preseason games, averaging 10.5 points and
hitting 13 of 16 field goal attempts in two exhibition games
against the Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But without benefit of a regular training camp and a full
preseason, Brown struggled when the regular season began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' Brown said. ``It was a lack of preseason
games and less (repetitions), that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   An undrafted rookie from Pepperdine, Brown was a standout at the
Los Angeles Summer Pro League, where the Suns decided to sign him.
He appeared in six regular-season games, averaging 5.4 minutes and
making 6 of 17 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, who was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in the second
round of last summer's draft and traded to the Suns for future
considerations, played in five regular-season games. &QL; 
Home delivery &QL; 
Suns center  &UR; Luc Longley received his 1998 world championship ring
from the Chicago Bulls, and he didn't even have to leave his house
to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls owner  &UR; Jerry Reinsdorf, who owns a home in the Valley,
delivered the ring to Longley. ``I offered to come get it, but he
said he'd bring it over,'' Longley said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Joe Kleine, Longley's backup with the Suns and a reserve with
the Bulls last season, also received his championship ring from
Reinsdorf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sent it COD,'' Kleine joked.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Kleine received his in the mail about two weeks ago. &QL; 
Scrimmage open &QL; 
The team will hold a scrimmage open to the public at 1 p.m. on
Sunday. Doors at America West Arena will open at noon. &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - Tom Gugliotta got the call. So far, Jason Kidd has
not.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta told ``The Arizona Republic'' he will represent the
United States at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' 6-foot-10 forward confirmed Friday that he received a
call from USA Basketball on Thursday and accepted the invitation to
play this summer in the Olympic qualifying tournament in San Juan,
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Those players were asked to make a two-year commitment to play
in the qualifier July 14-25 and then the Olympic Games in the fall
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Granik, deputy commissioner of the NBA and president of USA
Basketball, which is charged with selecting the team, said nine NBA
players will be chosen. Those will be announced next week.
</P>
<P>
   He said three other players will be chosen from the collegiate
ranks, the Continental Basketball Association or Americans playing
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But those three will not compete in the Olympics. The Olympic
roster will be filled out with three more NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd has not been contacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have my address,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If he isn't among the first nine selected, he still could be
among the three players added next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking for a two-year commitment,'' Granik said. ``It
wouldn't be fair for a player to say, `I only want to play in
2000.' The understanding is, unless there are unforeseen
circumstances, if a player agrees to play this summer in the
qualifying tournament, they will be on the Olympic team in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, we need a good team this summer. We can't afford
not to qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the top two teams in the 10-team qualifier will advance to
the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, players who were selected for last summer's World
Championships team, which did not compete in Greece because of the
NBA labor lockout, were to get first crack at the nine spots.
However, Granik said that is not the case, but ``when the smoke
clears, you'll see a lot of those names.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta was chosen for that team, which later was filled
mostly with Continental Basketball Association players.
</P>
<P>
   Center Luc Longley of the Suns is expected to compete for the
host Australians in 2000. &QL;

DRAKE'S RETURN ON HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ Coyotes right wing  &UR; Dallas Drake hoped to return Friday
night against Tampa Bay from the separated shoulder that has
sidelined him for the past 10 games. But caution prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld doesn't expect Drake back for the next two
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at least a week away, and I don't think he'll be ready
before the Washington game (Wednesday),'' Schoenfeld said. ``It's
an injury where if you don't have your strength back, you are very
susceptible to reinjuring it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes beyond pain. You can have pain and still play, but
it's the strength we're more interested in. He's not going until we
feel he's good and strong. The next one won't be this bad, it'll be
worse. We want to make sure we get him where we're sure he's not
going to have a recurring injury.'' &QL; 
Niki's the man &QL; 
Goalie  &UR; Jimmy Waite was sent to Springfield of the AHL to work on
his confidence and his game, not necessarily in that order, which
leaves untested &UR; Robert Esch as the backup to  &UR; Nikolai Khabibulin.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for Esch to see much playing time on the Coyotes'
seven-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any hard plan for Robert Esch,'' Schoenfeld said.
``Niki will play again in Florida (tonight), and we'll go from
there. Once you get by the back-to-back games, Niki can almost play
all the rest. Just two things concern us: one, how is Niki doing,
and two, how is Jimmy doing in Springfield. I don't really plan to
put Robert Esch in right now.''
</P>
<P>
   How about if the Coyotes' somehow gain a comfortable lead?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's ever a big enough lead,'' Schoenfeld
said, laughing. ``Wins are too hard to come by.'' &QL; 
Ice chips &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Injured  &UR; Brad Isbister is accompanying the team on the trip,
although he's four weeks away from playing after hernia surgery.
He's merely along to have his rehab regimen monitored by
conditioning coach  &UR; Stieg Theander.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jim Cummins returned after sitting out a five-game suspension
for elbowing. It was his second suspension of the season. &QL;

BROOKS ODD MAN OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The numbers finally didn't add up for veteran
point guard Scott Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   The former UC Irvine star, who's been down since injuring his
right knee in an exhibition game against the Los Angeles Lakers, is
out. On Friday's mandatory cut-down day, the Los Angeles Clippers
reached the 12-player limit for their active roster by waiving
Brooks and moving two others to the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-11 Brooks had been attempting to make his seventh NBA
team in 11 seasons. He averaged a career-high 6.3 points per game
for Houston during the 1992-'93 season, and played for the NBA
champion Rocket team the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks has been on the injured list since hurting his right knee
in a collision with Lakers rookie Ruben Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Even with perfect health, he would have been the fourth option
in a crowded point-guard stable that includes Darrick Martin,
Sherman Douglas
</P>
<P>
   and Pooh Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things are difficult,'' Elgin Baylor,
</P>
<P>
   the Clippers vice president of basketball operations, said of
waiving the popular Brooks. ``He's a real professional, and a great
person to have around.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 players who had been on the team payroll, the only
Clippers without guaranteed contracts were Brooks and rookie free
agent Tyrone Nesby.
</P>
<P>
   Nesby has become part of Coach Chris Ford's
</P>
<P>
   rotation, and is 10th on the team in minutes played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the guy has played very well,'' Baylor said of Nesby.
``His first step is as quick as anybody. He certainly has a
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining rookie Brian Skinner
</P>
<P>
   on the injured list are veteran center Stojko Vrankovic
</P>
<P>
   (back spasms) and seemingly healthy second-year guard Charles
Smith
</P>
<P>
   (shin splints). Smith hasn't missed a practice, but has yet to
make his first appearance in a regular-season game this season.
</P>
<P>
   IS TONIGHT THE NIGHT?
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Mavericks were beaten in seven of their first eight
games. When they meet the Clippers tonight at the Sports Arena, it
will be their third road game in four nights.
</P>
<P>
   Are they ripe for defeat?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even begin to think about that,'' said Ford, who has
yet to experience the thrill of victory this season. ``We're never
gonna have an easy night, so we just have to go out there and play
hard for 48 minutes - or more. I never assume it's going to be
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, coach. So, with one overtime defeat and another loss
achieved in double-overtime, does Ford ever sit back and ponder
what might have been?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have those little dreams,'' he said, ``but then
it's reality time. Hopefully, the tides will turn for us.''
</P>
<P>
   During the low tides of 0-6, the Clippers have yet to produce a
solid effort in most phases of the game. They were pounded on the
boards against Chicago, but Ford seems to have fixed the rebounding
problem. In Tuesday's double-overtime loss to Vancouver, they
out-rebounded the Grizzlies, 60-48. But in the same game, the
Clippers missed half of their 32 free-throw attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice,'' Ford said, ``if we started making open
shots and foul shots.''
</P>
<P>
   He also would prefer a better start than Tuesday's 0-13 opening
against Vancouver. To help prevent a reprisal of that performance,
Ford anticipates a change or two in his starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL REPORT
</P>
<P>
   Off-guard Eric Piatkowski,
</P>
<P>
   whose sore right ankle prevented him from working out with the
team Thursday, participated in Friday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas also practiced, but continues to nurse a slight pull of
the left groin that occurred in Tuesday's game with Vancouver. His
availability remains in question, but if he can't play, his minutes
will go to Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner also practiced Friday, and may be able to return to
action within a week. A knee injury has kept the power forward from
Baylor on the sidelines since the end of training camp.

NEVADA INTER ESTED IN NAU'S HOWLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - After distinguishing himself at Northern Arizona the
past five seasons, it's time for Lumberjacks Coach  &UR; Ben Howland to
move on, knowing he left a program in far better shape than he
found it.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Nevada apparently think so, too. Howland has
emerged as a top candidate there.
</P>
<P>
   NAU is tied for first place in the Big Sky Conference after
winning the regular-season titles the past two seasons (and almost
beating Cincinnati in the first round of the 1998 NCAA Tournament).
Howland immediately was mentioned in Reno after  &UR; Pat Foster
resigned as coach of the Big West school on Feb. 1, effective at
the end of the season. Since then, Athletic Director
 &UR; Chris Ault has been considering other candidates, ``but I'm sure he
(Howland) is going to get looked at,'' a Nevada official said.
</P>
<P>
   Also under consideration, among others, are Gonzaga Coach  &UR; Dan
Monson and Utah assistant  &UR; Donny Daniels. But is it really a step
up for Monson, who might be waiting to see what happens at
Washington State? As for Daniels, Utah head Coach  &UR; Rick Majerus,
who presumably would endorse Daniels, is a close friend of
Howland's.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada, a former Big Sky member, has been a graveyard for
coaches. No Wolfpack coach has ever moved from there to another
NCAA Division I job. Also, Ault is known to be a tough AD to work
for.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe it's never had the right coach. In terms of facilities
and money, and even the fact that an airport is nearby, the
potential at Nevada is greater than at NAU.
</P>
<P>
   Howland, who perhaps lobbied too hard for the Cal-Santa Barbara
job last year and didn't get it, is maintaining a low-key posture.
Contacted in Portland, before the Lumberjacks lost to Portland
State in overtime on Thursday, he acknowledged ``it's flattering to
be considered by schools,'' but said his main concern is getting
his team through this season.
</P>
<P>
   An even better opportunity for Howland might be at San Diego
State, where
 &UR; Fred Trenkle, mired in a 2-21 season, also has announced his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The school has a first-class arena, more visibility than Nevada,
and a commitment to upgrade from Athletic Director  &UR; Rick Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned. &QL; 
Sound familiar? &QL; 
Name a large university located in a warm-weather metropolis with a
transient population base and numerous entertainment options,
including professional sports, which has a good college basketball
program that can't attract fans.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. And Miami (Fla.), too.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of its most successful season ever, the NCAA
Tournament-bound Hurricanes are averaging a paltry 5,200. The main
reason seems to be Miami Arena, where the 'Canes play their home
games. It's a dump located about 25 minutes from campus in an area
with a high crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people just don't want to go there,'' an assistant
athletic director told Bloomberg News. ``It's hard to blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's ``your'' excuse, ASU fans? &QL; 
Andre the giant &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who's the better point guard, Utah's  &UR; Andre Miller or Arizona's
 &UR; Jason Terry? First-year San Jose State coach  &UR; Phil Johnson was an
assistant at UA, so he knows all about Terry. He learned about
Miller first-hand last year, when Miller went for a triple-double
in Utah's NCAA Tournament win over the Wildcats. Now Johnson knows
even more about Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best defensive guard in America, along with Jason
Terry,'' Johnson told the ``Salt Lake City Tribune.'' And this was
``before'' Utah's 71-49 win on Thursday. ``They'll be the top two
guards taken in the NBA draft. Andre will be the first. He's really
good because he's so strong and physical for a guard.'' &QL;

   TUCSON _ Rick Anderson seemed to be the least likely candidate
to claim the shooting guard spot for eighth-ranked Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   He had played exclusively in the low post, roughing up a lot of
California high school talent as a 6-foot-8 center and earning
nomination for McDonald's All-American.
</P>
<P>
   While 6-8 is a tall high school center, it doesn't project at
the collegiate level. Anderson isn't a bruising 6-8, either. He
weighs 198 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   He realized that to make it in college, he would have to play on
the perimeter facing the basket. He had to develop new skills and a
new level of endurance. Wing players don't camp out.
</P>
<P>
   So before stashing the surfboard and loading up for the drive
from Long Beach, Calif., to the desert, Anderson consulted a good
authority on what it would take to make the transition for Coach
Lute Olson: Anderson's dad, Gary, a former coach at Long Beach City
College and a player for Olson at Long Beach City College in the
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad said, `Rick, this is going to be the biggest challenge of
your life, but if you want to make it, you have to run the lanes
and attack,' '' said Anderson, the first former player's son that
Olson has coached.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has taken his father's advice to heart. His consistent
progress surprisingly has elevated him into the lineup for Arizona
(19-4, 10-3) for the Pac-10 stretch drive that begins this
afternoon against Oregon (14-9, 6-8).
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was the last player signed in a heralded freshman
class.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Anderson played like a real shooting guard, blossoming
in an 89-72 rout of Oregon State. He shot 50 percent, almost 20
percentage points better than anyone else who played the position
this season, making two three-pointers and scoring a career-high 14
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure didn't shoot threes in high school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More impressive to Olson was Anderson's defense. With his long
arms, Anderson prevented Beaver guards from making entry passes to
their big men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Olson has taught me a lot about playing the guard
position,'' Anderson said. ``I've learned team defense, where to
be, and how one mistake can make the whole concept fall apart. It
was hard to adjust, but I didn't rush it, and now it's just kind of
flowing. I knew at first I wouldn't do too well, not knowing how to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The original plan was to redshirt Anderson. That changed when
fellow freshman Luke Walton, son of Hall of Famer Bill Walton,
suffered a foot fracture similar to the one that stymied his dad's
pro career.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson moved into the lineup Thursday, following a strong week
in practice. He was further buoyed in the rotation while freshman
guards Ruben Douglas and Traves Wilson served disciplinary
benchings.
</P>
<P>
   That's the opportunity he needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can take it now,'' he said of holding the job
through the NCAA Tournament. ``It's up to Ruben and Traves, too.
It's about who wants to work the hardest.''
</P>
<P>
   On that, Anderson is the leader of the pack, according to UA
point guard Jason Terry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should see how hard Rick practices, how he beats everybody
to the hoop,'' Terry said. ``I saw this ability in him a long time
ago. I was just wondering when Coach Olson was going to see it,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson said he saw it a while ago, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said from the day we signed Rick that before he's through
here, he is going to be a great player,'' Olson said. ``He's the
best communicator we have at the defensive end. He gets pieces of
passes with those long arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands the game. The biggest thing now for him is
conditioning. We've got to get him out after four or five minutes
and get him a blow. But the thing I love is that I haven't once
heard him make an excuse all year.'' &QL;

EVANS: SUN DEVILS CAN'T WORRY ABOUT POSTSEASON

<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Barring some sort of wacky miracle, Arizona State
is no longer playing for an NCAA Tournament invitation. Not after a
disgraceful performance for 23 minutes Thursday against Oregon,
which led to a 76-75 loss on its home court.
</P>
<P>
   So what are the Sun Devils playing for, starting today at Wells
Fargo Arena against Oregon State? An NIT bid? Pride?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still battling, we still have five games left,'' ASU
Coach Rob Evans said. ``We've got to continue to try to win every
basketball game we can and see where we land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to finish off winning. We want to finish playing hard,
executing, just like we want to do every game. Nothing changes for
me. You have goals, and if your goals start slipping away, you've
got to re-establish. But you've got to continue to play hard. And
you've got to continue to execute. It's an assignment we have, and
every assignment we want to do the best we can at.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans will bounce back, and his team might, too. But for the
first time all season, he looked whipped, watching his Sun Devils
display an inept, lackluster effort for more than a half against
Oregon. Evans sat on the bench, not quite sure what he was seeing,
with even less of a clue as to why it was taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Evans is up and out of his chair, standing or crouched
on the sideline, barking at his players and working the officials.
But there was little of that. The fog the Sun Devils were playing
in had engulfed their coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd tell them a play,'' Evans said, ``and then they'd not
execute it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, after trailing by 15, the Sun Devils finally seemed
to figure things out. They even tied the score with 37 seconds left
when Mike Batiste, who started on the bench, hit a three-point
basket.
</P>
<P>
   What if Batiste had been out there at the start? What if he made
that shot, or just a regular two-point basket in the first four
minutes instead of sitting out? Maybe ASU wouldn't have lost by a
single point or started as slowly.
</P>
<P>
   A senior, Batiste was benched for a couple of transgressions. He
failed to show up for study hall and a meeting with an academic
adviser. So did some of his teammates. As punishment, they were
summoned to run five miles at 5 a.m., which Evans refers to as ``5
at 5.'' This time, Batiste was the only no-show.
</P>
<P>
   The only way Batiste got to play at all was by participating in
5 at 5 twice, the second time the day of the game. But the damage
had been done, a needless distraction for a team supposedly focused
on finishing the season big.
</P>
<P>
   Off for a full week since an intense effort against Arizona in
Tucson fell just short, the Sun Devils looked rusty. ASU pretended
to run an offense against an aggressive man-to-man defense, and the
result was predictable. And deadly.
</P>
<P>
   After making two of their first three shots, the Sun Devils
stood around and missed the next 15. They played hurriedly instead
of quickly, and only because of repeated trips to the free-throw
line and Oregon's own raggedness did they trail by just 10 at
halftime. They made 4 of 22 shots and turned the ball over 11
times.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out the second half the same way, ASU fell behind by 15
with 17:17 left. That seemed to wake the Sun Devils up, and they
spent the rest of the game clawing back but came up short. &QL;

DEAL WITH PIRATES HAS 1 MORE STEP 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ The much talked-about trade between the
Diamondbacks and Pittsburgh has cleared all but one hurdle and
could be announced today.
</P>
<P>
   The trade, which will bring outfielder Al Martin and infielder
Tony Womack to Arizona in exchange for outfielder Bernard Gilkey
and cash, needs only the approval of the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   It's so close to being consummated that Martin did not board a
flight to the Pirates' spring training facility in Florida on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reluctantly, I was going to get on a red-eye flight, but now
it looks like things took a turn for the better,'' Martin said from
his Scottsdale home. ``Hopefully, I'll just have to drive to Tucson
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The holdup is the amount of money the Diamondbacks will pay for
the remainder of Gilkey's contract. Because Arizona will pick up
more than $1 million of the deferment, and possibly as much as $6
million, the deal requires the approval of the commissioner's
office, where vice presidents Bill Murray and Sandy Alderson
red-flagged the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks managing general manager Jerry Colangelo, however,
has summoned the help of Commissioner Bud Selig to approve the
trade, which is not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finished with the Pittsburgh part,'' Colangelo said.
``He won't get that money for a long, long time. Why they took that
position with us, I don't understand.'' &QL; 
D-Backs sign Korean &QL; 
Korean native  &UR; Chan Ho Park has developed into one of the top
pitchers in the National League for the Los Angeles Dodgers. The
Diamondbacks can only hope their latest acquisition does the same.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona announced the signing of 20-year-old right-hander
 &UR; Byung-Hyun Kim of Korea, the club's first Asian player. Monetary
terms were not announced, but a source said the figure was in
excess of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kim was scouted by  &UR; Clay Daniel, Arizona's international
scouting coordinator. In 1998, Kim, 5 feet 11, 175 pounds, pitched
for the Korean National team and struck out 15 members of the U.S.
Olympic team in 6 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks decided to make a play for Kim after seeing
tape of Korea's gold-medal performance in the Asian Games, when he
struck out 12 during six perfect innings against China in the
semifinals. He had eight consecutive strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   By winning the gold medal in the Asian Games, Kim and his
teammates became exempt from military service.
</P>
<P>
   If Kim were eligible for baseball's amateur draft, Diamondbacks
Manager  &UR; Buck
 &UR; Showalter is certain he would be a first-round pick. Showalter said
the team was in a three-way race for Kim with the Dodgers and New
York Mets. &QL;

0 FOR FOREVER, BUT NOT GIVING UP  
 MICHAEL WALTRIP NEEDS 1ST WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it will happen Sunday. Or maybe two weeks from now.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe it won't happen at all.
</P>
<P>
   Not tomorrow, not next month, not even next year.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe never.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Marcis last visited victory lane in 1982. At least he got
there.
</P>
<P>
   Not Michael Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip is 0 for forever.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike older brother Darrell Waltrip, who is tied with Bobby
Allison at No. 3 on the all-time list with 84 career NASCAR Winston
Cup wins, the younger Waltrip never has finished higher than
second, and he did that just once _ 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no wonder Michael Waltrip barely batted an eye after
finishing a creditable fifth in last Sunday's Daytona 500, even
though the finish was his first top-five in three years (87
starts).
</P>
<P>
   When you've gone to the starting line 395 times since 1985 and
returned to the garage all 395 times without the checkered flag,
being close means nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty disappointed,'' said Waltrip, whose winless
streak is the longest among active drivers. ``I was very
distraught. Running fifth in the Daytona 500 is great. It's a good
morale booster for the team, but it wasn't the goal we started out
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to win.
</P>
<P>
   But when?
</P>
<P>
   Car owner Jim Mattei is convinced it will happen sometime this
season. So convinced is Mattei, he believes it will happen many
times over the next few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see great things out of Michael this year, and I very rarely
go out on the line that hard,'' Mattei said. ``Michael will produce
a lot of wins for us. We should have won (at Daytona), but
(Waltrip) made a mistake the last three or four laps and got out of
the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our computer, we were a tenth of a second faster than
(Jeff) Gordon. We feel like we would have at least been in the
hunt. But racing is 80 percent luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip's luck mostly has been bad.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, however, also admits he's the author of some of that
luck. He's made mistakes. Many mistakes. And he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   But Waltrip, 35, also knows, as do others, that he has the
talent to touch the stars. It just hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early (1990s), I almost won a couple of races,''
Waltrip said. ``I sat on a couple of poles. I just really felt that
everything was right there for me, like I was just an inch away
from cashing in after working my whole career to get to that point.
It just got away from me. It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from close to getting kind of away from it, (but) now
I feel like I'm close again. I guess it's been since 1990 or '91
that I've had this kind of optimism and excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) when we started with the Wood Brothers in (1996), I felt
I could do some good. And we did do good. We ran good the first of
'96. We were in the top 10 in points. We had won `The Winston'
(all-star event) and we were really competitive. For some reason,
we just let that slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   The famed Wood Brothers outfit hired Waltrip to replace Morgan
Shepherd in 1996, believing they had latched on to a future
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't think (Waltrip) could win, we wouldn't have hired
him,'' Len Wood said. ``Our intention was to make a winner out of
him. We were close a number of times, but we just didn't put it all
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nobody's fault. It just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   It's happened all through Waltrip's career.
</P>
<P>
   But Mattei and Waltrip are determined to bring the mess to an
end. Especially Mattei.
</P>
<P>
   Mattei first became a Winston Cup car owner two years ago, when
he became a partner with Geoffrey Bodine. A year later, Mattei
purchased the remaining interest from Bodine, then replaced Bodine
with Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Michael's history, this is the first time he's
been teamed up with the right budget and right equipment,'' Mattei
said.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip has seen enough to fill him with hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm plenty confident, and I'm only 35 years old,'' Waltrip
said. ``It's just putting all the pieces of the puzzle together. It
doesn't matter who you are, or how good you can drive, or how good
you can set up a car if you and the team don't work closely
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really what I'm focusing in on this year, trying to
have a relationship with my crew chief and my car owner and my team
(so) we all think alike. That's the key to getting to victory
lane.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the only key.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started this season thinking this could be my last season,''
Waltrip said. ``I've got a great ride, a great team, a great
sponsor and if I don't win races and run well, I might not be able
to get a ride next year. That's a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm faced with, and I love to race cars. It's
worth listening to everybody remind me that I've never won a race
just so I can get to do what I want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I know) I've got to win. I'll never feel like I'm accepted or
feel like I'm solid or stable until that happens.'' &QL;

 NHRA DRIVER DUNN SAVORS TURN AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about your good-news, bad-news seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dunn made it to four National Hot Rod Association Top Fuel
championship rounds last year, then proceeded to lose all four
races.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Dunn lost them all to one driver.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Scelzi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got beat a couple times, and I messed up a couple of
times,'' Dunn said. ``But we knew we had a team capable of
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn knew it, but still hadn't proved it.
</P>
<P>
   Until two weeks ago, when Dunn smoked the field at the NHRA
season opener at Pomona, Calif., blasting Larry Dixon in the finals
with a superb 4.522-second pass.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dunn's first visit to victory lane since the 1996 season,
and the reunion was made even more special after he set the NHRA
elapsed-time mark with a 4.503-second run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Scelzi and (crew chief) Alan Johnson are the benchmark,
even though we ran some good numbers (at Pomona) and pretty much
spanked the competition,'' said Dunn, driver of Darrell Gwynn's
Team Mopar dragster. ``But I think we have the team to get past
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have a similar year to last year, only we have to
turn some of those first- and second-round losses into wins. It's
easier said than done, but it's what we're shooting for.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn gets another chance next week during the Checker Schuck's
Kragen Nationals at Firebird International Raceway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Sportsman time trials begin Thursday, followed by pro qualifying
sessions Friday and Saturday. Final eliminations begin at 11 a.m.
on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn can hardly wait.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn put together four sub-4.60-second runs during eliminations
at Pomona, displaying the type of consistency he lacked for much of
the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, however, always believed he would return to the winner's
circle. Then, when he put together a strong second half last
season, he was convinced it only was a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody made a bigger deal out of us not winning
than we did,'' Dunn said. ``In the earlier part of my career, I
probably would have had doubts myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I knew what kind of car I had at the end of last year, and
I knew the type of people we had. We were doing all the right
things. It just wasn't falling our way.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've been around long enough to know that you've got to
keep chipping away at it. You can't get discouraged. Don't try and
set the world on fire. Just go and run your race. Then, everything
will start coming around.''
</P>
<P>
   It started toward the back half of last season, when at one
point Dunn made it to three straight final rounds. If Scelzi hadn't
been in the opposite lane, who knows what might have happened.
</P>
<P>
   The fact it was Scelzi only made Dunn and company work harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone talks about Scelzi, Cory McClenathan, Kenny Bernstein
and all those top guys,'' Dunn said. ``We want to be mentioned in
that group, too. We want to get to that next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. &QL;

GUTSY RACE COULD WIN GORDON FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For once, Jeff Gordon didn't dominate.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't lead the most laps, and he wasn't even in the top
three for much of the race.
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon still won the Daytona 500, and years from now,
stock-car historians may turn back the pages to this race and
signal it as the one that finally made believers out of so many
non-Gordon fans.
</P>
<P>
   Because, for whatever reason he is disliked, whether it's due to
his California roots or landing a dream ride with Hendrick
Motorsports without having to bust his butt on NASCAR's Saturday
night short-track circuits, no one can deny that Gordon didn't
drive the guts out of last Sunday's heart-stopping race.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Dale Earnhardt was nearly at his very best, Gordon
was better.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, Gordon was Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   When Earnhardt pressed the black Chevy Monte Carlo's grill up
against Gordon's rear end in the race's waning moments, a lot of
drivers might have panicked.
</P>
<P>
   Not Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon took one look in the rearview mirror, saw the sneering
Earnhardt peering over the steering wheel and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it's all about,'' Gordon might have been
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Gordon took the lead from a stunned Rusty Wallace with
a daring move entering Turn 1.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of move Earnhardt has made throughout a mostly
spectacular career, the kind of move all fans expect from their
favorite drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon made it and never once thought what the ramifications
might be.
</P>
<P>
   It's what all the great drivers would have done, even the
unfortunate ones who never have won the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   That Gordon did it in an attempt to capture the sport's most
prestigious winner's trophy is testament to his desire to be the
very best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have (made that move) time and time again if I had to
just because it's the Daytona 500,'' Gordon said. ``Probably in
some other races, you might not try something like that. But it's
the Daytona 500.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he won, Earnhardt would have said something like that. So
would Junior Johnson. And Cale Yarborough.
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon said it, and even those fans still unwilling to be
lured into his camp probably gained new respect for the driver.
</P>
<P>
   If they didn't, it's their loss, not Gordon's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I was the perfect type of driver that all those fans
out there wanted, I don't think everybody would be cheering,''
Gordon said. ``If I only won two or three races a year for the last
couple of years, and maybe one championship, I still don't think
they'd all be cheering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the alternative, and that's to go out there and win as
much as I can. . . . Whatever comes with that comes with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that my fan base continues to grow. I'm sure it even
grew after (Sunday).''
</P>
<P>
   Even rival car owners appreciated Gordon's late-race savvy and
his post-race accolades directed at Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell anybody who will listen to me that (Gordon) is a
legend, even at his age (27),'' said Jim Mattei, whose driver,
Michael Waltrip, finished fifth. ``He's done more for this sport in
this decade than any single person. He's what the future of NASCAR
is, and I'm one of his biggest fans.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday, I'll bet a lot more fans are saying the same
thing. &QL; 
No sale &QL; 
Three-time Formula One champion Jackie Stewart recognized Gordon's
talents early on and actually tried to hire him several years ago
before he turned to the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have been the first of the international bunch to see
the potential in him,'' Stewart said. ``I guess one day I`d like to
see him sitting in an F-1 car and maybe give him a test and let him
have a drive around. In fact, I spoke to him several months ago and
offered him that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's clearly an enormously talented driver. (But) I think,
unfortunately, he is making so much money now in his own little
area that it would be difficult for him to see the logic in leaving
that guaranteed marketplace and going into (F-1) racing.'' &QL;

LAKERS RIP SPURS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Outside the Forum, a weathered ``Help
Wanted'' sign hung still, like a desperate beacon for help. Inside,
the Laker Corp.'s human resources department awaited word from
their top candidate for the newly vacated position of power
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, the applicant, a Mr. Worm, was still evaluating
career opportunities with other corporations. And while he dithered
and delayed, the Lakers and their depleted corps of power forwards
took on one of their toughest rival firms, the Twin Towers of San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Robert Horry, Travis Knight and, well, that
tattooed guy also, the Lakers managed to play one of their best
games of the season, taking down the Spurs 106-94 before a rabid
sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers shot a season-high 56.9 percent to beat the Spurs for
a sixth consecutive time and record their first three-game winning
streak of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Facing David Robinson and Tim Duncan, it was enough of a concern
that the Lakers were without Horry, lost indefinitely to an
irregular heartbeat. But by tipoff, they also found themselves
without Travis Knight, their top backup at the position, whose
sprained left ankle was too much to bear.
</P>
<P>
   And Dennis Rodman? He was in the building, but nowhere near the
Laker bench, still without a signed contract and taking the weekend
to make the decision he's failed to make the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   His only appearance of the night was a stroll down the aisle at
courtside late in the fourth quarter that got the 17,505 in
attendance in a frenzy and a brief ``Rod-man'' chant.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' real saviors this night were Shaquille O'Neal with
28 points, Kobe Bryant with 21 and Derek Harper with a season-high
18 on 8-of-9 shooting in just 25 minutes. Eddie Jones scored 16.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan led the Spurs with 26, but missed half his 20 shots. Sean
Elliot added 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off back-to-back routs of Charlotte and Dallas, but
without a victory over a legitimate contender since Feb. 8 _ when
they beat the Spurs in San Antonio _ the Lakers needed a victory to
maintain any sense of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have a mental letdown,'' Bryant said. ``When you
beat a team by 20 points, you can come into the next game feeling
overconfident, feeling too comfortable. You want to try to avoid
that as much as you can and forget about what happened the last two
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Overconfidence ceased to be a problem once the Lakers realized
they were minus two forwards and down to 10 players not wearing
designer suits.
</P>
<P>
   Before tipoff, Harris had sought to reassure himself and
everyone else that the Lakers would be OK _ ``Robert played really
well in San Antonio, but we didn't have Travis. At least now we
have Travis.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Knight was scratched, and Corie Blount stepped into the
starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan wasted no time taking advantage of the depleted lineup,
scoring six points in the first four minutes of the game. But a
combination of Blount, Sean Rooks, Shaquille O'Neal and a few spare
parts held Duncan to just seven the rest of the half, and Robinson
to four points, and the Lakers kept the score close, trailing 50-45
at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Duncan got loose again _ for 11 points in the third
quarter _ it hardly mattered, because his teammates had
disappeared. The Lakers outscored the Spurs 30-20 in the quarter as
San Antonio shot 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: As expected, the Lakers placed rookies Tyronn Lue
(back spasms) and Sam Jacobson (broken finger) on the injured list
to reduce the roster from 14 to 12 on the NBA's cutdown day. Under
NBA rules they must sit out at least five games. &QL;

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-U.S. (Washington) _ In a joint news conference with
President Chirac of France, President Clinton declared that Serbian
leaders will be ``held accountable'' if peace talks on Kosovo
collapse and a NATO bombing campaign is needed. By Elizabeth
Becker. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MOOD (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ As the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, pondered the West's threat of air strikes and
rebuffed a visit from a U.S. envoy, Christopher Hill, U.S. and
Western diplomatic and aid workers began to leave Yugoslavia in
preparation for potential NATO bombing in the event the Kosovo
peace effort fails. By Steven Erlanger. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   KURD-MANHUNT (Washington) _ The United States worked for four
months to help Turkey hunt down Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish rebel
leader, U.S. officials said on Friday. U.S. diplomatic pressure
backed by intelligence-gathering helped drive Ocalan into an
increasingly desperate search for refuge, the officials said. By
Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   KURD-GREECE (Athens, Greece) _ Since Turkish security forces
seized Abdullah Ocalan in Nairobi, Kenya, where he had been hiding
in the Greek Embassy, and triumphantly hauled him, blindfolded, to
Turkey for trial on charges of terrorism, Greece has been nurturing
a deep identity crisis. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-BADGEMAKER (JINXIANG, China) _ From this remote coastal
town Chen Jiashu's influence spreads all over the world. Chen is
the owner of China's biggest manufacturer of badges and pins, a
world leader in the field. ``In recent years,'' he said, flipping
through books displaying his products, ``we've been making insignia
for Ford, badges for the U.S. police forces, emblems for the U.N.
forces and, I'm pretty sure, for the U.S. military, too. Though I'm
not really sure which is which, of course, since I can't read any
of them.'' By Elisabeth Rosenthal. With map.
</P>
<P>
   SAIPAN-WORKERS (Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands) _ Saipan is a
curious halfway point between the United States and China, most
clearly reflected in the disparity between the ambitions of Chinese
workers and the objections of American lawyers. Work conditions and
pay scales on Saipan are clearly better than in China, but fall
short of American standards. The contracts that workers sign before
they leave China include promises _ not to strike, not to discuss
problems with outsiders, not to become pregnant _ that are
acceptable to Chinese workers, even though they shock American
investigators. Such contracts are illegal in the United States, but
are signed in China. By Seth Faison. With photos.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DEATH-PENALTY-BIAS (Lincoln, Neb.) _ An American Indian who was
adopted by Quakers and then killed two people and who now faces the
death penalty has become a national cause for Quakers who want his
life spared. He has been granted a stay of execution under a recent
amendment to the Nebraska constitution guaranteeing all Nebraska
citizens equal rights under the law. By Pam Belluck.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-ENGINEERS (Northampton, Mass.) _ Smith College, in a bid
to help alter an imbalance and as part of its efforts to shift its
lingering white-glove image, will become the first women's college
to open an engineering department. Its board of trustees is
expected to approve the $12.5 million plan on Saturday with the
first engineering course to be offered in the fall. By Ethan
Bronner. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   FLIPPER-PARDON (Washington) _ President Clinton posthumously
pardons Lt. Henry Flipper, a former slave who was the first black
officer commissioned from West Point, clearing him of court-martial
charges driven by racism. By David Stout. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-POLITICS (Hollywood) _ It's that time again in
Hollywood, when that mostly Democratic community focuses on the
potential presidential candidates who troop in almost every week to
gather support from the rich and super-rich. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON _ (Moved in ``w'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   OSHA-ERGONOMICS (Washington) _ The Clinton administration
promised relief on Friday to millions of workers with aching backs,
crippled fingers, sore wrists and other physical problems caused or
aggravated by their jobs. The Labor Department took the first
formal step to require employers to redesign jobs and alter work
stations to accommodate workers suffering injuries to the neck,
back, arms and hands and to help prevent such injuries. By Robert
Pear.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TRADE-REPORT (Washington) _ The trade deficit in goods and
services narrowed in December but widened to a record level in the
full year. December's deficit shrank to $13.8 billion from $15.3
billion in November. Exports declined 0.6 percent, reflecting
weaker foreign demand for industrial supplies and auto parts.
Imports fell 2.1 percent, partly because of lower oil prices. In
all of 1998, the deficit expanded to a record $168.6 billion, up
from the previous year's $110.2 billion, in a reflection of the
dollar's strength and the domestic economy's vigor. By David E.
Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   RETIREES-TRAVEL (Undated) _ Retirees have always been big
travelers, but now they are showing a penchant for high-adventure
travel more typical of those half their age. These days, many older
people, even octogenarians, can be found riding elephants in India,
horseback riding in Costa Rica and bungee jumping in New Zealand.
And the adventure-travel industry is rushing to accommodate them.
By Edwin McDowell. With photos.
</P>
<P>
   OLIVETTI-TELECOM (Rome) _ Olivetti SpA shares rose on Friday
amid speculation that a board meeting of Italy's No. 2 phone
company on Sunday would approve a bid worth at least $53 billion
for its bigger rival, Telecom Italia SpA. By John Tagliabue and
Laura M. Holson.
</P>
<P>
   G7-MEETING (Frankfurt, Germany) _ With arguments continuing
about interest rates and currency levels, the Group of 7's finance
ministers, including Treasury Secretary Rubin, and central bankers
will meet in Bonn this weekend. By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   NEC-RESTRUCTURE (Tokyo) _ NEC Corp., one of the world's largest
semiconductor manufacturers and an emblem of Japan's business
success, announced a broad restructuring Friday that will include
one of the most sweeping labor reductions ever undertaken by a
major Japanese company. By Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ Burned by a searing
cross-examination of a senior Compaq Computer Corp. executive,
Microsoft Corp. and Compaq tried Friday to regain ground in federal
court, though they may have helped the government as much as
themselves. By Joel Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT (Moved in ``e'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-LANGUAGE (Undated) _ ``Off Cspring: Wuzup? Prettyfli5:
n2m Off Cspring: well g/g c ya.'' In the chat room, written and
spoken language slur together. Here, a correctly spelled word is a
sign of the inarticulate and an innovative abbreviation is prized
above all else. The protocol of informality that marks electronic
communication for Andrew Walker, 12, aka Off Cspring, and millions
of others has set off a debate about whether the Internet serves to
invigorate language or strip it of its expressive power. By Amy
Harmon. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   REGIONAL-STUDIES (Undated) _ Academic centers are popping up
everywhere to bore into the soul of the Southwest and the Great
Plains, the South and New England. The study of regional culture
and politics, folkways and eccentricities, long dismissed as the
minor leagues of academic scholarship, is fashionable at American
universities as it has not been since at least the 1930s. Still,
amid the celebration of regional distinctiveness, a nagging
question persists: are there still distinctive regions to
celebrate? By Peter Applebome.

<P>
   LEWIS-COLUMN (Washington) _ As Kenneth Starr conducted his
relentless investigation of President Clinton, many Americans were
troubled. ``What can we do about it?'' they asked in frustration.
But they could do nothing, because Starr was not accountable to our
political process. By Anthony Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPORTS (Moved in ``s'' category) &LR;

   BBA-ARATON-COLUMN (Tampa, Fla.) _ A Sports of The Times column
that looks at the most recent Yankee madness _ the blockbuster
trade involving Clemens and Wells _ through the eyes of a new
member of the team, left-hander Ed Yarnell. The former Mets
prospect said his first day with the Yankees was an eye-opener. By
Harvey Araton.
</P>
<P>
   BBA-YANKS-PITCHERS (Tampa, Fla.) _ Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush,
two-thirds of the package sent to Toronto for Roger Clemens, were
luxuries to manager Joe Torre, specialists on a roster of stars.
The Yankees will win without them. But sometime before the July 31
trade deadline, the Yankees will have to replace Bush and Lloyd _
maybe with someone like Jimmy Key, the veteran left-hander who

   BOX-WHITAKER-TRINIDAD (New York) _ Pernell Whitaker believes he
has turned back the clock some 14 years. He believes that when
Felix Trinidad steps into the ring against him Saturday night at

TRAIL BLAZERS LEAVE CELTICS BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ After two down-to-the-wire, strategy-matching,
insomniac-rewarding performances out here on the Left Coast, the
Celtics submitted a certifiable bow-wow Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   They were obliterated by the Trail Blazers, 106-86, as the
Portland players spent the night taking turns going over the
Celtics for rebounds and around them for baskets. The Blazers got
21 points and 18 rebounds from Brian Grant, who brutalized Antoine
Walker before retiring to a standing ovation with 7:25 remaining
and Portland comfortably ahead by 22. ``Brian Grant was huge,''
said coach Mike Dunleavy.
</P>
<P>
   He sure was. So were his mates. The Blazers' inside dominance
was best reflected in the final numbers for rebounds (52-37),
blocked shots (10-4), and free throws (38-13). It was a
manhandling, men against boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got physically overpowered in the frontcourt,'' said
Rick Pitino. The Celtics coach knows he must do something about the
team's physical presence _ or lack thereof _ even if it means
trading one of the club's assets. ``We're getting dominated on the
glass,'' he said. ``If you don't rebound the basketball, you don't
win in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said he is contemplating moving Walker to small forward,
but that would mean taking time from either Paul Pierce or Ron
Mercer. Walker had 15 points and 6 rebounds but could not deal with
Grant underneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very active. But that's his job _ to rebound the
basketball,'' Walker said. ``He does it very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss continued the Celtics' she-loves-me, she-loves-me-not
season. Through seven games, they've gone
loss-win-loss-win-loss-win-loss. Their road trip concludes Sunday
afternoon in Washington, D.C., against the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics had few bright spots. One was Pierce, who had 22
points and 6 rebounds. Tony Battie had his best game as a Celtic
with 16 points, 5 rebounds, 3 blocked shots, and 2 steals. But you
had an idea it was going to be a long night when Pitino sent in
12th man Greg Minor in the first quarter. Another bad sign: Eric
Riley, Friday night's sacrificial starting center, played only
seven minutes and fouled out without taking a shot or getting a
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics led briefly, 4-0, then were overrun. The
hopelessness of the evening was illustrated when Blazers conductor
Damon Stoudamire (14 points, 7 assists) missed his first four
shots, picked up two quick fouls, and hit the pine. In came Greg
Anthony, who scored 11 points in the first quarter alone, knocking
down three 3-pointers, including one from midcourt as the buzzer
sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Grant also set the tone in the first, collecting 6 points and 6
rebounds despite not making a shot from the floor. He was
constantly around the ball, many times retrieving his own misses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He controlled the glass and he got into the paint,'' Dunleavy
said. ``He's a warrior. Brian's an effort player. Against Walker,
we just wanted him to go after him and make him work hard on the
defensive end. I think Brian made him do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Walker, ``It just wasn't our night. You're going to have
nights like that. They played well. Give them credit. The big thing
for us is that we have to bounce back and finish this road trip at
.500.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland led by 8 after one, by 11 at the half, and by 12 after
three. The Celtics not only have not led at halftime once this
season, they also have trailed by 10 points or more in every game.
</P>
<P>
   They were down 10 after three quarters against the Grizzlies and
made their big comeback. But that was then and this was Portland.
The Blazers opened the fourth with a 10-2 run, and it was basically
garbage time the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the Blazers had a much-too-high shooting percentage on
fast breaks, Pitino once again was upset with his team's transition
defense, a season-long concern. The coach also expressed amazement
at the number of short, uncontested shots the Celtics missed. While
several qualified, the two most glaring were wide-open layups by
Popeye Jones and Dwayne Schintzius.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, those two misses summed up the evening for the
Celtics. By Sunday afternoon, they'll be somewhere else and playing
someone else. That was reason enough to get out of town.

   PARIS _ If you listened to the album ``From There to Here''
(Columbia) not knowing what it was, you'd be surprised to learn
that the bass player was the leader and that he was Clint
Eastwood's son.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kyle Eastwood says the name ha disadvantages as well
as advantages, the fact remains that it's not a bad name at all.
What he means is it balances out _ good luck and good genes on one
hand, questionable authenticity on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Without the name it would have been a lot more difficult for him
to reach, let alone persuade, such musicians as Billy Childs, Oscar
Brashear, Plas Johnson (the saxophonist who played the ``Pink
Panther'' theme), the percussionist Peter Erskine (Weather Report)
and Joni Mitchell (singing Marvin Gaye's ``Trouble Man'') to record
on his debut album.
</P>
<P>
   Remember though: Name or no name, people of such reputation and
caliber would not lend their own names to a faulty project.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the contrabass is far from the easiest way to capitalize
on the name of a nabob film-star father. As a child, Kyle played a
role in his father's movie, ``Honkytonk Man,'' and it would have
been easier and more lucrative to follow that career than learning
how to play the jazz bass.
</P>
<P>
   It's a high-risk job, a lot of responsibility and potential
grief _ there's a special circle in hell reserved for bad bass
players.
</P>
<P>
   If you are ambitious for fame or fortune, the odds are against
you. People go to the restroom during a bass solo. But there's a
lot of pride involved.
</P>
<P>
   Bass players are aware, even if the average listener is not,
that they have the real power and that the musicians know it. They
play the only truly essential instrument in the band. Without a
sturdy bass line, the center will not hold.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood is confident enough to lay back on his first record
under his name. True to the nature of his function, he has been
careful not to put himself in front of the other players. There is
a modest number of bass solos, and his walking is not
ostentatiously mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Presentation is varied _ standards, originals, instrumentals,
vocals (by Julia Fordham and Diana King as well as Mitchell), a
combo, and the big band version of Tom Waits's ``I Beg Your
Pardon,'' featuring Mark Isham and David Sanchez, sounds like a Gil
Evans/Miles Davis collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The casting is intelligent, the style consistent, the pattern
obviously cut from one piece of cloth. It's more than a merely
respectable first record.
</P>
<P>
   He feels no pressure to prove anything to anyone. He speaks
slowly, shyly, convincingly: ``If I let it bother me every time
people asked me about my dad then I'd be bothered a lot. He's
always been my dad, always will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is do the best I can and people either accept it
or they don't. If they don't, there's not much I can do about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz was always in the house. He and his parents listened to
Charlie Parker records together. When his father was producing a
jazz documentary called ``Straight No Chaser,'' they sat around for
hours watching a stack of Thelonious Monk videotapes. Quality
time. &QL;

   The bass caught his ear early on. He found that he was usually
paying attention to the lower register. One thing he likes about
the bass is that its role is essential for both rhythm and harmony.
</P>
<P>
   He started on the electric bass-guitar in Pebble Beach High
School, near Carmel, Calif., of which his father was the mayor for
a while. Once he learned basic tuning, scales and chords it became

<P>
   He learned R&AMP;B, Motown and reggae tunes by ear. He had friends

</P>
<P>
   When he switched to the contrabass, he began to practice all day
long. It is both a mentally and physically difficult instrument.
Whole days would go by and he wouldn't leave the house. He
practiced bowing, improved his intonation, learned the repertoire,
got more comfortable with improvising.
</P>
<P>
   His father likes to play Fats Waller tunes and boogie woogie on
the piano. He has a good left hand and he showed his son how it
worked. Maybe that had something to do with Kyle's original choice

   Starting off his career, Kyle moved down to Los Angeles for
eight years. He got the opportunity to play with Jack Sheldon,
Mundell Lowe, Teddy Edwards and Clark Terry. But time began to be
on his hands there, and he moved to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   He says he likes the ``craziness'' in New York. There was more
of an opportunity to play there and ``along with my family, playing
music is the only thing that is important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He lives in TriBeCa with his wife, the Spanish actress Laura
Gomez, and their 5-year-old daughter, Graylen.

   Since the album was released last autumn, his quintet has worked
fairly steadily. Leading a working band means that the music has
the opportunity to evolve. It has come together in only a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   A month-long European tour in April will include France,
Britain, the Netherlands, Austria, Spain and the Czech Republic.

<P>
   He feels at home being part of the expanded family of musicians.
``The musicians have been pretty accepting. When they first hear

   PARIS _ If you listened to the album ``From There to Here''
(Columbia) not knowing what it was, you'd be surprised to learn
that the bass player was the leader and that he was Clint
Eastwood's son.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kyle Eastwood says the name has disadvantages as well
as advantages, the fact remains that it's not a bad name at all.
What he means is it balances out _ good luck and good genes on one
hand, questionable authenticity on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Without the name it would have been a lot more difficult for him
to reach, let alone persuade, such musicians as Billy Childs, Oscar
Brashear, Plas Johnson (the saxophonist who played the ``Pink

 c.1999 International Herald Tribune  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Almost regardless of what may be decided this weekend
at the peace conference on Kosovo, there will be no lasting peace
or democracy in southeastern Europe until the NATO allies have a
fundamental policy for the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing, which the allies are threatening, may actually
reinforce each side's positions in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, establishing peace and democracy in only one area such
as Kosovo _ as Western countries are currently planning _ will only
be of very limited value.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans have never been amenable to easy solutions imposed
from outside. Even at the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union
gradually lost control over Yugoslavia, Albania and Romania, while
the West barely contained the perennial Greek-Turkish disputes,
despite the fact that both countries were NATO members and
therefore, at least formally, allies.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the Cold War period, the current condition of the
Balkans is quite favorable. Although the Yugoslav war has played
havoc with the economies of the area and the Balkans' aspiration to
project an image of stability, the region is now at the top of the
European agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has NATO mounted in Yugoslavia the biggest military
operation in its existence, but also many international
organizations are now deeply engaged in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union is financing infrastructure projects designed
to connect Romania and Bulgaria to main transport routes, Turkey is
paraded as one of Europe's key strategic allies and the United
States is mediating in the Greek-Turkish dispute over Cyprus and
the islands of the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the promise of full integration into both
NATO and the EU has been extended to the region's states in return
for their good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of this century, the great powers regarded the
Balkans as partly a geographic region and partly a disease for
which effective quarantine measures were the only adequate cure.
The Balkans may yet end the century in the same situation.
</P>
<P>
   The story is not one of mischief or cynicism (although there was
plenty of both) but of a lack of vision, which could lead to missed
historic opportunities and continued misery for the region's
people.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton peace accords that put a halt to the Bosnian war in
November 1995 were based on a set of dubious assumptions. The first
was the belief that, in order to reunite the Bosnian state, one
must start by separating the various fighting armies.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with that was the belief that ``the people'' are
``good'' and desire peace and that only their leaders could be
``nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the people were allowed the opportunity to vote freely, the
thinking goes, the warlords would be removed from power and all
Bosnians would live together again. The Dayton accords provided for
elections. In addition, there was the assumption that there was no
crisis that a well-written constitution could not solve.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton included a fine constitutional specimen, complete with
rotating presidencies, constitutional courts and arbitral
tribunals. But, finally, there was the belief that talking tough to
the ``natives'' and threatening unspecified retribution without
actually having to commit to any action should be sufficient to
bring about peace.
</P>
<P>
   At every step, the troops that were dispatched to Bosnia
carefully eschewed any military involvement while the Western
governments increased their rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in Bosnia has stopped, and we should all be
grateful for that. Nevertheless, Bosnia remains divided, and cut
away from its natural economic partners in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But, in many respects, Bosnia is yesterday's story, for the
West's real challenge is now with the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia represents the classic example of what can go wrong
in the transition from a communist society. The war, for which
President Slobodan Milosevic bears heavy responsibility,
perpetuated a disguised communist rule and postponed decisions
about the nature of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic fought the war in the name of Serbian unity and ethnic
purity. Yet Serbs are still divided and Serbia still contains the
highest number of ethnic minorities among all the republics of the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Having been the most integrated Eastern European state before
1989, Yugoslavia is now a pariah in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   To complete this cycle of tragedies, the Yugoslavia that
Milosevic invented after 1991 remains a rickety affair. Montenegro,
Serbia's partner in the federation, looks increasingly unreliable.
Moreover, the institutions of the state are an even greater farce
than they were during Tito's dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   For a number of years after the demise of old Yugoslavia, the
Yugoslav federal presidency, which was meant to represent both
Montenegro and Serbia, remained a mere cipher designed to obscure
Milosevic's political control.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia and _ to a lesser extent _ Montenegro have therefore
ended with the worst possible outcome: They are the only former
Yugoslav republics not to have a new identity.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has failed in his nationalist dreams, but succeeded in
destroying his country's civic society. Ten years ago, the people
of Yugoslavia were in the forefront of all communist states. Today,
Yugoslavia is at the bottom of the pile, with no salvation in
sight. In addition, there is more to come, for the crucial issue of
Kosovo has yet to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, the United States and the European Union have
solely relied on negotiations, exclusively with the existing
regimes, often in the hope of achieving brief periods of illusory
peace. The leaders of the region, in turn, have portrayed
themselves as saviors.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic has clearly not worked. Far from being upholders of
any solution, the autocratic leaders in some of the countries that
call themselves Yugoslavia's ``successors'' are actually part of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But a serious Western plan of stabilizing the region is still
feasible. It should start with establishing democratic roots in the
capitals of southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade, Sarajevo, Zagreb and Tirana would be the targets for
the creation of fundamental democratic institutions, which would
uphold human rights and freedom of the media and implement an
economic revival plan.
</P>
<P>
   Calculated pressure would be imposed upon the current regimes to
push them out of power. The region's dictators should be attacked
where they hurt most: by taking measures to recover the billions of
state assets that they have managed to spirit away from their
countries.
</P>
<P>
   And, ultimately, the prospect of genuine European integration,
as well as economic reconstruction, should be promised to those
countries that manage to emerge from their current political rut.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it may be argued that such an approach will take
years to bear fruit and cost a great deal. But billions of dollars
have already been spent in peacekeeping operations, and the
proposal is to spend much more in Kosovo now.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, there is neither peace nor stability. It is time
to go back to the fundamentals, however long it takes. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ Almost regardless of what may be decided this weekend
at the peace conference on Kosovo, there will be no lasting peace
or democracy in southeastern Europe until the NATO allies have a
fundamental policy for the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing, which the allies are threatening, may actually
reinforce each side's positions in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, establishing peace and democracy in only one area such
as Kosovo _ as Western countries are currently planning _ will only
be of very limited value.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans have never been amenable to easy solutions imposed
from outside. Even at the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union
gradually lost control over Yugoslavia, Albania and Romania, while
the West barely contained the perennial Greek-Turkish disputes,
despite the fact that both countries were NATO members and
therefore, at least formally, allies.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the Cold War period, the current condition of the
Balkans is quite favorable. Although the Yugoslav war has played
havoc with the economies of the area and the Balkans' aspiration to
project an image of stability, the region is now at the top of the
European agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has NATO mounted in Yugoslavia the biggest military
operation in its existence, but also many international
organizations are now deeply engaged in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union is financing infrastructure projects designed
to connect Romania and Bulgaria to main transport routes, Turkey is
paraded as one of Europe's key strategic allies and the United
States is mediating in the Greek-Turkish dispute over Cyprus and
the islands of the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the promise of full integration into both
NATO and the EU has been extended to the region's states in return
for their good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of this century, the great powers regarded the
Balkans as partly a geographic region and partly a disease for
which effective quarantine measures were the only adequate cure.
The Balkans may yet end the century in the same situation.
</P>
<P>
   The story is not one of mischief or cynicism (although there was
plenty of both) but of a lack of vision, which could lead to missed
historic opportunities and continued misery for the region's
people.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton peace accords that put a halt to the Bosnian war in
November 1995 were based on a set of dubious assumptions. The first
was the belief that, in order to reunite the Bosnian state, one
must start by separating the various fighting armies.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with that was the belief that ``the people'' are
``good'' and desire peace and that only their leaders could be
``nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the people were allowed the opportunity to vote freely, the
thinking goes, the warlords would be removed from power and all
Bosnians would live together again. The Dayton accords provided for
elections. In addition, there was the assumption that there was no
crisis that a well-written constitution could not solve.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton included a fine constitutional specimen, complete with
rotating presidencies, constitutional courts and arbitral
tribunals. But, finally, there was the belief that talking tough to
the ``natives'' and threatening unspecified retribution without
actually having to commit to any action should be sufficient to
bring about peace.
</P>
<P>
   At every step, the troops that were dispatched to Bosnia
carefully eschewed any military involvement while the Western
governments increased their rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in Bosnia has stopped, and we should all be
grateful for that. Nevertheless, Bosnia remains divided, and cut
away from its natural economic partners in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But, in many respects, Bosnia is yesterday's story, for the
West's real challenge is now with the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia represents the classic example of what can go wrong
in the transition from a communist society. The war, for which
President Slobodan Milosevic bears heavy responsibility,
perpetuated a disguised communist rule and postponed decisions
about the nature of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic fought the war in the name of Serbian unity and ethnic
purity. Yet Serbs are still divided and Serbia still contains the
highest number of ethnic minorities among all the republics of the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Having been the most integrated Eastern European state before
1989, Yugoslavia is now a pariah in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   To complete this cycle of tragedies, the Yugoslavia that
Milosevic invented after 1991 remains a rickety affair. Montenegro,
Serbia's partner in the federation, looks increasingly unreliable.
Moreover, the institutions of the state are an even greater farce
than they were during Tito's dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   For a number of years after the demise of old Yugoslavia, the
Yugoslav federal presidency, which was meant to represent both
Montenegro and Serbia, remained a mere cipher designed to obscure
Milosevic's political control.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia and _ to a lesser extent _ Montenegro have therefore
ended with the worst possible outcome: They are the only former
Yugoslav republics not to have a new identity.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has failed in his nationalist dreams, but succeeded in
destroying his country's civic society. Ten years ago, the people
of Yugoslavia were in the forefront of all communist states. Today,
Yugoslavia is at the bottom of the pile, with no salvation in
sight. In addition, there is more to come, for the crucial issue of
Kosovo has yet to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, the United States and the European Union have
solely relied on negotiations, exclusively with the existing
regimes, often in the hope of achieving brief periods of illusory
peace. The leaders of the region, in turn, have portrayed
themselves as saviors.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic has clearly not worked. Far from being upholders of
any solution, the autocratic leaders in some of the countries that
call themselves Yugoslavia's ``successors'' are actually part of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But a serious Western plan of stabilizing the region is still
feasible. It should start with establishing democratic roots in the
capitals of southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade, Sarajevo, Zagreb and Tirana would be the targets for
the creation of fundamental democratic institutions, which would
uphold human rights and freedom of the media and implement an
economic revival plan.
</P>
<P>
   Calculated pressure would be imposed upon the current regimes to
push them out of power. The region's dictators should be attacked
where they hurt most: by taking measures to recover the billions of
state assets that they have managed to spirit away from their
countries.
</P>
<P>
   And, ultimately, the prospect of genuine European integration,
as well as economic reconstruction, should be promised to those
countries that manage to emerge from their current political rut.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it may be argued that such an approach will take
years to bear fruit and cost a great deal. But billions of dollars
have already been spent in peacekeeping operations, and the
proposal is to spend much more in Kosovo now.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, there is neither peace nor stability. It is time
to go back to the fundamentals, however long it takes. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Saturday, the day after his acquittal in the Senate, it was
glibness-as-usual for Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week,'' he said in his weekly radio address, ``the
warring parties in Kosovo have been meeting at a 14th-century
castle in France in search of 21st-century peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Savoring the rich sweep of the past, the president proceeded to
enunciate two lessons from history. First, ``World War II taught us
that America could never be secure if Europe's future was in
doubt.'' Second, ``Bosnia taught us...(that) violence we fail to
oppose leads to even greater violence we will have to oppose later
at greater cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of these two lessons, the president explained, America
should intervene in Kosovo, though there should of course be ``a
clear and realistic strategy to allow us to bring our forces home
when their work is done.''
</P>
<P>
   These standard phrases constitute pretty much all Clinton has to
say about his decision to commit troops to Kosovo as part of a NATO
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, to be sure, that no such force will be
assembled: at midweek the Serbs and the ethnic-Albanian Kosovars
remained some distance from a cease-fire, without which
peacekeepers will stay at home.
</P>
<P>
   But, even if the two sides opt to keep on fighting, it is worth
pausing to consider the manner in which Clinton declared himself
willing to risk American lives for Balkan peace. It was not all
that impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Take, first, the ``lesson'' that America must intervene in
European conflicts early on. If this is really so obvious, why did
Clinton not intervene when the Kosovo bust-up began a year ago?
After all, America had long ago promised to jump into Kosovo at the
first sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush warned Serbia's dictator, Slobodan Milosevic,
that America would punish Serbia if it used force against Kosovo's
Albanian majority, and Clinton officials have echoed this threat
loudly and repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, for example, Madeleine Albright, the secretary of
state, promised that ``we are not going to stand by and watch the
Serbian authorities do in Kosovo what they can no longer get away
with doing in Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright also said, that same month, ``The time to stop the
killing is now, before it spreads.'' Yet Clinton, like America's
allies in Europe, dithered.
</P>
<P>
   Second, consider that cozy phrase in the president's Saturday
address about a clear exit strategy. He has ample political reason
to promise one of these: whenever an American president sends
troops abroad, critics accuse him of marching into a Vietnam-style
quagmire, so those critics have to be anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, at the same time, the president's talk of an exit
strategy is dishonest, and consciously so. He knows perfectly well
that no date can be set in advance for the withdrawal of
peacekeepers: in Bosnia, after all, a deadline of one year was set,
but American troops remain in place three years after the Dayton
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Mrs. Albright appeared on television to explain that
no deadline would be set in the case of Kosovo. So much for an exit
strategy, if Clinton meant a pre-timed one.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Kosovo address also failed to explain the general
principles that determine when intervention is advisable.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six years, the president has intervened in
Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia. But he has also declined to intervene in
places beset by equally serious wars, such as Chechnya, Liberia,
Sudan, Angola, Burundi, and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of these instances, America had plausible cause to
intervene: it might have felt some moral responsibility to quell
the humanitarian disaster in Liberia, a country invented by America
as a home for its ex-slaves; or in Angola, where America's
ex-Cold-War friend, Jonas Savimbi, is responsible for much of the
current carnage. But no intervention was forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plainly feels that European wars threaten American
interests more than far-off African ones; not least because they
worry his European allies, whose cooperation he wants.
</P>
<P>
   In his radio address, he made the point that violence in Kosovo
might spread into the neighboring countries of Albania and
Macedonia, pouring fresh poison on the relationship between Greece
and Turkey (now rendered even murkier by the Ocalan business),
which are both NATO members.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton's critics, such as Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of
Texas, retort that European wars should be fixed by European
powers. Even if the Hutchison idea is not entirely practical, it
has some political force.
</P>
<P>
   But, rather than tackling it explicitly and head-on, Clinton
brushed past, talking soothingly about how America can ``make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's glibness on Kosovo is not an isolated case. It is the
hallmark of his foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, the president has spotted a tough issue, taken
an admirable position on what should be done, and then failed to
implement it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton believes in freer trade, but lacks the perseverance to
build a constituency for it. He wants to pay America's debts to the
United Nations, but has not persuaded Congress to go along with
this.
</P>
<P>
   Just at the moment, Clinton is preparing to deploy an
anti-missile defense system. But he has not publicly explained why
he has dropped his old opposition to this scheme, or what he means
to do about the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which is relevant to
the nuclear balance with Russia and which may now have to be
renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is a brilliant student who thinks he can succeed by
pulling an all-nighter at the last minute. This is not the best way
to conduct American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But, even though the Kosovo example is typical, it stands out
for its seriousness. If a NATO force is sent to Kosovo, it may well
have a difficult time: hard-liners on either side will resent the
cease-fire deal, and may take out their frustrations on the hapless
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Ivo Daalder, a former Clinton official now at the Brookings
Institution, worries that Kosovo might turn into a Somalia-style
mess: American troops will get killed, triggering a hasty
withdrawal and undermining American internationalism for a good
while thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are always risks in peacekeeping. America is
strong enough to take these risks on _ provided it has a president
who explains them honestly. &QL;

MARINERS' BOBBY AYALA WANTS TO WIN BACK THE FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ It didn't hit Bobby Ayala until this week, when
the Mariner clubhouse at the Peoria Sports Complex started filling
up.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, who lives nearby and has been working out at the complex
for months, has seen the rest of the pitching staff arrive. No
Heathcliff Slocumb. No Paul Spoljaric. No Mike Timlin. No Bob
Wells.
</P>
<P>
   That's 2551/3 bullpen innings gone from 1998. Only one reliever
who threw more than 25 innings remains.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought Ayala would be the last man standing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would be the first guy to be gone,'' Ayala said.
``It's a business, and it's kind of hard to work trades with other
teams, but personally I thought I'd be the first one.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariner executives assured fans all winter that Ayala had thrown
his last pitch for the team. Two weeks ago, in a
question-and-answer session at the Mariners Fan Fest, club
president Chuck Armstrong said, ``We think Bobby Ayala will be a
very good pitcher again _ for another team.'' The crowd went wild.
</P>
<P>
   Even manager Lou Piniella, an Ayala loyalist, conceded this
week, ``I would think that a change of scenery would do him good,
and I'm saying that on his behalf, not ours.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners simply have found no takers. Ayala went 1-10
last year with a 7.29 earned run average, and he will make $1.8
million this year. The Mariners figure they might as well see how
he throws this spring in hopes of increasing teams' interest.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala understands this, but he doesn't really want to move on.
The Man You Love To Hate would prefer to win you back.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I want) to let (fans) know I'm a down-to-earth person and I'm
capable of pitching,'' Ayala said. ``No matter what they do, boo me
or not, I'm still gonna love them. I have nothing bad to say to
them. One day, when I'm throwing the ball good, I hope they
remember what they said about me or all the boos that they had, and
hopefully they will turn them around and think different of Bobby
Ayala.''
</P>
<P>
   As his '98 season spun out of control, Ayala stopped talking to
the media, closing an outlet that could have helped him communicate
with the fans who booed him. Now, he says, opening up is cathartic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had too many thoughts about failing and not doing my job,''
Ayala said. ``There's a lot of things like that in my head, and it
builds up. I realize, hey, I can't hold all that stuff in. I just
feel more free and open _ talk and let it out. It makes me feel a
lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala felt awful after last season. He didn't analyze and he
didn't agonize. He just went home and tried to forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a terrible year for myself,'' Ayala said. ``I was
very disappointed at the year I had and the way I pitched. But when
I got home, I just sat around and got away from baseball. ... I
didn't have to worry about going out the next day and seeing what's
gonna happen if I pitched again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala didn't think about baseball until starting workouts two
months ago. He put his career on rewind, passing over his five
years with Seattle and stopping on 1992 and '93 with the Cincinnati
Reds. He remembered having success there when he started each
inning from a windup instead of from the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of workouts, Ayala told his plan to pitching
coach Stan Williams, who approved an abbreviated windup that
stresses balance, which has sometimes been a problem for Ayala.
Apart from that, Ayala plans to keep things the same _ and it might
not be a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to find anyone who thinks the 29-year-old Ayala is a
lost cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``His arm strength is fine,'' said one American League scout.
``There's nothing wrong with his arm at all. He throws hard, and
his split is still a pretty good pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problem is his delivery's been flawed too long to be
fixed, and it's going to prevent him from being more consistent
with his pitches. But he competes well, and obviously he needs a
change of scenery.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Dan Wilson played with Ayala in the Reds' system and
came to Seattle in the same trade before the '94 season. He's not
sure Ayala has to go. Wilson said Ayala has ``unbelievable talent''
but faltered last year because he left the splitter too high in the
strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't like to see anybody go, because we're all family,''
Wilson said. ``We all heard the same (rumors), but I'm glad he's
here. It gives him the chance to prove to everyone he can still do
the job.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all Ayala wants.
</P>
<P>
   A trade wouldn't surprise him, and if it happens, he said he'd
thank the Mariners _ ``They've taken care of me, big-time'' _ and
be on his way.
</P>
<P>
   But he welcomes the chance to repair his relationship with
Mariner fans. He grew immune to the jeering, he said, and even was
able to laugh about it. On the season's last day, when fans booed a
giveaway Ayala cap, he rose from the bullpen and took a bow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still can work, I believe in it,'' Ayala said. ``I'm not
going to ever let myself down and say no, that it can't work. But
if Seattle thinks different, it's their job, they own me. They're
in charge of my move.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would still like to pitch here and prove to them that I
am still capable of pitching the way Bobby Ayala can pitch.''

CLEMENS TRADE A LESSON FOR MARINERS ON HOW TO PLAY AN ACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Kingdome people, nearing the end of a nice run,
have mailed out special hankies. Mine is a cheery square of bright
white cotton bordered with tiny red hearts.
</P>
<P>
   There is an inscription: ``Wave goodbye to the Kingdome.''
</P>
<P>
   It is good to see someone in this city has a sense of humor. The
end is near. And maybe not just for the Kingdome, either.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Roger Clemens-to-the-Yankees-for-David Wells
post-trade pity party, Mariners style.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the pledge of optimism offered here just a week ago
when the Mariners convened their pre-spring training media briefing
and offered hope that this year's club will contend for the
American League West Division title?
</P>
<P>
   Forget about it. There is a time for the heady relief of
optimism and then there's a time to stop acting like a fool.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to get out the rye bread and mustard. Mariner
watchers have just been grand salamied.
</P>
<P>
   As the new ballpark gets trimmed in retro-look brick, as the
fences get moved in so the left-center power alley doesn't make
Alex Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez nuts and as plans for the
Kingdome's implosion are being made, the good ol' Yankees have
rained on our parade.
</P>
<P>
   So have the Blue Jays, who took one look at what kind of trouble
a sourpussed power pitcher can mean for the emotional well-being of
a ballclub and decided, unlike the Mariners a year ago, to ship
their malcontent out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Jays got something out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse us, Woody Woodward and any of the 16 headless-horsemen
owners in charge of Mariner payroll and trades, but doesn't this
blockbuster deal make you squirm, even just a little?
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, it appears the baseball people in New York
and Toronto are allowed to make critical baseball decisions, which
is something we can't say for sure is happening in this city.
</P>
<P>
   Does this spring training kickoff/kick-butt trade not involve a
certain New York baseball club that, in the winter of 1997-98 when
the M's said they would not offer Randy Johnson a contract
extension, was ready to send Wells plus closer Mariano Rivera to
the Mariners for that 6-foot-10, scraggly-haired pitcher whose
strikeout power still exceeds his ability to pout, whine and go in
the tank under emotional duress?
</P>
<P>
   We believe it was the Yankees who were looking to make a deal,
only someone, somewhere in the Mariner organization decided no go,
just as someone, somewhere decided no go on a later Johnson deal
with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, now is the perfect time for some hand-wringing. We
believe Wells, who hurled a perfect game last May and was the
starting pitcher in the Yankees' 1998 World Series whipping of San
Diego, could have been a Mariner.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go to the videotape in the Mariners' archive of infamy:
</P>
<P>
   Instead of getting something huge out of the Johnson debacle _
and the beer-quaffing Wells is huge _ the Mariners were backed into
a humiliating deal at the stroke of the July 31 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a Cy Young winner and franchise saver, for three
minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   You better believe Mariner skipper Lou Piniella is down in
Arizona right now, touting second baseman Carlos Guillen as the M's
opening day leadoff hitter despite Guillen's 25 percent propensity
to strike out.
</P>
<P>
   You better believe right-handed pitcher Freddy Garcia is one of
the highly anticipated prospects in Mariner camp.
</P>
<P>
   Freddy and Carlos. Guillen and Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly names that take the sting out of losing Johnson. Not
the way Wells, Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush take some of the sting
out of the Blue Jays losing Clemens and the two Cy Youngs he picked
up in Toronto to display alongside his previous three.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Mariners see it, their two former Astro farm hands
can't make a name quick enough, because until Guillen is the second
coming of Chuck Knoblauch and until Garcia wins 20 games, strikes
out 280 and wins a Cy Young, the Johnson trade will still leave a
stench.
</P>
<P>
   The Wells-Clemens deal does nothing but remind us again of one
certain fact: The Mariners failed to secure a top-notch starter
this offseason. They failed to fill a major hole on a club that has
too much talent to waste. And they have arrived at this juncture
because for the past 18 months or more, no one stopped to think
what it would be like to open the new stadium with Butch Henry or
Billy Swift on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   No offense to Jeff Fassero and Jamie Moyer, but in the absence
of the skid-stopping Johnson, it would have been nice to have had a
guy like David Wells to lean on.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's shoulders were pretty broad. But Wells' gut is
broader, which can only be expected from a man who David Letterman
said last spring celebrated his perfect game by setting down 27
consecutive Heinekens.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, citizens of Marinerville can't drink to that.

COMMENTARY: DISMANTLE THE BARRIERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bowing to rising anger and plunging poll numbers,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani told several hundred police recruits last
week that they should go out of their way to treat people with
respect. He told the cadets that they would do a better job and
would reap ``tremendous respect'' for the Police Department if they
dealt with people politely and conducted themselves with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   At times he seemed to get carried away with his message,
suggesting, for example, that officers were, in some sense, ``civil
rights workers'' and that they should remember to say ``Yes, sir''
and ``No, sir'' while making arrests. Odd images come to mind:
officers chasing a fleeing suspect while shouting, ``Sir, please
stop!'' Or hard-nosed cops urging armed, drug-crazed individuals to
please come to their senses.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor's message was a good one, especially as it applies
to encounters between the police and people who have committed no
offense, or only minor offenses. Was the mayor serious? Was he
signaling a change in the way the police are expected to interact
with New Yorkers?
</P>
<P>
   History suggests no. The mayor has kept his eyes carefully
averted as large numbers of officers have gone into certain
neighborhoods and used their badges and their guns to suspend the
civil rights of the people who live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We own the night'' is the motto of the gung-ho Street Crimes
Unit, which is charged with, among other things, taking illegal
guns off the street. The New York Times' David Kocieniewski
reported last week that 45,084 people were stopped and frisked by
officers from the unit in 1997 and 1998. But the unit made only
4,899 arrests in 1997 and 4,647 in 1998. That means that more than
35,000 people were, as Kocieniewski wrote, ``stopped and frisked
during the last two years simply because a street crimes officer
mistakenly thought they were carrying guns.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the United States of America, not South Africa under
apartheid. The police are not supposed to search people on a whim,
and most Americans are not subjected to such searches. But it's a
different story in black and Latino neighborhoods in New York City.
As Richard Coram, a high school student in Brooklyn told me
recently, ``If you resist, you will get the beating of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   There are indications since the death of Amadou Diallo that
public support for Mayor Giuliani is eroding, and that there is
growing dissatisfaction with some of the tactics being employed by
the Police Department. The mayor's poll ratings have dropped
sharply. And criticism of misconduct by the police can now readily
be heard in most neighborhoods across the city.
</P>
<P>
   A page 1 headline in The Times on Friday said: ``After Shooting,
an Eroding Trust in the Police.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is denouncing the department as a whole, but there is a
growing sense of revulsion at some of its parts.
</P>
<P>
   Ellie Weiss, a Brooklyn high school teacher whose students are
frequently harassed by the police, said, ``It really, really
bothers me that my kids think this is a normal thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tal Strickland of Queens, was quoted in Friday's Times as saying
of the Diallo shooting, ``The horror is these things just keep
happening and piling up on each other.''
</P>
<P>
   I have interviewed many white New Yorkers who said they would
have joined recent protests against police abuses if the protests
had been led by someone other than the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think I like what's going on with the police?'' said
Audrey Rose, a resident of Brooklyn. ``I hate it. But march with
Sharpton? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Giuliani is getting the message or not, it is time for
leaders from the many different groups across the city to determine
how to continue the fight against crime without trampling on the
rights and the dignity of the innocent.
</P>
<P>
   If the mayor's comments to the police cadets were meant to be a
step in that direction, terrific. If not, others need to take up
the slack. New Yorkers need to be talking to one another _ and with
the many fair-minded members of the Police Department _ to resolve
some of these matters. There are ways to dismantle the barriers of
mistrust. They need to be found. Few things are more important to
this city.

COMMENTARY: HOUNDING HILLARY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gotham reporters have missed a few big stories over the years.
They still haven't figured out, for instance, that Bruce Wayne is
Batman.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in every story about Hillary Clinton running for the Senate
here, it is suggested that she might be scared off by a howling New
York press pack that relishes asking the unaskable.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Breslin rolled out the welcome mat in Newsday, writing
that the First Lady would face questions like: ``Is your husband
going to come here with you so the two of you can mortify the whole
city when he cavorts with young workers?''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Newfield, a columnist at The New York Post, visualized a
Hillary campaign for ``Nightline'': ``She is going to be sitting in
Katz's Delicatessen with her mouth full of knish and 30 guys are
going to be yelling at her to explain the $100,000 profit she made
in the commodity trade in Arkansas in 1979.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to conjure up tabloid headlines: ``Hillary to Israel:
Drop Dead.'' And you can almost hear the reporters raucously
calling out: ``Hey, LA-DY, First LA-DY, over here, you, Hill!''
</P>
<P>
   Some speculate that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has broken the spirit
of the New York press corps _ blocking attempts to fathom the
health of his marriage. Even a few pressies wonder if their
reputation for ferocity may be overdrawn. ``I don't know if we're
dogged bloodhounds as much as sniping chihuahuas,'' says Andrew
Kirtzman, the host of ``Inside City Hall'' on New York 1.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's tete-a-tete with Sen. Pat Moynihan about his
seat only ratcheted up the frenzy. In case this is more than an ego
trip for Mrs. Clinton, I called some media big shots to ask what
they would ask her if she runs. Here are their questions:
</P>
<P>
   Eric Mink, New York Daily News: ``In 1992, you and your husband
made a joint appearance after the Super Bowl on `60 Minutes.' The
interview in which your husband denied having had an affair with
Gennifer Flowers was credited with salvaging his primary campaign.
Exactly six years later, you sat with Matt Lauer of the `Today'
show and declared there was no substance to the allegations about
your husband and Monica Lewinsky. Don't you think, Mrs. Clinton,
that you have to acknowledge that you were made to look completely
ridiculous?''
</P>
<P>
   Don Imus: ``Do you realize that New York City is not the capital
of New York state? How will your whole Palestinian state deal fly
with all these New Yorkers? And what about your close friendship
with Mr. Hymietown, try to explain that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennet Conant, Vanity Fair: ``Do you have to bring Bill?''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Sheehy, Hillary biographer: ``I've been told by a White
House press secretary that you think that any questions about
feelings and motivations are psychobabble and yucky. New Yorkers
want to know: What do you have against therapy?''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Barrett, Village Voice: ``If you were a member of the
United States Senate, would you have voted for the welfare reform
bill that targeted women and their children? Did you kick his
(deleted) for that?''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Kolbert, The New Yorker: ``How many counties are in
New York?''
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Molloy, gossip columnist at The Daily News: ``How did you
feel the day the president said, `I'm sorry, Monica'?''
</P>
<P>
   James Stewart, author of ``Blood Sport'': ``When billing records
documenting your work on the McDougals' Castle Grande trailer park
development were discovered in the family quarters of the White
House, you said you had no idea how they got there. Do you have any
idea now?''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Johnson, Page Six, New York Post: ``What would you say
to the conspiracy theorists who believe you had Vince Foster
killed?''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Isaacson, managing editor of Time: ``Why, after all this,
would you want to be in public life?''
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Pressman, WNBC: ``To be a junior senator, are you willing
to forsake the insulation of the White House to deal every day with
people like me peppering you with questions you may not want to
answer?''
</P>
<P>
   Dominic Carter, New York 1: ``I would really press her: Do you
plan on being the first woman president?''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Dicker, New York Post: ``In which month does the northern
zone deer-hunting season open?''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dwyer, New York Daily News: ``Pick one for your team.
Sprewell or Oakley? Clemens or Wells? Donna or Rudy?''
</P>

SPORTS COLUMN: DON ' T WORRY, SPORTSMANSHIP WON'T BE CATCHING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A team turned back a victory the other day. Said they just did
not want to win that way. Thanks but no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   The wonder is that the incident happened in professional sports,
where sportsmanship seems to come along once a millennium. We are,
after all, in a world in which Pat Riley fines his basketball
players for helping an opponent off the floor, and football teams
keep victories even if they involve fifth-down touchdowns or gross
officiating mistakes at the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but the gesture of sacrifice and fair play also
took place in English soccer, which is inhabited, as all we smug
Americans know, by thugs and hooligans, on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it happened. Arsenal of London did not accept a
2-1 victory over Sheffield United eight days ago because the
winning goal was tainted by an apparently innocent breach of
ethics.
</P>
<P>
   There was no mistake by the official, just a violation of
sporting behavior that players themselves have evolved. Yes, I
know, these are the same mugs who spend much of their time fouling
and diving for every millimeter of advantage on the field, so it is
a shock when sportsmanship shows its tender little face.
</P>
<P>
   It was that noble impulse that led Alex Radulescu of Germany to
concede a let at 4-4 in the fifth set to MaliVai Washington during
a Wimbledon quarterfinal match in 1996. (Washington swept the last
two games and lavishly praised his opponent afterward.)
</P>
<P>
   Other tennis players have been known to call a let against
themselves, giving up, after all, only one point, not a precious
soccer goal or a hard-fought football touchdown. There is also an
assumption that you can trust just about any pro golfer to report a
violation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mass amount of faking and diving, in the past decade
soccer players have refined the tactic of kicking the ball out of
bounds to stop play if they see somebody down with apparent damage
to the head or a broken bone. They take the chance of being
hoodwinked, but they use their own judgment _ and the system works,
due to old-fashioned respect between opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In this Football Association cup game at Arsenal's field, a
Sheffield player went down, and the Sheffield goalkeeper kicked the
ball out of bounds, a normal tactic.
</P>
<P>
   After the player was treated _ nothing serious, as it turned out
_ Arsenal put the ball in bounds with an overhead throw. Normally,
the ball would have been allowed to bounce directly to a Sheffield
player, but this time it was intercepted by Nwankwo Kanu, a young
Nigerian substitute just acquired by Arsenal. Not grasping the
significance of the soft inbounds toss, Kanu kicked a crisp pass to
Marc Overmars, a seasoned Dutch teammate, who instinctively banged
the ball in the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheffield team went nuts, and many of the Arsenal players
were openly unhappy, but the referee did not nullify the goal
because there is no rule governing it. If he had been thinking
quickly, the referee could have waved off the goal, saying he had
not yet adjusted his watch, or some other fiction, but he counted
the goal, and the game ended at 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately afterward, the coach of Arsenal, the Frenchman
Arsene Wenger, announced that he was declining the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I offered the replay because it wasn't right to win that way _
it wasn't Arsenal,'' Wenger said, adding, ``The best we can do is
offer to replay the game here against Sheffield United.''
</P>
<P>
   The game will be replayed on Tuesday, at Arsenal's field, with
ticket prices cut in half to avoid any suggestion of chicanery to
set up an extra payday.
</P>
<P>
   English soccer referees are sputtering that the game is being
taken out of their hands, and many soccer buffs are fretting about
a dangerous precedent.
</P>
<P>
   My theory is, Sheffield deserved a second chance at the upset,
particularly because the players have arrived at the injury timeout
through their own wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, this is not going to start any worldwide Oprahfest of
athletes rushing to confession. We are not going to see Pakistani
and Indian cricket players making decisions against themselves. We
are not going to see Tour de France cyclists turning themselves in
for receiving blatant pushes by the crowds who line steep inclines
in the Pyrenees. We are not going to see hockey goalies admitting
the puck slipped over the line.
</P>
<P>
   In our own bloated and tedious sport of American football, let
us harken back to last December, when the Jets received a gift
victory because officials mistakenly ruled that Vinny Testaverde
had crossed the goal line. I never expected kindly Bill Parcells to
say, ``Hey, we don't want to make the playoffs because of some
mistake by the refs.''
</P>
<P>
   The last refusal of a touchdown may have taken place in 1940
when Cornell gave back a 7-3 victory over Dartmouth after
rudimentary game films proved the touchdown had come on a fifth
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't made that decision, we'd have been explaining
that game as long as football has a place in intercollegiate
athletics,'' said Edmund Ezra Day, the Cornell president.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, in more cutthroat competition, Notre Dame in 1961
and Miami of Florida in 1972 and Colorado in 1990 all had chances
to turn back officials' mistakes, but declined _ respectfully, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are part of the game. I never expected the Kansas City
Royals to come rushing on the field and admit Jorge Orta was
clearly out at first base in the play that turned around the 1985
World Series. I'm not holding my breath for Houston's Hakeem
Olajuwon and Scottie Pippen to say they got the superstar benefit
of chicken fouls in New Jersey on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Au contraire. Athletes are conditioned to fool the officials, to
stumble backward and draw the foul, to elicit sympathy. Arsenal
does not survive near the top of the Premier Division without its
share of discreet hackers and flailing divers.
</P>
<P>
   But here was a case in which the players' own code was violated,
probably by accident, and the players and coaches corrected the
error, before it was etched in the record books.
</P>
<P>
   My advice to nervous officials and twittery purists in England
is to chill out. The lads were surely hacking and diving all over
that green and pleasant land Saturday. Gamesmanship lives. I
reassure everybody that this is not the start of some fearful
epidemic of sportsmanship.  &QL;

LEFTHANDED PITCHERS HAVE (AS LONG AS THEY CAN PITCH) JOB SECURITY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Clemens and Mark McGwire have job security. So do Greg
Cadaret and Tony Fossas.
</P>
<P>
   With pitchers and catchers in spring training, Cadaret is in the
Los Angeles Dodgers' camp and Fossas is in the Texas Rangers' camp.
They do not have quite the same security Clemens and McGwire have;
nor do they have the salaries those stars earn. But they and their
fellow left-handed relief pitchers hold a position other players
envy. Jobs always seem to be available to them; barring injury, no
matter what their age is, teams are always ready to sign them.
</P>
<P>
   Every team would like to have a Clemens or a McGwire but cannot.
Every team makes sure it has that commodity known as the
left-handed reliever.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have them,'' said Doug Melvin, the Rangers'
general manager, who last season employed both Cadaret and Fossas.
``You always need them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're left-handed,'' Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' general
manager, said, ``you've got a chance probably to pitch five years
longer than one might expect. There's a real need for left-handed
pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Cadaret and Fossas are always employed. That is why
teams keep taking chances on Norm Charlton. That is why Dan Plesac
continues to work years after he lost his effectiveness as a
closer. That is why Jim Poole epitomizes the itinerant worker,
moving from team to team but never lacking a job. That is why
Graeme Lloyd is a valuable inclusion in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't necessarily need them as the closer,'' Melvin said.
``But you need them in the fifth and sixth or sixth and seventh for
one or two batters because your starters don't go very far anymore.
I think they're valuable to get one hitter out. Tony Fossas
pitching for us last year gave up one hit in 16 at-bats against
left-handers.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams do not place the same emphasis on getting right-handed
relievers as they do on left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's focused on as much because right-handers
seem to be more plentiful,'' Malone said. ``They're more available,
so it's not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even beyond availability, though, managers seem to place more
emphasis on having a left-handed specialist to pitch to a
left-handed hitter than summoning a right-handed reliever to face a
particular right-handed hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Assenmacher has made a long and profitable career out of
coming into a game, pitching to one or two left-handed batters,
then leaving. In the past three years, while Mariano Rivera of the
Yankees has pitched 240 2/3 innings in 181 games, Assenmacher has
pitched 142 2/3 innings in 207 games for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   But why the greater emphasis on the need of lefty vs. lefty than
righty vs. righty?
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective is to at least take the power away from
left-handed hitters,'' Melvin said. ``Most left-handers are
breaking-ball pitchers. The ball moves. You don't want to give up
that two, three-run homer. You still may give up a hit, but you try
to take the power away.''
</P>
<P>
   When Malone was assistant general manager in Baltimore, he said,
the Orioles were fortunate to have ``one of the best in the
business,'' Jesse Orosco, who has pitched in the major leagues for
18 years and will be 42 years old three weeks into the season.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Orosco gave up two home runs to left-handed hitters
but held them to a .205 batting average. He is not strictly a
specialist, though, and did a pretty good job against right-handed
hitters, too, registering a .232 average. ``Left-handers get better
with age,'' Malone said. ``With the experience, they become more
effective to get left-handed hitters out. They are part of a
quality bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how often they are released, left-handed relievers
find jobs. Fossas pitched for the Mariners, the Cubs and the
Rangers last season, Cadaret for the Angels and the Rangers,
Charlton for the Orioles and the Braves, Poole for the Giants and
the Indians, Alan Embree for the Braves and the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   This spring Fossas is with the Rangers, Cadaret with the
Dodgers, Charlton with the Devil Rays, Poole with the Phillies and
Embree with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Teams prefer older, more experienced left-handers like Fossas
(41 years old) and Cadaret (37) to younger pitchers who are not
battle-tested. Occasionally, a younger left-hander becomes
attractive. Ricardo Rincon, 27, is one such reliever. Left-handed
hitters batted .131 against him and hit no home runs last season
when he played for Pittsburgh. The Pirates since have traded him to
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was after him,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Some left-handed relievers belie their role. Dennis Cook of the
Mets, for example, was more effective last season against
right-handed hitters than left-handers, giving up 29 hits,
including two home runs, in 97 at-bats to left-handers (.299) but
only two more hits and one more home run in 56 more at-bats to
right-handers for a .203 average.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier Hernandez, on the other hand, is a right-handed reliever
who was almost as effective against left-handers (.213) as
right-handers (.203). ``But,'' Melvin said, ``would you bring him
in to face Tino Martinez with the bases loaded, or Fossas?''
</P>
<P>
   Being left-handed, though, doesn't guarantee immortality.
Sometimes the arm, even the left one, just gives out.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bailes reached the majors at age 23 in 1986, pitched for
the Indians for four years, worked for the Angels for three more,
then pitched briefly in the minors in 1993 before retiring for
three years. Then the Rangers, in the typical never-ending search
for left-handed relievers, located him and dragged his 34-year-old
body off the scrap heap.
</P>
<P>
   For the first four months of the 1997 season, he pitched in the
minors. Then he joined the Rangers early in August and relieved in
24 games for them. Last season he relieved in 46 games. But his
shoulder bothered him all season, and he had rotator cuff surgery
in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``His shoulder hasn't responded very well,'' Joe Bick, Bailes'
agent, said. ``He's been throwing the vast majority of the winter
and he hasn't been feeling real good. He has not formally announced
his retirement, but that's what he's going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Give Bailes another year or two, though, and someone else may
come calling.

EVIDENCE TIES OLYMPIC TAINT TO 1936 GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Calif.) 
(JT) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an effort to salvage the prestige of the
Olympics and their own marketing plans, commercial sponsors have
been calling for the removal of allegedly corrupt officials and a
new, graft-proof process for awarding the Games to competing
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The success of instituting a speedy cleanup _ next month's
special session of the International Olympic Committee is a target
date _ would be based on the assumption that the current scandal is
an aberration; that it was caused by the unfortunate confluence of
a new breed of overreaching local booster with IOC members who do
not fully understand the ideals of ``Olympism,'' a 19th-century
``movement'' that combined the fair play of sports with the passion
of religion.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence, though, that the problem is deeper, older and
more profound than what has been presented as a shabby case of some
Sydney and Salt Lake City payoffs for IOC votes. The evidence
paints a picture of an Olympic culture of moral relativism, if not
systemic corruption, that has enabled the sporting spectacular to
survive and prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Three IOC presidents were complicit in promoting the 1936 Berlin
Games, the so-called Nazi Olympics, in defiance of the
organization's spirit and charter, according to documents in the
Avery Brundage archives brought to light by the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Los Angeles. Two of them, the American Brundage and the
Belgian Count Henri de Baillet-Latour, apparently would have
profited handsomely from the choice of Berlin if World War II had
not intervened.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics' most celebrated figure, its founder, the French
Baron Pierre de Coubertin, came out of retirement to lend his
blessing to those Berlin Games. The German government nominated him
for a Nobel Peace Prize. For the Baron, the prize had seemingly
been as holy a grail as it is for the current IOC president, Juan
Antonio Samaranch, who is said to be concerned lest the present
scandal damage his own chances.
</P>
<P>
   The winner in 1935, the year of Coubertin's nomination, was the
anti-Nazi Karl von Ossietzky of Germany, who died in Dachau.
</P>
<P>
   Information about Brundage and Baillet-Latour has moldered in
archives for years. Brundage's papers at the University of Illinois
include a 1938 letter from the president of the German Olympic
Committee assuring him that his Chicago construction company's bid
to help build the German Embassy in Washington had been accepted.
Precise details on the Belgian bank controlled by Baillet-Latour's
family and taken over by the Deutsche Bank, which helped finance
Auschwitz, are harder to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this information has been brought up by the Simon
Wiesenthal Center to promote its own mission of keeping fresh the
lessons of the Holocaust and other human-rights tragedies. It is an
attempt by the center to link the present scandal to the 1936
Games, which many see as the first modern Olympic spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis of the center maintain that the well-documented
anti-Semitism of that era's Olympic leadership is a simple
barometer of an overall hypocrisy in the Olympic movement. In an
April 12, 1933, letter to ``My dear Avery,'' Sigfrid Edstrom, the
Swedish engineer who became IOC president after Baillet-Latour died
in 1942, captures the sentiment, if not the righteous heat, of his
fellow members of the Olympic elite. On stationery identifying him
as an IOC member, he wrote: ``It is too bad that the American Jews
are so active and cause us so much trouble. It is impossible for
our German friends to carry on the expensive preparations for the
Olympic Games if all this unrest prevails.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the Wiesenthal Center's offices here, the
dean and founder, Rabbi Marvin Hier, said: ``Leaders of the
Olympics violated their own rules; they sold their souls. They
injected politics into sports and they fudged the lines between
business and amateurism.''
</P>
<P>
   While the charge that Brundage and others willfully ignored
German sports officials' discrimination against their Jewish
athletes, in violation of Olympic regulations, is not new, the
center's indictment of Brundage as a bribe taker is unprecedented.
As evidence, it offers an Aug. 8, 1938, letter to Brundage from
Hans von Tschammer und Osten, the so-called Reichssportfuhrer,
president of the German Olympic Committee and a Nazi Party member
since 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Von Tschammer wrote, referring to Karl Ritter von Halt, a German
IOC member: ``Mr. Von Halt forwarded your letter to me at the
beginning of July, in which you asked whether your firm could
participate in the building of the German Embassy in Washington.
Having brought your proven record of your friendly attitude toward
German sports before the responsible authorities, I can happily
tell you that both the German foreign minister as well as General
Building Inspector Speer have declared to me that you take part.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that month, Brundage wrote von Tschammer, ``It was very
kind of you to interest yourself in my behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   By November, however, world events trumped Brundage's bid. In a
letter to von Halt, Brundage wrote, ``Ambassador Diekhoff informed
me that the project had been postponed.'' In the same letter, he
discussed the difficulty of staging another track-and-field meet
between Germany and the United States, saying that because of ``the
overwhelming proportion of Jewish advertising our papers have been
filled with anti-Nazi propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Brundage's most prominent biographer, the Amherst College sports
historian Allen Guttmann, did not mention the letters in his 1984
book, ``The Games Must Go On,'' and dismisses the Wiesenthal
Center's view of Brundage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 334 boxes of documents in the archives,'' Guttman
said. ``I might have overlooked a few. In any case, I'm skeptical
of the center's interpretation of all this. I see no linkage
between the present corruption and Brundage. Why wouldn't the
Germans go to someone with whom they had a relationship to build
their embassy? College department chairmen call up their alma
maters when they want new faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brundage wouldn't need a sweetener. He was pro-German. He was
against the boycott of the Berlin Olympics. Believing Brundage
would need to be bribed to support the Berlin Games makes as much
sense as believing Bill Clinton would need to be bribed to support
Hillary for senator.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is far less hard data on Baillet-Latour. Hier is prepared
to indict him, however, based on his attendance, while IOC
president, at the 1937 Nazi Party rally in Nuremburg. The Banque De
La Societe Generale de Belgique, of which Baillet-Latour's family
was a founder and major shareholder, was eventually absorbed by the
Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Wiesenthal Center investigators are trying to find out if
Baillet-Latour was still a shareholder when the Deustche Bank lent
IB Farbenthe money to build a synthetic rubber factory at Auschwitz
with slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   Big ideoloical pictures are easier to come by. Amateurism was
supposedly the basic commandment of the Olympics, until embracing
professionalism became a path to financial survival. The fervent
anti-Communism of Brundage and others, often invoked to excuse
their embrace of fascism, was handily disregarded when television
revenues in the 60's demanded a Cold War Games in which America and
the Soviet bloc duked it out. Willfully ignored was the Soviet
program of state-supported athletes and pioneering institutes of
performance enhancement, including cutting-edge drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Hier is only one of a number of critics who see Samaranch, a
protege of Brundage, as another in the
Baillet-Latour-Edstrom-Brundage line of pragmatic ideologues. Many
of those who would sacrifice Samaranch now so that the Games can go
on also credit the 78-year-old former Spanish diplomat with
restoring the financial health of the Games. Some say he may have
done it at a price that compromised the ideals of his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that those predecessors had ideals to compromise
should be open to further scrutiny, says Hier. ``To clean itself
up, the first thing the Olympics must do is stop glorifying
forefathers who acted out of selfish interests and betrayed the
ideal of amateur sports.''
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi also criticized Brundage for his refusal to support
the immigration applications of Germans and Austrians desperate to
escape to the United States in the late 30's. One of them, a
colleague of some 25 years, was Edgar Fried, vice president of the
Austrian Amateur Olympic Association. Fried died in a concentration
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Brundage came to world attention at the 1972 Munich Games after
the murder of 11 Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists. In a
famous address from the Olympic Stadium, he declared, ``The Games
must go on and we must continue our efforts to keep them clean,
pure and honest and try to extend the sportsmanship of the athletic
field into other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some felt he trivialized the murders by linking them to the
successful peaceful protest by African countries against Rhodesia's
appearance at the Games. In his address, he said the Games had been
``subject to two savage attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wiesenthal Center, best known for its relentless pursuit of
war criminals and for its Museum of Tolerance here, has had little
to do with sport in its 20-year history. During the 1984 Los
Angeles Games, however, it became, by default, the site for a
memorial service for the Israeli athletes murdered 12 years before.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the associate dean who served
as master of ceremonies for the memorial, Olympic officials were
not interested in holding or attending such a service. Several
thousand people did show up, including many athletes and some
American Olympic officials who kept a low profile. The main speaker
was Mimi Weinberg, the widow of the Israeli wrestling coach who was
the first to die.
</P>
<P>
   Yet three years later, in Lausanne, Switzerland, headquarters of
the IOC, officials attended a very different memorial service.
Samaranch was the main eulogist for Horst Dassler, the president of
Adidas, who died of cancer at 51.
</P>
<P>
   According to the British journalists Vyv Simson and Andrew
Jennings, who are among the most persistent critics of the Games,
it was Dassler, through his ISL Worldwide marketing corporation,
who made many of the deals that turned the five rings gold. He is
credited with signing Coca-Cola, among other important sponsors,
and finding friendly Monte Carlo banks for Olympic funds. Dassler's
father, Adolph, a World War II German bootmaker, created Adidas and
through his rivalry with his brother, who founded Puma, ignited the
shoe wars that today play so great a role in world sports.
</P>
<P>
   In their 1992 book, ``Dishonored Games,'' Simson and Jennings
recount the tale of Robert H. Helmick, the high-living Des Moines
lawyer who had to step down as USOC president after it was
discovered that he had acted as a paid consultant for companies
doing business with the Olympics. Helmick also left the IOC, where
he had been touted as a possible successor to Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch's successor will have a hard act to follow after
Samaranch's spectacular commercial successes, crowned by the 1992
Games in his hometown, Barcelona. It was there that the Michael
Jordan-led Dream Team took the Games into outright professionalism,
as well as a certain democracy; athletes were finally staying in
hotels as deluxe as those housing IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   But the new marketing-friendly Olympics of had already been cast
at the 1968 Mexico City Games. To clean up the city for visitors
and a huge television audience, demonstrating Mexican students were
machine-gunned, their blood scrubbed from the stone streets and
information about their deaths suppressed for many years. No
Olympic official lodged a protest. It was at those Games that the
pharma-coaches and the athletes with doctors' bags filled with
syringes and vials appeared, and ``cycling'' and ``masking'' became
common training terms. Olympic officials refused to institute the
random testing that could have deterred what has become an
implacable drug culture. Testing winners on the day of competition
may snare a reckless Ben Johnson in 1988, but few other marquee
names have lost their medals.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important of all, Adidas won its match with Puma in
1968. Adidas, Nike and Reebok have, in many ways, replaced the
nationalism of earlier Olympics with commercialism. This closed a
circle _ now athletes were getting paid, too.
</P>
<P>
   One issue at those Games that did ruffle the marketing-friendly
image was the Black Power salute from the victory stand by Tommie
Smith and John Carlos. While the swift decision to expel the
athletes was made by United States officials, it is hard not to
believe that the IOC president was not consulted. And Brundage
probably remembered that one of the demands of the proposed black
boycott of the Games was his removal.
</P>
<P>
   There has long been evidence that the high priests of Olympism
were hypocritical and prejudiced, but has the Wiesenthal Center
shown that they were also just plain crooked?
</P>
<P>
   Peter Levine, the noted sports historian at Michigan State,
thinks it's not that simple. He said, ``It's more reasonable to
believe that the people who have managed the Games through the
century would do whatever it takes to keep it viable, and then,
once their idealism was tinged with commercial profit, which also
extended the possibilities of the Games, to try to do well for
themselves while still thinking they were doing good.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, the great Coubertin himself was tainted
from the very start. Why did he re-create the Olympics in the first
place? Was it to foster all these wonderful ideals? No. It was to
get French youth into shape after they got beaten in the
Franco-Prussian War. The Baron wanted to win the rematch.''

<P>
   By the Numbers and the Shrills
</P>
<P>
   In complaining about the Yankees' still growing payroll, other
teams point to the salaries given players like Bernie Williams and
the team's willingness to add players like Roger Clemens. But an
even more telling barometer of the Yankees' spending style is the
$3.4 million salary Joe Girardi will have this season as their
backup catcher. Thirty-three catchers caught more games than
Girardi last year, and only six will have higher salaries this
year: Mike Piazza, Ivan Rodriguez, Javier Lopez, Charles Johnson,
Dan Wilson and Chris Hoiles.
</P>
<P>
   The number 125 has become imbedded in mantra-like recitation as
the number of games the Yankees won last year. But only 114
victories appear on their record because that is how many games
they won during the season. If people continue to cite 125 as the
number, they will have to revise the history of other years and say
that the 1906 Chicago Cubs won 118, the 1986 Mets 116 and the 1970
Baltimore Orioles and the 1975 Cincinnati Reds 115 each. Teams can
win more games now, of course, because of the extra post-season
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   At Derek Jeter's salary arbitration hearing last week, his agent
introduced a newspaper comment made by Tim Raines to show the
shortstop's popularity with fans: ``With the way women scream in
high-pitched voices, it's like he's the second coming of the
Beatles.'
</P>
<P>
   Some Team Styles Are Relaxed
</P>
<P>
   Last week was a momentous week for baseball and not because the
Yankees got Roger Clemens. One team, the Cincinnati Reds, and one
manager, Buck Showalter of Arizona, eliminated their rules banning
beards and mustaches. Greg Vaughn (Reds) and Randy Johnson
(Diamondbacks) were responsible for inducing the enlightened
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some day Showalter will even be able to acknowledge that
he was off base several years ago when he criticized Ken Griffey
Jr. for wearing his cap backward during batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch Money Lures the Best
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers enraged other teams by giving Kevin
Brown $105 million for seven years. The signing confirmed the worst
fears that some other owners and officials had when Peter O'Malley
sold the Dodgers to Rupert Murdoch. But Murdoch money has been
flowing freely, too, in not so public ways.
</P>
<P>
   An executive of an American League club said Kevin Malone, the
Dodgers' new general manager, called people from other clubs during
the winter and said, ``I struck an oil well out here; are you ready
to leave?''
</P>
<P>
   Malone used Murdoch oil to lure Ed Creech away from St. Louis,
where he had been scouting director, to become the Dodgers'
director of scouting operations. Within a couple of years Creech is
expected to double his Cardinals' salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to deny him permission to talk to them,'' Walt
Jocketty, the Cardinals' general manager, said. ``If I had, we were
going to have an unhappy employee. We couldn't compete with those
salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone also hired Bill Geivett from Tampa Bay, where he had been
assistant to the general manager, to become assistant to the
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Teams that feel they cannot compete with wealthier clubs for
high-priced players tend to emphasize scouting and player
development. But they feel they will begin to lose out there, too,
if teams like the Dodgers are going to use money to hire the best
people away from them.

   Michael Cohen was a New York City transit worker. Lena
Cymbrowitz, James Hayes and Howard Mills were professional
fund-raisers. Tom Duane was a stockbroker. Daniel Hevesi was a
financial analyst. And all six are freshman members of the New York
state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Throw a ``res ipso loquitur'' at them and you're likely to get
blank stares. Not a lawyer in the bunch. But all six were elected
to seats that had been held by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures have always had their farmers, teachers,
engineers and entrepreneurs, but from the early days of the
Republic, no group has been as over-represented as lawyers. But for
the last three decades, even as the profession has grown in
numbers, its grip on state capitols has steadily slipped, a trend
that continued in the turnover brought by the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   In states with the big cities that have high concentrations of
lawyers, the drop has been especially pronounced. In 1969, 61
percent of New York's state legislators were lawyers; today, 34
percent are. In California, the figure has fallen to 22 percent
from 48 percent 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, when the National Conference of State Legislatures
first surveyed legislators around the country about their
professions, 22 percent called themselves lawyers. (The survey
understated the true number, because each lawmaker could give only
one response, and many said ``legislator,'' rather than naming
prior careers.) When the survey was repeated in 1995, 15 percent
said they were lawyers. No one profession rose to fill the gap;
there was a general increase across many fields.
</P>
<P>
   So where have all the lawyers gone? Not surprisingly, the
answers have to do with money. Over the last generation, the money
to be made practicing law has soared, particularly in major cities
where lawyers had strong holds on legislative seats, and where the
starting salary at some firms was $90,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, only one state, California, paid its
legislators more than $60,000 a year. (Because of pay raises that
took effect in January, California's legislators now earn $99,000
each, while New York's average almost $90,000 in salary and
stipends.) Last year, legislators in 39 states were paid less than
$30,000, according to the conference of legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers still dominate Congress, where the annual salary is
$133,600 and the expense allowances are generous. According to
Congressional Quarterly, 43 percent of the seats in Congress are
held by lawyers, but even that figure is well below the 58 percent
held in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In many states, being a legislator has become a full-time job,
or at least a part-time one that makes it hard to manage another
career. In the late 1960s, the average state legislature was in
session three months of the year, but in the late 1990s, the
average has grown to five months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of time required of them back home has grown even
faster, with all the constituent service and campaigning,'' said
Karl Kurtz, director of state services at the conference of
legislatures, which is based in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, it was common for legislators to have thriving
law practices. It was even good for business, older legislators
say, adding to the resume a title that impressed judges, attracted
clients and promised a little more clout with government agencies.
But these days, far fewer lawmakers try to balance two careers.
</P>
<P>
   When Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, was first elected to
New York state's Assembly in 1976, he intended to keep working in
his three-person law practice. ``My partners quickly became
disenchanted with how little time I had for the work, and we
dissolved that partnership,'' said Silver, now the Assembly
speaker. ``I don't know of any young legislator who even tried to
maintain a law practice after being elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor dissuading lawyers from entering public life was
the post-Watergate wave of financial disclosure laws, which forced
lawyer-lawmakers in many states to reveal more than they might want
to about their practices and their clients.
</P>
<P>
   When he was Assembly speaker in California, Willie Brown, a
Democrat who is now the mayor of San Francisco, had an active law
practice, and was frequently accused of conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Of the lawyers who have been elected to legislatures, many never
practiced law but spent their careers as legislative staff members
or government bureaucrats, or worked in business or the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decline in lawyers is even more dramatic than it appears,
because a lot of these legislators who have law degrees and are
technically lawyers were never really lawyers,'' said A.G. Block,
editor of California Journal, a monthly magazine on state
government and politics. ``When I went to law school in the '60s,
most of the people in law school went on to practice law. Now, it's
more an educational tool to learn a critical way of thinking,
particularly for people who want to go into government.''
</P>
<P>
   While the pull toward public office has diminished for lawyers,
it has grown for others, in part because the federal government has
given more authority to the states. Legislatures are now important
to nearly every profession or interest group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislatures have become much more important to teachers,
insurance agents, small-businessmen, doctors, you name it,'' said
Kurtz. ``So it has become a more attractive target for people in
all of those professions.''

   The freshman class in Albany is filled with people for whom
state law and politics were never far from their lives. ``My work
was almost like being in politics, anyway,'' said Ms. Cymbrowitz, a
new assemblywoman from Brooklyn who raised money and did marketing

   Cohen, the former transit worker who is a new assemblyman from
Queens, was active in the politically powerful transit unions and
was elected to his local community board. Duane, the former
stockbroker and a state senator from Manhattan, was active in the
gay-rights movement and served on the New York City Council. Hayes,
an assemblyman from the Buffalo area, and Mills, an assemblyman
from the Catskills, were elected members of their town councils
while working as fund-raisers for colleges, and Mills was once an

   Does it matter that there are fewer lawyers making law? Analysts
say they cannot point to any area of policy that has been notably

</P>
<P>
   In the recent past, it was more important that the people making
law be people who knew the law. Thirty years ago, legislators often
wrote their own bills. But the growth of legislative staffs over
that time means that in nearly every state, any legislator who has
never cracked a law book can call on professional legal advice to
draft bills.
</P>
<P>
   There is general agreement, even among the lawyers, that greater
diversity in a legislature is a healthy thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a much wider range of interests and concerns
represented these days than there used to be, so it's less
insular,'' said Block. ``I mean, if you're drafting farm law,
shouldn't you have a few farmers?''

<P>
   Besides, Ms. Cymbrowitz asked, wouldn't a legislature with fewer
lawyers be a little less combative?

THE WATER'S FINE, BUT THE SALMON ARE LACKING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLAS KARAS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sergei Sokalov lay on his side on the sloping bank of the
Varzina River near Murmansk, his feet toward the water, body
propped up on his left elbow, and the ever-present burning
cigarette dangling from between his fingers. For the moment, it was
difficult to imagine that he was once a Soviet biathlon athlete. A
lot has changed in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   He watched as I cast a large Mickey Finn streamer across the
current. The river was full but clear, slightly above its banks.
Its force straightened the line, pulling the red and yellow fly in
a large, sweeping arc until it rigidly faced upstream. During the
next five minutes, I swung the rod tip back and forth across the
river's surface to make the fly swim in, then away, from the
boulder-strewn bank.
</P>
<P>
   Hitless, I lifted the fly rod tip to begin still another cast.
As the fly rose upstream, then to the surface, and just before
becoming airborne, a salmon engulfed it. A few minutes later, a
spent grilse came protesting toward the guide's landing net. It was
the fifth grilse I had landed in as many hours of fishing. A grilse
is a precocious salmon, between 15 and 18 inches, that returns to
its brith stream after but a year at sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a good sign,'' Sokalov said in English. ``This is
the best week of the season. The river should be filled with
salmon. It was last year.'' Grilse don't count in the angler's
book. Most are released. To be called a salmon, it must weigh seven
pounds or more and have been at sea for three or more years before
their first return to their natal stream.
</P>
<P>
   I was alone on Finn Pool, one of a dozen named pools on the
Varzina, and was about to cast again when I heard the roar of a
converted Russian military helicopter. It was flying downriver at
tree-top level, to return us to the lodge a mile downstream. As I
stepped out of the river, some 50 feet away, near the opposite
bank, a salmon jumped clear of the water. It was a bright fish,
fresh from the sea, about 15 pounds, with a blue back, and white
sides and belly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Varzina was the hottest salmon river on Russia's
Kola Peninsula, which is shaped like a thick thumb and is 160 miles
wide and juts 250 miles eastward. It is washed by the White Sea on
the south and east sides, and by Barents Sea, an arm of the Arctic
Ocean, on the north. Most of the Kola, the heart of Lapland, is
above the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   When I fished it last July, daylight lasted 24 hours. From its
interior flow 80 rivers, 60 of which contain Atlantic salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Its most famous is the Kola River that flows north through its
isthmus to Murmansk and the ocean. For centuries, Kola's rivers
were the exclusive realm of czars and kings. During the last 70
years, they were the private property of Communist officials. It
wasn't until 1987 that several Americans and Erro Pettersson, a
Finn, established permanent camps. Today, 15 are on as many rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular and first developed for sport fishing was the
Ponoi, an east-flowing river of gigantic magnitude. The first men
to open salmon fishing for foreigners were Gary Loomis of Seattle
and his partner Bill Davis. Their camp manager and logistics whiz,
which in Russia can challenge the most cerebral person, was
Pettersson. His newest camp is on the Varzina. It opened in 1997
and its largest salmon was a 35-pounder.
</P>
<P>
   A surplus of military helicopters and cheap kerosene has made
recreational fishing a reality. However, salmon fishing anywhere is
not inexpensive. The cost of a week on the Varzina, including
traveling from Murmansk and back, ranges from $3,850 for the first
and last four weeks of the 14-week season, that begins June 13, to
$6,950 during the last week of June and the first two in July.
These three weeks are considered the best on the Varzina as well as
other Kola rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Varzina River Camp (fax: 358-9-452-4314) supports 14 rods
with two anglers per guide. When I fished, three guides were
Russian and four were Finns. All spoke English. No angler
monopolized a pool. Rods and guides were taken out each day and
evening to different pools that were rotated among the fishers.
Anglers were also flown to the nearby Penka and Sidrovka rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The best pools proved to be Golden Pool and nearby Home Pool, at
the foot of the lodge built on a high glacial plateau. The lodge is
at the head of tidewater, four miles from the Barents Sea. A mile
north of the lodge is the abandoned settlement of Varzino. It
consisted of two dozen houses and was populated by a mixture of
Laps and Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the peninsula and its Atlantic salmon are the last
vestige of a wholly wild land and fish. No roads or permanent
settlements are on any river except Murmansk, at the mouth of the
Kola river. While every salmon river in North America and Europe is
polluted, the Kola's waters are pristine. Despite the Varzina's
virgin condition, the July run last year was disappointing. That
month, there were 75 percent fewer salmon than the previous July.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian meteorologists believed one factor was the
aftereffect of El Nino. It caused one arm of the jet stream to
cross from the United States into eastern Canada and across the
polar cap, bringing cold, damp weather to the Arctic coast of
Russia. In the six days we fished, three were fog shrouded. We were
told, snow fell twice on the river the previous week. During the
week, 18 salmon and 30 grilse were landed. Most grilse were
released. The salmon ranged from 7 to 22 pounds. The 22-pounder was
a hen taken by Kristian Marinovik of Santiago, Chile. He and fellow
Chilean Gonzalo Cortes also caught the most grilse.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost the summer that wasn't. By mid-August, a rush of
hot, humid weather finally caused reluctant salmon milling about in
the frigid waters of the Varzina's fjord-like estuary to re-enter
the river and trek upstream. ``Fishing recovered quickly,'' said
Pettersson, ``but some fish must have decided to spend another year
at sea. Our final tally was three-quarters of what it had been the
year before. I know El Nino is gone, and that La Nina is wet and
warm. She is just what we need this year.''

PLOT THICKENS FOR AMERICA'S CUP TV  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA LLOYD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It appeared last month that a competing sponsorship deal might
force ESPN to drop its plans for televising the 1999-2000 America's
Cup races. But the cable sports network now says it has a new
contract in the works that would allow the show to go on.
</P>
<P>
   What had given ESPN pause was an agreement negotiated by Young
America, the New York Yacht Club's cup syndicate, that could
potentially flood ESPN's screen with advertising logos on its sails
from Fox Sports Net. That sports network is ESPN's staunchest rival
in cable television.
</P>
<P>
   The battle may seem to be no more than a tempest in a television
teapot. But in fact, the heart and soul of America's Cup as a
global event hangs in the balance. If ESPN pulls out of the deal,
as it has threatened once before, it could jeopardize fund-raising
for most cup syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any international team sees the United States as a huge
market,'' Bob Billingham, chief operating officer for the America
One challenger in San Francisco, said. ``Television is one of the
biggest things you sell to sponsors. They look for their branding
on the sails and boats. It's very important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Glover, executive vice president of programming for ESPN,
said late Friday that his organization now expects to receive a
clean feed _ no Fox ads _ from the America's Cup races. The
competition is to be shown on ESPN for viewers in North America
beginning in October, when the cup trial races begin off Auckland,
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   By ``clean feed,'' Glover means TV footage void of any competing
network verbiage or logos. In its independent deal with Fox, signed
last month, Young America agreed to allow Fox to attach corporate
logos to Young America's yacht and sails as it races against other
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The group representing the competition's 15 teams, the America's
Cup Challenge Association, confirmed that a revised contract with
ESPN is scheduled to be signed February 22 despite the Young
America deal.
</P>
<P>
   David Elwell, chairman of the challenge association, said late
Friday that the challenge group is ``extraordinarily happy that
ESPN is doing the television feed. We feel they're the best in that
arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Elwell said that America's Cup 2000, the event organizer in New
Zealand, also has agreed to the tentative new ESPN contract. Final
approval, however, hinges on 100 percent approval by the 15
challenge teams, including Young America.
</P>
<P>
   Basic to the new deal is that all 15 challengers must agree not
to allow any sponsors to put signage on their boats if the
corporation competes with ESPN. Glover conceded that the rule opens
up a gray area as to which advertising ESPN might oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Like two planets moving in opposite directions along the same
orbit, that means the competing networks _ ESPN and Fox _ may still
be on a collision course. It appears that Young America remains
knee-deep in a pricey $2.5 million sponsorship deal with Fox _ all
signed and sealed _ that says Fox can advertise on the Young
America yacht as much as it wants within event rules.
</P>
<P>
   John Marshall, the president of Young America who also helped to
negotiate his syndicate's deal with Fox, declined to comment
Friday. But it appears that the agreement he crafted still stands
as written last month. ``We have a sponsorship with Fox, and that
has not changed,'' Jane Eagleson, a syndicate spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the sphere of contract rights is the New York Yacht
Club, which sources say is unhappy with its charge, Young America.
At a board of trustees meeting about two weeks ago, executives of
the club reportedly told the syndicate that it needs to undo the
Fox contract.
</P>
<P>
   Since about 90 percent of the syndicate's operating funds - so
far, about $24 million - comes from club members and affiliations,
the syndicate clearly is between the proverbial rock and a hard
place.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, for one, is unlikely to let Young America off the hook. Its
rivalry with ESPN is well-known within the industry. In a show to
be aired Monday night on HBO's ``Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel,''
David Hill, president of Fox Sports, takes on ESPN about its
America's Cup broadcast rights:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it could be a very clever marketing ploy, don't you?''
Hill said to Steve Bornstein, ESPN's president.
</P>
<P>
   Bornstein replied: ``It'll never get on our air. We're not in
the business of televising our competitor's logos.''
</P>
<P>
   Vince Wladika, a senior vice president at Fox Sports, said that
Hill was not available for comment Friday. ``There's really nothing
to talk about until a deal has been signed,'' Wladika said about
the revised ESPN contract.

   Kurds explode in fury across Europe. President Clinton
contemplates sending marines into Kosovo or bombing Serbia.
Scorched earth and bereaved families testify to ethnic passions
gone haywire in Rwanda, Burundi, Bosnia, Chechnya. With or without
violence, nation-states proliferate at a dizzying rate, most of
them out of the ashes of collapsed communist states. In 10 years,
membership in the United Nations swells from 156 to 185, with
former Soviet republics, East European spinoffs and Lilliputian
specks like San Marino, Andorra, Marshal Islands or Micronesia
taking their places alongside nuclear powers and ancient
monarchies. Even in staid and settled Western states like Britain
or Canada, ethnic minorities _ Scottish, Welsh, Francophone _
pursue dreams of a United Nations seat of their very own.
</P>
<P>
   To a world shaking off the accumulated debris of fascism and
communism, there is something startling, ironic and troubling in
discovering that nationalism _ a force alternatively glorified over
the century as a building block of a just world order or reviled as
the wellspring of genocidal hatreds _ is militantly bucking the
trend toward globalism and transnationalism and emerging with a
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   A common wisdom has emerged that the lifting of authoritarian
and Cold War strictures has released ancient ethnic ambitions and
hatreds, potentially leading to a world far more complex and
dangerous than the familiar bipolar East and West.
</P>
<P>
   But is it so? Could it be that this supposedly new nationalism
is neither so new, so surprising, nor so uniformly dangerous? Many
students of world affairs who have taken a closer look at the
nationalisms and conflicts, like those of the Kosovars and the
Kurds, have found that most of the causes and histories long
predate the collapse of communism. What is new, they argue, is not
nationalism and ethnicity as such but the world's perception of
these in a complex new universe, and the political uses of them in
a world of porous borders and interconnected economies.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of globalism, they find, has paradoxically made
statehood more necessary for small nations hoping to compete for
resources, investment and aid. And if the news media are drawn to
ethnic brush fires, there is the less dramatic fact that many
regions where ethnic violence was thought probable, like Ukraine or
Kazakhstan, have handled their transitions, so far, in peace. And
without a superpower conflict to manipulate for their ends, some
national movements like the Palestine Liberation Organization have
even concluded that peace is a viable option.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a large effort to track incidents of ethnic
conflict, to grasp whether there has been a sudden surge of ethnic
conflict,'' said Rajan Menon, professor of international relations
at Lehigh University. ``Well, the answer turns out to be no. In the
old bipolar world there was a great deal of ethnic conflict, but
the Cold War was so superimposed on the American psyche that
everything else was pushed to the margins. It's something of an
optical illusion: the Cold War ends, and `ethnic' now becomes the
vector of conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would deny that the bloodshed in Rwanda, Bosnia or
Chechnya has been terrible, or that ethnic conflicts have been fed
in some way by the collapse of the communist system. What the
experts note, rather, is that the hatreds behind these conflicts _
or the nationalism behind the emergent states _ are hardly new.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Africa has been riddled with such conflicts since the
colonial powers saddled the continent with arbitrary borders. The
Balkans and Caucasus have been problems for over a century. And in
the former communist world, many of the republics and provinces
that have now become U.N. members, from Slovenia to Ukraine to
Uzbekistan, are less manifestations of any new nationalism than
legacies of Soviet nationality policies designed to divide and
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Stalin deliberately divided his empire into Soviet Socialist
Republics, and when they ceased to be a union, Soviet or socialist,
what remained were the republics. Russia, the purported ruler of
the empire, was among the first to break out of it, leaving the
rest little choice but to follow.
</P>
<P>
   What has prompted the proliferation of states and liberation
movements, the experts find, is less a flowering of nationalism
than the very forces that were expected to make nationalism
obsolete. In a world increasingly united by air travel, the
Internet, multinational business and international organizations,
ethnic minorities have come to see no reason why they should not
participate directly. If the Olympics Games during the Cold War,
for example, were an ersatz competition between two ideologies and
superpowers, there is little reason any more why every nation,
large and Lilliputian, should not field its own athletes and gather
its own laurels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend hours and hours wondering how to understand this
phenomenon,'' said Roman Szporluk, director of Harvard University's
Ukrainian Research Center. ``My understanding of this modern
nationalism is as a rebellion against those political entities that
obstructed participation in the life of the world. When I think of
the `secession' of Estonia, or Latvia, or Ukraine, or Georgia, or
Russia itself, I feel that those people did not break away from
some universalism represented by Moscow but felt that the Soviet
system denied them the ability to participate in the affairs of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what appears to be regionalism is really a way of
recognizing the greater interconnectedness of the larger world.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Woodward, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution,
finds a strong economic component in the new nationalism, as small
nationalities, stripped of ideological patrons, conclude that
independence is critical in the struggle for international
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationalism is just an excuse, a part of the political dynamic
as conflicts develop between the central government and regional
governments over who controls what resources and what money is
being drained out of the region,'' she said. ``Globalization leads
to fragmentation, as the state becomes more important as a way to
catch fewer resources, to get access to international loans, trade
agreements.''

   If globalism and the demise of a bipolar world have been the
major factors behind the multiplication of nation-states, the
eruption of violence is more difficult to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree, however, that simply lifting the communist lid
off ancient hatreds does not explain why people who have lived
peacefully side by side for generations suddenly go for each
other's throats. In fact, researchers note that incidents of ethnic
violence have declined since a peak in the immediate aftermath of
the collapse of communism, in 1991, when 35 of 37 conflicts in the
world were deemed ethnic in origin.
</P>
<P>
   Where violence has broken out, moreover, it has often come not
as a direct and spontaneous revival of ethnic hatreds, but from
some specific breakdown in order that quickly developed its own
momentum. In some instances, the catalyst was the holding of
democratic elections in states that did not have the democratic
institutions or national consensus to support them. Conflicts in
Burundi, Yugoslavia, Armenia and Azerbaijan all followed elections
that brought to power leaders who, in the absence of established
levers of authority, seized on xenophobia as a means of
consolidating power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institutions of democracy often were simply not there,''
said Professor Jack Snyder, chairman of the political-science
department at Columbia University. ``There were no courts, no
police, no press to make democracy run, so what else is there?
Often the other thing is ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Yugoslavia's president, who stirred ethnic fears
among the Serbs of Kosovo as early as 1988, Snyder added:
``Slobodan Milosevic was not a nationalist in the slightest bit
until he saw Yugoslavia breaking up and needed a popular issue. So
what he seized on was a national issue, provided by Kosovo. It was
the same in Burundi. It's what happened in the French Revolution,
in Germany before World War I.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the experts argue that there is no such thing as
inevitable conflict. For every outbreak of violence, there are less
publicized instances of places where violence was initially deemed
inevitable but never broke out. Papers were full of doomsday talk
about Ukraine several years ago, or of impending anti-Russian
``ethnic cleansing'' in Kazakhstan. Both lands have so far managed
to keep difficult transitions peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to fight against the notion that the only way out
of conflict is the mono-ethnic state, that ethnic diversity is
simply incompatible with a civic state,'' said Menon. ``But once
ethnic conflicts begin, I'm afraid you can't solve them. You simply
try to manage them. Once fathers are killed, or sisters are raped,
you have created an uncontrollable dynamic.''

   KOSOVO-TALKS (Rambouillet, France) _ Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright negotiated intensely Saturday, hours past
deadline, to try and achieve peace in Kosovo, spelling out to the
leaders of Serbia that they must accept deployment of up to 30,000
NATO troops, including a small contingent of American soldiers. By
Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Washington) _ As the deadline passed Saturday
without a peace deal in Kosovo, Defense Department and NATO
officials said they were ready to launch immediate air strikes on
Serbia, even though dozens of American warplanes assigned to the
mission will not be in place in Europe until after the weekend. By
Philip Shenon.

   KOSOVO-RESIDENTS (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ Residents in the
capital of Kosovo listened intently to the news Saturday as peace
talks passed with no word of an agreement. By Carlotta Gall. With

   INDIA-PAKISTAN (Wagah, India-Pakista Border Crossing) _ In an
extraordinary show of warmth between two bitterly hostile nations,
India's Prime Minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, rode a bus Saturday
through the fertile plains of the Punjab, across the usually closed
border gate here and cordially embraced his Pakistani counterpart,
Nawaz Sharif. By Barry Bearak. With art.
</P>
<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-RITTER-BOOK (Washington) _ Reversing itself for a
second time, the Pentagon has demanded that Scott Ritter, a former

hindering the search for evidence of Iraqi chemical and biological
weapons. By Philip Shenon.

   RUSSIA-FILMMAKER (Moscow) _ Oscar-winning film director Nikita
Mikhalkov premiers his new film at the Kremlin, a palace he says

Michael S. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   UKRAINE-ECON (Lviv, Ukraine) _ Ukraine's political leaders say
they see the future in Europe, capitalism and democracy. But
Ukraine's basket-case economy remains lashed to its Russian past _

   HONGKONG-IMMIGRATION (Hong Kong) _ Last month, a Hong Kong court
ruled that children born in China of Hong Kong parents have the

   WISCONSIN-WELFARE (Milwaukee) _ As Wisconsin drives its welfare
rolls to record lows, many of the state's most troubled mothers
have lost their benefits, often en route to drug clinics, jail
cells, shelters, or the streets. And grandmothers are being left to
care for the children abandoned along the way. It is just one
chapter of the complex treatise on social change being written here
by welfare's end. And like most aspects of Wisconsin's daring
experiment, it is drawing national _ and even international _
attention from a world eager for glimpses of the post-welfare
future. By Jason DeParle. With art.

<TEXT>
<P>
   To the extent that language provides cues for behavior, the
orders that American governors, mayors, police chiefs and block
association presidents have been giving cops on the beat in big
cities over the past few years are unambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   As James Alan Fox, dean of the College of Criminal Justice at
Northeastern University, notes, these officers have been told that
they form the front line in a ``war'' on crime and a ``war'' on
drugs, that they have been enlisted in special ``operations'' and
drafted for bold new ``offensives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We use all these paramilitary terms,'' Fox said, ``and we have
promoted somewhat of a siege mentality among police: The enemy is
out there, and there are more of them than we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox paused, sighed and added, ``When you have this sort of
mentality, excessive brutality and improper actions are more likely
to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's comments root out what is indisputably a dirty little
secret embedded in the public angst over police brutality: many
Americans have come not only to tolerate a degree of it from their
police officers but also, in ways subtle and unsubtle, to encourage
it.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Americans are untroubled by such glaring
examples of excessive force as the beating of Rodney King by police
officers in Los Angeles; the torture of Abner Louima by police
officers in a Brooklyn station house or, most recently, the killing
of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, in a fusillade of
police fire this month in the Bronx. In each case, race became an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everybody would agree that if these flagrant episodes
were the unintended outgrowths of aggressive policing _ and it is
by no means certain that they were _ then the price for such a
modus operandi is exorbitant in the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   But too frequently omitted from discussions of police brutality
that attend these cases is the fact that many Americans have
tacitly blessed a more vigorous, invasive, belligerent brand of
policing. And the line between law enforcement that is aptly
forceful and law enforcement that is unduly brutal or abusive can
be thin indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it's in the eye of the beholder,'' acknowledged
former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton. ``That's
part of the dilemma that police find themselves in.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not confined to the nation's police departments.
It also confronts the politicians who help supervise them and the
taxpayers who fund them. Underlying it is the age-old tension
between public safety and civil liberties. The question now is, can
the ``zero tolerance'' crime policies that have come into vogue
over the last decade be executed and achieved without the trampling
of innocent people's rights?
</P>
<P>
   The ``zero tolerance'' policy, which has been given a showcase
in New York City, holds that no crime _ not the breaking of a
window, not the jumping of a turnstile _ is too insignificant to
capture the swift, decisive attention of the police. Prosecute more
petty offenders and offenses today, goes the reasoning, and you
will have fewer hard-core criminals and crimes tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But as the police were being schooled in this new religion,
Bratton said, they were also being taught a new zealousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``In wartime, which we were engaged in for a few years in this
city, it required certain strategies,'' Bratton said. Among those
strategies, he said, was to be less timid in the investigation of
crimes and the use of force, so long as the force was justified by
the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Those sorts of instructions, however, call for judgments that
are bound to be imperfect. Take, for example, the statistics
concerning the activities of the department's street crimes unit.
In 1997 and 1998, officers with the unit frisked more than 45,000
people thought to be carrying guns, but they arrested fewer than
10,000. The rest _ the vast majority _ were mistakenly detained.
</P>
<P>
   Is that acceptable? The answer depends not only on the
sensibilities of the person answering the question but also, in
many cases, the race. Black leaders and civil libertarians said
that when the police put more emphasis on preventive strategies,
they invariably lean on broad profiles in stopping and
interrogating possible criminals, and those profiles are racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you rely on hunches, you rely on prejudices, and the
people most likely to be stopped are black or Hispanic,'' said Ira
Glasser, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union.
``When you start throwing around phrases like zero tolerance, you
get these kinds of excesses. And if the cops can stop you at will,
where's the public safety in that?''
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's predecessor, David Dinkins,
said there was a certain blindness among white people who respond
to the reduction in crime simply by cheering the ends without
scrutinizing the means.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they'll say,'' Dinkins observed, ``until one day,
this white middle-class family has a son who comes home from
Harvard or Princeton or whatever university, and he comes home with
his black classmate. And they, dressed as young people will dress,
get into some altercation with cops'' _ and become victims of
police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to force, there is not a police department in the
country that expressly commands its officers to use it
indiscriminately. Giuliani told police academy graduates last week
that ``in a very special sense, you are civil-rights workers''
whose job of public protection entails an ``equal emphasis on
treating everyone with respect.''
</P>
<P>
   But the broader goals that officers are asked to pursue, the
fire instilled in them and the messages that the culture outside of
police departments broadcast can easily coax them toward
unjustified violence.
</P>
<P>
   The heroes in televised police dramas like ``NYPD Blue,'' ``Law
and Order,'' and ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' regularly slam
suspects against concrete walls, twists their arms behind their
backs, even bloody their noses.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there has not been a popular protest of the possible
danger of such examples to match the outcry over, say, the chastely
rendered longings of a lesbian who owns a bookstore in the
situation comedy ``Ellen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that if Americans want to glorify violence,
ratchet up the mandates of police officers and cut crime rates to
ever lower levels, they must own up to the trade-offs they are
bound to be making.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more aggressive the police get, the safer the streets can
be,'' Fox said, ``but there's a price in terms of individual
freedoms, civil liberties, civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of freedom is tolerance, not zero tolerance,''
Richard Emery, a civil-rights lawyer, wrote in an Op-Ed article in
The New York Times on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission of
New York City, a watchdog group, said he did not want to believe
that the equation was that tidy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no inherent conflict between good crime control and
respect for people's rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added with a note of pessimism, ``it's very hard to
apply in practice.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Alarmed, heartsick and still baffled over
President Clinton's acquittal by the Senate, some of his most
ardent detractors have come to an extraordinary conclusion, one
that may carry grim implications for the conservative movement.
They blame not themselves for mishandling the whole sorry episode
but a public whose moral standards have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Their message is audacious, perhaps even arrogant: Americans
just don't get it. Why can't they see we were right?
</P>
<P>
   In the most striking example, Paul Weyrich, an unflinching moral
crusader for three decades, embarked last week on a rampage against
society rather than against Clinton. The man who suggested to the
Rev. Jerry Falwell that he name his organization the Moral Majority
now contends that the name is an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I no longer believe that there is a moral majority,'' Weyrich
wrote in a letter to hundreds of thousands of supporters of his
organization, the Free Congress Foundation. ``I do not believe that
a majority of Americans actually shares our values.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking his fury a step further, Weyrich said that while he was
``not suggesting that we all become Amish or move to Idaho,'' he
believes that ``we have to look at what we can do to separate
ourselves from this hostile culture.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked: ``What steps can we take to make sure that we and our
children are not infected? We need some sort of quarantine.''
</P>
<P>
   That's easy for Weyrich to say _ he's not an elected official
accountable to voters. But for those who do run for office, blaming
the public can be risky, particularly in an age when politicians _
no matter how much they grovel at the feet of voters _ find that
public to be increasingly aloof. For all his private
contemptuousness and fury at liberals, President Richard M. Nixon
was careful not to publicly denounce the prevailing public will.
</P>
<P>
   President Jimmy Carter was not as prudent. He isolated himself
from the electorate in 1979 when he said ``a moral and spiritual
crisis'' was gripping the nation. ``Too many of us,'' he said,
``now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption.''
Republicans traded for years on what was dubbed ``the malaise
speech,'' citing it as Exhibit One of a Democratic Party that was
out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't shame people into changing the way they look at the
world,'' said Dan Schnur, a Republican strategist in California.
``You have to lead by example. And if the people won't follow your
example, it's really not as much their problem as it is yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Weyrich is the most panicked, he is not alone.
Other conservatives are eager to fault the public rather than
themselves for misreading the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that ordinary Americans reacting to Clinton's conduct
``are complicit in his corruption,'' William Bennett, the former
education secretary who has since built his career on talking and
writing about morality, said: ``I will not defend the public.
Absolutely not. If people want to pander to the public and say
they're right, they can. But they're not right on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he rejected the ``canard that conservatives are
putting out that we didn't make our case.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Smith of New Hampshire, in formally announcing his
long-shot bid for the Republican presidential nomination last week,
could not resist a dig at the public: ``The president's acquittal
is a sad commentary on the prevailing values in America today.'' In
an interview, Smith sneered at polls showing _ week after week,
month after month _ little public appetite for impeachment. ``My
wife likes to say they must be polling people coming out of Hooters
on Saturday night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Craig Shirley, a longtime conservative public relations
consultant, said: ``A certain portion of the American public is
cowed by popular culture. They do not want to be thought of as not
being modern or sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   Such scorn for the will of the people may be an obvious
manifestation of conservatives' frustration. Again and again, they
replay the tape: A president whom they already believed to be
immoral has an affair with an intern in the Oval Office, lies about
it _ and remains as popular as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they are so demoralized and bitter because many
conservatives convinced themselves that sooner or later the
nation's pent-up outrage would surface. The Weekly Standard, a
conservative magazine, was positively gleeful after Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr sent his impeachment referral to Congress
last September. Jumping off the cover was an illustration of a
beaming Starr at bat, with the headline, ``Starr's Home Run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of conservatives said, `Wait, there's another woman.
There's another affidavit. It will all turn around,''' Bennett
recalled. ``But at each point they found out more about Clinton his
approvals went up.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton ventured back to this state last week _ where seven
years ago he pronounced himself the ``Comeback Kid'' _ his
detractors still could not contain their rage. In a front-page
editorial in The Union Leader of Manchester, publisher Nackey Loeb
advised the president to ``stop by Washington just long enough to
pick up his toothbrush, turn in his resignation and head back to
Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives were not as defeatist as Weyrich, who went so
far as to write off the Republican Party's ability to connect with
society. In his letter, Weyrich complained that ``we have probably
lost the culture war'' and said the cultural collapse was ``so
great that it simply overwhelms politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Weyrich said in an interview that he was not particularly
concerned that conservatives might alienate voters, because he
viewed his causes as larger than partisan politics. ``I've never
been one who is very active in the party to begin with,'' he said.
``It hasn't been my forte. I will be a good citizen and participate
appropriately. But I've never been consumed with the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Weyrich does not have to worry about his own electoral
fate. But perhaps the bashers of Joe Citizen who are still
committed Republicans can take solace in the example of at least
one successful politician who found that loathing voters is not
political suicide: Sen. Stephen Young, D-Ohio, who served from 1959
to 1971. In vituperative letters, he traded indignities with
constituents and interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Young wrote one constituent, ``Buster, your insults show that
you are the east end of a horse going west.'' He called another
constituent ``lower than a snake's tail in a wagon rut.'' He
exploded at still another, calling him a ``low-down skunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Young was re-elected in 1964, the beneficiary of the landslide
for President Lyndon B. Johnson.

   NASHUA, N.H. _ Alarmed, heartsick and still baffled over
President Clinton's acquittal by the Senate, some of his most
ardent detractors have come to an extraordinary conclusion, one
that may carry grim implications for the conservative movement.
They blame not themselves for mishandling the whole sorry episode
but a public whose moral standards have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Their message is audacious, perhaps even arrogant: Americans
just don't get it. Why can't they see we were right?
</P>
<P>
   In the most striking example, Paul Weyrich, an unflinching moral
crusader for three decades, embarked last week on a rampage against
society rather than against Clinton. The man who suggested to the
Rev. Jerry Falwell that he name his organization the Moral Majority
now contends that the name is an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I no longer believe that there is a moral majority,'' Weyrich
wrote in a letter to hundreds of thousands of supporters of his
organization, the Free Congress Foundation. ``I do not believe that
a majority of Americans actually shares our values.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking his fury a step further, Weyrich said that while he was
``not suggesting that we all become Amish or move to Idaho,'' he
believes that ``we have to look at what we can do to separate
ourselves from this hostile culture.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked: ``What steps can we take to make sure that we and our
children are not infected? We need some sort of quarantine.''
</P>
<P>
   That's easy for Weyrich to say _ he's not an elected official
accountable to voters. But for those who do run for office, blaming
the public can be risky, particularly in an age when politicians _
no matter how much they grovel at the feet of voters _ find that
public to be increasingly aloof. For all his private
contemptuousness and fury at liberals, President Richard M. Nixon
was careful not to publicly denounce the prevailing public will.
</P>
<P>
   President Jimmy Carter was not as prudent. He isolated himself
from the electorate in 1979 when he said ``a moral and spiritual
crisis'' was gripping the nation. ``Too many of us,'' he said,
``now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption.''
Republicans traded for years on what was dubbed ``the malaise
speech,'' citing it as Exhibit One of a Democratic Party that was
out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't shame people into changing the way they look at the
world,'' said Dan Schnur, a Republican strategist in California.
``You have to lead by example. And if the people won't follow your
example, it's really not as much their problem as it is yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Weyrich is the most panicked, he is not alone.
Other conservatives are eager to fault the public rather than
themselves for misreading the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that ordinary Americans reacting to Clinton's conduct
``are complicit in his corruption,'' William Bennett, the former
education secretary who has since built his career on talking and
writing about morality, said: ``I will not defend the public.
Absolutely not. If people want to pander to the public and say
they're right, they can. But they're not right on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he rejected the ``canard that conservatives are
putting out that we didn't make our case.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Smith of New Hampshire, in formally announcing his
long-shot bid for the Republican presidential nomination last week,
could not resist a dig at the public: ``The president's acquittal
is a sad commentary on the prevailing values in America today.'' In
an interview, Smith sneered at polls showing _ week after week,
month after month _ little public appetite for impeachment. ``My
wife likes to say they must be polling people coming out of Hooters
on Saturday night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Craig Shirley, a longtime conservative public relations
consultant, said: ``A certain portion of the American public is
cowed by popular culture. They do not want to be thought of as not
being modern or sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   Such scorn for the will of the people may be an obvious
manifestation of conservatives' frustration. Again and again, they
replay the tape: A president whom they already believed to be
immoral has an affair with an intern in the Oval Office, lies about
it _ and remains as popular as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they are so demoralized and bitter because many
conservatives convinced themselves that sooner or later the
nation's pent-up outrage would surface. The Weekly Standard, a
conservative magazine, was positively gleeful after Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr sent his impeachment referral to Congress
last September. Jumping off the cover was an illustration of a
beaming Starr at bat, with the headline, ``Starr's Home Run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of conservatives said, `Wait, there's another woman.
There's another affidavit. It will all turn around,''' Bennett
recalled. ``But at each point they found out more about Clinton his
approvals went up.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton ventured back to this state last week _ where seven
years ago he pronounced himself the ``Comeback Kid'' _ his
detractors still could not contain their rage. In a front-page
editorial in The Union Leader of Manchester, publisher Nackey Loeb
advised the president to ``stop by Washington just long enough to
pick up his toothbrush, turn in his resignation and head back to
Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives were not as defeatist as Weyrich, who went so
far as to write off the Republican Party's ability to connect with
society. In his letter, Weyrich complained that ``we have probably
lost the culture war'' and said the cultural collapse was ``so
great that it simply overwhelms politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Weyrich said in an interview that he was not particularly
concerned that conservatives might alienate voters, because he
viewed his causes as larger than partisan politics. ``I've never
been one who is very active in the party to begin with,'' he said.
``It hasn't been my forte. I will be a good citizen and participate
appropriately. But I've never been consumed with the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Weyrich does not have to worry about his own electoral
fate. But perhaps the bashers of Joe Citizen who are still
committed Republicans can take solace in the example of at least
one successful politician who found that loathing voters is not
political suicide: Sen. Stephen Young, D-Ohio, who served from 1959
to 1971. In vituperative letters, he traded indignities with
constituents and interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Young wrote one constituent, ``Buster, your insults show that
you are the east end of a horse going west.'' He called another
constituent ``lower than a snake's tail in a wagon rut.'' He
exploded at still another, calling him a ``low-down skunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Young was re-elected in 1964, the beneficiary of the landslide
for President Lyndon B. Johnson.

   BAD RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION, Wis. _ Heartbreakingly beautiful,
the Chippewa territory here runs wild along the sandy shore of Lake
Superior, where soaring forests of quaking aspen and sugar maple
had long obscured the bleakness of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   For a century, Chippewas here grew up with a choice: move far
from home to find work, or stay and settle for government welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Young people in Bad River typically left for Chicago or
Milwaukee or Minneapolis, settling in edgy neighborhoods and
learning to navigate in places where the Ojibwe language was a
foreign tongue.
</P>
<P>
   But now many tribal members are coming home, not just for
funerals and weddings but for jobs. Legalized tribal gambling has
spawned a windfall of new employment in casinos, hotels and
restaurants. And the profits from the casinos are often invested in
schools, stores and clinics, enlivening tribal economies that once
seemed as lifeless as stone.
</P>
<P>
   The Mille Lacs tribe in Minnesota has used gambling profits to
build a hospital and a high school, and bought a bank that had once
refused to grant it a loan. The Apache at Fort McDowell in Arizona
have invested in service stations and convenience stores. The
Chippewa band here has used its profits from the Bad River Casino
and Lodge for new roads, programs for the elderly and the purchase
of tracts within the reservation long ago sold, or lost, to whites,
territory that Indians call ``alienated land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '90s, we've gone from everyone being on welfare to the
point that we've now got jobs for everyone here,'' said Bob
Poqorney, a marketing director at Bad River, which opened a casino
seven years ago. ``We've seen a sharp decline in the number of
people leaving. And we're seeing a lot of people coming back from
the cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Precise numbers of homecomings in Indian Country are hard to
come by, partly because the trend is so new. But there is no doubt
that most reservations with casinos are now flush with jobs, a
stark change from the days of selling beaded artwork to the few
motorists traveling along the rural highways. More than 125,000
people are now working at Indian casinos, hotels and restaurants
nationwide, and another 160,000 are working in jobs indirectly tied
to Indian gambling, according to the National Indian Gaming
Association. More than 90 percent of those jobs at Bad River are
held by Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Most reservations with gambling still have high rates of poverty
and unemployment. The image of Indians made rich by casino wealth
is wildly overdrawn; the notion is amplified by a few atypical but
highly publicized little tribes with big operations near
metropolitan regions like the Mashantucket Pequots' Foxwoods Resort
Casino in Ledyard, Conn., and the Shakopees' Mystic Lake Casino
outside Minneapolis and St. Paul. Unlike the Shakopee tribe, whose
300 members each received $400,000 in 1994, Indians on most
reservations with gambling get little or no money in per capita
payments.
</P>
<P>
   But jobs that pay $20,000 or more, once a dream in Indian
Country, have become relatively common. These are decent wages in a
place like Bad River, where a nice house costs about $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new jobs, together with the cultural ties, have beckoned to
people like John Moore, a native who left Bad River 30 years ago,
and took some hard knocks living in Milwaukee, before returning to
the reservation last fall to take a job as a security guard. ``This
isn't the same place where I grew up,'' said Moore, a rugged man in
his 50s, who wears some scars from the hard streets of Milwaukee.
``The idea of going back to the Rez for jobs _ it would have seemed
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now plenty of people at Bad River have come home for jobs, and
for their heritage. In the 12 years that Mike Wiggins lived in
Milwaukee, making good wages as a cement finisher, he yearned for
the life at Bad River.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job was in the city, but my heart was at the reservation,''
said Wiggins, 49, who returned five years ago to take a job at the
casino as a floor worker and rose to become vice-chairman of the
tribe, grateful to have the chance to raise two of his children in
the family's homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with the freedom to wander, to hunt and fish anytime
I wanted,'' he said. ``And I wanted my children to know that kind
of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Giago, a Lakota writer who lives in South Dakota, has called
the homecoming trend ``the biggest story in Indian Country.'' He
said it represented a triumph over the days when the U.S.
government tried mightily to move Indians away from reservations,
especially during the 1950s, in hopes that they would assimilate in
urban culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It failed miserably,'' said Giago, a former newspaper
publisher who recently started a publishing company for books on
Indian life. ``People went to the cities and missed their homeland,
missed their families. Many of these people ended up in the
gutter.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the growth of jobs created by gambling, Giago noted that
about 30 colleges are now flourishing on reservations, with
faculties that have evolved from almost all white to mostly Indian.
The staffs at health centers on the reservation, he said, are now
much more likely to be staffed by Indian doctors and nurses.
</P>
<P>
   One troubling trend on reservations, Giago noted, was the
increase in crime, much of it inflicted by whites. But tribal
leaders also see a growth in gangs among young Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Giago attributed some of the criminal activity to the people
returning from cities. ``They brought some of the problems of urban
streets back to the reservation,'' he said, noting that
reservations, usually located in rural regions with few police
officers, can be easing pickings for criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But to someone like Moore, who grew accustomed to the toughness
of Milwaukee neighborhoods, life at Bad River seems tame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk home in the middle of the night,'' he said with a
shrug, ``and I don't worry a bit.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: OLD, AND SOMETIMES SENTIMENTAL  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ ``I'm getting old,'' George Steinbrenner is
saying, around the corner from the Yankees' clubhouse here at
Legends Field, away from the cameras, apart from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of those big-news days that Steinbrenner lives for,
that for more than a quarter century he's been able to invent.
Roger Clemens is here, being welcomed into the Yankee family. It is
a day to feel the limitless possibilities of an unborn season. But
these days, Steinbrenner talks about getting old. At 68. A tanned
and rested 68.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' he says, ``that's getting old.''
</P>
<P>
   Old, and sometimes sentimental, but the Boss wants to make one
thing perfectly clear. He is not, in his ``getting old'' years,
going soft.
</P>
<P>
   He makes this point, unwittingly perhaps, by snapping at a
clubhouse kid wheeling a laundry cart through the narrow corridor,
pinning us against the wall. ``That can't wait?'' he asks. The kid
shrugs, pushes on. He does not get fired. Maybe he is getting just
a bit soft, around the edges, like an aging bear.
</P>
<P>
   I ask about his displays of public emotion, the crying game
during the clubhouse celebration after the clinching game of the
World Series in San Diego last October. On my television screen, he
looked close to tears several times at ESPN's annual awards show
last week in New York, especially when Joe Torre raised a trophy to
Steinbrenner in the audience and thanked him, poignantly, for being
the best Boss.
</P>
<P>
   A Boss increasingly in touch with his inner self, like Vincent,
on HBO's mafia series, ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not choke up at the ESPYs,'' Steinbrenner says, shaking
his head. ``No...no. I was happy for Joe, for my players. To be
named the best team of the year, going against the Chicago Bulls
and the Denver Broncos? That's an accomplishment to be proud of.
But I can tell you that I did not choke up at the ESPYs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the World Series, yes, I was very choked up because I
worked harder on that team than any other I've had, and because
right before we got up there, I had been in there with Bud Selig,
and we'd been talking about all we'd been through together, as
owners, and now with him being commissioner. And then when he
handed us the trophy ...''
</P>
<P>
   The Boss lost it, right in front of Nielsen Nation, and then
came the speculation that this was the signal that a quarter
century run as the country's most prominent sports franchise owner
might be over. The sale of the team to Cablevision's Charles Dolan
was coming. Steinbrenner was going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said this before and I'll say it again,'' he said.
``Whatever is worked out, I'll be here. I have a son and a
son-in-law who want to take over, and will. The Yankees and the
Steinbrenner family will be together for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The family business. It still comes first. It came before
whatever sentimental attachment Steinbrenner had formed for David
Wells, who won 18 games last season, lost 4, pitched a perfect
game, won the swing game, Game 5, of the American League
Championship Series. He became a true Yankee character, a New York
folk hero who stood on that same ESPY stage last week and spoke of
his love for his ``new home.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words rumbled through Steinbrenner's mind earlier this
week like a subway train. There were, he admitted, moments when he
had second thoughts after his baseball people had unanimously voted
to make the deal. How could he trade David Wells, he asked himself?
A few times he could feel himself wanting to reach for the phone;
he could feel the urge to overturn the vote. But that, he said,
would've been letting his emotions run wild at the worst of all
times, in the middle of a business deal. That, he said, would've
been soft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started thinking about how they crucified me when I let
Jimmy Key go and decided to sign Wells,'' he said. ``Then I said to
myself, `My God, how could you not want a Roger Clemens on your
team?' This is business, this is baseball. I've never been an
Eisenhower. I'm a Patton.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs and says, ``Howard Cosell called me that.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue shirt he is wearing is a gift that was presented to him
the night he made his peace with Yogi Berra by visiting the Berra
Museum in Little Falls, N.J. When Darryl Strawberry walks by, they
joke around, and half embrace, which apparently means that
Strawberry is forgiven for missing an autograph session last week
at the Florida State Fair without a note from his Boss.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner even admits he is interested in the publicized

consider, under such terms, keeping the team in the Bronx.

   ``When you're not a kid anymore,'' he says, ``you do care a

fans happy.''

   In his ``getting old'' age, he shook up his 125-victory
defending champions and reeled in Roger Clemens. When everyone
thought he was going soft, he cried no tears over David Wells.

   NEW YORK _ The story is that when David Wells first came here
from Baltimore, he wanted to wear Babe Ruth's No. 3. They had to
explain to him that the number was retired; he settled for wearing
one of Ruth's old caps.
</P>
<P>
   If Roger Clemens asks for No. 3, they ought to at least think
about it. One aspect of the Clemens-for-Wells deal that hasn't been
discussed is that it gives two of the game's greatest entities a
crack at something neither has ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, the best starting pitcher in baseball over the last 15
seasons and one of the 8 or 10 best of all time, gets a chance,
possibly his last, for the World Series ring that will validate his
career. The Yanks get the best pitcher of his era, in his prime or
close to it.
</P>
<P>
   That last statement seems incredible, but think about it. Who is
the greatest pitcher in Yankee history? Most fans would say Whitey
Ford, and that's a pretty good guess. Ford was 236-101 in 16
seasons with a 2.75 earned run average, and he's in the Hall of
Fame. Everyone acknowledges that Ford was a great big-game
performer, and along with Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra he remains a
symbol of the Yankees' era of dominance in the 1950s and early
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody ever called Ford the best pitcher of his time. This
season, when Clemens wins his fourth game, he'll have passed Ford's
career win total.
</P>
<P>
   Waite Hoyt, perhaps? The star of the Yankee staff in the 1920s
was a fine pitcher for 8 or 9 seasons and lasted in the Bigs for
21, posting a 237-182 record. Clemens is 233-124 going into spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   How many other great pitchers have the Yankees had? Red Ruffing
and Allie Reynolds were pretty good. Ron Guidry was almost great.
But isn't it one of baseball's puzzles that, in a game that is
supposedly mostly pitching, the winningest team in history has
never at any time had a pitcher who could be called the game's
best?
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has posted a 2.95 career earned run average in an era
when, unlike Ford's, runs are cheap. He has led the league in ERA
six times; only Lefty Grove, generally regarded as the greatest
starting pitcher ever, has led more (nine). That's the pitcher's
equivalent of winning the batting title six times, which no Yankee
has ever done.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has won five Cy Young awards; for a pitcher this is like
winning five Most Valuable Player awards, which only Ruth would
have achieved (if there had been an MVP award early in his career).
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to the departed Boomer, the pairing of
Clemens and the Yankees is a natural. The only regret should be
that it took 80 years to happen.

   WASHINGTON _ There was a time when G-men wore fedoras and hunted
down bank robbers, kidnappers and spies. Now, in addition to all
that, federal law-enforcement agents are being asked to track down
carjackers, wife beaters, drunk drivers and low-level drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The change in responsibilities has prompted some legal experts
to warn of the emergence of a national police force. It has also
raised a more prosaic issue.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen if the federal agents really got serious?
</P>
<P>
   Last week a special task force of the American Bar Association,
headed by former Attorney General Edwin Meese, issued a strongly
worded warning about the trend in Congress to federalize crimes
that are traditionally handled by state and local authorities.
Calling the trend ``misguided, unnecessary and even harmful,'' the
panel said, ``It reflects a phenomenon capable of altering and
undermining the careful decentralization of criminal law authority
that has worked well for all our constitutional history.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been so eager to be seen as tough on crime that it
has enacted a host of laws in recent years making crimes like
carjacking and drive-by shootings federal offenses. In fact, more
than 40 percent of all federal criminal statutes enacted since the
Civil War were placed on the books after 1970.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of the chest-thumping surrounding the passage of new
federal criminal laws, the panel said, the federal government does
little to protect Americans from crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of feel-good legislation,'' said Meese, who, had a
tough-on-crime reputation when he was attorney general during the
second half of the Reagan administration. ``It's passed because
it's politically popular or because a particular crime gets a lot
of media attention. But what we found was that the new laws aren't
utilized very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Of nearly 60,000 criminal cases filed in federal courts in the
1997 fiscal year, 164 were carjackings. There were no drive-by
shooting or domestic violence cases, crimes that got much media
attention when they were included in a major crime bill passed in
1994. Even in crimes like drug trafficking and possession _ an area
where the federal government has been quite active _ only 1.5
percent of the more than 1 million drug arrests in the country in
1997 were prosecuted by federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased federalization is rarely, if ever, likely to have
any appreciable effect on the categories of violent crime that most
concern Americans,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The legal scholars who made up the panel suggested that if
federal courts become overwhelmed with these criminal cases, they
may be prevented from handling antitrust, civil rights and other
civil matters that state courts cannot hear.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all they warn about what they see as a trend toward a
national police force, an issue that so concerned the framers of
the Constitution that they forbade the use of the military to
enforce domestic laws.

   Alabama was first. By early last year, nearly all of the state's
public libraries had computers and Internet access. Then came
Louisiana and Mississippi. Next up are Arkansas, Kentucky, West
Virginia and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're literally going to march through the states,'' said
Patty Stonesifer, president of the Gates Learning Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to help close the growing digital divide between
rich and poor by donating money for public-access computers to
libraries in all 50 states by 2003. This is the stated goal of the
foundation's benefactors, William H. Gates, chairman of Microsoft
Corp., and his wife, Melinda, who recently gave $1.1 billion to the
foundation, bringing its assets to $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gates does not run the foundation, but the people who run the
libraries have no doubts about the source of the money. Several of
the libraries that Ms. Stonesifer visited on a recent whirlwind
tour of the South, accompanied by a reporter, prominently displayed
a poster of Gates holding up an Ernest Hemingway novel and
admonishing people to read. As Ms. Stonesifer was leaving a branch
in New Orleans, an exuberant librarian called out, ``Tell Gates
it's like manna from heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   The library program offers a glimpse into Gates' newly
burgeoning philanthropy _ he and his wife also gave $2 billion last
month to the William H. Gates Foundation, which focuses on world
health and population issues, and followed that with another $1
billion earlier this month. It also casts new light on some old
questions: Can computers help bridge the nation's economic gaps?
What is the role of the public library in the digital age?
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the relatively recent involvement in public
libraries by Gates, whose company is embroiled in antitrust
litigation with the U. S. Department of Justice, suggests a nagging
question: At what cost does a public institution accept the largess
of a benefactor whose corporate interests are so closely linked to
the social good he is providing?
</P>
<P>
   The need for computers in economically disadvantaged areas is
obvious. According to a report released last summer by the
Department of Commerce, American households with annual income
below $35,000 have PC ownership and online access levels well below
the national average, while households earning more than $75,000
have the highest. The report said the gap had widened in the last
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Figuring out a way to bridge that gap is important to us,''
Gates said, in e-mail, referring to himself and his wife. ``We want
to make sure everyone has the ability to have Internet access,
regardless of where they live or how much money they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have questioned Gates' altruism. When the Gates Learning
Foundation was announced in 1997, as a spinoff of a Microsoft
program called Libraries Online, skeptics noted that by encouraging
the use of the technology that made him rich, Gates' philanthropic
efforts could be considered self-serving. Virtually all the
computers that go to the libraries run on the Microsoft Windows
operating system. They arrive at the libraries loaded with a dozen
or so Microsoft programs and games as well as a handful of CD-ROM
programs from Corbis, an archive of images owned by Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the Gates money goes to libraries as a one-time grant.
The foundation will supply free software upgrades, but once the
hardware is obsolete, the libraries are on their own when they need
to replace it. ``This doesn't even qualify as philanthropy,'' said
Theodore Roszak, a historian at California State University at
Hayward and a social critic. ``It's just seeding the market. You're
simply lubricating future sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the skepticism, however, which was heaviest in the
earliest days of the program, has dissipated. ``Carnegie gave money
to build libraries on the proviso that the libraries would support
themselves afterward,'' said John Berry, editor in chief of Library
Journal. ``Obviously, Gates must be biased in favor of Microsoft
products, but that is the dominant technology right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Carnegie, the steel tycoon whose money built more than
1,600 public libraries in the United States in the early part of
the century, is a name that crops up frequently alongside Gates'
these days. Not since Carnegie's time, in fact, have public
libraries, chronically strapped for funds, seen such an infusion of
private money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public libraries have been ignored over the years,'' said
Susan Kent, city librarian at the Los Angeles Public Library, who
welcomes the donations. ``What the Gateses have done is say that
libraries are important.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant recipients are not required to buy computers that run on
Windows. Once the Gates Learning Foundation issues a check,
librarians are free to buy whatever equipment they choose, with one
condition: the money must be used for public-access computing.
</P>
<P>
   There is a catch: the foundation's technical support staff is
set up to install and support a specific configuration of computers
manufactured by Gateway Computers. Deviating from the prescribed
setup means forgoing technical support from the foundation. Since
the program began, said Ms. Stonesifer, a handful of grant
recipients have chosen Windows-based computers made by other
companies, like Dell, but none of the recipients have opted for
Macintosh computers, which do not use Windows and are made by
Microsoft's main rival, Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   This has raised some eyebrows among nonprofit organizations.
``While you're free to do anything you want,'' said Andrew Blau,
program director at the Markle Foundation in New York, ``it has
raised the concern that they make it so easy to do it a particular
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Blau and others credited the foundation with careful
planning and implementation of the program. Technical training of
librarians is extensive, and the libraries get free technical
support for three years after purchasing the computers. To address
the problem of obsolescence, the Gates foundation asks grant
applicants to outline their plans for upgrading the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of the Gates foundation computers into
libraries has not always gone smoothly. After receiving their
computers, overwhelmed librarians in Troy, Ala., unplugged the
machines and put them back in their boxes. The machines were
returned to service only after a visit from foundation staff
members.
</P>
<P>
   Libraries in extremely rural parts of Alabama have had a
difficult time establishing reliable Internet connections. More
than two dozen libraries in remote parts of the state have to make
a toll call to reach an Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   The grants themselves, based on the size of the population in a
library's immediate service area, are not huge. The average check
per library is roughly $18,000, which buys five computers, a laser
printer and communications equipment. ``In these small communities,
a little bit of money is a profound solution,'' Ms. Stonesifer
said.
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Although the program is still young, few public libraries _ 30
out of 733 eligible ones _ so far have refused a Gates grant,
according to the foundation. In some instances, the libraries said
they did not have the resources to support the computers.
</P>
<P>
   Rural librarians, whose budgets are often the leanest, have seen
the most striking change. Take Bay Minette, Ala., north of Mobile,
where 21 percent of the 8,000 residents live below the poverty
level, according to the 1990 census, and one in four adults is
functionally illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Cabaniss, who runs the Bay Minette Public Library,
said that since the Gates computers arrived a year ago, people who
otherwise would not have thought to venture into the local library
are suddenly showing up. Many of the new patrons are encountering
computers and the Internet for the first time. They use the
computers to type resumes, hunt for jobs, do schoolwork, research
Beanie Babies, look up medical information, investigate family
roots, send e-mail and visit wrestling sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Usage is heaviest after the schools let out. ``When 3 p.m.
comes, they hit the doors and I have to turn them away from the
computers,'' Ms. Cabaniss said.
</P>
<P>
   Librarians in Alabama have noticed that traditional information
resources like books and reference materials are more often than
not a second thought these days.
</P>
<P>
   But several librarians at newly computerized libraries pointed
out that circulation had increased, as more people go to the
library to use the computers and notice the books.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kent of the Los Angeles Public Library said that since 1996,
when the library began installing public-access computers in its 67
branches _ 2 of the branches were beneficiaries of Microsoft's
Libraries Online program _ circulation steadily had risen. ``We see
teen-agers in here every day who never ever used to use the public
library,'' Ms. Kent said.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger question, well beyond the scope of most public
libraries, surrounds the problem of just how technology should be
used to help those at an economic disadvantage. Closing a technical
gap is one thing. Using technology in a way that, say, helps to
improve academic performance or helps someone find a job is
another. In the future, the learning foundation plans to expand
beyond libraries to schools and community centers, and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next is crucial. Helen Birenbaum, executive
director of the City University of New York graduate school's
Stanton/Heiskell Center for telecommunications policy, who has
conducted a seven-year study on the effects of computers on
academic achievement, is wary of programs like the Gates library
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will all fail unless there are thoughtful programs that
understand how to support low-income folks,'' Ms. Birenbaum said.
``It won't help them enough just to be able to sit in front of a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Gates people are doing is a first step,'' she said.
``But I think it will fail unless there is the next step.''

RECRUITING BENEFICIARIES TO SPOT MEDICARE FRAUD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   N.J., Fla., Texas, Mass., Ill. , Wash., Ky.)   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government will begin enlisting
millions of Medicare beneficiaries in its war against Medicare
fraud next week, urging them to report billing errors, overcharges
and other evidence of possible wrongdoing by their own doctors and
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has strong support from lobbyists for the elderly,
who see it as a way to educate consumers and save money for
Medicare and its beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort has provoked outrage among doctors, who say it
will drive a wedge into the doctor-patient relationship,
undermining the trust needed for effective medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials will fan out across the country on Wednesday
to show Medicare beneficiaries how to decipher their medical bills
and ferret out fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala,
Attorney General Janet Reno and the director of the FBI, Louis J.
Freeh, will speak to beneficiaries at 30 sites linked by satellite.
The ``fraud fighter rallies'' will be held in Washington, New York
City, Boston, Miami, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Seattle and
Honolulu, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senior citizens are our first line of defense in the battle
against Medicare fraud,'' Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
   June Gibbs Brown, inspector general of the Department of Health
and Human Services, estimates that improper Medicare payments
totaled $12.6 billion last year. But she said she could not specify
how much of this was attributable to fraud, as opposed to
unintentional billing errors. Medicare finances health care for 39
million people who are elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the new campaign is: ``Who Pays? You Pay!'' The
message is that Medicare beneficiaries and taxpayers pay more when
doctors, hospitals and other health care providers ``rip off'' the
program, in the words of the Federal Health Care Financing
Administration, which runs Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The government is offering rewards up to $1,000 for information
that leads to the recovery of Medicare money lost to fraud and
abuse. Federal officials said such abuse included billing Medicare
for services that were never provided or were not medically
necessary; billing for services more costly than those actually
performed, and billing twice for the same service or supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In recruiting ``fraud busters,'' the government tells Medicare
patients, ``You can join the fight and help stop Medicare cheats
from stealing your tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the American Medical Association met recently with
Medicare officials to complain that the government was using
inflammatory language that tends to set patients against doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In a confidential report to AMA trustees, Dr. E. Ratcliffe
Anderson Jr., executive vice president of the association, said:
``We stated that we could not underscore strongly enough the
outrage that physicians feel about these types of beneficiary
outreach programs. We expressed physicians' grave concern that this
type of rhetoric completely undermines the physician-patient
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials said patients were often in the best
position to spot fraud and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare contractors say that they receive 130,000 telephone
calls about potential fraud and abuse each year, and that 72
percent, or 94,000 calls, are from beneficiaries, many of whom
question the propriety of claims filed on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Retired Persons, a co-sponsor of the
new campaign, says, ``Medicare beneficiaries must become the eyes
and ears of law enforcement.'' The group is urging its members to
join a ``neighborhood fraud watch,'' which will scrutinize Medicare
statements for questionable charges.
</P>
<P>
   In brochures to be disseminated at the kickoff events next week,
the AARP says: ``Most health care providers are honest, and the
questionable charge may be the result of a clerical error. That's
why many people call their provider first.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, if you're not sure, you don't feel comfortable
talking with your provider or your provider's answer is not
satisfactory, don't hesitate to report a questionable charge to the
Medicare fraud hot line at 1-800-447-8477.''
</P>
<P>
   The hot line is operated by the inspector general of the
Department of Health and Human Services. ``Just reporting
questionable practices will help keep unethical providers on their
toes,'' the association of retired persons says.
</P>
<P>
   But some doctors are furious. Dr. George J. Petruncio, a family
practitioner in Turnersville, N.J., said: ``Senior citizens are
being drafted to act as agents of the government. This will create
an adversarial relationship between the patient and the
physician.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John M. Rainey, who has been caring for cancer patients in
Lafayette, La., for more than 20 years, said, ``The government is,
in effect, asking patients to turn in their doctors.'' Dr. Jerald
R. Schenken, a pathologist in Omaha, said, ``Legitimate doctors are
very concerned that they will be classified as fraudulent.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey S. Freed, a surgeon in Manhattan, said: ``This puts
patients in the position of having to police their own physicians.
We have a sacred trust to do no harm, but the government now tells
patients that we may be doing them financial harm. Patients will be
less likely to trust me as their advocate, and less willing to
share delicate medical information.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Hospital Association has told its members to
prepare for a barrage of phone calls from Medicare patients.
Richard J. Pollack, executive vice president of the association,
conceded that hospital bills were ``hideously complex and often
incomprehensible.'' But he said that patients overestimated fraud
and mistakenly believed that ``if you crack down on fraud, you can
extend the life of the Medicare trust fund forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is assigning more auditors and investigators to
health care cases. In the last four years, more than 8,500 health
care providers were excluded from Medicare after they were found to
have engaged in fraud or professional misconduct. Criminal
convictions for health care fraud reached 326 last year, up from
140 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Beneficiaries repeatedly say Medicare fraud should be eliminated
before their benefits are cut or premiums or co-payments are
increased.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government pays most Medicare bills, older
Americans receive statements itemizing the services and equipment
for which Medicare has been billed. Federal officials and the AARP
say that any questionable charge should be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, they say, beneficiaries should answer three
questions about each charge: Did you receive the service or product
for which Medicare was billed? Did your doctor order the service or
product for you? To the best of your knowledge, is the item
relevant to your diagnosis or treatment?
</P>
<P>
   An FBI official said that several complaints about the same
provider may indicate a pattern of abuse or a fraudulent scheme.
(MORE)
nn
</P>
<P>
   Besides offering monetary rewards, federal officials note that
private citizens may file lawsuits, on behalf of the government,
against health care providers who defraud Medicare. Under the False
Claims Act, the government may impose a civil fine up to $10,000
for each fraudulent claim and may recover three times the amount of
any damages it sustains. The person who filed the original lawsuit
may get up to 30 percent of the money recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors say the government must be careful. Dr. William F.
Gee, a urologist in Lexington, Ky., said: ``Medicare patients may
not remember what services they received. They may never see the
doctors who perform certain services _ the radiologist who reads an
X-ray, the pathologist who examines a tissue specimen.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare claims typically are reviewed and paid by Blue Cross
and Blue Shield plans or other insurance companies acting as agents
for the government. The government recently advised these companies
about how to handle complaints of fraud and abuse, saying that
patients should not be told simply to ``work it out'' with their
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the government said, if a complaint seems to have
merit, the contractor should interview a sample of the doctor's
patients.

ON DECK FOR YANKEES: CRASH COURSE IN INTENSITY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ A clubhouse full of pinstriped pitchers eagerly
awaited the arrival of Roger Clemens here Saturday. To rookie Ryan
Bradley, to long-time pitcher David Cone, Clemens is seen as a
great store of knowledge. Clemens will be asked questions and
watched closely, the way a former president might if he were
teaching a college course after leaving the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's probably the best pitcher in the game, and there
are a lot of people in here who are going to learn from him,'' said
the reliever Jeff Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   When club officials determined to trade for Clemens three days
ago, they assumed the five-time Cy Young Award winner would provide
more than just a well-pitched ball game every fifth day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is someone who has incredible presence,'' Cone said. ``He
has Paul O'Neill-type intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone does not freely throw around comparisons to O'Neill, who is
said to set the tone for how the position players on this team
focus deeply on each at-bat. O'Neill's inner rage is unique, and
similarly, Clemens' approach to his work is legendary: his workouts
between starts, his intense approach to each game, the detailed
notes he keeps on hitters and umpires. Yankees pitchers will watch
and learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if he's in a trance on the day he pitches, from what I
hear,'' Cone said. ``That's something I'm kind of anxious to see.
He's almost unapproachable _ you don't even want to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to compare notes with him. Once the young guys get
over their awe of him, he'll be able to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte had a poster of Clemens on his wall when he was a
teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the Yankees' best pitching prospect, has always seen
Clemens as his idol; the Yankees played the Blue Jays shortly after
Bradley was promoted last year, and as the Yankees worked out,
Bradley could hardly contain himself from rushing to the other side
of the field just to get a look at Clemens, in the flesh. He wanted
to meet him and shake his hand, but never got the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bradley and Clemens will share the same field, the same
clubhouse, the same mounds, at least through spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best,'' said Bradley. ``I love the way he pitches,
the way he goes up and in on hitters, the way he does things. I'd
love to learn some stuff from him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee pitcher whose stuff most resembles that of Clemens is
Hideki Irabu, who also throws a fastball 95-96 miles an hour, with
a diving split-fingered fastball. But Irabu already has been put on
notice by Joe Torre in the first days of camp, the manager
indicating that Irabu needs to start preparing with more purpose,
and not take his job for granted.
</P>
<P>
   What could Irabu learn from Clemens?
</P>
<P>
   ``Work ethic,'' Torre answered, quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of last season, opposing pitchers had been
throwing inside to Yankees' hitters, knocking them down; Pettitte,
in particular, did not retaliate in a game against Seattle, and
that led to a team meeting. Earlier in spring, Nelson suggested
that the starting pitchers had to take more responsibility in
protecting the hitters, that the Yankees' relievers always had to
do the dirty work of knocking down or hitting opposing hitters,
when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   That won't be an issue with Clemens, the game's most
intimidating pitcher. In the parlance of the old Western: there's a
new sheriff in town.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens twice was involved in beanball incidents with the
Yankees last season, when he was pitching with Toronto. After Irabu
hit Blue Jays shortstop Alex Gonzalez in the head, Clemens
immediately hit Derek Jeter in the side, and the message was clear:
you hit our shortstop, and I'm going to drill your shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Sept. 11, the Yankees were taking healthy full swings
against Clemens, and Clemens responded by drilling Scott Brosius in
the back.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' penchant for pitching inside, said the Yankees catcher
Joe Girardi, makes him very uncomfortable to bat against.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said: ``You hated the way he did it when you were on the
opposing side of the field. But now he's with us. Instead of having
the relievers going out and protecting hitters, he will do it. He
has no problem doing in. In fact, he gets away with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason why the other pitchers shouldn't be picking
up a lot of stuff from Clemens. I mean, he's a Hall of Fame
pitcher.'' &QL;

STRAY DOG PROBLEM HAS ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICIALS IN PERPETUAL CRISIS
MODE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Turbo is trapped. One minute he's eating a
breakfast of garbage with the rest of his stray dog pack. The next
he's running for his life with animal control officers hot on his
heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Need a rope. Need a rope,'' Officer Miguel Gonzalez shouts
from deep inside Turbo's hedgerow hiding place.
</P>
<P>
   Officers Jesse Castillo and Eric Gardner cover Turbo's only
exit. Castillo drops his lasso over the hole and snares the fleeing
gray and white mutt with an expert yank.
</P>
<P>
   ``How ya doin', Turbo?'' Castillo says, soothing the shaking
dog, a mutt so familiar residents gave him a name.
</P>
<P>
   Another day, another collar.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, the three officers of the L.A. Animal Services Special
Enforcement Unit _ the city's stray dog police _ could lasso loose
pooches 24 hours a day, seven days a week and barely put a dent in
the city's rogue canine population.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative estimates put Los Angeles' stray dog population
equal to the population of a small city: roughly 44,000 dogs. They
are a motley mix of all shapes and sizes _ from pathetic mutts like
Turbo to vicious pit bulls with bone-crushing bites.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Martinez saw a pit bull mix shred two cats in the alley
behind his Pacoima house. ``I call the city, no one comes,''
Martinez said. ``I get so angry I want to kill the stinking dog
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Animal control officers caught the dog, a pit bull mix still
wearing a harness and frayed rope. No one knew who owned the dog.
</P>
<P>
   The stray dog problem is so bad the animal control officers
focus only on the worst areas: South Central L.A. and the
 &UR; e &LR; ast San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no slow days,'' said Lt. Tim Goffa, who serves as
unit leader and manages the East Valley Animal Shelter. ``Right
now, it's out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Animal Services General Manager Dan Knapp said the city has
ignored its stray dog problem for two decades, and now it's time to
pay. He is asking the Los Angeles City Council for $262,000 to hire
an additional seven officers and another supervisor whose sole duty
will be to chase stray dogs. The request effectively triples the
agency's current $131,000 special enforcement budget, but Knapp
says it's crucial. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``We are reacting every day with a minimal ability to even
touch the problem,'' he said. ``What we've asked for is two teams
of five Special Enforcement Unit officers. With that, we can begin
to impact the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a public health crisis. We have at least 44,000 dogs
on the streets that are definitely not inoculated against rabies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bites are another concern.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
estimate America's 52 million dogs bite an estimated 4.7 million
people a year. About 800,000 bites are considered bad enough to
require medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Children account for half of all the bites, the CDC reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services dismantled
its dog bite investigation unit in 1995 to save money, so the scope
of the local problem is unclear. In 1996, the city and county
reported 878 animal bites -- dogs, cats and wild animals -- to
state health officials, but the figure is far too low, authorities
say. In the same report, Orange and San Diego counties reported
5,705 and 4,483 animal bites respectively in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline Bernstein, president of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals-Los Angeles, said animal control always takes
a back seat to a long list of other priorities in most municipal
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem no one has to see until the dogs are running
the streets,'' Bernstein said. ``They're the new street gangs _
hungry, street-fighting dogs. It's not a new problem. It's becoming
more talked about because of the Hayden bill. That's making people
think about it and that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Hayden's SB 1785 is forcing governments across
the state to take a hard look at animal control services. The law,
which went into effect on Jan. 1, forces animal shelters to provide
more care for sick or injured animals _ instead of euthanizing them
_ and also extends the mandatory hold period from three to seven
days. Animal control agencies across the state are facing millions
of dollars in increased costs.

IS SACRAMENTO STILL IN THE LEAGUE? VERY DEFINITELY  
 FEERICK IS HISTORY  
 STOCKTON TO PAYTON TO KIDD  
 RODMAN'S DECISION  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Danny Ainge emerged from his first practice session as a
Sacramento King more than a decade ago and heard the sound of
shotguns outside Arco Arena, the team's home facility that was
built in the middle of the sticks, north of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on?'' Ainge inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duck season,'' he was told.
</P>
<P>
   As the losses piled up, there were more than enough rustic
stories to go around about the town and the team _ one of the
National Basketball Association's perennial sad-sack franchises
since it moved west from Kansas City in 1985. They were called the
Sacrificial Kings and worse.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help when they finally lucked out on the No. 1 draft
pick in 1989 _ and promptly chose Pervis Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' last winning season was 1983 and they have one
playoff victory to their credit in the past 13 seasons. The last
time the franchise won a playoff series, Ernie Grunfeld was in the
backcourt. But the jokes and the futility are gradually coming to
an end.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber is now dunking back missed shots for the Kings, the
rookie point guard Jason Williams is freezing Gary Payton before
going by him, and Vlade Divac's behind-the-back passes are finding
cutting teammates rather than fans in the fourth row.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings moved to 5-3 on Friday night with a victory over
Charlotte. Williams' flair, Webber's force and Divac's craftiness
are pushing Phoenix, the Lakers and Minnesota, whom the Kings play
Sunday afternoon, for the title of America's Highlights-at-11 team.
Whether or not they advance to the playoffs, the Kings represent
the best off-season makeover of a lottery team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a different type of team a year ago, where it was
basically Mitch shooting the ball all the time,'' said Geoff
Petrie, the Kings' general manager, referring to the former
All-Star guard Mitch Richmond. ``Now, Mitch is a terrific player,
but the passing and ball movement we have is something that's made
this team exciting. They play very unselfishly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings went into Friday night's game as the only team in the
league averaging more than 100 points. They are second in assists.
Webber, who was traded in the off season for Richmond, and Divac
are two of the better interior passers.
</P>
<P>
   The brand of ball they play _ essentially an end-to-end,
church-league scrimmage _ is reminiscent of the Golden State
Warriors' style of nearly 10 years ago. Petrie is the architect,
but he has had some help.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective owners and brothers Gavin and Joe Maloof, who
will take over the team in July, made their presence felt
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   They flew to Little Rock, Ark., in a tornado to convince Corliss
Williamson and his agent to play for a meager $500,000 so salary
cap room might be cleared for Divac's six-year, nearly $60 million
deal. Williamson kept his Larry Bird rights, meaning he can command
a much better deal after this season.
</P>
<P>
   Petrie pushed hard to draft Williams at No. 7, in spite of the
fact he flunked two drug tests at the University of Florida.
Williams, a point guard, has brought flair and fire to the
position. Petrie also spent considerable time in Greece the past
two years, swaying the team's 1996 draft pick, the 6-foot-9-inch
Predrag (Peja) Stoyakovic, to finally join the team.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the 21-year-old Yugoslav, perhaps the best
player to come out of Europe in the past year, helped his fellow
countryman Divac to leave Charlotte for the Kings. Tariq
Abdul-Wahad starts at shooting guard, while Stoyakovic comes off
the bench. The Kings also acquired the seldom-used Laker guard Jon
Barry for less than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though Webber has said he is merely making the best of his
situation _ Sacramento might as well have been Siberia for him
after Washington jettisoned him _ he is playing some of his most
inspired basketball.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, with the new collective bargaining agreement, the
Kings can keep Williams for up to four years before he pursues free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally convinced there's a young nucleus here that with
maturity and experience can be something much, much better than
we've ever had before,'' Petrie said. ``Whether it happens this
season or down the road, I don't know. It's hard to ask patience
and perseverance from the fans of such a long-suffering team, but
we may have to. What you can say is, we're potentially pretty good
here now.''
</P>
<P>
   Feerick Is History
</P>
<P>
   John D. Feerick was quietly released from his duties last week
as the grievance arbitrator under the collective bargaining
agreement. The league, not the union, asked for the dismissal of
Feerick, the Fordham Law School dean who ruled in the Latrell
Sprewell case.
</P>
<P>
   Feerick was thrust into the spotlight last March when he sharply
reduced the penalty handed down by the NBA and Golden State after
Sprewell choked Coach P.J. Carlesimo in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After a much-publicized hearing, Feerick ruled that Sprewell's
contract with the Warriors would be reinstated, and that
Commissioner David Stern's yearlong suspension would be trimmed to
the end of last season. Sprewell lost 68 games and $6.4 million _
the longest and most costly nondrug-related suspension in league
history.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Feerick was roundly criticized. Even Stern got into the
act, saying that Feerick's decision essentially said it was all
right to choke your boss if you play in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no ill feelings,'' Feerick said on Thursday. ``I feel
terribly privileged to have had the opportunity to work as a judge
in a great American sport. I will always feel grateful for that. I
can understand the need for change, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The league and the union will have to agree on the appointment
of a new grievance arbitrator to decide disputes that arise from
the new agreement. But they will be hard-pressed to find one with
not only impeccable integrity and credentials but also one as
philanthropic.
</P>
<P>
   Feerick worked 250 hours on a guaranteed contract case between
July and September, in which he earned an $88,000 fee. He is going
to use that money to establish a scholarship at Fordham to assist
law students from the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time he has dedicated the fruits of his
arbitration work to worthwhile causes. He took the entire $98,000
fee he would have earned from the Sprewell arbitration and gave it
to a grammar school in the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, he did find it somewhat amusing that Sprewell landed
in New York. ``I've gotten a lot of comments,'' Feerick said,
laughing. ``Suffice to say, nobody has given me any free tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I wish him well.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton to Payton to Kidd
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton is still the most productive and dominating point
guard in the game, having taken over the unofficial title from John
Stockton about two seasons ago. But you wonder how long he can hold
onto the crown. One player has had two triple-doubles this season,
and it's not a power forward or a shooting guard. Jason Kidd
erupted for 28 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists against Denver
last Monday and followed up with 14 points, 15 rebounds and 10
assists on Wednesday against San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's Decision
</P>
<P>
   It's nice of Dennis Rodman to finally make up his mind about his
plans for this season. Rodman is holding a news conference Monday
at a very discreet location _ Planet Hollywood in Beverly Hills. If
he decides to play, he'll have cost himself about $150,000 in
prorated salary by waiting until the season was in its third week.

LOS ANGELES: increased costs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Knapp is asking City Council leaders to increase
his budget from $8.2 million to $11.9 million in the coming fiscal
year _ a $3.7 million increase. He's asking for an additional $1.6
million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Knapp said his agency now operates in perpetual crisis mode.
Forty-five animal control officers police a city of 3.8 million
people, 3 million cats, 760,000 dogs, and an assortment of
chickens, pigs, goats and other livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, three officers and a supervisor were devoted to
tackling the stray dog problem. But it was too little, too late.
Last year, the city took in 33,000 stray dogs. Animal control
officers caught 7,581 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the problem increases exponentially on the streets.
Spay/USA, an animal overpopulation awareness group, estimates one
female dog and her offspring can produce 67,000 dogs in six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just snowballs,'' Bernstein said. ``They're not spayed or
neutered so they're just making more. It fuels overpopulation.
Getting the strays off the street would stabilize the population.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan's office said the stray dog task force
will get special attention when his final budget request is
submitted on April 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question that the city budget remains tight,'' Deputy Mayor
Noelia Rodriguez said. ``However, this issue is a priority for the
mayor because it affects the quality of life for our residents on a
number of levels from public safety to the atmosphere of the
community. It's not good for the two-legged Angelenos as well as
the four-legged Angelenos.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem calls for a grim solution. Most strays are not
adoptable. They're too skittish, diseased or old, so they're killed
instead. L.A. Animal Services euthanized 35,522 dogs and 17,604
cats last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents are not sorry to see the stray mutts go to an
uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad you all are catching all of them,'' resident Eric
Allen told animal control officers. ``Every day, every night
there's dogs running up and down, up and down. This place round
here is pathetic with dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time, I had to come out here with my bat. This Dalmatian
was jumping on this little girl. She was crying, her parents were
yelling, so I came out and started slugging.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, a dog pack has lived unhindered so long the
alley is thick with dried feces. Residents named one alley dog
``Fleabag.'' The dog had limped around the neighborhood for two
years after it was hit by a car. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The dogs are not to blame. The root of the problem goes back
to irresponsible pet owners who don't spay or neuter their dogs and
let them wander the streets _ which can lead to a $76 ticket if an
officer has time to write it. Unwanted animals are turned out on
the streets or dumped into already overcrowded shelters where most
are killed to make room for an endless tide of neglected animals.
Only 11,000 dogs were adopted at L.A. shelters last year.
</P>
<P>
   Grim, overcrowded conditions at California animal shelters led
to the Hayden bill, which may have the unintended consequence of
increasing animal euthanasia. The law requires longer holding
periods for sick or injured animals, which means adoptable animals
will have to be euthanized to make room for a new surplus of dogs
and cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animals that are sick, injured or have behavioral problems
tend to die quickly in shelters. Adoptable animals occupy shelter
space longer,'' said Gini Barrett, western regional director of the
American Humane Association and a member of the city's animal
regulation board. ``But there is so much protection in this bill
that the ones we will have to euthanize first are the happy,
adoptable ones _ the ones we used to keep the longest.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Remember Giga Pets? Not long ago, the little
hand-held computers that children fed, watered and nurtured by
pressing buttons were all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to imagine how a toy company could top that
craze, but get ready for Giga Monsters, designed for ages 5 and up.
Here the object is to make the virtual pets die.
</P>
<P>
   The persnickety monsters keep coming back to life as the
diligent child tries to hasten their destruction. They live in tiny
coffins, or ``uniquely stylized cabinets,'' in the words of the
toy's creator, Tiger Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost enough to make one nostalgic for the days when toys
died because they ran out of batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The Giga Monster was but one of many startling items on display
last week at the 96th American International Toy Fair in New York,
where 1,700 exhibitors gathered to peddle their wares to 20,000
buyers. Most of the toys and games haven't hit stores yet. Some are
still prototypes and failed in demonstrations; others succeeded in
demonstrations and will still fail in stores.
</P>
<P>
   In the game of Conscience _ ``The fun way to learn right from
wrong'' _ players travel through seven zones: violence, drugs,
crime, character, charity, education and sex. (Sex is optional, and
parents can remove or add this zone at will.) Winners earn gold
stars. Losers collect black marks and wind up in the principal's
office, detention center, jail or the morgue. Players get on the
wrong path if they ignore their homework, for example, or
``associate with druggies.'' The board game has been designed by
GoRu Products for ages 8 and up, but comes with a simplified
version that 5- to 7-year-olds can enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Checkers, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Children are certainly capable of dealing with morality,
character or crime _ after all, they encounter such issues in fairy
tales and in the schoolyard. And, of course, classic games have
always tackled the big themes: Chess explores war, Monopoly takes
on greed and in many games players meet their metaphorical deaths.
But the latest toys tend to be more literal, making announcements
like, ``Your toy just died.''
</P>
<P>
   The new heavy-handed gadgets, plus Jerry Springer board games
and Rock-'n-Roll Elmo, are part of a $20 billion-a-year industry.
Even Bill Gates has gotten in on it. Anyone who thinks Microsoft or
the Teletubbies are intent on world domination will be alarmed to
hear that they have forged an alliance. Microsoft Teletubbies
ActiMates are dolls that a conspiracy theorist could love.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who believes the purple Teletubby is secretly gay
obviously did not attend this year's toy fair. Secrecy and subtlety
were not at a premium: Toys for 1999 tell about themselves in
painstaking detail, and they won't shut up. They will tell you if
they are dead or alive or sad. The Kissy-Kissy Baby, courtesy of
Irwin Toy Ltd., will pucker if you kiss her mouth, will say ``Kiss
my boo-boo better'' if you kiss her hand and ``I love you, Mommy''
if you kiss her cheek. Her responses are ``moisture-activated.''
</P>
<P>
   Even lipstick gets a word in. Funrise Toy is offering electric
lipstick equipped with a sound module that says things like ``You
go girl!''and ``Looking Good!'' The lipstick presumably provides
the encouragement that young girls may not otherwise be getting.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of the sound chip, toys can broadcast all kinds
of messages out loud. Girls' white shoes, for example, could once
connote innocence, or summer, or membership in the wedding party.
But now tots with marital ambitions can slip on a pair of Funrise's
Sound Shoes without any ambiguity. The shoes play ``Here Comes the
Bride'' as the girl walks.
</P>
<P>
   But in a stride against blonde stereotypes, Mattel's Chatty
Cathy now comes in new hair and eye colors. The doll, who
incessantly says things like ``Please carry me,'' can now be a
brunette, too.
</P>
<P>
   Technology also allows toys to relate to one another. According
to Plato, Aristophanes suggested that human beings were once
two-headed creatures, then were split in half and condemned to
spend the rest of their lives seeking to re-attach to their
original mates. Dubbels, a toy by Rumpus, uses the latest
recognition technology chips to prove Aristophanes right. Somewhere
out there, the perfect mate awaits each L-shaped bean-bag creature.
They just need to be fit together.
</P>
<P>
   If two incompatible bean-bags join, the toy will complain,
``You're cute, but you're not my Dubbel.'' The crestfallen child
will then probably demand that another $5.99 be invested in the
Dubbel's search for romance. The payoff comes when it finds its
bean-bag fantasy mate and announces, ``Baby I've been waiting for
you my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   With recognition technology this advanced, subliminal messages
are unnecessary.

ATTORNEY-AUTHOR COLLECTS COMPELLING ARGUMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DON HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. -- After dropping out of high school at age 17,
Michael Lief has piloted submarines for the Navy, conducted
research at the United Nations, edited a newspaper and graduated
from law school.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 35-year-old Ventura County deputy district attorney is
trying on a brand-new role: popular author.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury'' _ his compilation of
notable closing trial arguments _ has raced through four printings.
He recently sold the British rights, and the book will soon be
published in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   There's even talk of an audio book and a documentary series for
cable.
</P>
<P>
   Lief, an affable man with a quick wit and a ready laugh, said
the book has all the fascination of a potboiler blended with modern
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans love crime, as you can tell by the success of shows
like `Homicide,' `The Practice' and `Law and Order,' '' Lief said.
``It's compelling, and it's dramatic. We're dealing with issues
here ranging from genocide, assassination, murder, the nuclear
power industry. So these deal with compelling issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``And nothing is more compelling than crime or genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   Published by Scribner, the 400-page book covers the most
eloquent closing arguments in 10 notable trials _ most from this
century. Defendants include the Nuremberg Nazi war criminals,
Charles Manson, the Chicago Seven and Lt. William Calley, involved
in the 1968 My Lai massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Among Lief's favorites is a closing argument by Clara Shortridge
Foltz, California's first female attorney. Although the 1890 trial
centered on an Italian immigrant charged with arson, prosecutor
Thetas Stonehill set his sights not on the defendant, but on Foltz
and the idea of female lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is so quick-witted, so sarcastic that I found several
times I laughed out loud while reading her summation,'' Lief said.
``The jury, without leaving the jury box, found her defendant not
guilty. So she got a good result and she took (the prosecutor) to
the woodshed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lief got the idea for the book in 1993, while he was in his
first year at the Pepperdine University School of Law. Assigned to
write a closing argument for a class, he scoured the library for
examples of great closing statements. Finding none, he mulled the
idea over and then approached one of his law professors, H.
Mitchell Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up to his office and I sort of kicked back and put my
feet up on his desk and asked him what he was doing this summer,''
Lief recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell liked the idea and agreed that Lief would not be
relegated to a mere assistant on the project.
</P>
<P>
   As their guide, they sought out trials that were historically or
socially significant. In some cases, trial transcripts had
disappeared from archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we wrote it, our intention was not to write it for
lawyers,'' Lief said. ``Our intention was to write it for the
layperson, someone who is interested in history, true crime and
public speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   After they finished the book, Lief and Caldwell tried without
success for two years to entice a publisher or even an agent.
Caldwell then suggested bringing on board Ben Bycel, a
well-connected friend and dean of the University of West Los
Angeles School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, the book was making the rounds at Scribner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no time at all, we went from (Caldwell) and I struggling to
get an agent to suddenly being in the big leagues,'' Lief said.
</P>
<P>
   The book has won favorable reviews around the country and
climbed to the No. 2 spot on the Barnsandnoble.com list of best
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The book's success hasn't made Lief wealthy enough to quit his
job with the Ventura County District Attorney's Office, where he
reviews misdemeanor cases for filing of charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think I'm a pretty good trial attorney,'' said Lief,
who is now working on a murder mystery set in a courthouse. ``While
I don't think any of my closing arguments are going to end up in a
book like this, practice makes perfect.''

   NEW YORK _ Remember Giga Pets? Not long ago, the little
hand-held computers that children fed, watered and nurtured by
pressing buttons were all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to imagine how a toy company could top that
craze, but get ready for Giga Monsters, designed for ages 5 and up.
Here the object is to make the virtual pets die.
</P>
<P>
   The persnickety monsters keep coming back to life as the
diligent child tries to hasten their destruction. They live in tiny
coffins, or ``uniquely stylized cabinets,'' in the words of the
toy's creator, Tiger Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost enough to make one nostalgic for the days when toys
died because they ran out of batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The Giga Monster was but one of many startling items on display
last week at the 96th American International Toy Fair in New York,
where 1,700 exhibitors gathered to peddle their wares to 20,000
buyers. Most of the toys and games haven't hit stores yet. Some are
still prototypes and failed in demonstrations; others succeeded in
demonstrations and will still fail in stores.
</P>
<P>
   In the game of Conscience _ ``The fun way to learn right from
wrong'' _ players travel through seven zones: violence, drugs,
crime, character, charity, education and sex. (Sex is optional, and
parents can remove or add this zone at will.) Winners earn gold
stars. Losers collect black marks and wind up in the principal's
office, detention center, jail or the morgue. Players get on the
wrong path if they ignore their homework, for example, or
``associate with druggies.'' The board game has been designed by
GoRu Products for ages 8 and up, but comes with a simplified
version that 5- to 7-year-olds can enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Checkers, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Children are certainly capable of dealing with morality,
character or crime _ after all, they encounter such issues in fairy
tales and in the schoolyard. And, of course, classic games have
always tackled the big themes: Chess explores war, Monopoly takes
on greed and in many games players meet their metaphorical deaths.
But the latest toys tend to be more literal, making announcements
like, ``Your toy just died.''
</P>
<P>
   The new heavy-handed gadgets, plus Jerry Springer board games
and Rock-'n-Roll Elmo, are part of a $20 billion-a-year industry.
Even Bill Gates has gotten in on it. Anyone who thinks Microsoft or
the Teletubbies are intent on world domination will be alarmed to
hear that they have forged an alliance. Microsoft Teletubbies
ActiMates are dolls that a conspiracy theorist could love.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who believes the purple Teletubby is secretly gay
obviously did not attend this year's toy fair. Secrecy and subtlety
were not at a premium: Toys for 1999 tell about themselves in
painstaking detail, and they won't shut up. They will tell you if
they are dead or alive or sad. The Kissy-Kissy Baby, courtesy of
Irwin Toy Ltd., will pucker if you kiss her mouth, will say ``Kiss
my boo-boo better'' if you kiss her hand and ``I love you, Mommy''
if you kiss her cheek. Her responses are ``moisture-activated.''
</P>
<P>
   Even lipstick gets a word in. Funrise Toy is offering electric
lipstick equipped with a sound module that says things like ``You
go girl!''and ``Looking Good!'' The lipstick presumably provides
the encouragement that young girls may not otherwise be getting.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of the sound chip, toys can broadcast all kinds
of messages out loud. Girls' white shoes, for example, could once
connote innocence, or summer, or membership in the wedding party.
But now tots with marital ambitions can slip on a pair of Funrise's
Sound Shoes without any ambiguity. The shoes play ``Here Comes the
Bride'' as the girl walks.
</P>
<P>
   But in a stride against blonde stereotypes, Mattel's Chatty
Cathy now comes in new hair and eye colors. The doll, who
incessantly says things like ``Please carry me,'' can now be a
brunette, too.
</P>
<P>
   Technology also allows toys to relate to one another. According
to Plato, Aristophanes suggested that human beings were once
two-headed creatures, then were split in half and condemned to
spend the rest of their lives seeking to re-attach to their
original mates. Dubbels, a toy by Rumpus, uses the latest
recognition technology chips to prove Aristophanes right. Somewhere
out there, the perfect mate awaits each L-shaped bean-bag creature.
They just need to be fit together.
</P>
<P>
   If two incompatible bean-bags join, the toy will complain,
``You're cute, but you're not my Dubbel.'' The crestfallen child
will then probably demand that another $5.99 be invested in the
Dubbel's search for romance. The payoff comes when it finds its
bean-bag fantasy mate and announces, ``Baby I've been waiting for
you my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   With recognition technology this advanced, subliminal messages
are unnecessary.

   Forecasters see a lot of unsettling trends in the aging of the
American population, from rising medical costs to falling arches.
But they may have missed one: the geezer-ization of the supermarket
tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than ever, the tabs read like versions of Modern
Maturity edited by Rupert Murdoch hopped up on Fibercon _ what with
their persistent dwelling on Liz Taylor and sundry celebrity
candidates for artificial life support.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even though there are more older people nowadays, the tabs
aren't thriving. Blame the increasingly sensationalized mainstream
media for stealing their act, and readers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Enquirer and the Star, for example, have seen their
circulations tumble in the last five years as the median age of
their readers has risen from just over 35 to around 40. Last week
the two tabs were bought by an investment firm led by Robert
Altman, a former Treasury big shot, which plans to rejuvenate their
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with a gray future in store, we've probably not seen the
last of headlines and quotations like those below, gleaned from
just the past two weeks' offerings at checkout counters.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not so long ago, Air Force pilots sent to Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait to contain Iraq's Saddam Hussein complained that their
mission had become routine: Flying monotonous loops in the ``no
flight'' zone over southern Iraq, waiting for hostilities that
never came.
</P>
<P>
   All that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   In the untidy aftermath of December's four-night battering of
Iraq, U.S. and British pilots enforcing the southern no-flight zone
and the smaller zone in northern Iraq now find themselves dodging
Iraq's newly aggressive air defenses and responding with punishing
strikes of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon does not like to say it, but these skirmishes _
coming, on average, every other day _ have quickly turned into a
low-level war. It is a war of attrition and appears to have no end
in sight, since Clinton administration officials say it will
continue as long as Saddam's forces keep challenging the U.S. and
British patrols over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Persian Gulf War in 1991 _ and, before that,
Vietnam _ have U.S. forces engaged in such routine combat in such a
sustained way over such a prolonged period. Perhaps the closest
parallel today is Israel's continuing war against Islamic factions
in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The recently concluded impeachment trial of President Clinton
and other distractions may have deprived the fighting of much
attention, but U.S. and British jets have now struck some 70
military targets that the Pentagon said posed a threat. Operating
under new rules of engagement, the pilots have broadened their
attacks to include air defenses and other targets, not just those
that directly confront them.
</P>
<P>
   This new war embraces many of the hallmarks of U.S. military
strategy today, including a reliance on technological superiority
to overwhelm the enemy and the avoidance of any risk to American
lives. But it lacks the guiding principle once known as the Powell
Doctrine, after Gen. Colin Powell, the former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, who held that the United States should never
commit U.S. forces to a military campaign until it had a clear idea
of the way out.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration long ago stretched the meaning of the
Powell Doctrine to intervene in places like Bosnia, but now it
seems to have given it up altogether. Last week, with the United
States pledging to send 4,000 U.S. soldiers and marines to the
Serbian province of Kosovo if a peace agreement could be reached,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright did not even pretend to set a
homecoming deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the post-Cold War world,'' said Eliot Cohen, a
professor at Johns Hopkins who directed the Air Force's definitive
study of the Persian Gulf war in 1991. ``This is the kind of
imperial policing that the American military is increasingly going
to be called upon to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The stated purpose of the intensive barrage against Iraq last
December was to punish Saddam for his refusal to cooperate with
United Nations weapons inspection and to knock down his ability to
menace his neighbors. The goal now is to chip away at the fringes
of his military might while stopping short of another all-out
assault, even though the administration now openly calls for
Saddam's removal.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon Officials have defended this new limited strategy.
Defense Secretary William Cohen said in an interview that the
strikes were steadily eating away at Saddam's air defenses. Iraq's
threats last week against Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey for
providing bases or the U.S. and British forces simply underscored
Saddam's frustration, Cohen said. The key, he added, is to keep
pressure on Saddam long enough to let diplomatic efforts to
undercut him play out. How long will that take? He could not say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience is required,'' Cohen said. ``This policy is
working.'' Still, the conflict has raised concerns among some U.S.
military commanders and lawmakers. ``I wish I knew where all of
this played out,'' a senior uniformed official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a former Navy pilot who spent seven
years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, has repeatedly criticized
the administration's approach, saying it puts pilots at risk
without truly punishing Saddam. ``We continue to be in a reactive
mode,'' He said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes this new war of attrition frustrating to
critics. Even though the skirmishes have been overwhelmingly
one-sided, with U.S. and British jets able to strike virtually at
will, the strategy is to hold the line, not to unleash enough force
to defeat Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something much less than more,'' said William Quandt,
professor of government and foreign affairs at the University of
Virginia. ``It's a kind of symbolic show of force on our side to
make a political statement, which is: There are some things Saddam
cannot do without paying a price.'' Quandt called this an
``on-the-cheap strategy.'' But it is not without costs.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Hanlon, an analyst at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, said enforcement of the no-flight zone eight years
after the end of the Persian Gulf war was taking a toll on
resources and morale. He noted that many Air Force pilots are not
re-enlisting, at least in part because of the strain of repeated
tours in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the risk of a nasty surprise. The one thing that
could change everything is the downing of a U.S. pilot. The
prospect of an American or British prisoner of war being paraded
through Baghdad to gain some kind of crude diplomatic leverage
appears to be Saddam's only goal in opening his air defenses to
repeated counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a military sense, the attrition clearly favors the United
States and Britain,'' said Anthony Cordesman, a military analyst at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
``The question is, Will Iraq get lucky? No matter how good the
American military is, mistakes happen.''

   Not so long ago, Air Force pilots sent to Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait to contain Iraq's Saddam Hussein complained that their
mission had become routine: Flying monotonous loops in the ``no
flight'' zone over southern Iraq, waiting for hostilities that
never came.
</P>
<P>
   All that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   In the untidy aftermath of December's four-night battering of
Iraq, U.S. and British pilots enforcing the southern no-flight zone
and the smaller zone in northern Iraq now find themselves dodging
Iraq's newly aggressive air defenses and responding with punishing
strikes of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon does not like to say it, but these skirmishes _
coming, on average, every other day _ have quickly turned into a
low-level war. It is a war of attrition and appears to have no end
in sight, since Clinton administration officials say it will
continue as long as Saddam's forces keep challenging the U.S. and
British patrols over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Persian Gulf War in 1991 _ and, before that,
Vietnam _ have U.S. forces engaged in such routine combat in such a
sustained way over such a prolonged period. Perhaps the closest
parallel today is Israel's continuing war against Islamic factions
in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The recently concluded impeachment trial of President Clinton
and other distractions may have deprived the fighting of much
attention, but U.S. and British jets have now struck some 70
military targets that the Pentagon said posed a threat. Operating
under new rules of engagement, the pilots have broadened their
attacks to include air defenses and other targets, not just those
that directly confront them.
</P>
<P>
   This new war embraces many of the hallmarks of U.S. military
strategy today, including a reliance on technological superiority
to overwhelm the enemy and the avoidance of any risk to American
lives. But it lacks the guiding principle once known as the Powell
Doctrine, after Gen. Colin Powell, the former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, who held that the United States should never
commit U.S. forces to a military campaign until it had a clear idea
of the way out.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration long ago stretched the meaning of the
Powell Doctrine to intervene in places like Bosnia, but now it

IN FILMMAKER'S IDEAL RUSSIA, A PRESIDENTIAL ROLE?
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Nikita Mikhalkov, Russia's most celebrated living film
director, has already won an Oscar for his 1995 movie, ``Burnt by
the Sun.'' He has fame, fortune and, as many women fans would have
it, is the epitome of Russian manhood.
</P>
<P>
   But the talk now in Moscow _ a capital skittish with economic
crisis, winter gloom and an obviously ailing head of state _ is
that Mikhalkov might even run for president.
</P>
<P>
   His latest $40 million film, ``The Barber of Siberia,'' with a
lavish premiere at the Kremlin, appears, in a sense, to be his
extravagant political advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old director says his aim is to conjure up an ideal
of Russia that its people can live by: a world of pageantry in
which honor endures, love is pure and a noble czar rules with a
firm but benevolent hand. But these days, politics is also not far
from his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plato said that power should be a burden and not an
aspiration,'' he said in an interview. ``I will support anyone who
says it is a burden for him, and if I support him he ought to win.
People do listen to me. But if there is no such candidate, I will
have to sit down and think heavily.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Mikhalkov's candidacy may seem like an improbable
movie plot or publicity stunt. But it reflects the disillusionment
Russians have with their political choices: an infirm President
Boris Yeltsin and a slew of pretenders widely seen as power-hungry
opportunists.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhalkov, in contrast, has cast himself as Russia's political
savior. Even if he does not run, he says that he knows what Russia
needs: the restoration of the real or idealized virtues of czarist
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture shows not how Russia was but how it should be,''
he said, referring to his film.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhalkov's Moscow office is adorned with a large chart tracing
his ancestry back to Russia's pre-revolutionary aristocracy. With
his trademark mustache, he certainly looks the part. And his family
has long been one of the most eminent artistic families in Russia _
as well as one of the most discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhalkov's father, Sergei, an author of children's books, wrote
the words to the Soviet national anthem and was the leader of the
Soviet Writers' Union. His older brother, Andrei Konchalovsky, also
a film director, immigrated to the United States and went to work
in Hollywood, carefully dropping the Mikhalkov part of his
double-barreled surname, and keeping the name of his mother,
Natalya, a poet and descendant of one of czarist Russia's most
revered and respected painters.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Mikhalkov, who first became famous as an actor,
chose to work within the Soviet system. He was neither a Communist
Party member nor a dissident. As the Soviet Union collapsed, and
since, he has often been seen in the company of top politicians and
figures of artistic resistance. ``Burnt by the Sun,'' his
Oscar-winner, was anti-Stalinist.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1995 parliamentary elections, he made a polished
``feel good'' television ad in which Russian astronauts talked
lovingly about their homeland as they gazed at the earth from
space, and appeared in the spot as one of the astronauts. The
commercial showed his prowess as a political image-maker, no small
concern for future presidential candidates who would like his
support.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Mikhalkov is known as a moderate nationalist. He
supported Yeltsin's re-election but also has advocated the
establishment of a constitutional monarchy. He describes his
politics as ``enlightened conservatism.'' It comes across as more
of a sermon than a program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stopped respecting ourselves, our history and our
culture,'' he said. ``We live on top of fantastic wealth and beg
all the time,'' he continued, alluding to Russia's oil, gas and
mineral riches. ``What is shown on television that Russians have
made with their own hands? We should not have to stretch out our
left hand for Snickers.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his politics, his long-awaited, three-hour saga
is a kind of nationalist ``Doctor Zhivago,'' a ``Titanic'' for a
Russia enveloped in self-doubt. It is an epic love story,
skillfully blending his artistic, commercial and political
interests.
</P>
<P>
   An adventurous American woman, played by British actress Julia
Ormond, falls in love with a dashing Russian cadet named Andrei
Tolstoy, who is played by one of Russia's leading actors, Oleg
Menshikov. The Hollywood-style love story has a bitter-sweet
Russian ending, in which the protagonists accept their tragic fate
with dignity and self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, there is a dig at rapacious foreigners. American
actor Richard Harris plays the eccentric American inventor whose
consuming passion is to turn Russia's glorious Siberian forests
into a pile of timber.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, filmed abroad and on site in the Kremlin, near the
Novodevichy Monastery in Moscow and in Siberia, is Russia's leap
into the world of multimillion-dollar blockblusters, with luxuriant
sets and Dolby soundtracks. The Kremlin even agreed to turn off the
illuminated red stars on its towers _ the first time that has been
done for a film.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mikhalkov's instinct for Western marketing is, apparently, as
unerring as his father's was for hitting the leaders' and the
people's tastes in Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   His movie comes complete with commercial ``tie-ins'' like
Mikhalkov's ``Junkersky'' cologne, which takes its name from the
young noblemen who trained as cadets, and comes in a snazzy box
depicting czarist military trappings.
</P>
<P>
   About $10 million of the film's budget was provided by the
Russian government. Mikhalkov says the government money comes from
a special budgetary fund and, thus, has not diverted funds from
unpaid state workers.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts find it odd that Mikhalkov's film celebrates the
reign of Alexander III, the 19th-century czar whose rule was one of
the least eventful in Russia's turbulent history.
</P>
<P>
   But that appears to be precisely the point. Alexander III
represents the stability that Russians hunger for, as well as the
old values of dignity, self-sufficiency and generosity that have
been lost, Mikhalkov explained.
</P>
<P>
   A Slavophile, Mikhalkov says he believes that Peter the Great,
who opened up Russia to the West, pushed the country forward but
drove a wedge between the elite and the people.
</P>
<P>
   For all its Russian nationalism _ the film is formally dedicated
to the Russian officer corps _ it is also aimed at an American
audience, where the big money is. Seventy percent of the dialogue
in the film is in English _ a gambit, Mikhalkov's aides say, to
enable the movie to qualify for an Oscar nomination outside the
category of foreign films.
</P>
<P>
   Whether all this will advance Mikhalkov's cause in the shifting
sands of Russian politics is unclear. But, as every fresh week
brings a new twist in the alleged power struggle between Yeltsin
and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, and to throw up new contenders
for the post-czarist presidential throne, some of Russia's movers
and shakers are already speculating about the movie director's
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovsky, the tycoon who has been locked in a
debilitating confrontation with Primakov, has talked about
supporting Mikhalkov's bid. Vladimir Gusinsky, the media mogul,
said in an interview that Mikhalkov would make a better president
than many of the other potential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhalkov says it is too soon to discuss his political plans in
detail. But one scene stands out in the mind of the politics
analysts here: his cameo role as Czar Alexander III. Wearing a
resplendent uniform, he gallops into the Kremlin on a gleaming
white stallion to loud hurrahs.

KNICKS-BULLS: ALAS, A GAME THAT LACKS SOUL  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 &HT;     c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Forgive Patrick Ewing if he looks lost Sunday. He's
like the tall, awkward kid who missed graduating with his own class
by a year. Or the poor soul who shows up at the party after the
chips, salsa and guests are gone.
</P>
<P>
   When the 36-year-old center surveys the landscape at Madison
Square Garden, he will wonder whatever happened to that fierce
rivalry between his brooding Knicks and Michael Jordan's
incomparable Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's not there, Scottie's not there and Rodman's not
there,'' Ewing said of Chicago's championship triumvirate. ``And
for us, John isn't and Oak isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Eastern Conference showdown, huh?
</P>
<P>
   No Jordan, no Scottie Pippen, no Dennis Rodman, no John Starks
and no Charles Oakley. Other than the bit-part player Herb Williams
and Chicago's Ron Harper and Toni Kukoc _ both late arrivals in the
saga _ Ewing is the last man standing amid the ashes of Chicago's
dynastic saga in which they continually turned the Knicks into
silver medalists.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry essentially died the day Jordan announced his
retirement last month, a development that created a domino effect
in Chicago and depression in New York. Ewing, who always said he
wanted to go through Jordan to win an elusive championship ring,
now has to settle for dethroning the Bulls reserve guard Rusty
LaRue.
</P>
<P>
   As proof the game is not near the spectacle it once was, NBC
will televise the matchup only regionally, the first time it has
done so with a weekend Knicks-Bulls game since the early 1990's.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks beat the Bulls in Chicago last week, hanging on
despite a late run from Chicago. They really have nothing in common
other than that game. Rebuilding instead of reloading for a change,
Chicago is off to a 1-8 start with a cast featuring Brent Barry and
Bill Wennington.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks improved to 5-3 with a victory over Philadelphia on
Friday night, although a slow, inconsistent start and a heel injury
to Latrell Sprewell raises serious questions as to whether they'll
be in sync once the regular season moves into its second month.
</P>
<P>
   But one constant has stood out, just as he did in perhaps the
league's most intriguing rivalry over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has led the Knicks in rebounding in six of their first
eight games. He's averaging 16.3 points per game, 9.3 rebounds per
game, 2 assists and 2.3 blocks per game.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the ball with his teammates, he has taken five fewer
shots than Allan Houston this season. New York's 78-67 victory over
the 76ers on Thursday night marked Ewing's fourth game in five
nights. Though he seemed bolted to the floor at times, he managed
to block two shots and hit one of the game's most important shots _
a wild, spinning, left-handed layup that ignited a 10-0 run in the
fourth quarter and put away the game for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   In only his 12th game back since fracturing his shooting wrist
in December 1997, Ewing played 37 minutes, his average. He may
still go through ineffective stretches, but his durability after 13
seasons is impressive. And his role in the rivalry, as that
stone-faced antagonist trying to wrest the championship from
Jordan, has not been lost on Ewing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came in, people didn't think I could do a lot of
things,'' Ewing said. ``But I'm still here. I'm still surviving. He
added, ``We may have won some battles, but they always won the war.
Except for one year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks overcame the Bulls without Jordan in 1994 en route to
their first finals appearance in more than 20 years. But mostly,
Bulls-Knicks has been extremely one-sided. Jordan's Bulls were 5-0
against the Knicks in playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much redemption in dunking on Tim Floyd's new team
rather than Phil Jackson's old one. The halcyon days of the rivalry
are indeed gone. It is merely another game Sunday, a game between
two franchises that used to mean so much more.

EDITORIAL: GLOBAL MARKETS' LETHAL MAGIC  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 21:
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, Americans feared the military ambitions of
Russia and China in the great battlegrounds of Asia and Latin
America. Today the territory is familiar but the danger is
different, as the United States awaits the aftershocks of a global
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As The Times reported in a series of articles last week, no one
forecast the start of the new contagion in Asia two years ago. Nor
did many foresee how it would spread quickly to Russia and Latin
America. Rich nations and investors were blind to the weaknesses of
the worldwide boom, and their initial ``solutions'' when the
collapse started often made things worse. Now there is no clear
path out of the morass.
</P>
<P>
   The Times series dispelled any temptation to be complacent about
the American economy's supposed imperviousness to distant trends.
In an era of interconnectedness, American farmers, steelworkers and
ordinary citizens dependent on investments and pension funds were
shown already to have been hurt. The horrendous human cost overseas
could also be seen in the vanished hopes of rickshaw drivers,
entrepreneurs and fledgling investors whose families had been
reduced almost overnight to poverty and hunger.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the world, the magic of the marketplace extolled by
the West in the afterglow of victory in the Cold War has been
supplanted by the cruelty of markets, wariness toward capitalism
and new dangers of instability.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for staving off an even worse disaster goes
to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence
Summers, who along with Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve have
energetically worked with finance ministers and central bankers in
other countries to minimize panic. But as many in the
administration now acknowledge, they and other officials got caught
up in the euphoria of the early 1990's and pushed developing
countries to open their markets to foreign capital when, in
retrospect, they were not ready for it.
</P>
<P>
   An important lesson is that the mantra of privatization,
investment and deregulation of markets overseas should have been
accompanied by greater caution and attention to openness, sound
financial infrastructures and efforts to root out corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Because the experts failed to anticipate the crisis, many of
their actions proved counterproductive. The International Monetary
Fund, focused on maintaining fixed exchange rates, forced countries
to accept austerity steps that only precipitated bankruptcies and
killed growth. At the World Bank, officials fear that the monetary
fund's economic prescriptions can hurt recovery, not hasten it.
</P>
<P>
   The second lesson, then, is that there needs to be greater
understanding of the broad social and political implications of
economic theory, more diplomatic sensitivity and certainly more
coordination among the ``doctors'' trying to revive the patient.
</P>
<P>
   The final lesson will be the hardest to figure out. The United
States must participate in developing new structures to monitor the
new forces at work in the global economy. Institutions like the IMF
and World Bank may have made mistakes, but they need to be
strengthened, not abandoned, as the best available way to insure
that there is enough warning as the next crisis hits.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts suggest a kind of global Federal Reserve system to
regulate the global economies, while others insist on the absolute
sovereignty of the marketplace. Whatever happens, some form of
greater financial coordination is in order, with more attention to
the underpinnings of healthy markets, including a modern banking
system and bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
   From the early 19th century and the start of the industrial era,
the United States suffered a terrible cycle of boom-and-bust. There
were times of great euphoria when the United States attracted
foreign capital, only to crash, leaving investors empty-handed. The
Great Depression and World War II helped set in place the modern
system of regulation, disclosure and government safety nets.
</P>
<P>
   The world is far from reaching that point, but it is not too
soon to think in terms of heading in that direction, and certainly
being clear-eyed about the risks as well as the magic of the
marketplace. &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE PREDICTABLE NEW PRIME OF LIFE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 21:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big news from the social sciences last week was that
Americans are really enjoying middle age. After a 10-year study,
the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Successful Midlife
Development reported that the midlife crisis is mostly myth, that
women were happy about undergoing menopause and that most
middle-aged people are extremely content with their children,
marriages and overall lives.
</P>
<P>
   This will come as no surprise to the oldest and youngest
generations of Americans, who have watched the self-absorbed baby
boomers insist on getting the best of everything since the 1960s.
The same people who had the Beatles for their rock band and John
Kennedy for their philandering president began turning 50 just when
medical science invented Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   The news that most of the middle-aged women surveyed experienced
``only relief'' when they went through menopause suggests a
phenomenon that has followed the boomers throughout their lives:
lengthy and well-publicized concerns about the next stage, followed
by euphoric relief when everything turns out to be fine after all.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge in talking about middle-aged Americans
these days is figuring out where midlife is. The old, orderly
progression _ in which school is followed by adulthood at around
21, in which middle age arrives as the children graduate to junior
high, and when senior citizenship kicks in somewhere around 60 _
has all been scrambled.
</P>
<P>
   Women who assumed their biological clocks went off at 35 or 40
are now shepherding around toddlers at 50. People are now warned
that they should expect to have not one but three or four different
careers in their lives, and it is difficult figuring out how to
work them all in before 80, let alone 65.
</P>
<P>
   The people who came of age in the 1960s and 70s also had the
foresight to spend their early years wearing clothes and hair that
were destined to look silly after the fact, guaranteeing few would
spend their silver years yearning to recapture their lost,
Woodstockian prime.
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur researchers said that the oldest respondents in
their surveys showed less optimism and satisfaction than the
others, and warned that what is ahead may be less rewarding than
what has come so far. That may be because old age has not yet
visited itself upon the boomers. Forty years from now we may be
hearing that Americans are feeling particularly content at 85.

EDITORIAL   OBSERVER: A NEW GENERATION LOOKS AT GERMANY'S PAST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 21:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Schroeder, born in 1944, is the first modern German
chancellor with no experience of World War II. More important,
Schroeder came of age as a leftist in the 1960s. He and many of his
closest advisers entered politics to rebel against their parents'
customs and expose Nazis still in government. The contrast between
his history and that of his predecessor, the conservative Helmut
Kohl, is visible even in the four months that Schroeder has been
Chancellor. He has brought a different attitude toward dealing with
Germany's Nazi past _ and, more crucial, a welcome new approach to
the treatment of minorities, an issue where the past still echoes
today.
</P>
<P>
   After Hitler's defeat, West Germany underwent a far-reaching
process of de-Nazification. But the purges and payment of
reparations were imposed by the Allies and did not mark new German
attitudes. The Third Reich's crimes were invisible in German
schools. The 1950s did see the beginnings of some trials. But it
was the trial of Auschwitz guards in 1964 that sparked a German
rebellion against the past.
</P>
<P>
   Germans went from ignoring the Holocaust to talking about little
else. Schroeder's generation wrote a new curriculum for the
schools, exposed Nazis still in power and instituted a culture of
questioning that had never been present in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   No nation has done more than Germany to deal with its past. No
country has announced its guilt more loudly, paid more in
reparation (more than $60 billion) or put more of its own citizens
on trial for war crimes _ many of them committed against
foreigners. This is appropriate, as German guilt is unique.
</P>
<P>
   But Kohl made mistakes, such as his insistence in 1985 that
President Reagan visit Bitburg, where members of the Waffen SS are
buried. After that, his government often gave the impression of
reluctantly following rules set by outsiders _ mostly, German
officials grumbled privately, by American Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The Kohl government's plan for building a memorial to murdered
Jews in Berlin is one example. The working design for the project,
begun 10 years ago, was a forest of 2,800 giant stone pillars _
politically correct, many said, but numbing and bombastic in a city
already overwhelmed with Fascist architecture and giant Soviet war
memorials. Michael Naumann, Schroeder's culture minister and fellow
young leftist, worried the memorial would have no educational
effect. He has improved the idea by proposing the addition of a
Holocaust archive and research library.
</P>
<P>
   The additions would have the added benefit of marking the deaths
of others killed in the Holocaust, like Gypsies and homosexuals.
The decision is now in the hands of the Bundestag. Schroeder's
original instinct would have been better still. That was to use the
money to fix decaying concentration camps and improve their museums
_ the most powerful monuments imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has also moved more forcefully to settle an
outstanding debt. Last week the government brokered an agreement by
Germany's 12 largest banks and businesses to pay into a fund
expected to be worth at least $2 billion to compensate those used
as slave labor by private business during the war. Although
Schroeder inappropriately suggested outside pressure for such
compensation came from a campaign against his country, the fund is
an achievement. Unlike the Swiss government, which has refused to
join any settlement, the German government initiated its reparation
fund.
</P>
<P>
   The vigorous German debate over the past is probably more
valuable for memorializing the Holocaust than any field of stones.
But the more relevant test of whether Germany is a ``normal''
nation is how it deals with present questions of race.
</P>
<P>
   Jews are coming back, especially to Berlin, and there are more
than 70,000 Jews now in Germany. Other minorities feel less
welcome. Especially in the eastern states, where unemployment is
18.9 percent, violence against immigrants is alarming.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing Germany can do to change public
attitudes is to pass Schroeder's proposals to change its
citizenship laws, which hold that Germanness is in the blood. Even
foreigners whose families have been in Germany for generations have
little chance to become citizens. Kohl's Christian Democrats and
other conservative parties have run an ugly petition drive against
the change.
</P>
<P>
   Germans are once again debating how much guilt people today must
bear for the past. Except for a handful of old men, the answer is
none. But all Germans have a special responsibility for the future,
to maintain democracy and deepen tolerance. This is how Germany
must now be judged.

HARRINGTON LEARNS PATIENCE ON THE PACERS BENCH AND SO DOES HIS
FAMILY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Ind.)   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Indiana Pacers play, the scene is always the same in
Roselle, N.J. Nearly a dozen people gather in the Lawton family
living room and wait for Al Harrington to appear on the television
screen.
</P>
<P>
   While the gatherings are fun for the basketball-loving family,
these evenings typically end in disappointment for the Lawtons,
because Harrington, the latest high school prodigy to jump directly
to the National Basketball Association, has not played in the last
six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been rough because you anticipate him being out there on
the court and then he doesn't get a chance to play,'' said Aaron
Lawton, Harrington's father. ``The only game he really got a chance
to play in was the exhibition against Chicago, and we were off our
feet then. Then, he kind of went through a little drought where
they haven't played him as much as we would've liked. But we spoke
to him and we understand that it's all a part of Larry Bird's
formula to bring him along slowly. We can accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   To say that Harrington's introduction to the NBA has been
discomfiting would be an understatement. Since electing to enter
the 1998 draft out of St. Patrick's High School in Elizabeth, N.J.,
the 6-foot-9-inch forward has endured a surprisingly low selection
(25th), a dubious seven-month lockout and the indignity of playing
only four minutes in the first eight games.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the top high school players in the country last year,
Harrington expected to step in and contribute 20 to 30 minutes a
game for the Eastern Conference favorites, who will play the Nets
Sunday at 6 p.m. in Market Square Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he played only three minutes in the season opener,
grabbing two rebounds and missing two free throws, and one minute
the next game, notching a rebound and missing his only shot of the
season. He has yet to score his first NBA point.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he denied having any regrets about his decision to forgo
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't gotten to that point yet,'' Harrington said Friday
in a telephone call from Indianapolis. ``But I'm a competitor so
I'm a little frustrated by not getting time. It's tough. It's real
tough. It kills me sitting and watching because I always want to
play. I definitely thought I was going to play more than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana Coach Larry Bird, the Hall of Fame player and reigning
coach of the year, could not be reached for comment, but he has
told Indiana reporters not to view Harrington's lack of playing
time negatively. The Pacers simply are overcrowded at small
forward, Bird has said, noting that the veterans Chris Mullin,
Jalen Rose, Sam Perkins and Austin Croshere are getting the minutes
that would be Harrington's.
</P>
<P>
   The coach reportedly is happy with Harrington, who at times has
been tremendous in practice, and views him as a key player for the
future. But presently, the Pacers are playing the exact lineup that
took them to within one game of the NBA finals last season, with
the addition of Perkins, a 37-year-old free agent.
</P>
<P>
   That is the message that the Indiana assistant coach Rick
Carlisle shared with Harrington's mother, Mona Lawton, in a
telephone call last week that was sparked by her anxiety over her
son's lack of playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how mothers are,'' said Harrington, who has lived
with his Pacers teammate Antonio Davis since September. ``They
always think it's somebody else's fault. But she finally realized
that I just have to be patient and wait my turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said he enjoys playing for Bird and has no resentment
towards his coach for not playing him more. ``Our relationship is
cool,'' he said. ``I'm learning a lot from him. A lot of times we
joke about how he used to dominate, how he used to kill people on
the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lawtons will attend their first Pacers game in person next
weekend in their first trip to Indianapolis. Aaron and Mona are the
only family members going. Harrington's siblings, Harvey, Tiffany
and A.J., plus the relatives from Long Island who travel to Roselle
for the Pacers games, will stay behind and watch on the DirectTV
program that Harrington bought for his family right before the
season started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al wanted to give that to us for a little present,'' Aaron
Lawton said. ``So we could keep up with his games.''
</P>
<P>
   Like their son, they will have to be patient. &QL;

PLEADERS IN RESIDENCY CASE WAIT AT HONG KONG'S DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Penny Lin has been trying to move to this enclave
for as long as she can remember.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Fujian province in China, Ms. Lin said goodbye to
her parents when they migrated to Hong Kong nearly two decades ago.
Immigration laws prohibited the parents from bringing all four of
their children, so the 9-year-old Ms. Lin and her younger sister
stayed behind with a friend of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Lin is 28 and runs a small trading company in
Shenzhen, just across the border in the mainland. But she has never
abandoned her dream of rejoining her parents. In the wake of a
landmark immigration ruling here, Ms. Lin believes she may never
have a better chance than now.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Hong Kong court ruled that children born in China
of Hong Kong parents have the right to live in the territory. The
decision opens the door to tens of thousands, if not hundreds of
thousands, of mainlanders. But officials in Beijing have said the
ruling violates China's constitution and must be ``rectified.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last two weeks, Ms. Lin and 300 other mainland Chinese
have camped on a concrete plaza in front of the government offices
here. They are so determined to stay in Hong Kong that they have
defied orders to leave _ even avoiding trips to the toilet for fear
of being nabbed by immigration officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nobody left in China,'' said Ms. Lin, her steady voice
suddenly quavering. ``Even in Shenzhen, I might as well live in a
hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Ragtag but resolute, these protesters are pawns in a potentially
momentous legal dispute between Hong Kong and China. What is at
issue is whether Hong Kong's courts have the right to make their
own laws _ even if that means striking down mainland Chinese laws
that conflict with Hong Kong's statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lin did not wait for the legal issues to be thrashed out.
She and hundreds of mainland residents poured into Hong Kong on
temporary visas to assert their claim to residency. When the Hong
Kong authorities told them to return to mainland China to file
formal applications, they refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really tough for us,'' Ms. Lin said. ``The Chinese
government has said that if we go back to China, we might be
punished.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Hong Kong has treated the protesters with uncommon
forbearance. It has let them build a squatters' camp inside the
gates of the government offices, just steps from where the chief
executive, Tung Chee-hwa, alights from his limousine. That, more
than any legal decision, may explain why these people are so ready
to forsake mainland China for this former British colony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong is much better than China because of the lifestyle
and because you are allowed freedom of expression,'' said a
40-year-old woman from nearby Guangdong province whose husband
lives in Hong Kong. The woman, who identified herself as Mrs. Siu,
is trying to gain residency for their 16-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   When Chinese authorities declined the girl's application, Mrs.
Siu paid to have her smuggled across the border by a ``snakehead,''
the name given to shadowy gang members who traffic in illegal
migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong seems likely to allow the demonstrators to stay in the
territory _ at least until a local court rules on their residency
claims. Last week a court blocked the deportation of 18 mainland
Chinese who entered Hong Kong illegally but contend that they have
the right to live here.
</P>
<P>
   The larger question _ whether the Court of Final Appeal ruling
will be reversed by Beijing _ may not be answered until next month,
when the National People's Congress of China holds its annual
meeting. Some legal experts predict that China will allow the
decision on residency to stand, while watering down the Hong Kong
court's sweeping assertion of judicial independence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, tolerance of the migrants does not equal acceptance. The
prospect of hordes of people streaming into the territory has
stirred deeply ambivalent feelings among native Hong Kongers.
Although many people here are refugees from China, they fear that a
new influx will strain Hong Kong's resources and swell the ranks of
the unemployed during an already grinding recession.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Cheng, a popular talk-radio host, said that the day after
the court ruling was announced, 90 percent of his callers opposed
it. When Beijing demanded that the ruling be altered, Cheng said,
many listeners rallied behind the court. But on the issue of
whether to welcome or spurn the migrants, Hong Kong people can seem
more colonial than their former British rulers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have all these stereotypes about how mainlanders will
reduce the quality of life in Hong Kong,'' Cheng said. ``They don't
line up for buses, they throw garbage all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Such stereotypes sting the people squatting in front of the
chief executive's office. They are acutely aware of the
well-dressed civil servants who scurry past their motley encampment
on the way to work. But they also note that Hong Kong was built by
refugees from Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unfair, because people who have had no education
don't know how to live differently,'' said Mrs. Siu, brushing away
angry tears as she recounted her family's struggle to set down
roots in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Siu's husband migrated to Hong Kong in the 1970s with no
education. He held menial jobs and returned to China in 1981 to
find a wife. When Mrs. Siu and her husband had a daughter,
immigration laws barred them from bringing her to Hong Kong. Mrs.
Siu stayed with the girl in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong
province, while her husband returned to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Siu wants her daughter to be educated here so that she can
live like any other descendant of Chinese people in China's newest
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether a man's wife is from Hong Kong or China,'' she
declared, in words that could have been torn from the court ruling,
``his descendants are people of Hong Kong, and they can't be
discriminated against.''

ISRAELIS SEE POLITICAL MELTDOWN, LIVE ON PRIME TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Broadcast live on Israeli television, the finale of
the Labor Party primary last week was supposed to be a rousing
affair. As it began, balloons bobbed, the theme from ``Rocky''
played and Laborites congratulated one another for assembling what
they believed to be a diverse, experienced and winning ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But then Adissu Massala, the only member of Parliament
representing Israel's Ethiopian immigrants, climbed on stage and
commandeered the podium. Filled with rage, Massala faced the
cameras and accused Ehud Barak, the Labor Party leader and its
candidate for prime minister, of racism. Barak, a former general,
stood beside him, his face frozen in an embarrassed half-smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forgive the Labor Party,'' Massala said, after
learning that he had lost the ``new immigrant'' slot on the party
ticket to a Russian. It was only after he finished his bitter
harangue that Massala was ushered off the stage so that Barak could
deliver an anticlimactic celebratory speech.
</P>
<P>
   The moment ruined the festivities and humiliated the party.
Having overcome disarray in its ranks, Labor was finally ready to
propel itself into the campaign for the May elections. Instead, it
presented to the Israeli public on Tuesday night a spontaneous
meltdown within the minority ranks of a party desperate to break
free of its image as a bastion of the elite.
</P>
<P>
   Labor has had a difficult time grabbing the spotlight in this
race. The conservative Likud Party holds a publicity edge because
its candidate, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is the incumbent.
And the new Center Party, because it is a novelty, is stealing the
show.
</P>
<P>
   But when Labor finally had its moment, it bombed, and the
reviews were devastating. Nachum Barnea, of the newspaper Yediot
Ahronoth, called it ``a performance of collective suicide _ live on
prime time.'' Chemi Shalev, of Maariv, described the party as ``an
errant whale that insisted on beaching itself in order to die, in
front of the entire nation, on prime-time television.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really ruined our day,'' acknowledged Alon Pinkas, Barak's
foreign-policy adviser. ``People _ our own supporters _ were
saying, `Why do they have these idiotic suicidal tendencies?' If it
happened to Likud, your average Likudnik would be much more
receptive to the idea that Massala was just a disgruntled man who
lost his job and went berserk.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did not happen to Likud and so Likud was quick to
capitalize on the fiasco. Netanyahu introduced new posters and a
new mode of attack: ``Barak is too weak to unite the people,'' his
new slogan said. ``He cannot even unite his own party.''
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, the damage had been kept somewhat in check.
Although Barak slipped a bit in the polls, one showed him ahead of
Netanyahu, if only by 3 percentage points. Still, Israeli
journalists could not keep themselves from speculating about a
highly unlikely outcome: that the Labor Party might consider
dropping Barak and inviting the more popular Yitzhak Mordechai, the
Center Party candidate, to represent them.
</P>
<P>
   Labor strategists find such speculation galling. Barak, 57, a
Stanford University-trained engineer who speaks in elaborate,
metaphor-ridden language, does not possess his opponents' charisma.
James Carville, one of his U.S. consultants, talks about wanting to
knock 100 points off his IQ before each campaign appearance.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Labor strategists see it, charisma is overrated.
Netanyahu, they say, is a great candidate, but a poor prime
minister. Anyway, they say, what tarnished Barak's golden week was
bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Massala, 37, a social worker from the development town of Bat
Yam, had proved a disappointment to the Labor Party as a
legislator, and had failed to woo many of his fellow Ethiopians
away from the Likud Party. In cold, hard terms, he was not as
valuable to the party as Sofa Landver, the Russian woman who ended
up in his slot because she garnered more votes.
</P>
<P>
   There are 60,000 Ethiopians in Israel and 1 million immigrants
from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, Israeli radio announced that Massala was likely
to win the new immigrant slot. But in the interest of building
toward a dramatic prime-time show, the Labor Party stopped
releasing the returns. And it was not until the show began that
Massala really understood that he had lost. He and his supporters
were furious and began pushing toward the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, sensing a possible disaster, waved Massala to the podium
and allowed him to speak. And as he spoke, an Israeli-Arab woman
candidate, who also lost, joined him on stage, echoing his anger.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lose-lose situation for Barak with no way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically, Ehud knew the minute he allowed him to take the
microphone that he was in for a media disaster,'' Pinkas said.
``But he also knew that to not let him speak would probably cause
even greater damage.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If the episode had not occurred, Labor would have celebrated,
among other things, what it considers a high voter turnout of 60
percent, or about 100,000 party members. This is important to party
leaders because it signals that they will be able to bring out
their forces in a tight race.
</P>
<P>
   But the party also selected a ticket that it considered balanced
and experienced, with hawks and doves, two Sephardic immigrants and
one woman among the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Ben Ami, a Moroccan-born intellectual, drew the most
votes. From the lowest-ranking member of the Labor delegation, he
rocketed into the No. 3 spot, after Barak and Shimon Peres, the
former prime minister whose second slot was reserved.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Beilin, another academic and a peace negotiator who has
maintained strong working relationships with the Palestinians, took
the fourth slot. Matan Vilnai, a former general who turned down
Netanyahu's offer of the post of defense minister to join Labor,
took fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Intent on portraying all his opponents as leftists, Netanyahu
was quick to pick up and reproduce, in advertisements, Beilin's
words as he embraced the ticket: ``My heart beats on the left. The
results of the primaries shows that the heart of Labor beats on the
left as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But a lead editorial in Haaretz urged those Labor leaders who
cringed to stand tall and proud. ``The Labor Party has no reason to
apologize for being leftist,'' it said. ``There is no basis for
Netanyahu's nightmarish propaganda, which seeks to depict those who
want to bring him down as somehow endangering the national
interests.''

   A grisly shadow from the earliest days of the Vietnam War crept
across the media landscape last week during the outbreak of rioting
among Kurds infuriated by Turkey's capture of the top Kurdish rebel
leader. Protesters in Germany, England and Denmark set themselves
on fire. In Paris, London and Marseilles, Kurdish protesters
occupied embassies and threatened to immolate themselves before
finally surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, I'm thinking 1963, those pictures of Buddhist monks
burning themselves to death in Vietnam on the front pages,'' said
Professor Anthony Joes, director of the International Relations
Department at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Those haunting images appeared in June 1963 and continued for
months: Surrounded by prayerful supporters, monks engulfed
themselves in flames to protest the South Vietnamese regime of Ngo
Dinh Diem, the U.S.-backed leader whose powerful sister-in-law,
Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu, ridiculed the self-immolations as ``a
barbecue'' and taunted, ``Let them burn!''
</P>
<P>
   That November, Diem was killed in a coup supported by the United
States. Though other horrifying pictures would soon dominate the
news, the burning monks remain among the indelible images of the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few forms of political statement more impressive
than deliberately setting yourself on fire,'' said William Harman,
a professor of religious studies at DePauw University in
Greencastle, Ind., who has written extensively on historical
religious attitudes toward martyrdom and public suicide. He sees
such acts as a technique for manipulating a community into
commitment to causes that transcend material concerns like
self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of those 1963 Vietnam images, self-immolation is
commonly associated with Buddhism. But Harman said the practice
springs from no single cultural tradition and shares ancient
philosophical origins with religious sacrifices and martyrdom,
including the crucifixion of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Joes noted that the Kurdish militants were mostly Muslims, whose
religion forbids suicide for personal reasons but condones ``heroic
martyrdom'' _ including acts like terrorist suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Harman said self-immolation is increasing in parts of India and
Burma. In Vietnam, at least five Buddhists have burned themselves
to death in the past two years protesting religious persecution. In
Bangalore, India, the site of the Miss World pageant in 1996,
police rounded up scores of feminists who were planning to stage a
mass self-immolation before TV cameras broadcasting the event
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   And in India last April, the Dalai Lama issued a statement that
followers interpreted as suggesting support for hunger strikes and
self-immolation after he visited a hospitalized Tibetan exile who
had set himself on fire to protest the Chinese occupation of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Joes said last week's rioting, including the self-immolations,
underscored both the desperation and the determination of militants
in the Kurdish Diaspora, who were apparently organized enough to
coordinate well-timed street protests all over the world. In
Vietnam in 1963, Western reporters and photographers were always
given advance notice when Buddhist protesters set themselves on
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Immolation as protest is ``a kind of theater _ a religious act
tied into a political act,'' Joes said. ``In 1963, Americans looked
at those pictures and said, `Man, what would it take for me to set
myself on fire? I'd have to be flat-out crazy.' But we sensed those
Buddhist monks weren't crazy. It really had an enormous public
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-immolation is ``obviously a very painful way to die,''
Harman said, ``although some say that you actually suffocate first,
because the fire consumes the oxygen. When someone does it,
essentially they are saying, `I gave my life.' The act itself makes
it very clear what the lines are between the committed and the
uncommitted.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Turkish television stations devoted much of
their programming last week to endless repetitions of a
three-minute video of a scene many Turks believed they would never
see: The Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan, reviled here as
``the vampire'' and ``the baby-killer,'' in the custody of jubilant
Turkish commandos, handcuffed and sweaty.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue was even more astonishing than the pictures. This
towering figure, focus of one of the world's last Stalinist
personality cults, hero to thousands of Kurdish militants and demon
to millions of Turks, a man who has cost the Turkish state huge
amounts of blood and treasure and who reportedly could order
tortures and executions between dinner courses without the
slightest disturbance to his digestion, blubbered like a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really love Turkey and the Turkish people,'' the erstwhile
rebel told his captors. ``My mother was Turkish.'' Later he said,
``Sincerely, I will do all I can to be of service.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan seemed groggy when he spoke, possibly under the influence
of drugs. The video had obviously been heavily cut. Nonetheless,
there was no echo of the defiant revolutionary who had vowed for
years to lead his people to liberation or death.
</P>
<P>
   For Ocalan's friends and enemies alike, these scenes could not
help but raise the question of what will happen to the Kurdish
nationalist movement now that its most visible leader has been
captured and apparently tamed.
</P>
<P>
   Much will depend on whether Turkey's leaders feel able to move
away from their unyielding stand that there is no such thing as a
Kurdish minority and that allowing moderate Kurdish groups to
emerge is intolerable because they only stoke the fires of
separatism.
</P>
<P>
   Several times in recent years, Turkish politicians have sought
to challenge this orthodoxy. The first was President Turgut Ozal,
who claimed Kurdish ancestry himself and said he was committed to
making cultural concessions to Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   The established elite was horrified, believing that Ozal was
opening a Pandora's box of troubles, and his policies were quickly
dumped after his death in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, returning from a meeting
with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, told reporters that
Turkey might give Kurds autonomy along the lines of the ``Basque
model.'' She was so sharply reprimanded by military commanders that
she not only retracted her suggestion, but denied ever making it.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Turkish business leaders have urged a new
approach. In 1997, the principal business association here issued a
report proposing that Kurds be allowed to give their children and
their villages Kurdish names, to use and teach Kurdish languages as
they pleased, and to be allowed to form their own political parties
and associations. Military and political leaders angrily rejected
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's capture in Kenya this week reopens this debate. The
operation was a tremendous victory for Turkey. Now Turkish leaders
may ask themselves how to make that victory complete, how to wean
Kurds away from violence once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurdish self-awareness is expanding and will not go away,''
two American specialists, Henri Barkey and Graham Fuller, asserted
in a study last year. ``Realistic solutions are ones that satisfy
Kurdish aspirations without truly threatening a modern democratic
Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence can be undercut only when Kurds realize that they
have clear reason for hope for progress using other means,'' their
study asserted. ``Acceptance of the cultural diversity of Turkey
should not be taken as a reflection of the country's weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, many Kurdish politicians have more or less openly
supported Ocalan and his rebels. Among them is Leyla Zana, an
imprisoned former member of Parliament who has received a peace
prize from the European Parliament and is a symbol of Kurdish
militance. She asserted in a recent statement that Kurds consider
Ocalan's guerrilla group to be ``their tongue, their ears, brain
and very blood _ their hearts and veins.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Kurdish politicians, however, have distanced themselves
from guerrilla violence. One is Hasim Hasimi, who was mayor of the
embattled Kurdish town of Cizre and is now a member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Hasimi's views are about as close to Kurdish nationalism as is
possible within the limits of Turkish legality. Besides arguing for
Kurdish rights, he listens to cassettes of Kurdish folk songs in
his car and, when at home, watches the pro-guerrilla MED television
station, which is based in Belgium. This week he ventured to hope
that Ocalan's capture might prove a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance for Turkey to make the transition to full
democracy,'' Hasimi said. ``We need to let people enjoy their own
cultural identities, and to renounce all forms of ethnic
discrimination. Turkey shouldn't be afraid of its own people. We
need to grab this chance for peace with the same audacity we used
in grabbing Ocalan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last 15 years, we've had 30,000 people killed and
many others missing,'' Hasimi added. ``There has been mass
emigration from the Kurdish region. Many villages have been
deserted. But I believe that our society will be able to put this
all behind us. The feeling of brotherhood is still very strong
here. We are going to live in peace again.''

   WASHINGTON _ Yevgeny Primakov, the former KGB spy who is trying
to tighten his hold as Russia's prime minister, has gotten a pretty
fast education about the ugly choices the global economy presents
to leaders of some of the world's great and once-great powers.
</P>
<P>
   Every few weeks a team of economists from the International
Monetary Fund shows up in Moscow to determine if Primakov has put
together what they politely term a ``realistic'' budget. By that
they mean a budget that contains a plan to actually begin
collecting taxes, bring the costs of pensions and subsidies under
control, manage interest rates and pay back debts owed to the West.
Their recent message is simple: If the numbers don't add up, the
long-halted aid won't resume. And don't count on welcoming back the
burned investors who fled Russia last August.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the agony, Primakov is getting an equally clear _ and
entirely contradictory _ message from the oligarchs whose support
he needs, from ordinary Russians who want relief from soaring
prices, from the itchy military that wants to get paid and from the
Communists who point out that these indignities were unheard of
before Russia began paying lip service to the idea of a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's struggle between the forces of global economic
integration and domestic economic disintegration, between going the
IMF way or going its own way, is an extreme case, but it is hardly
unique. Even as the world economy seems to be stabilizing after 20
months of chaos, the political tensions engendered by those events
are only worsening. From Brasilia to Beijing to Tokyo, leaders who
once talked, Clinton-like, about the benefits of plunging into a
globally integrated economy are now talking about how to get out of
the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger put it bluntly three
weeks ago at the annual meeting of the gods of a globalized economy
in Davos, Switzerland: ``It is not politically tolerable to
prescribe long periods of austerity. It has not worked in any
country, and in Indonesia it has produced a political
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is not on the same wavelength as
Kissinger. It continues to prescribe austerity and fiscal
rectitude, even while talking about the need for ``social safety
nets'' in places like Russia and Brazil. But listen carefully, and
you can hear the White House recalibrating. Last week President
Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, was talking
about a new challenge: Dealing with the ``very real fear of a swing
back away from democracy and market economics'' overseas because of
the pressures of austerity.
</P>
<P>
   A four-part series in The New York Times last week described the
economic carnage that created this backlash _ from the enormous
increase in the flow of international capital around the world to
the unpredictable consequences when that cash rushed out of nations
that had become addicted to it but were unable to regulate their
financial systems. Add to that a dash of crony capitalism, the
effects of falling prices for everything from pigs to gasoline, and
the sheer panic that sets in when investors conclude that last
month's ``emerging market'' is this month's basket case, and you
have the ingredients for a global mess.
</P>
<P>
   Only now, though, are people beginning to explore the political
consequences of that collapse, which are as varied as the countries
where economic contagion spread. Brazil's governors responded to
the country's crisis by threatening to default on their debts
rather than give up populist programs; Japan's lawmakers are
pressing the Bank of Japan to vastly increase the amount of yen in
circulation, an inflation-creating strategy Japan hasn't tried
since 1939. (It didn't work out so well then.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the solution, all are discovering one immutable fact:
For all the talk about the wonders of joining the global market, it
greatly reduces a nation's political choices.
</P>
<P>
   When times are good it is easy to satisfy investors, who want
low risk and high returns, while keeping the masses happy. That was
the story of Asia: As money poured in and jobs were created, the
free markets seemed not just a godsend, but an ideology. But the
moment they stopped delivering prosperity, interests diverged. The
IMF, backed by the United States, saw salvation in fiscal
discipline, high interest rates to draw back investors and a
continuing commitment to open markets. The investors demanded
government guarantees that their investments would be protected _
or they would take their cash elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The investors won the first round. But now Indonesian rickshaw
drivers and Chinese steel makers are demanding that their
governments take care of them first. Suddenly the market forces
that were seen as the path to national salvation have become the
enemy of national sovereignty; who wants to let some bond traders
in New York, much less the IMF, dictate how much can be spent on
unemployment insurance?

   ``Few people would die with the words `free markets' on their
lips,'' notes Daniel Yergin, who has chronicled the rise of the
markets in the 1980s and '90s and the consequent reduction of state
power. And so all of a sudden, from Davos to Shanghai, the talk is
about re-imposing control on the markets to protect the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't so easy to do, not in a world grown dependent on
foreign capital to build the office buildings and the factories.
</P>
<P>
   This struggle between what investors demand and what politicians
think they need to do to satisfy their constituencies is visible
every day, in different guises. French President Jacques Chirac
arrived in Washington last week and before stepping inside the
White House went to the headquarters of the IMF, where he declared
that it was time to reimpose control over the exchange rates of the
three major currencies: the dollar, the yen and the new euro.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a free marketeer, made it clear
that he views Chirac's idea as a form of madness. In the name of
keeping currencies aligned, he said, a country whose economy was
slowing _ say, the United States _ might have to raise interest
rates, worsening the slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Another form of the struggle between state control and markets
is playing out in China, where the Communist Party's legitimacy
these days rests almost entirely on its ability to deliver economic
growth. When greater economic liberalization served that purpose,
the leadership in Beijing talked about market socialism. But now
growth is slowing _ the government insists the economy expanded 7.8
percent last year, but the figure appears to be a figment of
statistical imagination _ and there are no new jobs for those laid
off from decrepit, uncompetitive state-owned industries. With small
riots breaking out, the government is suddenly more worried about
stability than economic reform. A senior Clinton administration
official talks of China's new ``command economy,'' in which banks
are instructed to keep lending money to failing state-owned
enterprises, a formula for disaster. And foreign investment in
China, once the hottest play on the globe, is slowing dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Russia, whose downward spiral, Berger says, is a
greater threat to U.S. security than a strong Soviet Union was. But
the solution Washington is adopting seems a series of Band-Aids:
Clinton's latest budget includes money to pay Russian nuclear
scientists in hopes that they won't seek employment with Saddam
Hussein, and it provides humanitarian food aid around the edges.
But the old strategy _ pretending that Russia is rapidly turning
into a market economy, and providing billions in loans through the
IMF to get it there _ is an approach Washington now views as
bankrupt. So do Russians like Vladimir Ryzhkov, a member of
Parliament who told an audience at Davos that Russia is now so weak
it ``is incapable of implementing serious reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers of the global crisis insist there is a third way _
that austerity need not mean abandoning the poor or the unemployed.
Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the IMF, says the portrayal
of his organization as heartless economists devoid of a social
conscience is ``arrant nonsense.'' But he also points out that the
IMF does not have the resources to rebuild a Russia or an
Indonesia; only the private markets have that kind of cash. And if
the leaders of the emerging markets want to attract that money
again, they are going to have to listen to what the investors want
as attentively as they listen to the protesters in the streets.

<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey _ The emotions of 25 million people without a
state seized the world's television screens last week. Viewers saw
anger and frustration, clinched fists and in a few instances bodies
ablaze in suicidal protest.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy being a Kurd.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this century, this ethnic minority has sought to
promote its national identity in a tumultuous part of the world. On
a cluttered agenda of global oil, Israeli-Arab animosity, Saddam
Hussein and Iran's Islamic fundamentalists, there's been little
room for Kurdish rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds want self-determination, but no one else seems ready
to take up their cause. They are Muslim farmers, merchants and
nomads -- scattered across Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria. In each of
these countries, regimes have effectively contained and weakened
the Kurdish minority. What's more, the Kurdish movement remains
beset by its own internal feuds and tribal distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   With ``no friend but the mountains,'' as their self-pitying
legend goes, the Kurds have long been cloaked in relative
obscurity. But now that veil is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest Feb. 16 of separatist leader Abdullah ``Apo'' Ocalan
by Turkey -- with the help of the CIA -- provoked riots by the
Kurdish diaspora across Europe and brought the quest for self-rule
into the world's living rooms, with TV pictures of Kurds taking
over embassies, wrestling with police and committing
self-immolation.
</P>
<P>
   The capture of the charismatic Ocalan, leader of the militant
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), places the aspirations of Turkey's
12 million Kurds and the Turkish government at a crucial turning
point in the decades-long struggle over Kurdish rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``And clearly it is not only Turkey's problem, but the
world's,'' said Sedat Yurtdas, 38, a moderate Kurdish politician
and lawyer whose activities have been banned by the Turkish
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Entebbe-style capture of Ocalan in Kenya by Turkish
commandos was widely celebrated in Turkey, comparable to if Israel
had nabbed Yasser Arafat amid the Palestinian terrorist movement in
the 1970s. Ocalan's rebel forces are credited with a 15-year
insurrection that has cost the lives of some 30,000 Turks, both
soldiers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   He is routinely referred to in Turkey's pro-government press as
``the babykiller.'' Some families who lost sons serving in the
Turkish army held parties to toast his capture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victory!'' screamed the headline this week in a leading
Turkish newspaper, Hurriyet. Pro-government TV relished
broadcasting a videotape of a humiliated and blindfolded Ocalan
being transported to his high-security island prison on Imrali, in
the Sea of Marmara, near Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question nagging Turkey is: What next? Will the
arrest of Ocalan debilitate the Kurdish movement, or galvanize it
as never before?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's is great rejoicing at what we've accomplished in
apprehending this criminal. But I don't think anyone in Ankara is
under the illusion that it is going to make our problems go away,''
said a foreign ministry official who asked to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that eliminating the opposition is not possible in the
short term. The guerrilla movement is still active, there are
millions of Kurds living in Europe. They have a structure and a
cause that is not simply going to fade away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   EDITORS: The story may end here.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   A sobering problem for Turkey is the delicate matter of how to
handle Ocalan's upcoming trial and anticipated conviction, after
which he could be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan and the PKK's brutal tactics have been loathed by many
moderate Kurds. But Turkey risks turning Ocalan into a martyr for
all Kurds if the trial is viewed as a sham and Ocalan is put to
death.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate aftermath of Ocalan's arrest, Kurds living
abroad and linked by e-mail and a Europe-based satellite TV
station, took the streets and occupied embassy buildings in more
than 20 European cities. It was a surprising and sudden show of
coordination and logistics.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other man has done as much to publicize the plight of
the Kurds. A vindictive Saddam Hussein sought to annihilate Iraqi
Kurds in the north of his country in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf
War. The United States and other Western forces had to intervene
with threats and a no-fly zone to curb an all-out military assault
by what was left of Iraq's battered army.
</P>
<P>
   With Saddam contained and supply lines of refugee aid
established, the West offered little hope that more would be done
to address the ambition of Kurdish independence. With American and
United Nations help, the Kurds in northern Iraq are largely running
their own affairs, without realizing their ultimate goal of
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most militant of Kurds began to set their sights lower;
In Turkey, Ocalan relinquished the goal of an independent
statehood, calling instead for limited autonomy within Turkey's
borders.
</P>
<P>
   With the bulk of Kurds living in Turkey, the United States has
been hesitant to enter the fray and risk upsetting Turkey, a NATO
ally strategically situated next to Iran and Iraq that hosts the
U.S. military most notably at the large Air Force base at Incerlik.
</P>
<P>
   Washington regards the PKK as a terrorist organization. On
Friday, the State Department acknowledged that the U.S.
intelligence services helped Turkey track down and capture Ocalan,
who had looking for a hiding place since mid-October when he was
forced from his haven in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey used the arrest as an opportunity to launch a fresh
offensive against the Kurds in the southeast, where troops backed
by artillery and air power routinely drive the guerrillas into the
snow-covered highlands across the border with Iraq. Since the early
1990's, Turkish forces have effectively place the PKK on the run
and in the process pulverized more than 3,000 towns and villages to
eliminate their hiding places.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a pronouncement by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit that
``the terrorist organization's back has been broken and the
terrorist chief has been captured,'' no one expects the Kurdish
problem to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   If Turkey's relentless military and security offensive is the
stick, Ecevit offered a carrot this week in proclaiming a campaign
to increase investment and improve roads in mainly Kurdish
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel appealed for a special
session of parliament to pass an amnesty law to urge Ocalan's
followers to end their 15-year struggle for self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, the Kurds will be looking for more.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among their demands are basic human and democratic
rights. Most moderate Kurdish voices have been jailed or their
activities curbed by the government and courts who consider almost
any Kurdish political expression as tantamount to sedition.
</P>
<P>
   Local and general elections are scheduled for April 18. But
Turkey's chief prosecutor has begun legal proceedings to bar the
pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party (HADEP). If outlawed, it would
be the fourth political party sympathetic to the Kurds to be banned
in Turkey during this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Such crackdowns go over well among mainstream Turkish voters,
who tend to view the Kurdish issue not a quest by disenfranchised
people, but as a threat to national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   A few public figures in Turkey do openly question government
policy, at the risk of prosecution for violating security laws, by
suggesting that the Kurdish problem could have been preempted years
ago had Turkey relaxed its opposition to limited regional self-rule
for the Kurds and allowed Kurdish moderates a greater voice in
national affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to name this problem -- it is the Kurdish problem. If
you don't recognize that it is there you won't be able to solve
it,'' said Akin Birdal, a leading Turkish human rights activist in
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arrest has placed the eyes of the world on Turkey. It is
an important test, not only for the future of the Kurds but for
Turkey's reputation in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey can take comfort in the fact that during his months on
the run, no European country would offer Ocalan refuge.
</P>
<P>
   But now that it has him in custody, the government here appears
to be ignoring demands by international human rights groups for
greater tolerance towards the Kurds and a fair trial for Ocalan.
Turkey is preparing a closed trial before a military tribunal for
the rebel leader and has rejected attempts of Ocalan's European
lawyers to enter the country to confer with him.
</P>
<P>
   Italy and Greece have asked the European Union to insure a fair
trial for Ocalan, one that would avoid the death penalty he faces
under Turkish law. They would make such procedures a condition for
eventual Turkish membership in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Turkey, the threat of new violence was faxed Friday to
the Associated Press. Ocalan's PKK warned that Turkey would ``face
the consequences'' if Ocalan were harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that a dark period is waiting for us in the future,''
said Yurtdas, the Kurdish politician. ``If Turkey has a genuine
intention to solve this problem peacefully, it is high time to do
it now. There would be no reason for Kurds to rebel if we were
allowed to be part of the system.''

   Granted, April in Paris is hard to beat, but one thing that
beats it is being able to spend April in Paris thanks to an airline
ticket costing less than the regular fare between Seattle and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A rash of bargain fares this winter from an industry that, in
the words of one airline official, ``has more seats available than
fannies to put in them,'' has placed many European cities within
reach for the next two months _ plenty of time for Americans to
enjoy spring elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Through Wednesday of this week, United, American, Delta, British
Airways and other carriers are offering an array of low-cost
roundtrip tickets, including New York or Boston to London for $228,
or Los Angeles and San Francisco to London for $358. Air France's
$270 roundtrip fare between Chicago and Paris can be purchased as
late as this Friday, as can its $300 roundtrip to Madrid or $380
roundtrip to Rome or Milan. The fares are larded with restrictions,
and not all airlines have identical discounts or travel dates.
</P>
<P>
   If it is true there'll always be Paris, airline officials say,
you must remember this: it may be a long time before there'll be
Paris this cheap again. The discount fares do not include

   Turning Midlife Crisis Into Bliss &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a nation of rapidly aging baby boomers, it was very good
news: Never mind those heartburn commercials and wrinkle cream ads.
Middle age is not so bad after all.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Dr. Orville Gilbert Brim, director of the
MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Successful Midlife
Development, which just released the first wave of results from a
10-year study of nearly 8,000 Americans, ``midlife is the best
place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from supporting the Madison Avenue stereotype of middle age
as a time of questioning and emotional upheaval, the MacArthur
study found that most people experience the years between 35 and 65
_ particularly the decades between 40 and 60 _ as a period of
psychic equanimity, good health and productive activity. They feel,
for the most part, a high degree of satisfaction with their
marriages and with their relationships with children _ and a
greater sense of control in many areas of life. Most say they feel
better about their lives than they did 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And while the term ``midlife crisis'' is so familiar that 95
percent of Americans can define it, only 23 percent of participants
in the study reported having a midlife crisis, and of those, just a
third described the crisis as a time of personal turmoil brought
about by the realization that they were aging.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the MacArthur study is the MIDUS survey, an
in-depth telephone and mail survey of 3,000 adults from 25 to 74
years old, designed to tap a variety of life domains. About 5,000
other subjects participated in 11 related studies, whose results
will be released in future reports, Brim said.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the most comprehensive to date of middle-aged
adults. But while its message is upbeat, the findings suggest many
Americans may have trouble believing it: Fully 87 percent of those
surveyed told the researchers they would like to be younger than
they are.

   Two weeks before the visit to Beijing of Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, China granted early release to a journalist who
was imprisoned after writing about internal politics in Hong Kong
publications. Diplomats read the release of Gao Yu, 55, whose case
had been publicized abroad, as a gesture to soften U.S. rights
concerns as the two countries plan a visit to Washington by Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji in April. But the gesture was not overwhelming:
Ms. Gao had served all but nine months of a six-year term.

   Deciphering a Deadly Flu
</P>
<P>
   Scientists reached a milestone in their attempts to uncover the
face of one of the most deadly viruses ever known _ an influenza
virus that swept the world in 1918, killing perhaps as many as 40
million people. Using shards from lung tissue preserved since 1918,
they deciphered the entire sequence of an essential viral gene.
Unfortunately, this gene did not explain the virus' lethality. The
scientists are moving on to the virus' seven remaining genes.

   After years of sporadic charges about corruption within the U.S.
Customs Service, a Treasury Department report concluded that the
agency's front-line role in the war against illegal narcotics had
left it vulnerable to drug traffickers willing to pay enormous
bribes to low-paid officers willing to look the other way. The
report found that the agency's internal affairs system was too
ineffective to determine the scope of the problem, but said that
Raymond W. Kelly, the former New York Police Commissioner who was
recently appointed Customs Commissioner, had taken steps to more
aggressively police employee dishonesty.

   The Yankees based their arbitration argument with the All-Star
shortstop Derek Jeter strictly on numbers. Jeter has only three
years in the big leagues, club officials argued, and he shouldn't
be paid more than $3.2 million-a-year. But Jeter's agent took a
different tack, mentioning the 24-year-old's star quality in
supporting his request for $5 million _ how many endorsements he
does, how many Web site inquiries on Jeter's name and how teen-age
girls squeal when they see him. Jeter won, and the award is one of
the largest in baseball history.

Jews who survived concentration camps or fled, but the generally
non-Jewish forced laborers have yet to receive compensation.

   The announcement of the fund's creation by Social Democratic

   Patterns in HIV Study

   The first large-scale study of HIV infection among young gay men
in New York City has found that 12 percent have been infected, many
of them within the last two years. The infection rates of young
black men exceeds those of white and Hispanic men. But whether the
percentage is on the rise is unclear. The survey of 15- to
22-year-old men is one of a series of federally financed studies
nationwide. Strikingly, two-thirds of those participating in The
Young Men's Survey in New York reported that they had also had sex
with women.

   Is your diet heavy on pizza, ketchup and pasta sauce? Good. It
just might save your life. Various studies have suggested that
tomatoes _ especially processed tomatoes, high in the antioxidant
lycopene _ can cut the risk of various cancers. And now the Journal
of the National Cancer Institute has given its blessing, saying the
data prove the tomato's virtues convincingly. The benefits are
strongest against prostate, lung and stomach cancers, but tomatoes
have also proved effective and cervical and other cancers.

   Of the 29,000 recorded deaths in Oregon last year, 15 had an
unusual cause listed: ``Drug overdose, legally prescribed.'' That
is how many terminally ill people, nearly all with cancer, chose to
take lethal medication in the first year of the so-called ``Death
With Dignity'' act in Oregon, the only state that allows
physician-assisted suicide. Upon the release of the state's report
on the law's implementation, one doctor who oversaw a suicide
described it as a ``very positive, joyful experience'' for the
patient and family gathered around. But the state's leading
Catholic archbishop said the measure was continuing cause for
``sadness and shame.''

   Crimes Against Indians
</P>
<P>
   The old frontier mentality is alive and well. That seems to be
the message of a Justice Department report finding that American
Indians are the victims of violent crimes at a rate more than twice
the national average. Unlike whites and blacks, Indians are most
likely to be attacked by members of a race other than their own,
the study found. A full 60 percent of those who committed the
crimes were white, a heritage of prejudice in the West where most
Indians live, experts say.

   Twelve major German companies created a fund, expected to total
about $1.7 billion, to compensate victims of the Nazis, especially
forced laborers brought to Germany from Eastern Europe. Germany has
already paid out about $80 billion in war reparations, mainly to
Jews who survived concentration camps or fled, but the generally
non-Jewish forced laborers have yet to receive compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the fund's creation by Social Democratic
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was aimed at stopping lawsuits in
American courts against companies that exploited labor in Nazi-era
factories or concentration camps. Schroeder said he hoped it would
end ``the campaign being led against German industry and our
country.''

MEXICAN KIDNAPPING IS PUZZLE WITH HINT OF POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The kidnappers who stunned Mexico last week by
abducting the father of the country's most popular sports figure
have left the authorities puzzling over whether the crime was
motivated by politics or simply done for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a country where kidnapping has become disturbingly
common, the abduction of the father of the soccer star Jorge Campos
Navarrete has drawn national media attention, not only for the
celebrity involved but also for the brazen manner in which it was
carried out.
</P>
<P>
   A gang of at least half a dozen men seized their victim in broad
daylight on Wednesday and did not even bother to cover their faces.
</P>
<P>
   In another curious detail, Gov. Angel Aguirre Rivero of Guerrero
state, where the crime took place, said on Friday that the
kidnappers had still not established communication with the Campos
family. That appeared to contradict newspaper reports that the
kidnappers had demanded a $1 million ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Campos Navarrete, who in major-league soccer has played for the
Los Angeles Galaxy and now has a contract to play for the Chicago
Fire, also plays in Mexico's professional leagues and for the
national team. He is the idol of millions here and appears
frequently on Mexican television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   At least six men wearing workers' clothes lay in wait for the
soccer star's father, Alvaro Campos Gonzalez, 65, shortly before 2
p.m. Wednesday at a soccer field in a southern suburb of the
Pacific city of Acapulco, according to news accounts. When Campos
arrived, the men pulled out AK-47 rifles, seized, beat and tied up
two of his aides, and drove him away in a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because the abduction came during a tense post-election
standoff between President Ernesto Zedillo's Institutional
Revolutionary Party, and the leftist Party of the Democratic
Revolution, some experts see political motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an important current of analysts who believe this
kidnapping has political dimensions,'' said Lucio Mendoza, a former
coordinator at Mexico's national intelligence agency who has
founded an institute that studies organized crime here.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapping occurred 10 days after gubernatorial elections in
Guerrero in which Rene Juarez Cisneros, the governing party
candidate, claimed victory by a narrow margin. The Party of the
Democratic Revolution, accusing the governing party of vote-buying,
ballot-stuffing and vote-count irregularities, has refused to
recognize the victory and promised to harass the party with
continuing protests.
</P>
<P>
   During the gubernatorial campaign, Campos Navarrete appeared in
television commercials on the governing party candidate's behalf,
and his father is friendly with several prominent governing party
politicians, including the Acapulco mayor, Mexican newspapers said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The political context in Guerrero is also complicated by the
presence there of at least two guerrilla organizations tied to
previous kidnappings. Before the vote on Feb. 7, one group
threatened unspecified retaliation if the election appeared
fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers appear not to have carried out the abduction in
stolen vehicles. That, coupled with their failure to cover their
faces, suggested that they may have been inexperienced small-time
local criminals, Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Campos Gonzalez's sisters told Mexican reporters that she
doubted that politics was a motive. ``These people just want money,
and we hope to reach a deal,'' she told the Mexico City newspaper
La Jornada.

   Scheduled for the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   NATIONALISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Kurds, Bosnians, Scots, former
Soviet republics, central African tribes, Marshall Islanders and
others: there is something startling, ironic and troubling in
discovering that nationalism is militantly bucking the trend toward
globalism and transnationalism and emerging with a new vengeance
from a half-century of enforced quiescence. Or is it? Many of the
new nationalistic movements are fighting not each other but simply
trying to better position themselves in the new global marketplace.
By Serge Schmemann. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   POLICE-BRUTALITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Can the `zero tolerance'
anti-crime policies that have come into vogue over the last decade
be implemented without the trampling of innocent people's rights?
Embedded in the public angst over police brutality, there is a dark
underbelly to the superficially unassailable goal of stamping out
crime: Americans have come not only to tolerate a degree of
brutality from their police officers, but also, in ways subtle and
unsubtle, to encourage it. By Frank Bruni. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CONSERVATIVES-MORALS-REVIEW (Nashua, N.H.) _ Angered and puzzled
by President Clinton's acquittal, some conservatives have come to
an extraordinary realization, which may carry grim implications for
the their movement: They blame not themselves for mishandling the
whole episode, but a public whose moral standards have collapsed.
But blaming the prevailing public will can be risky, particularly
in an age when politicians find that public to be increasingly
aloof. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   LEGISLATORS-LAWYERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ State legislatures have
always had their farmers, teachers, engineers and entrepreneurs,
but from the early days of the Republic, no group has been as
over-represented as lawyers. But for the last three decades, even
as the profession has grown in numbers, its grip on state capitols
has steadily slipped, a trend that continued in the turnover
brought by the 1998 elections. By Richard Perez-Pena. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   INDIANS-JOBS-REVIEW (Bad River Reservation, Wis.) _ Many Indians
are returning to their ancestral homes, not just for funerals and
weddings but for jobs. Legalized tribal gambling has spawned a
windfall of new employment in casinos, hotels and restaurants. And
the profits are often invested locally, enlivening formerly
moribund tribal economies. By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   YANKS-CLEMENS-REVIEW (New York) _ Roger Clemens, the best
starting pitcher in baseball over the last 15 seasons and one of
the 8 or 10 best of all time, gets a chance, possibly his last, for
the World Series ring that will validate his career. The Yanks get
the best pitcher of his era, in his prime or close to it. By Allen
Barra.
</P>
<P>
   FEDERAL-POLICE-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at the growing trend
in Congress to federalize crimes that are traditionally handled by
state and local authorities. Federal law enforcement agents are
being asked to track down car-jackers, wife beaters, drunk drivers
and low-level drug dealers. Some legal experts warn of the
emergence of a national police force. By Steven A. Holmes. WITH
GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   TABLOIDS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The National Enquirer and the
Star have seen their circulations plummet in the last five years as
the median age of their readers has risen from just over 35 to
around 40. A look at some recent headlines and quotations.
</P>
<P>
   TOY-FAIR-REVIEW (New York) _ A look at the 96th American
International Toy Fair, where 1,700 exhibitors gathered to peddle
their wares to 20,000 buyers. Most of the toys and games haven't
hit stores yet. Some are still prototypes and failed in
demonstrations; others succeeded in demonstrations and will still
fail in stores. A look at some of the toys exhibited. By Jenny Lyn
Bader.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-WAR-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Pentagon does not like to say
it, but almost-daily skirmishes between U.S. pilots and Iraqi
forces have quickly turned into a low-level war of attrition that
appears to have no end in sight. Not since the Persian Gulf War in
1991 _ and, before that, Vietnam _ have U.S. forces engaged in such
routine combat in such a sustained way over such a prolonged
period. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at the political
consequences of the recent economic crisis in East Asia and Brazil;
they are as varied as the countries themselves. Even as the world
economy seems to be stabilizing after 20 months of chaos, the
political tensions engendered by those events are only worsening.
From Brasilia to Beijing to Tokyo, leaders who once talked,
Clinton-like, about the benefits of plunging into a globally
integrated economy are now talking about how to get out of the
pool. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   SELF-IMMOLATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ A grisly shadow from the
earliest days of the Vietnam War crept across the media landscape
last week as Kurdish protesters in Europe set themselves on fire or
threatened to. The events evoked memories of 1963, when Buddhist
monks immolated themselves to protest the Saigon regime. A look at
the historical and psychological aspects of self-immolation. By Joe
Sharkey.

FOR GORE, BANE OR GAIN OF A CLINTON CANDIDACY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the past week, Democrats have reveled in the
possibility that Hillary Rodham Clinton might run for one of New
York's seats in the Senate, casting her hypothetical candidacy next
year as a precious gift from the political gods. For the state's
beleaguered Democratic Party, it might be exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   But for someone else with a rather large stake in the elections
of 2000, Mrs. Clinton's candidacy might not be so divine.
Democratic political analysts and several advisers of Vice
President Al Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination
for president, say Gore may have more to lose than gain if Mrs.
Clinton runs in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably creates a little bit of a distraction for two of
Al Gore's most important supporters, namely the president and the
first lady,'' said Geoff D. Garin, a Democratic pollster. ``Both
Clintons could and would play an enormously supportive role for
Gore in a whole host of ways, and if Mrs. Clinton is a candidate
for the Senate, there's going to be something at least as pressing
on their to-do list.''
</P>
<P>
   Her candidacy also could draw money and celebrities from Gore's
side to Mrs. Clinton's. ``Will it overlap with some fund-raising?''
asked one of Gore's campaign advisers, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity. ``Yes. Will it be a high-profile campaign that
attracts talent we would like to attract? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Smith, who has been hired to manage Gore's presidential
campaign, said the diminished presence of the Clintons on the
campaign trail for Gore would not be critical, in part because the
excitement about the Democratic Party that the Clintons would be
creating in New York would fan out to other places.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she chooses to run,'' Smith said, ``we would look forward
to running with her.''
</P>
<P>
   But other people working on Gore's campaign said that for the
vice president, there would be an undeniable downside. They said
that while Gore had not expressed any reservations about Mrs.
Clinton's candidacy, some of his advisers briefly had discussed the
implications, because they had been operating on the presumption
that and Mrs. Clinton would campaign extensively for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a potential weapon we don't have,'' said one of Gore's
advisers, noting that Mrs. Clinton's speeches and appearances at
fund-raising events last year provided enormous help to Democratic
Senate candidates like Barbara Boxer of California.
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser, however, said that the Democratic turnout that
Mrs. Clinton might inspire in New York would sew up victory in the
state for Gore, allowing him to devote energy and money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it means we only have to buy a third as much television
time in New York,'' said the adviser, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, ``that's millions of dollars saved. There are upsides
and downsides, and we'll just have to adapt to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the frenzy of speculation that intensified with the
first lady's announcement on Tuesday that she was giving her
candidacy careful thought, some people who know her say there is
little chance she will decide to run. Several of her close friends
said this week that Mrs. Clinton was probably months away from
making a decision and was not leaning either way.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hasn't said yes or no in her mind yet,'' said Diane Blair,
a longtime friend from Arkansas. ``She very strongly feels she
needs some time and space _ real thinking time. Hillary does not
jump into things.''
</P>
<P>
   One close friend said that in addition to Mrs. Clinton's
concerns about money and the family's privacy, the first lady knew
that the pedestal she occupies as one of the country's most
respected, popular women might crumble instantly in the rough and
tumble of a campaign. Mrs. Clinton also remembers how it felt, just
a few years ago, not to have such a perch, her friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends also said that Mrs. Clinton realizes that energy spent
on herself is energy denied others like Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are questions of opportunities lost and roads not
taken,'' said Mandy Grunwald, a Democratic media consultant who
worked not only for Clinton but also for Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan of New York, whose retirement is opening up the seat for
which Mrs. Clinton would run.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's true of the campaign road 2000,'' Ms. Grunwald
said. ``If she was campaigning for herself, she obviously would not
have the time to campaign as fully for Vice President Gore or House
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there are some reasons why Mrs. Clinton's candidacy
might actually be desirable for Gore. By all appearances, she has a
good shot at winning and helping to lift other congressional
candidates in New York to victory, and more Democrats in Congress
would make it easier for a Democratic president to institute his
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, also said that Mrs.
Clinton's candidacy in New York could help Gore by making sure that
Democrats defined the terms of the political debate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather she shook less hands in other states'' and instead
``changed the national debate on substantive issues,'' said
Torricelli, who has been fiercely lobbying Mrs. Clinton to run.
</P>
<P>
   But other political veterans took a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have an asset like Hillary Clinton showing up at
fund-raisers in California, as well as Florida and other key states
_ that's a hell of a draw,'' said Leon E. Panetta, a former
Democratic congressman from California who served as Clinton's
chief of staff in his first term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you can have others, but not with the same impact,''
Panetta said. ``In a tight race nationally, I think it could make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic strategist in Washington, D.C.,
pointed out another potential problem for Gore. In terms of issues,
Ms. Gorlin said, Mrs. Clinton's candidacy could essentially box
Gore in, because she would be the one defining the president's
legacy in the course of her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore no longer has the option of picking and choosing among
the things in the Clinton record that he wants to run on or
defend,'' Ms. Gorlin said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WAGHA, Pakistan _ In an extraordinary show of warmth between two
bitterly hostile nations, India's prime minister, Atal Behari
Vajpayee, rode a bus Saturday through the fertile plains of Punjab,
crossed the usually closed border gate here and cordially embraced
his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries, led by these same two leaders, startled the
world last May when they conducted tit-for-tat tests of nuclear
bombs. The bellicose euphoria of their people _ stoking the fires
of half a century of enmity _ led much of the world to fret that
the Indian subcontinent was now the globe's most perilous nuclear
flash point.
</P>
<P>
   But relations between them, while still tense and unpredictable,
have taken a turn for the better. In recent months, the two prime
ministers have spoken both in person and on the telephone,
developing the rapport that led Sharif to invite Vajpayee to pay a
call. It is the first visit to Pakistan by an Indian prime minister
since 1989 and only the third ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bring the good will and hopes of my fellow Indians, who seek
abiding peace and harmony with Pakistan,'' Vajpayee, 72, said as
his bus finished its journey along a route that holds vivid, if not
always happy, memories for the people of both countries. ``I am
conscious that this is a defining moment in South Asian history,
and I hope we will be able to rise to the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif had been waiting for his guest for 15 minutes and at one
point walked a few feet across the border into India, where a brass
band was playing and dancers whirled in the shady lane.
</P>
<P>
   Colorful bunting was strung on both sides of the crossing
station. The roadways were a burst of color with newly planted
flowers and freshly painted stripes. Red carpets had been unfurled.
Indian and Pakistani flags flew side by side.
</P>
<P>
   As the bus crossed into Pakistan, Sharif, a 49-year-old
millionaire industrialist, stood at the door and waited for the
older prime minister to manage the steps down. The two men greeted
each other with a double handshake. It did not seem enough to those
cheering. Vajpayee initiated a hug.
</P>
<P>
   Then the bus was slowly emptied of the diplomats, businessmen,
athletes and film stars who had joined the journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling, the greatest in the world,'' shouted Dev
Anand, a veteran actor who has family roots in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   After juice was served, a color guard saluted Vajpayee, and the
prime ministers inspected the Pakistani troops who stood at
attention with bayonets drawn. Finally, the two leaders left
together aboard a helicopter for the historic city of Lahore and a
day and a half of serious discussions and highly choreographed
pomp, including a banquet at Lahore Fort, a Mughal-era treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Topics for discussion will include both nuclear weaponry and the
disputed territory of Kashmir. Results of the talks are to be
announced at a joint news conference on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not just two neighbors any more _ we are nuclear
neighbors,'' said Pakistan's information minister, Mushahid
Hussein. ``Success means we are not shooting at each other. We are
not shouting at each other. Success means we are talking to each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   The nominal occasion for Vajpayee's trip was the inaugural run
of regularly scheduled bus service between New Delhi and Lahore.
The 250 miles would normally require a 14-hour journey, but
Vajpayee avoided most of the wearying travel by getting on the bus
in the northern Indian city of Amritsar and staying aboard only for
the final 23 miles to the border.
</P>
<P>
   As he entered the bright gold 31-seat vehicle, he said: ``I have
mixed feelings. I am happy that I am going to Lahore on Prime
Minister Sharif's invitation, but I feel sorry that we have lost so
many years.''
</P>
<P>
   To many Indians, these will be surprising words, coming as they
do from the leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party,
the political arm of groups widely seen as anti-Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message to the people of Pakistan will be short and
simple,'' Vajpayee said. ``Put aside the bitterness of the past and
let us together make a new beginning.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The elaborate welcome the Indian prime minister received holds
special emotional meaning, not merely for its promise of peace but
because of the indelible grief suffered by families of both nations
along this same route in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Some 12 million people were uprooted during Partition, the name
history has given to the sundering of the subcontinent with the
stroke of a pen. Hastily drawn maps separated predominantly Muslim
Pakistan from predominantly Hindu India when both nations were
granted independence.
</P>
<P>
   Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs had all staked their claims to the
rich farmland and ancient cities of Punjab, and those who lost out
fled in enormous migrations, crossing paths with the masses of
people coming to supplant them.
</P>
<P>
   Atrocities were carried out on all sides in a prolonged mania of
rage and vengeance. Children in both nations are told and retold
stories of skewered infants, massacres of entire trainloads of
passengers, drainage ditches teeming with bloody corpses. One
million people rapidly perished, and the two countries still feed
off that hate.
</P>
<P>
   The border here has remained a gash that separates the former
countrymen. In a half-century, India and Pakistan have fought three
wars with each other, and military skirmishes and artillery fire
continue relentlessly like a low-grade fever.
</P>
<P>
   For some Indians and Pakistanis, news of the bus trip has
brought a surge of nostalgia for their ancestral homes, though for
others emotion rises in waves of anger.
</P>
<P>
   Across Pakistan, thousands of Islamic fundamentalists on
Saturday protested Vajpayee's visit. Some carried signs: ``Vajpayee
Go Home'' and ``No friendship between Hindus and Muslims.'' Many
stores were closed. Some roads were blocked and vehicles were
attacked. One policeman was shot in an exchange of gunfire in an
area not far from Sharif's private residence in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders have hard-liners to mollify. A week ago, in the
midst of the felicitous buildup to the bus ride, Sharif declared a
Day of Solidarity with Kashmiri ``freedom fighters'' _ people the
Indians consider terrorists. During protests, Sharif's supporters
dragged Vajpayee's effigy through the streets before setting it
ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   The prime ministers have domestic troubles as well. Vajpayee
heads a multiparty coalition government with small allies who
require full-time cajoling. Sharif's country is economically
hobbled and frightfully lawless. His use of military courts to try
criminal cases speedily was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme
Court the week before last.
</P>
<P>
   Bus diplomacy will likely be a boon to their popularity.
According to polls, the common people in both countries
overwhelmingly want improved relations.
</P>
<P>
   There was a demonstration of this in recent weeks as Pakistan's
cricket team toured India for the first time in 12 years. The
matches were played without disruption. Indeed, when the Pakistanis
won the first match, played in Madras, Indian fans gave the
visitors a thunderous ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the current talks will produce substantial progress as
well as smiling photos depends on the willingness of each side to
move from entrenched positions, especially those regarding Kashmir,
an Indian state with a Muslim majority.
</P>
<P>
   For the last five months, high-level civil servants from the two
nations have been holding periodic _ and largely fruitless _
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, men with more power will step in. The meetings in Lahore
may be merely a historic start. Sharif has accepted Vajpayee's
invitation to ride the bus the other way. Details for further bus
diplomacy are expected to be worked out soon.

   MILWAUKEE _ Her mother didn't want to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Carmelina Smith was locked up and crying _ for herself, for her
children, and because the police had just discovered the secret
behind her seemingly smooth transition from welfare. A cashier in a
college bookstore, Ms. Smith had bolstered her modest wage by
lifting more than $11,000 from the cash register and tucking it
under her mattress.
</P>
<P>
   But when her mother arrived for a jailhouse visit, she was
crying, too. With her daughter headed toward a four-year sentence,
Jessielean Smith knew she would be the one forced to feed, clothe,
diaper and bathe the unruly grandchildren left behind. At age 43,
with her own children mostly grown, the last thing she wanted was
two toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Don't cry _ I'm the one crying!' '' the elder Ms. Smith
recalls barking at her daughter. `` `Your little boy's jumping all
up over my foot. My hand ain't no good. My blood pressure's high.
And I'm obese. I don't want to hear you're depressed. I'm
depressed!' ''
</P>
<P>
   As Wisconsin drives its welfare rolls to record lows, the number
of grandmothers pressed into action is reaching unexpected highs.
Unwilling or unable to work for public aid, many of the state's
most troubled mothers have lost their benefits, often en route to
drug clinics, jail cells, shelters, or the streets. And
grandmothers like Ms. Smith _ angry, worried, or plain exhausted _
are being left to care for the children abandoned along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the state's beleaguered grandmothers is just one
chapter of the complex treatise on social change being written here
by welfare's end. And like most aspects of Wisconsin's daring
experiment, it is drawing national, even international, attention
from a world eager for glimpses of the post-welfare future.
</P>
<P>
   No anti-poverty idea has animated the last decade as much as
``ending welfare.'' And no state has drawn closer than Wisconsin,
where a universal work requirement has cut the cash welfare rolls
by an astonishing 91 percent. (The food stamp and Medicaid rolls
are also declining, though at a slower rate.) Unlikely as it once
would have seemed, policy makers from across the globe now
routinely descend on Milwaukee, the state's former welfare bastion,
searching for signposts of the future.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and his Republican adversaries have celebrated
the dwindling rolls _ in Wisconsin and across the country _ as
evidence of clear success. Skeptics warn that families are
suffering out of sight and that a flagging economy may yet leave
them sleeping on grates. Years of ideological war have left all
sides invested in a view. From academic conferences to political
campaigns, opinions abound, but facts are scare.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Milwaukee, the epicenter of welfare's end, a sustained
look offers a portrait of change not easily reduced to slogans. The
world remade by this bold experiment counts winners and losers and
many whose complicated stories place them somewhere in between. And
those whose lives are being reshaped are not all drawn from the
ranks of the poor. Tax preparers are pocketing new profits as the
jobless go to work. Slum landlords are bemoaning their losses as
eviction rates rise. Day-care centers are sprouting rapidly and
dying just as fast. Homeless shelters are running out of beds.
Morning traffic has arrived in neighborhoods once eerie with
inactivity.
</P>
<P>
   And grandmothers like Jessielean Smith are busier, and more
burdened, than ever. As a grandmother summoned to new duty by
welfare's demise, Ms. Smith is typically young, typically ill, and
typically overwhelmed. She has arthritis in her hand and legs, high
blood pressure, and a weight problem that has slowed her gait with
260 pounds. Counting six foster children, she has had a young child
in her care for a quarter century, ever since she turned 18.
Yearning for a break, she had just surrendered her last foster
child four days before her daughter's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Now her life's boundaries are circumscribed by Nakia, 3, and
Na'Quee, 2, who require an even closer watch than most toddlers.
They have clogged her toilet, colored her walls, and reduced the
wood panels of her dresser drawers to a pile of splinters. She has
already sought psychiatric assistance for Nakia, who flies into
hour-long rages and rams his head against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   With little help and a fixed income, Ms. Smith has seen her
spirits sag, her finances falter, and the dosage of her blood
pressure medication double. ``It's been a disaster!'' she said.
``You have no private life. You can't even go to the bathroom. Your
whole world revolves around these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Grandmothers like Ms. Smith have long served as pillars of poor
communities. But the last decade has left them especially besieged,
as crack, AIDS and lengthening jail terms have sidelined more and
more poor mothers. Nationally, the Census Bureau reports that the
number of children in their grandparents' care has risen more than
50 percent in the last decade alone.
</P>
<P>
   If Wisconsin's experience is an indication, the nation's tougher
welfare laws will push the number even higher. Since the program,
called Wisconsin Works, or W-2, began in September 1997, the number
of children falling into relatives' care has exceeded state
projections, created waiting lists for aid, and touched off a new
safety-net debate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's kinship care program, grandmothers and other
relatives can receive $215 a month for every child in their care.
Some advocates for the poor have argued that families need easier
access to the payments, and more social services, to keep the
children from foster care.
</P>
<P>
   But others, including Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson, have asked
the legislature to tighten the program's eligibility criteria. They
warn that kinship care could evolve into a new welfare entitlement
that allows poor parents to avoid work by giving _ or perhaps just
pretending to give _ their children to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   While the placement of children with relatives has brought new
criticisms of W-2, whether to consider such moves frequent or rare
depends in part on one's expectations. In a state survey released
last month, 5 percent of former recipients said they had sent their
children to live with others because they could no longer care for
them. (By contrast, 62 percent had jobs.) The survey acknowledged
undersampling the most troubled families, so the real number of
displaced children may be somewhat higher.
</P>
<P>
   Like Carmelina Smith, many of the mothers affected had drug
problems that interfered with their ability to work, and others had
problems with mental health. ``I have come to admit my
powerlessness over drugs and drink,'' Ms. Smith wrote to a judge
last month, in a plea for early release.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, a welfare check often lent such mothers
just enough stability to keep their families together. But Ms.
Smith said that when the work program began, her income disappeared
and her troubled situation bloomed into outright crisis. ``I
couldn't buy my kids milk and Pampers _ that's why I did what I
did,'' she said in a recent telephone interview from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 100,000 families received cash welfare payments in 1987
when Thompson took office. Under W-2, that figure has now fallen to
about 9,000. In addition, the state assists about 8,700 other
families through kinship care or a state disability program.
</P>
<P>
   At times, a grandmother's intervention can bring new stability
to a child's life. That seems the case with Verleen Pearson, who
marches her two grandsons, Brandon, 9, and Giovante, 4, through
nightly meals on her lace tablecloth and weekly services at the
Holy Temple Missionary Baptist Church. Ms. Pearson has been caring
for the children for more than a year since her daughter, Yolanda,
lost her benefits, faced an eviction and left town with a
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are fine,'' Ms. Pearson said, though she herself
admits to more than a little fatigue. At 51, she has a disabling
lung disease that requires her to breathe with the help of an
oxygen tank. ``I enjoy it because they are my grandchildren and I
love them, but physically it's been somewhat of a struggle,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But other grandmothers are just marginally more stable than the
mothers they have replaced. At 71, Bernice Locke found herself
caring for four great-grandchildren _ three of them teen-agers _
after her granddaughter, LaHonda, lost her welfare check and was
arrested for selling drugs. A besieged woman surviving on
disability payments, Ms. Locke falters just trying to remember the
children's names.
</P>
<P>
   ``They name these babies so many crazy names, I don't even know
_ I get confused,'' she said, estimating she has 28 or 29
grandchildren and about 17 great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A recent visit to Ms. Locke's home found two of the teen-agers
suspended from school for fighting while Ms. Locke wrote the judge
that sentenced her granddaughter. ``I know this is a lot to ask,
but can her jail time be reduced?'' she asked. ``One of the
children has a bed-wetting problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are about 1.4 million children living in
``skip-generation'' households, where grandparents are raising
grandchildren without a parent present. That represents a 52
percent increase since 1990. Almost half live in households headed
by a grandmother only, the configuration most commonly found in
Milwaukee's poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, their resources are meager. Nationwide, 57 percent of
these single grandmothers are poor, according to the Census Bureau.
About 46 percent lack a high-school diploma and only a third are
employed in a given month. Their average income is $13,400. About
53 percent are black; 28 percent are white; 16 percent are
Hispanic; and 3 percent are classified as ``other.'' Forty-one
percent are younger than 54.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's previous system, grandmothers like Ms. Smith
could receive welfare as long as the grandchildren they were caring
for had sufficiently meager resources. But in creating kinship
care, the state made it harder to get cash payments. Families must
first undergo a home visit from a child protection worker. And the
only children eligible are those deemed at risk of going into
foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Still, caseloads have run unexpectedly high. By last September,
the most recent month for which figures are available, there were
8,616 children approved for aid. That figure exceeded the range of
previous estimates by 12 to 40 percent and led to long waiting
lists.
</P>
<P>
   While the state had about $80 million in unspent federal welfare
money, the effort to bolster the program's financing bogged down
during months of interagency squabbling. After a barrage of
criticisms, Thompson and the legislature transferred $1.9 million
last fall to eliminate the waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith applied for help last February, a month after her
daughter went to jail. But she was forced to wait seven months
before receiving a check, and she is now seeking back payments.
``Man, that made me mad,'' she said, speaking of the wait.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith has other monthly income _ $550 in disability
payments, $419 in food stamps, and $426 in adoption assistance for
a former foster child she has turned into a son. But she said a
half year's bills for food and diapers has left her in a hole.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the demand for kinship care is unexpectedly strong, the
reasons are in dispute. Critics of W-2 say the unforgiving work
rules are breaking apart troubled families once held together by
welfare. That view seems bolstered by reports from homeless
shelters, which have seen sharp rises in single women who say they
have left their children with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   It is also bolstered by other circumstantial evidence. After
declining for several years, the number of children on public
assistance being raised by relatives began to edge up in March
1998, the month transition to W-2 was completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``W-2 makes so many demands and these were already fragile
families,'' said Gwen Moore, a state senator whose district
includes some of Milwaukee's poorest neighborhoods. ``We predicted
that child welfare cases would go up.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials agree that, without welfare, some troubled
mothers like Carmelina Smith may be forced to place children with
relatives. But they say that is often better for the child. ``It's
a good thing if the child was coming from a situation where there
was a risk of abuse and neglect,'' said J. Jean Rogers, who
oversees the daily administration of the work program.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Rogers said the demand for kinship care may be driven by
factors other than distress. With welfare gone, the program may be
seen as a new source of easy cash. Ms. Rogers said some mothers may
leave children with relatives, or merely pretend to do so, to
collect the $215 payments. ``We suspect that may be a factor at
play,'' she said. While the home visits are meant to deter such
schemes, Ms. Rogers said social workers do not always screen the
cases with rigor.
</P>
<P>
   In the Smiths' case, the work program clearly brought new
pressures. But their troubles began in a previous age and continued
over decades when they regularly received welfare checks.
Jessielean Smith once grew so incensed at a food-stamp worker in
Chicago _ when she complained of hunger, he advised her to fast _
she left the infant Carmelina in his lap and fled the office. ``I
said, `OK, you feed her,' '' she said. (She returned a half-hour
later.)
</P>
<P>
   The family moved to Milwaukee when Carmelina was 12, and the
elder Ms. Smith raised her four children while moving on and off
the welfare rolls and in and out of work. In Carmelina's case, the
welfare problems started before her first child was born. She
pleaded guilty to defrauding the food stamp program in 1995 after
officials discovered she secretly had a job.
</P>
<P>
   When W-2 began in 1997, she was was once more unemployed. The
new program offered $673 a month for herself and her two children.
But it also demanded at least 30 hours of weekly work at a
community service job. ``I thought I could make more money than
that little bit they were giving me,'' she said. So she refused to
join the work program and lost her check.
</P>
<P>
   But private jobs proved harder than she expected to find and to
keep. And Ms. Smith, then 23, had other problems. Her boyfriend
impregnated one of her neighbors. He hit Ms. Smith in the mouth,
and she stabbed him with a fork. She sought solace in marijuana and
wine. Milk and Pampers grew scarce. Her landlord posted an eviction
notice and she moved back home with her mother. She grew depressed
as friends treated their children to Nikes and Guess jeans, coveted
items beyond her means.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't able to put clothes on their back, the way I should
have,'' Ms. Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the hard times, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
offered her a four-week job at $5.50 an hour, running the
bookstore's cash register during the back-to-school rush. Soon
after, her sister noticed Ms. Smith's mattress no longer lay flat
against the floor. Ms. Smith then lifted it and revealed a pallet
of stolen cash. The two women laughed like lottery winners,
whooped, and threw hundred-dollar bills in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith recalls the moment as a rare time of inner peace. ``It
felt good,'' she said. ``I felt like now I can take care of my kids
the way I want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother grew suspicious when Ms. Smith started treating the
family to spending sprees at the mall. But the bookstore failed to
detect the theft and invited her back the following semester. More
cash disappeared, and this time her supervisor noticed. Confronted
in January 1998, Ms. Smith quickly confessed to stealing
$11,615.10.
</P>
<P>
   Now the elder Ms. Smith has her arthritic hands full. ``Look, I
love my grandchildren, but they're just wild,'' she said. Nakia,
who is nicknamed ``Man-Man'' used a broomstick to knock the fire
detectors off the walls. Na'Quee, who goes by ``Chu-Chu,'' once
delivered a screaming fit that so jangled Ms. Smith's nerves she
tried to muffle her with a pillow. ``I said to myself, `You better
watch it, fool _ you're going to smother that child and go to
jail,' '' she said. ``I can see how they crack and kill kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters of the new system say crises like the Smiths'
are inevitable _ a short-term cost of long-term gain. Welfare gave
drug users and other troubled women a way to ignore their problems,
they say. But they hope a work requirement, in bringing such
problems to light, will ultimately prove a stepping-stone to family
health. Indeed, for her part, Carmelina Smith still predicts a
happy ending to her story. ``My life has changed a lot since I've
been in prison,'' she said. ``I'm very much into Christ now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jessielean Smith is less sanguine and more fatigued _
especially this week after inheriting even more grandchildren. Her
son's girlfriend just went to jail for selling drugs, sending two
more children into Ms. Smith's care. ``I'm fixing to go to the
insane asylum,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In her view, welfare is supposed to be a shock absorber, not a
shock producer. ``This is unfair and unjust,'' for herself and for
the children, she said. ``If Carmelina had been getting public aid,
she wouldn't have stole the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the future, she has only one desire: a long
vacation. She plans to visit Disney World, or maybe Toledo, though
she has never seen either place. ``When Carmelina gets out of jail,
I'm gone,'' she said ``Sayonara!''

<P>
   With the nation's welfare rolls down 43 percent, both President
Clinton and his Republican critics count the landmark 1996 welfare
law as cornerstones of their respective legacies. That law replaced
a 60-year-old cash safety net with a new program of time limits and
work requirements. Now countries from Britain and France to
Australia and New Zealand are considering the overhaul of their own
welfare systems.
</P>
<P>
   But no place has come closer than Wisconsin to the goal of
``ending welfare.'' A decade ago, 100,000 Wisconsin families relied
on public aid. Now 9,000 do.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no single state serves as the perfect policy
microcosm. The Wisconsin experience is captivating not because it
is typical but because it is distinctive in off-setting ways. Jobs
are unusually plentiful, yet the streets of Milwaukee's central
city can be as mean as any in Chicago, 90 miles south, from which
many of its residents have fled.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the new state program of public assistance, Wisconsin
Works or W-2, is both unusually generous and unusually strict. All
recipients are expected to work, with virtually no exceptions. But
the state has also invested heavily in child care, health care and
job-placement services, and it has created thousands of community
service jobs for those unable to find private work.
</P>
<P>
   These dramatic changes continue to reverberate in broad and
unpredictable ways. Throughout the year, The New York Times will
return to Milwaukee to plot the pattern of change.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Isa Hoxha looked out through the cracked
glass of his shop window and gestured toward his Serbian neighbor
who, he said, had hurled a stone through his bakery the week before
last.
</P>
<P>
   Hoxha, an ethnic Albanian in the overwhelmingly Serbian village
of Kosovo Polje, on the outskirts of Kosovo's capital, Pristina,
said he had had no problems until that stone was thrown. As the
deadline neared for agreement on Kosovo's fate, however, the
tension with his Serbian neighbors rose palpably, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is listening to the news, Serbs and Albanians,
waiting to see what will happen,'' Hoxha said. His family is still
living behind the bakery, but he said he was ready to evacuate them
at a moment's notice if the peace talks in France broke up without
agreement and NATO bombed Serbian targets.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every member of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian population _ 90
percent of the estimated 2 million people in this Connecticut-sized
province _ expects the Serbs to retaliate against them if the
alliance strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's Serbs, barely one in 10 of the province's population,
were also nervous. A Serbian shopkeeper across the road from
Hoxha's bakery refused to talk to a Western journalist on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Some 150 Serbs, throwing stones and shouting anti-NATO slogans,
forced nine of the unarmed foreign monitors here to flee the
northern village of Lapastica, said Beatrice Lacoste of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's 1,300 foreign monitors may evacuate on Sunday
if peace talks fail.
</P>
<P>
   An hour's drive southwest of Pristina, in the ethnic Albanian
village of Dragobilje, men were hanging around on a muddy street,
shivering in the damp cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope for the best, but we just do not know if there is
danger ahead for us or not,'' said Rame Paqarizi, a farmer and
father of four.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer the villagers fled into nearby woods when Serbian
security forces attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two miles away is the town of Malisevo, still deserted
and scorched from last year's fighting, occupied by a single
Serbian police unit.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers said the real danger was that if the peace talks
failed, fighting could resume. The armed ethnic Albanian fighters
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who guarded the entrance to the
village, were no match for Serbian tanks and artillery and would
not be able to protect them, said Paqarizi's nephew, Imer.

3 RETIREMENTS CLOUD DEMOCRATS' HOPES IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Nev., Ky., Calif., Wis., Pa., Wash., Mo., Minn., R.I.,
Del.)   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democratic Party's hopes of retaking the Senate
next year may have dimmed a bit with the unexpected retirements
announced last week by two Democrats who almost certainly could
have kept their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Richard Bryan of Nevada
surprised the political world by saying they would not seek
re-election next year. Lautenberg said he was tired of raising
money; Bryan, who has been in politics for more than three decades,
wants to try something else.
</P>
<P>
   They joined Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, as
the only senators so far to announce their exits, creating three
open seats in states that Democrats had counted on in their uphill
fight to recapture the Senate. Republicans control the chamber,
with 55 seats compared with 45 for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been riding a wave of optimism since the November
elections, when they exceeded expectations by winning five House
seats and holding their own in the Senate. They have also been
buoyed by polls showing that the public soured on the Republicans
during their drive to impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were also hoping to make headway in the Senate because
they had fewer seats to defend. Of the 33 senators up for
re-election in 2000, 19 are Republicans and 14 are Democrats. Of
the 19 Republicans, 13 are from states that Clinton won in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who heads the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, said in an interview that the
Democrats have little reason to celebrate now.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Democratic euphoria over impeachment has vanished in a
week,'' McConnell said. ``All this big talk about getting the
Senate has been made dramatically more difficult. Now they're going
to have to fight like hell to hold onto three seats they already
hold.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that trying to save those seats would divert money and
energy from other states where Democrats were hoping to pick off
Republicans who might be vulnerable because they voted to convict
Clinton while polls showed their constituents supported keeping him
in office.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a strong fund-raiser like Hillary Rodham Clinton enters
the race in New York, McConnell said, the Democrats would still
have to send money her way because her presence would prompt big
contributions from Republicans who oppose her.
</P>
<P>
   Prime targets for the Democrats are Republican Sens. Rod Grams
in Minnesota, Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania, Spencer Abraham in
Michigan, John Ashcroft in Missouri and Slade Gorton in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rothenberg, author of a nonpartisan political newsletter
that analyzes races across the country, said the three Democratic
departures marked at least a temporary setback for the party. ``It
makes a five- or six-seat Democratic gain that much harder,'' he
said. ``Democrats didn't have to worry about what was going on
behind their own lines, but now they do.''
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that the Democrats would have to divert money to New
York and New Jersey, two very expensive states, forcing the party
into difficult choices during a presidential election, which
traditionally drains donations away from lower-ballot races.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans historically enjoy a financial edge, and 2000 is
shaping up no differently. Already, the 19 Republicans facing
re-election have raised $6.5 million, according to reports from the
Federal Election Commission, while the 11 Democrats for whom
records were available have raised just $1.8 million. Fund-raising
reports for the three other Democrats were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tucker, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, played down the potential damage from the three
Democratic retirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into '98 knowing we would play defense, and in 2000 we
still have to play defense,'' he said. ``But we've also got
opportunities where we're able to play offense. That gives us some
reason to be encouraged that we are within reach.''
</P>
<P>
   One unknown is whether this month's Democratic retirements will
be balanced out by Republican retirements and whether any more
Democrats will leave.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation centered on Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who has said
only that he will announce his plans at the appropriate time. Other
question marks are hanging over Republican Sens. John Chafee of
Rhode Island, who will be 78 in 2000, and William Roth of Delaware,
who will be 79.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to all these people, which is not to say they've
given me total assurance,'' McConnell said, but he added, ``I don't
believe we'll have any retirements at all.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, there was speculation about Sens.
Herbert Kohl of Wisconsin and Charles Robb of Virginia, although
aides to both said they were preparing for re-election. Another
possible loss for Democrats could be Sen. Dianne Feinstein of
California if Vice President Al Gore wins the Democratic
presidential nomination and chooses her as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Rothenberg said, three or four senators from each
party retire every two years. The numbers have ranged recently from
a low of three senators, all Republicans, who left in 1990 to a
high of 14 (six Republicans and eight Democrats) who left in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He said he could not predict any other retirements because there
appeared to be no common theme among the three departing Democrats.
``All three just want to get on with their lives,'' he said. ``The
Senate is a peculiar kind of occupation that takes 100 percent of
your time. There just happen to be some normal people up this year
who decided they wanted to get a life.''

STUDY EXPOSES ILLEGAL TRAFFIC IN NEW GUNS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   As many as one-third of the guns used in crimes by juveniles and
up to half of those used by people aged 18 to 24 were purchased
within the last three years from federally licensed dealers,
showing that large numbers of new guns are being sold illegally,
according to a report to be released Sunday by the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Although the data are intended to aid law enforcement, the
report is likely to provide new support for the growing number of
cities filing lawsuits against gun manufacturers, charging that the
industry markets its products in ways that make it easy for
criminals and juveniles to obtain guns. Last week, a jury in U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn found 15 firearms makers negligent and
nine of them liable in three shootings, in the first case in which
the gun industry has been found responsible for death or injury
caused by its products. The central issue in the case was negligent
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The new report found that 51 percent of the guns used in crimes
by juveniles and people ages 18 to 24 were acquired by
intermediaries acting on behalf of the real buyer. In addition, 14
percent of the guns used in crimes by juveniles and young people
were sold by private sellers without federal firearms licenses and
10 percent were sold at gun shows, flea markets or through ads in
gun magazines, none of which require buyers to show identification
or undergo background checks.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said the report would disprove
widespread skepticism that there was an illegal market for firearms
used in crimes. In the past, gun makers have argued, with the
support of many law enforcement authorities, that most guns used in
crimes were stolen rather than purchased new or nearly new by
criminals. But the report found that only 35 percent of guns used
in crimes by juveniles and young people were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the second major study by the firearms agency in
the past two years that makes use of newly improved methods for
tracing guns used in crimes. It reports on efforts to trace more
than 76,000 firearms seized in the past year in 27 cities,
including New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these traces, 397 defendants have been referred
for prosecution for gun trafficking in state and federal courts in
the past year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Until President Clinton took office, the firearms agency, under
pressure from the National Rifle Association and Congress, had only
a small program to trace guns used in crimes, and few city police
forces tried to find the sources of illegal guns.
</P>
<P>
   Criminologists believe the intensified effort to trace guns is
one of the factors that has helped drive crime rates down for seven
straight years, though there is no way to quantify its
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that the five guns that moved fastest from
dealers to juveniles and young adults and ended up in crimes were
all semi-automatic pistols: the Lorcin 9 millimeter, the Smith &AMP;
Wesson .40 caliber, the Bryco 9 millimeter, the Hi-Point 9
millimeter and the Glock .40 caliber.
</P>
<P>
   Of the guns confiscated from juveniles and young people, 18
percent had been used in homicides, 18 percent in robberies, 28
percent in assaults and 31 percent in drug offenses, among other
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the investigated cases of trafficking
involved 10 or fewer guns, the report said. But one case involved
1,359 guns sold illegally and another 1,600 guns.
</P>
<P>
   As a typical example of trafficking, the report cited a case in
which the firearms agency traced three guns recovered in New
Jersey, which has strict gun control laws, to a federally licensed
dealer in Cleveland operating under less restrictive Ohio laws. Two
of the guns had been used in homicides; one was in possession of a
juvenile. An investigation found that the dealer had not kept
records of most sales and had not performed background checks of
purchasers as required by law.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, the firearms agency successfully prosecuted a
trafficker and a straw purchaser he hired to buy more than 50
semi-automatic rifles, including assault rifles, which they sold to
drug dealers. In Richmond, Va., a trafficker who was a gang member
used a straw purchaser to buy handguns at gun shows from licensed
dealers for other gang members that were used in homicides. The
trafficker was sentenced to six years in prison.

NEW YORK CITY RETHINKS PLAN TO EXPORT TRASH TO OTHER STATES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATT: Ind., N.J., Ohio, Pa., Va.)   (rk) 
 By   DOUGLAS MARTIN and ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Strong opposition from states slated to receive New
York City's garbage is forcing city officials to rethink their
plans for where New York's trash will be dumped as they prepare to
close the giant Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   With the tentative sites in three states in doubt, the city will
soon ask companies for more proposals on ways _ and places _ to
deal with trash. And for the first time, the city is scouting rural
areas in upstate New York for landfills, a strategy that could
reduce the risk of political attack. Earlier planning had focused
exclusively on out-of-state landfills.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty New York City is having negotiating the politics
of exporting its 13,000 tons of daily residential trash raises
questions about how easily _ or even whether _ it will be able to
meet the state-ordered deadline for closing Fresh Kills by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   When the city agreed to close Fresh Kills, it planned to
establish waste transfer stations throughout the city where garbage
would be taken before being shipped to out-of-state landfills by
private companies. This was seen as a viable option since the city
was already exporting all 13,000 tons a day of commercial trash.
</P>
<P>
   But recently and in rapid succession, the city's plans have been
pounded by officials in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia is about to pass several laws severely limiting garbage
shipment and dumping. Pennsylvania is pushing for a freeze on the
size of its landfills and has doubled its inspections of trash
trucks. State, county and local officials in New Jersey roundly
reject the idea of huge new transfer stations, which the city has
proposed there.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at City Hall and the Sanitation Department insist that
the setbacks and the scrambling for new strategies will not delay
plans for closing Fresh Kills, but others have their doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city's proposals have run into obstacles all over the
place,'' said Jim Tripp, general counsel for the Environmental
Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the mounting uneasiness on Staten Island, Borough
President Guy V. Molinari has questioned whether city Sanitation
Department officials are committed to closing the landfill, and
suggested that some are sabotaging Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's plan.
For one thing, he said, the states through which New York plans to
ship its waste should have been fully consulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some individuals within the Sanitation Department don't want
to see the landfill closed,'' he said, an assertion the department
vigorously rejects.
</P>
<P>
   Under the city's plan, announced in December, three new transfer
stations would handle the city's residential waste: two in Newark
and Carteret, N.J., to be built by private companies, and one at
the Port of Red Hook in Brooklyn. From the transfer stations the
garbage would be taken by truck, rail or barge to landfills in
Virginia, Pennsylvania and other states.
</P>
<P>
   In states that only recently were aggressively enlarging
landfills or building new ones, politicians now grouse that they
resent their states being regarded as dumps.
</P>
<P>
   That resentment intensified recently after after Giuliani said
other states should welcome city trash in return for the New York
cultural attractions their citizens might enjoy. The campaign had
begun last fall when Pennsylvania, Virginia and several other
states began developing common strategies to curtail the influx of
out-of-state trash.
</P>
<P>
   This led to intensified inspections of the hundreds of garbage
trucks traveling on interstate highways, and the placement of
limits on the amount of trash permitted at new landfills or
expanded ones.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery 11 days ago of illegal medical waste from Brooklyn
dumped at a Virginia landfill further aggravated feelings about New
York waste. Virginia, like other states, requires that medical
waste be disposed of at special facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia and other states are cooperating to develop a proposal
for a federal law giving states more control over the waste
crossing their borders. A series of Supreme Court decisions over
the last decade has made it clear that only an act of Congress can
give the states the power to regulate the interstate garbage
business.
</P>
<P>
   The push for federal legislation is ``not an anti-New York
effort,'' said Donald S. Welsh, deputy secretary for state-federal
relations of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection. ``We do not want to build a fence at the border and
choke it off completely,'' he said. ``We just want to put a set of
reasonable restrictions on it.''

</P>
<P>
   The mounting opposition from other states surprised city
officials because New York has exported its commercial waste to
other states, including Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio and Indiana,
for more than a decade. The residential garbage going to Fresh
Kills is being gradually rerouted through this established
commercial system.
</P>
<P>
   City officials would not comment on their search for new
options, saying it must be kept secret under municipal procurement
rules. But they suggested that they might consider proposals
previously rejected, as well as completely new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Local and county officials in New Jersey have opposed building
transfer stations in Carteret and Newark, and Gov. Christie Whitman
has said she would not permit garbage barges to travel past the
state's beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey authorities have so far taken no official action.
But in Virginia, state legislators last week agreed on the outlines
of a law that would ban garbage barges on Virginia's rivers.
</P>
<P>
   New York City had planned to send as much as 4,000 tons of
residential garbage a day by barge from Red Hook to a new barge
pier on the James River in Charles City County, Va. Waste
Management Inc., which handles most of the city's exported waste
and is one of the largest contractors in the field, built the $15
million pier to funnel garbage to one of its landfills.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the city had planned to truck most of its
garbage out of state. For the long term, the city is committed to
using rail and barge transportation, and it is the threat to this
approach that most concerns city officials.
</P>
<P>
   The result could be that what was intended to be the interim
plan becomes permanent, meaning tens of thousands more trucks on
city streets for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the trucks would be piling up at all hours of the day and
night,'' warned Eric Goldstein, a senior attorney for the Natural
Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   States receiving the garbage see their own endless parade of
garbage trucks in similar fashion, particularly in Pennsylvania and
Virginia, No. 1 and No. 2. respectively, in landfill capacity in
the country. Both have a surplus of dump space and have for years
imported millions of tons of commercial garbage and construction
debris from New York City and New York state.
</P>
<P>
   There were few complaints, even when the city started sending
residential garbage from the Bronx in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But 1997 was also the first year that Virginia began compiling
an annual tally of garbage imports. When the numbers were totaled,
local newspapers made much of the fact that the state was the
nation's second-biggest trash importer.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Giuliani's comments about the obligations of Virginia
and other states to accommodate the trash of the nation's leading
city, which inflamed passions and prompted renewed calls from
Virginia politicians for federal legislation allowing states to ban
imports of garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The grand finale was the medical waste discovered mingled with
Brooklyn garbage on Feb. 10 at a Virginia landfill in Charles City
County, the third day of a blitz of inspections across eight states
and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in the Virginia Capitol, Gov. James S.
Gilmore III, wearing rubber gloves, displayed the used syringes,
bandages and other material, vowing to seek $500,000 in fines
against Waste Management and push for stronger laws to control
medical waste.

   RAMBOUILLET, France _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
negotiated intensely on Saturday, hours past deadline, to try and
achieve peace in Kosovo, spelling out to the leaders of Serbia that
they must accept deployment of up to 30,000 NATO troops, including
a small contingent of American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and four European foreign ministers arrived Saturday
morning at the 14th-century castle where ethnic Albanian and
Serbian delegates have been sequestered for two weeks, and tried to
squeeze an accord out of them.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after a NATO-appointed deadline of noon (6 a.m. Eastern
time), the biggest sticking point remained the demand that NATO
troops enforce a settlement in Kosovo, a province of southern
Serbia that has been roiled by conflict for the last year. About
2,000 people are thought to have been killed, and as many as
200,000 driven from their homes by fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and NATO have said airstrikes against
Serbian military targets would commence if the president of
Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, did not back down and accept
foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
   But although more than 400 NATO strike and support planes
remained at the ready, there was little talk at the castle on
Saturday of airstrikes, and greater concentration on working out
details of making NATO soldiers acceptable to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   More than two hours after the deadline, Albright's spokesman,
James Rubin, said the secretary had just completed a half-hour
face-to-face session with Milan Milutinovic, the president of
Serbia and Milosevic's close ally. The man with the biggest
decision-making power, Milosevic, remained in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
But it appeared clear that he had authorized Milutinovic to
negotiate seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has insisted so far that NATO troops in Kosovo would
represent an infringement of the sovereignty of Serbia and
Yugoslavia, the federation of which Serbia is a part, along with
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, which was stripped of its autonomy 10 years ago by
Milosevic, is a province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   By the noon deadline, Albright had hoped to have the ethnic
Albanian delegation sign the political text of the peace agreement,
which calls for autonomy for Kosovo over a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no announcement of this, and the ethnic Albanians
have said they were upset about the addition of an upper house to a
proposed legislature. ``If everything was great, we'd tell you; if
it was terrible, we'd tell you that,'' Rubin said to reporters
after the deadline passed.
</P>
<P>
   No decision had been made, he said, on whether to extend the
talks formally, or whether to let the deadline informally slide.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 ambassadors of NATO were scheduled to meet in Brussels,
Belgium, to review the status of the talks. The NATO
secretary-general, Javier Solana, was empowered by the 16 member
nations two weeks ago to order airstrikes if the Serbs failed to go
along with an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Solana said he would consult NATO members before ordering
any bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent attempt to water down the NATO deployment,
Milutinovic raised the prospect on Friday night of using armed
civilians working under the auspices of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe as a substitute for alliance
troops keeping the Kosovo peace, Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO was extremely unlikely to accept such a proposal, it
was the first sign that the Serbs might eventually accept armed
foreigners on their territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs are also not pleased that they would be required under
any settlement to make dramatic reductions in their security forces
in Kosovo _ for the police, who have been blamed for massacres of
ethnic Albanian civilians, and for the Yugoslav army, which patrols
the borders with Albania and Macedonia. Ethnic Albanian guerrillas
have received weapons mostly across the porous, mountainous
frontier with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army are
required under the proposed pact to disarm over a period of six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The high-stakes drive to reach an accord in Kosovo began after
the massacre of 45 ethnic Albanian civilians by the Serbian
security police last month in the village of Racak.
</P>
<P>
   The killings, apparently the worst of the massacres that have
marked the yearlong conflict, dramatized what many had known: that
the hatred between the two ethnic groups in Kosovo was
irretrievably deep. Unlike other parts of former Yugoslavia, where
different ethnic groups spoke the same language and intermarried,
there is little intermingling between the ethnic Albanians and the
Serbs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the two ethnic groups deteriorated further
when Milosevic revoked the autonomy of Kosovo in 1989, swept
Albanians from all important posts and introduced a repressive
Serbian police and military regime in the province.
</P>
<P>
   The Racak massacre also illustrated that both sides in the
conflict were rearming for renewed hostilities in the spring. In
the last month, international monitors in Kosovo have reported
seeing fighters of the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army
carrying new, highly sophisticated sniper rifles as well as other
new weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian police and Yugoslav army increased the numbers of
their units in violation of a cease-fire agreement worked out in
October by the Clinton administration's special envoy, Richard
Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   With the danger of an unchecked conflict in Kosovo spoiling the
celebrations in Washington in April for the 50th anniversary of
NATO, the administration moved quickly in late January to forge a
combination of diplomacy and military force that would convince
both sides to sign a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Albright urged the Contact Group _ which includes the United
States, France, Germany, Britain, Italy and Russia _ to run the
diplomatic negotiations that have taken place at Rambouillet.
During her visit to Moscow in late January, the Russians made clear
they were ready to work toward a solution in Kosovo and signaled
that they were ready to distance themselves from their traditional
allies, the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO, the administration fought hard to get the 16 alliance
members to give Solana the authority to order airstrikes against
Serbia if peace talks failed. It also moved, but with less
appetite, to have Americans included in a NATO-led ground force
that would enforce any political settlement emerging from the
Rambouillet talks.
</P>
<P>
   The point of a political agreement is to grant the province
self-government status within Yugoslavia, giving the ethnic
Albanians who make up 90 percent of the population the control over
their daily lives that has been denied by the Serbian authorities.
The question of Kosovo's future independence _ the rallying cry of
the insurgents _ would be deferred for three years.

</P>
<P>
   For the administration, the toughest part has been making the
case for a second deployment of U.S. troops to the Balkans in less
than four years.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary of Defense Walter Slocombe told a congressional
hearing that regional stability was at stake in the southern
Balkans, where a continued war in Kosovo could spill over into
neighboring Albania and Macedonia, and possibly envelop two NATO
partners, Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The peace in Bosnia, where U.S. troops remain stationed, was
also on the line, Slocombe said, as well as the performance of
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the U.S. troop commitment on Feb. 13, President
Clinton stressed that this time _ in contrast to Bosnia _ the
Europeans would be providing the bulk of the NATO force. The U.S.
offer of 4,000 troops was only 15 percent of the deployment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 Marines from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit
based at Camp Lejeune, N.C., were poised this weekend on ships in
the Mediterranean to be among the first troops to land in Kosovo in
the event of a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding to allow Europe to do most of the work in Kosovo,
the administration is trying to ensure that it does not lose its
leverage. It is a new and at times seemingly uncomfortable
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington doesn't want to pay the bills but doesn't like
being the junior partner,'' said a NATO official of the military
plans for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, whose countries are most concerned about
waves of impoverished ethnic Albanian refugees flooding into
Western Europe if the fighting continues, has pledged hundreds of
millions of dollars in civil reconstruction money for Kosovo over
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The diminished role of U.S. troops will mean that a British
general will be the commander on the ground in Kosovo for the first
months of the peacekeeping operation. Thus, U.S. soldiers will have
to get accustomed to a non-American commander on the ground under
the authority of an American, Gen. Wesley Clark, who is the supreme
commander of NATO.

ALABAMA TOWN PREPARES FOR SCALING DOWN OF GOODYEAR PLANT

<P>
   GADSDEN, Ala. _ It was 70 years ago this summer that Goodyear
first decided to come south out of Ohio, looking for workers eager
to mold rubber into tires for low wages, and the vast plateau of a
factory the company built here eventually became one of the largest
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a critical moment in the economic recovery of
the South.
</P>
<P>
   But the plant's wages are not low anymore, and now, tens of
millions of tires later, the never-ending search for greater
efficiency has finally left northeastern Alabama behind.
</P>
<P>
   This month, in a move attributed in part to the Asian and Latin
American economic crises, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.
announced that it would cease making tires at what it called its
``inefficient'' Gadsden plant, leaving only a small rubber-making
operation and wiping out more than 1,300 jobs. When the final tire
rolls out of the immense factory later this year, this city will
face a cloudy future _ one for which it has spent more than a
decade worrying and planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, the sun used to rise and set on
Goodyear and on the steel plant, but everyone knew we were living
on borrowed time,'' said Cathy Back, manager of Downtown Gadsden
Inc., the economic development group for the central business
district, referring to the city's Gulf States Steel plant. ``It's
no relief, but at least now it's better than being in limbo. We can
finally start to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   As imposing as the Goodyear plant looked from the outside _ 63
acres of sturdy brick buildings put up over the years around a
grand old-fashioned clock tower _ most people in the region
understood that it was slowly suffocating within.
</P>
<P>
   From its post-war height of 4,000 jobs in 1945, invigorating a
quarter of the state, employment at the plant had fallen to 1,550
workers, and employees could tell that the company was not making
the kinds of high-tech investments necessary to keep the factory
efficient and competitive. Under great pressure earlier in the
decade, unionized workers agreed to a host of concessions to save
their jobs, an agreement that federal officials hailed as a model
of labor-management cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   With the future of the steel plant also in doubt, local
officials became concerned in the 1980s that this city of 43,000
people could be headed downward amid the national prosperity, a
loser on the roulette wheel of global competition.
</P>
<P>
   The city was too dependent on two large, aging industries,
officials decided, and they desperately began trying to diversify
its economy before one or both big factories went under. Now
Gadsden faces its largest test of all that advance planning, and
the outcome will say much about how the smaller, rusting
manufacturing zones of the South will be able to cope now that the
textile, steel and rubber dinosaurs are dying off.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every trick in the modern city's play book has been put
into place in preparation for this day. A countywide industrial
development agency was created to lure expanding businesses with
tax incentives. Several junior colleges and technical schools were
combined to form a regional community college to turn out trained
workers for employers, and an advanced technical manufacturing
center was opened to assist companies eager to modernize.
</P>
<P>
   High schools dropped their old vocational and general education
programs, and required students to choose between paths toward
either college or technical programs. The city's downtown merchants
spent millions trying to improve the look of the aging central
business district.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as this hurts, I'm convinced that the psychological
impact will be greater than the economic impact,'' said Mike
McCain, executive director of the Gadsden-Etowah County Industrial
Development Authority, who is in charge of the region's economic
recovery. ``We will recover from this.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted that the area's unemployment rate was now 4.5
percent, one-third of what it was 15 years ago when the plant
employed 3,500 people. In the last year, he said, local companies
have announced plans to create 1,000 jobs in industries like metal
stamping and electrical controls, and he predicted that the
laid-off Goodyear workers would be able to find work after
retraining.
</P>
<P>
   Economists praised Gadsden leaders for working to cushion the
inevitable blow, but said the kinds of jobs being lost at the
Goodyear plant could not be offset in the short term. Cities that
prospered in the 1950s with manufacturing plants that are now
obsolete may have to wait their turn in hopes that the global
economy recovers, the economists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many pockets like this around the South, the residue
of an era that has now passed,'' said J. Barry Mason, dean of the
Culverhouse College of Commerce at the University of Alabama, in
Tuscaloosa. ``They have been masked somewhat by the country's
tremendous prosperity, but now they are going to have to take a
hard look at their natural resources and decide what kinds of
projects they can hope to attract in four or five years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many people in the region do not share McCain's iron
confidence. Plant workers scoff at the notion that they can easily
be retrained for other industries, pointing out that most of the
newly created jobs are not unionized and pay far less than
Goodyear's $18-an-hour jobs, with their generous benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bring jobs to the area, but what type of jobs are you
bringing?'' asked Jimmy Butler, 45, who has made tires at the plant
since he was 20 and who also serves as mayor of the nearby small
town of Sand Rock. ``These are not high-paying jobs coming in.
We're going to lose tax revenue and people are going to move out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Williams, president of Local 12 of the United
Steelworkers of America, which represents workers at the factory,
said he expected several hundred of the laid-off employees would
move to Goodyear plants in Union City, Tenn., and Danville, Va.,
where they have preferential hiring rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to devastate the whole county,'' Williams said.
``You have third and fourth generations working in that plant,
mostly people in their upper 40s, and they're either going to have
to move out of town or take something that pays a lot less. People
don't know what they're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The virtual closing of the plant is part of what Goodyear calls
a ``manufacturing rationalization'' that will eventually result in
the layoffs of 2,500 to 2,800 employees around the world and save
the company as much as $150 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Workers here were particularly angry that the concessions they
had made, including lower wages and longer workdays, had only
bought them a few years of extra employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it just postponed the inevitable,'' said Jimmy
Chapman, 43, a machine operator at the plant from nearby Altoona,
who said he would be unable to relocate. ``We earned our stake in
this thing, and it looks like we're just going to be hung out to
dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear workers have long been among the best-paid residents of
the region, and there has been some resentment expressed among
other local residents that state officials, including Gov. Don
Siegelman, have rushed to Gadsden to announce expedited
unemployment insurance and other benefits for them.
</P>
<P>
   But their liberal health insurance plans helped foster several
hospitals and medical practices, and the loss of their wages will
rumble through the economy. Mayor Steve Means estimated the city
would lose $2 million in tax revenue, more than 5 percent of its
annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope for Gadsden and similar small cities is that many
manufacturers are growing weary of the sprawl and transportation
slowdowns in major cities like Atlanta, said Dr. Mason of the
University of Alabama. Eventually, Gadsden might be able to attract
one of the new automobile plants or an advanced steel mill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gadsden's advantage is that its livability is high, it's on an
interstate highway, and its work force has been prepared,'' he
said. ``The cities of the south have always shown a great deal of
resilience in making the most of what they have.''

PANEL TRIES TO GET CLEARER PICTURE OF 1921 RACE RIOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. _ Nearly 78 years after one of the deadliest racial
confrontations in the nation's history, a multiracial commission of
citizens and historians is trying to determine how many people
really were killed in the Tulsa race riot and whether survivors are
entitled to reparations.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-member Tulsa Race Riot Commission, created by the
Oklahoma Legislature in 1997, is even looking for mass graves where
the bodies of dozens of blacks who may have been killed in the riot
on June 1, 1921, were dumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were suspicious of the official figures of the time,'' said
Bob Blackburn, chairman of the commission and deputy executive
director of the Oklahoma Historical Society. ``We also wanted to
come up with a portrait of what north Tulsa looked like before the
riot.''
</P>
<P>
   The exact number of people killed in the riot, which destroyed a
30-square-block area of north Tulsa known as Greenwood, a primarily
black neighborhood, was never determined. Newspaper accounts at the
time varied, with some reporting as many as 76 dead. But some
historians, citing survivors' accounts, have put the figure as high
as 300.
</P>
<P>
   The riot was touched off after a black shoeshine man was
arrested after a white girl said he tried to assault her in an
elevator. The man was eventually cleared and all charges were
dropped, but not before a mob of armed white men showed up at the
Tulsa County Courthouse threatening a lynching.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted the city's black residents to take up arms and
head for the jail. A scuffle led to gunfire, and firebombings and
shootings went on for a day before the Oklahoma National Guard
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Using old census records, mortgage notes, city directories,
building permits and other official documents, the commission is
developing a data base to try to reconstruct north Tulsa on paper
and determine who owned the bombed property and what it was worth.
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn said the commission had found that many more whites
owned property in north Tulsa than was initially thought. And, like
their black counterparts, they received no compensation after their
property was destroyed. Still, the commission's most controversial
work has been in trying to provide a more accurate death toll.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has hired archaeologists and forensic
pathologists to assist in the search for mass graves. Radar was
used to search for mass graves in some cemeteries in the area last
July, but none were found.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ellsworth, a former historian at the Smithsonian
Institution and author of ``Death in a Promised Land: The Tulsa
Race Riot of 1921,'' is one of the advisers to the commission. The
historian John Hope Franklin, whose father lost his home in the
riot, is also an adviser to the commission. Franklin last year
headed the advisory board to the President's Initiative on Race.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth said the commission examined records from a defunct
funeral home showing that the city was billed for the burial of 30
people who died in the riot and who had not been identified
previously as riot victims.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that while searching a city-owned cemetery for mass
graves, the commission found two headstones with no names on them
dated June 1, 1921. He said the commission thought these graves to
be those of previously unidentified riot victims, most likely
black.
</P>
<P>
   And there were numerous accounts of bodies being dumped into the
Arkansas River, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may well be the worst incident of racial violence in
American history,'' Ellsworth said of the Tulsa riot. He said it
was quite likely that at least 300 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the death toll, the commission hopes to answer a
number of other questions, many of them grounded in local lore.
Blacks here have long maintained that whites used airplanes to bomb
homes, churches and businesses in north Tulsa. The commission hopes
to find records showing whether any Tulsa residents owned airplanes
in 1921, and where they were based.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission's hardest job probably is still to come: how
to determine who is eligible for reparations and what those
reparations should be. Since the beginning, many blacks have
accused the city authorities of turning a blind eye to the
destruction, and the National Guard of stepping in too late. Some
say that if that is found to be true, the city and the state may be
held accountable for damages.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is financed through a $50,000 grant from the
Oklahoma Historical Society; the money is being used to pay the
expenses of experts and advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the commission thought at first that only a handful of
riot survivors were still living, it now says that more than 30
could be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Where the money for potential reparations would come from is ``a
good question,'' Blackburn said, adding that the commission has not
decided what form of reparations it will recommend when its
findings are made public. A preliminary report could come as early
as May.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The group could recommend that reparations consist of an apology
from the city and the state, scholarship funds for black students
or even a monument in Greenwood, Blackburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn says he realizes that it will be difficult to put to
rest decades of speculation over the riot, storytelling fueled by a
long and deep silence on the part of whites in Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Kinney Booker says he hopes the commission's work will get to
the bottom of what happened here in 1921. Booker, now 85, was 8
years old when the riot occurred, and he remembers hiding in an
attic with his mother and four siblings as white men set the
family's house on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Although they escaped, Booker's family lost its home and
possessions, and was never compensated.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I hated all white people,'' he said, adding that his
view changed when a white businessman took his family in after the
riot.
</P>
<P>
   Booker, too, has heard the stories about mass graves and bodies
dumped in the river. ``I think there's some truth to that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission could be most useful in educating the public
about the riot, he said, noting that many Oklahomans know little or
nothing about the outbreak of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Booker said he also liked the idea of reparations, even if it
was just a monument on Greenwood Avenue. ``That would be better
than nothing,'' he said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moderately heavy snows will fall in the Rockies on Sunday as a
tandem of Pacific disturbances advance inland. Bursts of snow, a
few accompanied by thunder and lightning, will strafe the mountains
of northern Utah and northern Nevada as a potent jet-stream
disturbance approaches from the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the valleys, rain showers will change to snow showers
as a pocket of cold air arrives overhead. Snow will spread to the
mountains of western Colorado and southwest Wyoming later Sunday.
In the wake of the disturbance, snow showers and flurries will
linger in the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will accumulate from the Cascades of Washington and Oregon
to the Bitterroots of Montana and Idaho and the Tetons of northwest
Wyoming as an upper-level low-pressure system pivots slowly east
over the region. Snow may accumulate in the valleys, with storm
totals of 4 inches possible in spots by later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the upper-level low, gusty showers, a few with
thunder and small hail, will speckle western Oregon, western
Washington and the coast and interior valleys of northern
California early in the day. Intervals of sunshine with puffy
cumulus will develop in some areas of Oregon and northern
California on Sunday afternoon as a ridge of high pressure
approaches from the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered snow showers will develop along southwest shores of
the Great Lakes, where chilly winds from the northeast have been
moistened in transit over open waters. Flurries and snow showers
will dust some of the mountains in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Rare Cacophony
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for snow to mix with rain, but it is rare for
heavy rain and heavy snow to occur simultaneously. At Charlotte,
N.C., on Friday, while lightning flashed and thunder echoed
overhead, heavy rain and heavy snow were observed at the same time.
With temperatures a few thousand feet aloft hovering near 32
degrees, air rising within thunderstorms cooled, allowing
snowflakes to avoid melting on descent toward the ground. But the
variable cooling from changeable updrafts also permitted some
snowflakes to melt, setting the stage for a cacophony of heavy rain
and snow.

   ONLINE-PRIVACY _ WASHINGTON _ ``You're kidding!'' my wife
exclaimed. I had just told her that someone had gained access to
our private bank records, lifted our account number and recorded
our balance. She listened in stunned silence. There was more. They
had also tracked our recent long-distance calls, identifying those
we had telephoned by name, address and occupation. And they had
compiled dossiers on us, complete with Social Security numbers,
property holdings and financial dealings. ``That's incredible,''
she said. ``How can they do that?'' Easily, it turns out, in the
computer age. (Alexander, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   w/ONLINE-SLEUTH _ WASHINGTON _ Many private detectives use
``pretexts'' to fool banks into releasing a customer's confidential
financial data. Al Schweitzer, an investigator who once pleaded
guilty to illegally obtaining Social Security numbers, told the
House Banking Committee last year how he used ``gags'' to get
information. (Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE-LAWS _ WASHINGTON _ At first glance, a pending House bill
seems to be on the side of the angels: it would make it a federal
crime for anyone to fraudulently obtain information about your
account from a bank. But Dana LeJune, a Houston attorney, says that
in order to find where debtors are hiding their money, it is
sometimes necessary to trick banks into revealing if a deadbeat has
an account. (Jaspin, Cox News Service).

<P>
   TAX-CUT _ WASHINGTON _ Prospects appear good for a federal tax
cut this year, but it may not be the 10 percent across-the-board
income tax cut favored by some congressional leaders. Instead,
Democrats and many Republicans appear to favor tax cuts targeted to
specific groups they find deserving, such as married couples or
families needing home health care. The sentiment is fueled by polls
showing few Americans favor the broader cuts. (Mollison, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-THEN&AMP;NOW _ WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush is a man who has
played opposite roles on the national scene. As the son of a
president under fire, he became the ardent and sometimes angry
defender of his father and the adviser deputized for the tough
jobs. Now as the popular Texas governor, he is seen as the cheerful
optimist. Who's the real George W.? (Malone/Herman, Cox News

   DEMS-2000 _ Dick Gephardt wants to be speaker of the House come
Jan. 2001, and Democrats need a gain of just six seats in the next
election to make it happen. Two Georgia seats, held by Republicans
Saxby Chambliss and Charlie Norwood, are crucial to the Democrats'
quest. Gephardt, Patrick Kennedy, John Lewis and others will be in
Atlanta Monday to raise money for those and other campaigns. Of
course, Democrats were whistling the same tune two years ago, but
could not recruit top-flight challengers. They say 2000 will be
different. (Sherman, Cox News Service).

   MARSHLAND _ HOUMA, La. _ Deep in Cajun country between New
Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico, a waterworld of marsh and swamp is
Michael St. Martin's ''2,400-acre hobby.'' He has roamed it since
he was a child, built his estate next to it in the 1980s, and
finally bought it in 1992. It looks pristine and almost
prehistoric: Alligator eyes poke out of the water every few
minutes, ducks fly overhead by the thousands, coots fly in black
masses and rest like carpets on the surface of the water, and huge
swamp rats called nutria dart between the hanging moss and the
gnarled trunks of cypress trees. Swamp maples are in bloom and look
like pink torches against the deep greens, grays and browns of
winter. And when St. Martin's found damage to that land, he sued
two oil companies that had leased drilling rights. The precedent
could lead to hundreds of other lawsuits and cost oil companies
millions to repair past damage. (Konigsmark, Atlanta

   TURKEY-KURDS _ ANKARA, Turkey _ Kurds climbing on roofs, taking
hostages, tussling with the police, setting themselves ablaze and
occupying embassies in a dozen countries across Europe this week
threw an unusually bright spotlight on this nation of people
without a state. Who are these people that have come blazing into
American living rooms the last few days? How can such a diaspora of
people be organized enough to mount simultaneous demonstrations in
different cities, yet factionalized enough not to agree on how to
go about building their own nation-state? What is the nature of
their relationship with the United States? Developing. (Holmes, Cox
News Service). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-POLITICS _ ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ With its rough
democracy and market economy, Russia is often compared to the Wild
West. If so, reformer Galina Starovoitova was widely viewed as one
of the white hats. The St. Petersburg legislator was gunned down
last November in what appeared to be a political assassination.
Then, she was viewed by her allies as a respectable martyr whose
death would surely inspire some essential changes to Russia's
faulty experiment with democracy. But three months later, her death
is almost an after-thought. There are no dead martyrs in today's
Russia, just as there are no living heroes. That's unfortunate in a
country with a broken economy, and the election of a new parliament
and president scheduled to take place in the next 18 months.

   CAMBODIA-ROYAL _ PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Only a few monarchs left
in the world really matter. And not one has mattered for longer
than King Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's master of dramatic intrigue
for the last 58 years. In the 1940s, Sihanouk acted the playboy
king with scores of mistresses, the self-described ``randy
rabbit.'' In the fifties, he became the father of Cambodian
independence from France and the slippery Cold War neutralist. In
the sixties, he occupied himself as the absolute ruler who doubled
as a film maker. In the seventies, he became the figurehead of the
genocidal Khmer Rouge guerrillas and then the Khmer Rouge's gilded
prisoner. Twenty years ago, when Sihanouk was an exiled prince with
slim prospects of reclaiming his country, he was told by Henry
Kissinger that he was as good an actor as Lawrence Olivier. Now
Sihanouk is back on the throne, playing the most improbable role of
his checkered career. (Kunstel-Albright, Cox News Service). MOVED.

Iraq and Turkey in the days immediately after Desert Storm. ``We
are in daily combat with Iraqi defenses over no-fly zones that we
established for reasons that included protecting Kurds from Saddam
Hussein's attacks and now the Kurds are attacking the embassies of
our NATO allies and others because a Kurdish leader, who many
identify as a terrorist the like of Osama bin Laden, has been
jailed in Turkey, which Saddam Hussein now says may be targeted by
Iraqi missiles because our planes take off from Turkey and bomb
Iraqi defenses in the zones in which we are protecting Kurds.''

ECONOMIC POWERS AGREE ON A MODEST APPROACH TO PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ Deeply divided about the best way to tame
violent swings in world financial markets, finance ministers from
the world's biggest industrial nations agreed here Saturday to
create a modest forum to consult on the problem more closely.
</P>
<P>
   Adopted by finance officials of the Group of Seven industrial
nations, the plan is notable more for what it would not do than
what it would.
</P>
<P>
   In a flat rebuttal to demands by German and French political
leaders for a broad new ``architecture'' or ``highway code'' for
world markets, the plan would merely establish a new forum for top
regulators that would meet twice a year to consult and look for
ways to improve the quality of financial information.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end there cannot be a world authority that regulates
all of this,'' said Hans Tietmeyer, president of Germany's central
bank and author of the proposal. ``The only way is to get existing
organizations to work together better and more regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   But the so-called financial stability forum amounts to the
lowest common denominator of agreement between the United States,
Europe and Japan. The real battles here Saturday were about much
more ambitious proposals to smooth out swings in exchange rates and
to reduce the mercurial movements of international hedge funds,
which some leaders say have contributed to the financial meltdowns
in Asia, Russia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   And on those proposals, there were no signs of agreement as
finance ministers and central bankers began their talks this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's new Social Democratic finance minister, Oskar
Lafontaine, came here Saturday to drum up support for some sort of
agreement to coordinate exchange rates between the United States,
Europe and Japan. France's finance minister, Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, was expected to push for what President Jacques
Chirac has called a ``highway code'' to exert tighter control over
international hedge funds and perhaps exchange rates as well.
</P>
<P>
   But both the United States and Europe's own central bankers, who
are far more orthodox on financial issues than European political
leaders, are adamantly against grander plans for intervening in
financial markets. Without American support, experts and government
officials agree, the ideas were essentially dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's meeting occurred against a backdrop of growing
economic gloom in Europe and continuing anxiety about Japan.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most sensitive issues under discussion was whether
the finance ministers should issue a statement of support for the
Japanese yen. If the yen is allowed to remain at its relatively
weak current value, about 120 to the dollar, it would boost
Japanese exports by making them cheaper in foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   But that would aggravate one of the biggest problems faced by
the United States, its ballooning trade deficit with the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   European finance ministers, meanwhile, are increasingly alarmed
about slowing growth in their region. The euro, the new single
currency adopted by 11 countries on Jan. 1, has fallen steadily
from its inception and reached a new low on Friday against the
dollar _ $1.10 versus its starting position of $1.17 just six weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Bundesbank reported that German's economy
actually contracted by four-tenths of 1 percent in the last quarter
of 1998, primarily because of a sharp decline in exports to Asia
and Latin America. Business confidence also slumped, according to a
survey by Germany's IFO Institute released on Friday.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shortly before leaving Washington to attend the meeting
Saturday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin began warning that
the United States could no longer be the world's only major
importer and that European and Japanese leaders needed to do more
to jump-start their own economies.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, that makes Rubin an indirect ally of Lafontaine ,
who has also campaigned loudly for the European Central Bank to
lower interest rates, pump more money into the economy and
stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, has
fired back by criticizing Germany and France for not doing enough
to deregulate their economies and remove ``structural'' barriers to
business. The central bank refused to lower interest rates last
week, and experts doubt it will do so for at least another few
months.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of agreement about monetary policy or exchange
rates, officials seem poised to agree on Tietmeyer's proposal for a
``financial stability forum,'' which was drawn up in response to a
plunge in world markets last summer after Russia essentially
defaulted on its foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central idea is that existing institutions and
organizations work together and that is why I am proposing the
establishment of a worldwide stability forum,'' Tietmeyer said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The forum would examine the extent to which existing rules on
disclosure of information and minimum standards were being met, the
head of the German central bank said.

GREEK ORTHODOX LEADER IN U.S. FACES CALLS FOR HIS REMOVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio., Pa., W.Va., Mass.)  (bl)  
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 54-year-old Archbishop Spyridon was enthroned as the leader
of the Greek Orthodox archdiocese in the United States in 1996, he
was widely regarded as a visionary who would lead his flock into
the 21st century, with new ideas firmly woven into the fabric of
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three years later, the archbishop is viewed with
bitterness, disappointment and suspicion by some members of both
the clergy and laity of his denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Demands made to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of
Constantinople in Istanbul, Turkey, that he replace Archbishop
Spyridon have grown more insistent, and there is increasingly
frequent discussion of autocephaly, or the creation of an
autonomous American Orthodox church, independent of the mother
church in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Even the five American metropolitans, senior bishops who preside
over large dioceses and who are next in rank to Archbishop
Spyridon, have petitioned Patriarch Bartholomew, who has direct
authority over the Greek Orthodox Church in the Western Hemisphere,
for the removal of the archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the debate is an issue that faces many denominations
caught between the pull of the Old World and the new.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an immigrant church that has come of age, but its
leaders still refer to us as the diaspora, hoping that maybe
someday we'll return to Greece,'' said Dean Popps, a
satellite-communications executive and a founding member of a
dissident organization, Greek Orthodox American Leaders, or GOAL.
``It is a cultural battle, a failure of the eastern Turkish culture
from which the patriarch comes to understand the American
experience of the Greek Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop's supporters maintain that the seriousness of the
divisions is greatly exaggerated and that the breach can be healed
as Archbishop Spyridon adjusts to American ways of making
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference in Athens on Monday at the end of
his first official visit to Greece, the archbishop denied that he
faced serious opposition. Challenging reporters to judge for
themselves, he said: ``Come to America, follow us on tour, and see
if there is a trace of this problem. If you can find a problem,
then I will resign.''
</P>
<P>
   While Archbishop Spyridon's critics applauded the offer, the
Rev. Mark Arey, the spokesman for the archdiocese, said that was
``purely a rhetorical comment'' and emphasized that the archbishop
had no intention of resigning.
</P>
<P>
   Still there is little doubt that the church is in serious
turmoil, with accusations involving everything from internal
politics to financial impropriety to personality clashes that have
led several churches to withhold funds and have pitted the
archdiocese against the laity in two lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Matters came to a head in January when the five metropolitans
went to Istanbul to take the patriarch the scathing report
``Concerning the Disorderly State of Affairs in the Archdiocese of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   They wrote: ``The archdiocese is presently suffocating in an
atmosphere of fear, suspicion, insecurity, lack of trust and
vindictiveness. The majority of the clergy and laity have lost
their trust in their ecclesiastical leadership, which during the
last two and a half years has not be able to create and promote new
visions and new dreams for the future.'' Their conclusion: replace
the archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Bartholomew and members of his Synod of Bishops told
them to go home and learn to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Maximos, the metropolitan in charge of
Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, said: ``Everything changes,
so I am taking this with a grain of salt. For today it is
convenient; tomorrow things may change. The mother church has the
whole picture and we expect it to do what is appropriate. They gave
instructions to Spyridon. Now we expect him to deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   The stage for the report and for the organization of GOAL was
set at Hellenic College and its Holy Cross School of Theology in
Brookline, Mass., 11 months after the archbishop's elevation.
</P>
<P>
   A theology student there accused a visiting priest of making a
homosexual advance at a party. In response, the president of the
college, the Rev. Alkividias Calivas, formed a committee to
investigate the incident, and it recommended expulsion of the
priest. Shortly after, Calivas and the dean and librarian, were
demoted, and two members of the faculty were removed from the
classroom for parish assignments.
</P>
<P>
   That the changes were made shortly after the party incident was
merely an unfortunate coincidence of timing, said Arey, the
archdiocese spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But many people associated with the college saw it differently.
``The archbishop got rid of the best theologians we had and since
then, because of the upheaval and continued oppressive environment
at the school, additional faculty have left,'' said Valerie Karras,
who was assistant director of institutional planning and has since
left the college.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of a complaint Ms. Karras made, the accreditations
of the college and seminary are under review.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Very Rev. George Passias, chancellor of the
archdiocese, the Archbishop had been bombarded with requests to
make changes at the college long before his arrival here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a Spyridon problem, but how he acted was,'' Passias
said. ``He chose to make a European unilateral authoritative
decision to reassign the priests. There is no doubt that the
situation could have been handled in a better way, but in all
fairness, he did what he felt he had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the archbishop has also been under fire for the
reassignment of other respected figures in the church, among them
the popular Rev. Dr. Robert Stephanopoulos, dean of the
Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Though Stephanopoulos was given new duties planning ministries
to address social problems, he lost most of the responsibility he
held for administration and liturgical operations of the cathedral
to the Very Rev. Gabriel Karambis, vicar of the cathedral. The move
was widely considered to be a punishment for his having signed a
letter critical of the archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his new position, Stephanopoulos, whose son is
George, the former presidential adviser, said: ``My title as dean
is the same, but I will do whatever needs to be done as directed by
Father Gabriel. I am not happy about it, but we have to accept
things that come down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the battleground, the archbishop's supporters and
critics agree that he is still in the process of adjusting from a
rigidly European hierarchical system to a more open American one.
</P>
<P>
   Some people believe that the bitter divisions serve as an
impetus for independence from Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuing support of Spyridon and the blind eye turned
toward the concerns and protests of the laity, the parish clergy
and the entire Synod of Bishops is simply strengthening that
movement every day,'' Ms. Karras said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he blamed unwarranted gossip for the unrest, Arey said:
``When you are on a ship at sea, you realize that you can have only
one hand on the rudder. He is our captain and we don't want anyone
to jump overboard.''

NO TIME TO ORGANIZE THE SURF, UNION LEADERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., Nev.)  (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ The labor leaders gathered here for the
AFL-CIO's winter meeting last week seemed haunted by one image:
those embarrassing pictures from years past of big-bellied union
potentates, cigars in mouths, sunning themselves by the hotel pool.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's strategic thinkers were so alarmed by this image that
three years ago they announced they would halt the decades-old
practice of meeting each winter in exclusive Bal Harbour, just up
the road from here. John Sweeney, who was elected president of the
AFL-CIO two and a half years ago, knew it looked bad to use
members' dues money to pay for golf and luxury suites at a seaside
resort.
</P>
<P>
   So the decision was made to hold these meetings elsewhere, with
an emphasis on places where labor's chieftains could give impetus
to organizing drives. Accordingly, the 1997 winter meeting was held
in Los Angeles, and last year it was in Las Vegas (labor leaders
defended that choice because Las Vegas was a showplace of
successful union organizing).
</P>
<P>
   But this year the AFL-CIO, pulled perhaps by sun and surf,
returned to Florida, and not just to any hotel, but to the famed
Fontainebleau.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, nary a labor leader could be found poolside.
One reason was from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day many union
presidents had meetings: about trade, politics, organizing
strategies. And unlike in past years, the leaders held community
forums about Social Security and safeguarding the right of workers
to form unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a minute to get outside during the day, although
one night at 11 I was finally able to take a stroll outside,'' said
John Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees Union.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders squirmed and squealed when a Republican Party
official attacked them for using members' dues to live it up in
sunny Miami. (``I suppose Republicans don't have meetings in places
like this,'' one labor leader said.) But a few union presidents
questioned the wisdom of gathering at a luxury resort that they
were too busy to enjoy. ``A lot of us haven't seen the sun or sea
in two days,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the American
Federation of Teachers. ``Maybe we should have just met in
Washington. That would have saved us the trouble of flying down
here. And we wouldn't be hearing any of these attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy Days With Hoffa
</P>
<P>
   Labor conventions are even more scripted than political
conventions. Big-name Democrats always drop in to pay homage. Union
leaders always denounce free trade.
</P>
<P>
   But this year one big thing was not scripted: how James P.
Hoffa, the teamsters' president-elect, the man with the famous
father, would get on with other union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   There was anxiety about a split because Sweeney and several
other leaders had backed Hoffa's 1996 opponent, Ron Carey. There
were even rumors that Hoffa would pull the mighty International
Brotherhood of Teamsters out of the AFL-CIO. But Wednesday, when
Hoffa stopped in for a few minutes at a news conference alongside
Sweeney, it was as if they were best buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted he's with us,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hoffa gave a brief speech that could have been written by
Sweeney's staff. ``I'm absolutely committed to working with the
AFL-CIO to advance the cause of working families,'' he said. ``It's
no secret we've had our differences in the past. We cannot afford
disunity now. I'm interested in one thing _ it's rebuilding the
labor movement.''
</P>
<P>
   He ruled out leaving the federation, he attacked the North
American Free Trade Agreement, and he promised to do more
organizing and to back labor-friendly candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Several leaders said Hoffa and Sweeney needed each other. A
fight would weaken both, distracting Hoffa from rebuilding the
teamsters and Sweeney from reviving the AFL-CIO. ``He's been
received warmly and with relief,'' said Wilhelm of the hotel union.
``He's made explicitly clear that he wants to be an active,
participating member of the House of Labor. His father always told
him of the importance of being in the House of Labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Tall Men and a Tall Tale
</P>
<P>
   At the last two winter meetings, there was an out-and-out beauty
contest. One contestant was Vice President Al Gore; the other Dick
Gephardt, the House Democratic leader. When both were vying for the
2000 Democratic presidential nomination, Gore made sure he
delivered a major goodie. Two years ago, he warmed labor hearts by
announcing a plan to blacklist federal contractors that repeatedly
violated labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, with Gephardt having bowed out of the
presidential race, Gore provided only a minor goodie _ some draft
regulations on ergonomics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad for labor that Gephardt's not running because
that would have forced Gore to be a lot more generous,'' one
official said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a contest this year, but it was of the
David-vs.-Goliath variety. Goliath was played by Gore, the
front-runner for the Democratic nomination, and David was Bill
Bradley, the former New Jersey senator and former New York Knick
now running for president. (This David was at least 6 inches taller
than this Goliath.)
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he felt about playing David, Bradley borrowed a
page from basketball: ``I've been the overdog in my life. I've been
the underdog. I don't mind being the underdog. If you're the
overdog, you play cautious. If you're the underdog, you can be
bolder.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders said they came away impressed with Gore and
Bradley, but several acted like eager little boys toward a tall,
gangly, graying man who accompanied Bradley. It was Phil Jackson,
the former coach of the champion Chicago Bulls and a teammate of
Bradley's on the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   With many curious about Jackson's presence, Bradley volunteered
that he had plans for his friend if he was elected: ``He'll be my
secretary of DEEE-fense.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite the decision on Saturday to extend the
deadline for peace talks on Kosovo, Defense Department and NATO
officials said they were pushing ahead with plans for airstrikes on
Serbia, with dozens of U.S. warplanes assigned to the mission
expected to arrive in Europe over the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO force is awaiting the arrival of a variety of U.S.
aircraft, most notably the six B-52 bombers that have been ordered
to fly to Europe from their base in Barksdale, La. The heavy
bombers, which can be armed with Tomahawk air-launched cruise
missiles, are expected to leave for an air base in Britain this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could go right now _ this minute _ with cruise missiles and
the planes we already have in Europe, and we might,'' said a
Defense Department official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity. He and other military officials said the B-52s were
considered an especially important addition to the NATO force,
certainly as tools of psychological warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hulking silhouette of a B-52 is a powerful image, and it
can make an adversary rethink his options pretty quickly,'' he
said. ``We'd like Milosevic to see them on their way,'' he added,
referring to the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The new deadline for the peace talks in France has been set for
Tuesday. If the talks end in failure, Clinton administration
officials said, the airstrikes could begin quickly after the
deadline passes, although they said the attacks would almost
certainly be delayed until all of the more than 1,000 foreign
civilian monitors in Kosovo were evacuated to protect them from
retaliation by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation of those monitors, who were assigned there last
year to police a cease-fire that has since collapsed, is expected
to begin this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Western embassies began evacuating diplomats from Yugoslavia on
Thursday and Friday. The United States was evacuating nearly 130
diplomats and dependents from Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon put a total of 51 U.S. warplanes on alert last week
to fly to Europe to join in a possible NATO strike against Serbian
targets, including 12 F-117A stealth fighters, 25 KC-135 refueling
planes and 10 EA6B Prowler radar-jammers. They would join more than
260 other U.S. warplanes that are already in place in Europe as
part of the NATO force.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have said that a first wave of
strikes would probably be made with cruise missiles fired from U.S.
warships that are now in the Mediterranean and Adriatic. Five
warships and two submarines assigned to the 6th Fleet in the area
are capable of firing the missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Under one proposal that U.S. officials said had been weighed by
the Pentagon, several dozen cruise missiles would be launched
against Serbian targets in the first volley of attacks, most of
them aimed at anti-aircraft batteries, radar stations and other
command posts across Yugoslavia that could pose a threat to
warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, which consists of
Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the missile attacks would be followed by
successive waves of attacks by NATO warplanes against Serbian
airfields, military warehouses, tank depots and other targets.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its NATO allies have left the final
decision on airstrikes to NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana.
He has said that ``NATO will have all the political support'' that
it needs for airstrikes against Belgrade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If a political solution is not reached, then we say very
clearly that NATO knows very well what it has to do,'' Solana said
on Thursday during a trip to Macedonia, which borders Kosovo, to
review NATO preparations for action.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said there was still debate within NATO over how
quickly to begin strikes once the deadline had passed. Western
diplomats said France was adamant that the attacks not occur
automatically, and added that Solana would probably be required to
consult several NATO leaders before making a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will clearly consult in an informal way,'' said Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, quickly adding, however, that Solana
had the final say on an attack. ``I think it's very important to
know that he has that authority already.''

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ As NATO's much-advertised deadline passed
for a peace accord on Kosovo province, the people of a dismally
gray and rainy Belgrade were scarcely looking up to the sky for the
bombs. Few believe missiles will ever come.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Belgraders pursued their normal Saturday routine,
drinking coffee and shopping, and generally believing that although
the West was being deeply unfair to Serbia over Kosovo, their
authoritarian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, would pursue his own
interests. And those do not include getting bombed.
</P>
<P>
   Snjezana Milkovic, 35, a history teacher in a Belgrade high
school, said the West in general and the Americans in particular
were unjust to the Serbs, threatening to bomb because of a
situation within a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they are right to ask for a deal between us and the
Albanians in Kosovo,'' Ms. Milkovic said in a bakery, ``their
troops have no right to be there. Our leadership has some right to
protest this brutal effort to snatch Kosovo from us.'' Her remarks
reflected the general belief that Serbs must retain Kosovo, the
heart of their national legend, and that the ethnic Albanians who
make up some 90 percent of its population have systematically
plotted to undermine the Serbs there and get the land.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Milkovic said Milosevic usually ended up going along with
the West, because it in effect protected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans constantly torment us because of Milosevic's
policies,'' she said, ``but they do nothing serious to topple him.
On the contrary, they support him by deliberately failing to help
those who are against him. They abandoned the independent media;
they let him destroy the student movement. One might think that he
has concluded some kind of a long-term agreement with them to
destroy this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Tabakovic, a 25-year-old clerk in a shipping company,
seemed to regard the whole diplomatic display and threat of bombing
as cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans meddle into everyone's affairs with double
standards,'' he said. ``There are similar problems to this one
elsewhere in the world like in Spain, Northern Ireland and Turkey,
and yet no one threatened them with air strikes, just us. I think
that it has nothing to do with morals, just with America's
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Novak Drakul, a physician, said the United States was a
proud country, ``and the politicians need to feed Americans some
crisis they can be proud of every six months, with some military
display.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ``has to look like the
only one who can get both sides together in Rambouillet and then
comes running again today to pull out a deal,'' he said Saturday,
referring to the French castle where the Kosovo negotiations were
taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did she have Holbrooke arrested?'' he wondered, musing on the
absence of Richard Holbrooke, who has traditionally performed the
last-minute dramatics with Milosevic in negotiating Balkan peace.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Miki, a 25-year-old part-time waiter in the Ipanema cafe in
central Belgrade, said he expected no bombing. ``The economy is
bad, the people are demoralized, everything is down,'' he said.
``That's what people care about. Bombing would only make Milosevic
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than 10 years of Milosevic's rule in Serbia, he said,
``I don't know of anyone of my generation who wants to stay in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   As the noon Saturday deadline trickled away, the two channels of
state television were showing, respectively, a cooking program and
a peasant dance festival.
</P>
<P>
   Government-controlled print media were more aggressive, however,
with the newspaper Glas displaying a photo of a steely-eyed
Milosevic leaning on a military helmet with binoculars in his hand.
Alongside were headlines of Milosevic's defiance of the night
before: ``We will not give up Kosovo, even if we are bombed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the West is not asking Milosevic to give up Kosovo,
but to allow NATO troops in to help him keep the rebellious
province within Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials said that Milosevic, through Serbian President
Milan Milutinovic, who is in Rambouillet, was angling for the
presence of more Serbian troops in Kosovo and the smallest possible
Western military presence there. Failing that, Milosevic may seek
at least some delay or separation between a political agreement on
Kosovo and a military one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some deal will be reached,'' said Bratislav Grubacic, a
well-connected Serbian journalist. ``The main point is to get the
Albanians to accept disarmament and to revise parts of the military
annex. Some elements are simply too much for the vanity of a
sovereign state.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, about 75 American diplomats, their families
and their pets left Belgrade in a convoy for Budapest, leaving a
small contingent to run the American Embassy here. As they drove
away, the chief American diplomat here, Richard Miles, in a trench
coat and a flat blue cap, waved goodbye to each vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not reached an agreement at Rambouillet,'' Miles said,
``and there is the threat of military action should the
negotiations not be successful. In order to be prudent, to reduce
the danger to our people we have taken these measures. The
situation in its present stage is rather more dangerous than a few
days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The embassy would be closed, he said, in the event of NATO air
strikes.

WEIGHING NEW YORK'S DANGERS AND GUINEA'S UNEMPLOYMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONAKRY, Guinea _ When the sun sets, a damp breeze blows in from
the Atlantic Ocean, turning the day's dust to grit, and crowds of
young people congregate along the rutted streets. With them come
the police and the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In this shabby capital of one million on Africa's west coast,
men in uniform are as ubiquitous as the evening's mosquitoes. The
military and some police officers carry guns, especially at the
numerous checkpoints set up after midnight in and around the city.
They demand identity cards. They grab criminal suspects from the
milling throngs, often by the throat, and pat them down. They
search bags and pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The tools of the security forces _ harassment, beatings, even
muggings _ are brutal, but usually not deadly. Human rights
monitors and ordinary Guineans say shootings by police officers are
rare. That is one reason the story of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed
Guinean immigrant shot to death by four New York City police
officers in the Bronx on Feb. 4, resonates so deeply here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence happens, but it's not something we fear all the
time,'' said Mamoudatu Diallo, an uncle of Diallo who used to
travel between New York and Guinea buying and selling electronic
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all its publicity here and the uneasiness it created
among families with relatives in New York, the Diallo killing is
not likely to stem the flow of Guinean immigrants to the United
States. Fear of the authorities at home is not what drives them to
leave. Hardened by the casual brutality and hardships of their
daily lives, many take a certain level of crime and violence for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, like Diallo, Guineans flock to foreign embassies for
visas in growing numbers in the hope of rising above the poverty
that afflicts their country like a chronic disease.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, under the former Socialist regime, university
graduates were guaranteed jobs, and prices were controlled. Now,
unemployment and the cost of living are spiraling upward. So in
Guinea's teeming markets, crumbling shantytowns and lackluster
universities, the image of New York City remains one of vast
opportunities available for the price of loneliness, danger and
hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guineans by nature and temperament are very dynamic, and when
they see the freedom and dynamism of the United States and its
strict judicial and legal system, they are drawn to go there,''
said Alpha Absoulaye Diallo, a prominent Conakry lawyer and former
Guinean diplomat who is not related to the young immigrant slain in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guineans are also very fatalistic. They believe that what will
happen will happen,'' he added. ``For those who know the United
States, they know the police are very severe. That is true in all
countries where there are bandits, and it's especially so in the
United States, where people can freely buy weapons.'' Weapons
purchases are restricted in Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   Guinea declared its independence from French rule in 1958. Once
the richest of France's West African colonies, with 30 percent of
the world's known reserves of bauxite, it is now one of the world's
poorest nations. Only about 20 percent of the 7.5 million people
can read and write. The life expectancy at birth is 44 years.
</P>
<P>
   Under Sekou Toure, the president from independence until his
death in 1984, all Guinean industry was owned by the state. The
regime was brutal and arbitrary, killing or imprisoning thousands
of Toure's opponents. Many people left, by whatever means they
could. An estimated 2 million lived outside the country by early
1980. France, then more welcoming to immigrants from its former
colonies than it is now, was a popular destination. So were
neighboring West African countries and, to a lesser extent, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, 8 out of 10 Guineans relied on subsistence
farming. Private business was outlawed, but some merchants, like
Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, set up trading companies in
next-door Liberia and the Ivory Coast to market goods from Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   When an army general, Lansana Conte, seized power in 1984, he
promised a free-market economy. Later elected president, Conte has
reached out to the diaspora to return and help rebuild. His prime
minister, justice minister and the head of the Supreme Court are
all former emigres.
</P>
<P>
   But change came too slowly for some Guineans, among them
Diallo's father. He moved back to Guinea from Liberia in 1980 but
left with his family again, this time for Thailand, in 1985.
``There were no laws yet to protect businessmen,'' he said,
recalling his decision to leave home again. The father still lives
abroad, in Vietnam, where he imports West African gems.
</P>
<P>
   For those who stayed, life became harder still. The government
cut its work force in half, offering many bureaucrats money to
leave voluntarily, and simply firing many more. People now must pay
for their electricity and the rent on their once-subsidized
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wake-up was brutal,'' said Prosper Dore, editor in chief
of two of Guinea's independent weekly newspapers, La Lance and Le
Lynx. ``Suddenly we had to pay for this and we needed that.
Unemployment exploded. People who finish university don't have
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   While the more open economy drew foreign companies to Guinea,
they needed employees with computer and other skills that local
universities did not provide. At the same time, civil war broke out
in Liberia and then in Sierra Leone, making cross-border trading
hazardous. Even movement within Guinea is more time-consuming and
perilous, as the government has increased the number of army
checkpoints in an effort to prevent foreign fighters from slipping
into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Many Guineans leave home with unrealistic expectations,
especially about the educational possibilities open to them, Dore
said. ``A lot of Guineans think they only have to show up at a
university and enroll,'' said Dore, who has used his newspapers to
explain how to prepare better for the immigrant life.
</P>
<P>
   Like Diallo, some find their dreams cut short by violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that many Guineans before Amadou were killed in New
York,'' said Mohamed Mouktar Diallo, a cousin of Diallo who studied
economics and computer science in Canada and Washington. ``But they
are usually doing something dangerous, like driving a cab in
Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Diallo, who sold tube socks and other goods from a sidewalk
table in Manhattan to finance his computer classes, many Guineans
also find that earning a living and an education abroad is an
exhausting enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've talked to young people there in America who say that
if they tighten their belts, they can eventually take care of their
families better and even put some money aside,'' Dore said. ``They
say they prefer to live in the subway in New York, even with the
dangers, than be back in Conakry, where there are no jobs.''

 &HT;    Braves power up for fall in spring
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Braves general manager John Schuerholz
doesn't want to call it a change of philosophy, this turn of events
that has pitcher Denny Neagle playing for the Cincinnati Reds and
two new bats in the Braves lineup belonging to Brian Jordan and
Bret Boone.
</P>
<P>
   So let's find another way to put it, to describe what happens
when the National League's team of the '90s decides to do some
restructuring with one year left to elbow its way into the Yankees'
and Blue Jays' claims as baseball's team of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   What to call a steady run of Fab Fours _ starting rotations that
border on the obnoxious in their completeness, talent and
propensity to turn back hitters at the plate _ becomes, for now, a
Fab Three of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz?
</P>
<P>
   How to categorize trading away Neagle two seasons removed from a
20-win season and leave the fourth and fifth spots in the rotation
to Kevin Millwood, in his second full year, and 21-year-old rookie
Bruce Chen?
</P>
<P>
   First of all, call it early postseason planning.
</P>
<P>
   The idea came into Schuerholz's focus after the Braves blew away
the National League East by winning a franchise-record 106 games
last year but then stumbled in the pitching-packed NLCS duel with
San Diego as Neagle watched idle from the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might not go out and win 110, 115 games in the regular
season,'' third baseman Chipper Jones said, ``but we should
certainly make it to the playoffs, and, offensively, we'll have the
horses to score some runs against some top pitchers in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always fun to have a loaded starting rotation, but one of
those guys has to sit in the postseason,'' Jones said. ``Why not
have another big bat in place of that, somebody who can come in
from the very beginning of spring training and gel with the team,
generate more offense for this staff?
</P>
<P>
   ``In streaks, we've been a very hot team, where we've scored a
lot of runs and won a lot of games,'' he said. ``But if we hit a
stretch where we face tough pitching, we've also struggled. One
more hot bat could get us through those struggles.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it a relief.
</P>
<P>
   No way the Braves would have figured on losing Andres Galarraga
for the season to lymphoma, but those offseason moves are starting
to look even better. Without Jordan and Boone, the Braves would be
in dire straits offensively. With Jordan and Boone, the Braves are
merely fidgety, to see how to fill a pretty large gap.
</P>
<P>
   Call it an easy choice.
</P>
<P>
   On this end, Millwood had just finished winning 17 games in his
first full season of pitching in the major leagues, and Chen showed
his combination of talent and poise during his September callup.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end, Cincinnati offered 32-year-old Mike Remlinger,
a veteran who has pitched plenty as both a starter and a reliever
and can fill in if Millwood or Chen falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't toss or turn,'' Schuerholz said. ``You'd really be
standing out on the precipice if you traded a guy like Denny Neagle
and you didn't have guys coming along you feel comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, call it popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited, because the team got better,'' Greg Maddux said.
``It's not about leading the league in ERA or home runs. It's about
winning games. I think we have a chance to win more games this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   And because it's his project, give Schuerholz the last word.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy has not changed,'' he said. ``I still think the
way you win championships and build championship teams is with
starting pitching as the cornerstone of the foundation. Not just
starting pitching, but dominant, excellent starting pitching. . . .
I'd suggest that there are a lot of other teams in baseball who
would love to have this (rotation).

 &HT;    Loss of Big Cat a rally cry
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the next five weeks the Braves will prepare for the start of
the 1999 season. Here are 10 questions they have to answer in the
meantime:
</P>
<P>
   1. How will the Braves deal with the loss of Andres Galarraga?
</P>
<P>
   Stripping the lineup of 44 home runs, 121 RBIs and statistically
the best clutch hitter in the National League makes the 1999
outlook much less clear. Each of the Braves hitters must increase
his productivity. The Braves can ill-afford any off-years. But
players already are saying they want to win this season for
Galarraga. Giving a supposedly stoic team a personal reason to win
could make them even more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   2. Who is going to bat cleanup?
</P>
<P>
   Probably Brian Jordan. But don't look for Galarraga-like
production. When he's healthy, Jordan is a solid power hitter, but
he doesn't reach Galarraga's standard _ more than 40 home runs each
of the last three seasons, more than 30 the last five. Jordan can
help on the basepaths. Hitting ahead of Mark McGwire last year,
Jordan kept the steal attempts to a minimum, but he's adept when
the opportunity is right. He also has excellent skills in right.
</P>
<P>
   3. Can Klesko answer the call?
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are expecting him to, and the signing of Brian Hunter
as a backup supports that. The only way Klesko can take full
advantage is if he stays healthy, quits swinging for the fences,
and returns to being the more disciplined, opposite-field hitter he
was when he broke into the big leagues. He says he'll be
comfortable playing first base.
</P>
<P>
   4. How will Bruce Chen do as the fifth starter?
</P>
<P>
   If he's even slightly concerned he won't measure up, Chen sure
doesn't show it. His cool and confident demeanor suggests that he
will do just fine. With only eight starts above the AA level _ four
in Richmond, four in Atlanta _ his experience is severely limited.
Bobby Cox likes Chen's maturity and the way he and Kevin Millwood
use Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz as resources.
</P>
<P>
   5. Will Mark Wohlers make it back?
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't look like it. The season is only five weeks away, and
Wohlers is still having trouble finding the catcher, much less the
strike zone. His breaking ball is OK, but everybody knows that
Wohlers' fastball made him one of the dominant closers. What is
working in his favor is Wohlers' attitude. He hasn't backed down
from the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   6. What happens to those final couple of spots in the bullpen
otherwise?
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cather is making a strong comeback bid from his
rib-extraction surgery. If he can come close to throwing the kinds
of pitches that made him so effective in 1997, he's a shoo-in to
return. Kerry Ligtenberg, John Rocker and Rudy Seanez are all but
locked in. Mike Remlinger gives Cox a second lefty in the pen, so
it's doubtful that he'll keep rookie Odalis Perez in Atlanta. But
with Russ Springer still out recovering from back surgery, Perez
can't be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   7. Will Chipper Jones be able to put his offseason troubles
behind him?
</P>
<P>
   The way he figures it, yes. Jones has settled his marital
problems and is moving ahead. He is entering his baseball prime _
he'll turn 27 in April _ and is ready to build on a 1998 season
that brought him his first All-Star Game start. He worked in the
offseason to gain strength and stamina and added an extra 20
pounds. Jones knows that adoration from the fans comes with great
production, no matter how much he hurt his All-American image.
Jones will get his fourth consecutive 20-homer, 100-RBI season.
</P>
<P>
   8. Can Bret Boone repeat the kind of season he had last year?
</P>
<P>
   Boone had career highs in hits, doubles and runs to go along
with 24 home runs and 95 RBIs. But Boone spent the 1998 offseason
shortening his swing and saw immediate results. He was finally
awarded a Gold Glove for his outstanding play at second. His
defense is a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   9. Has Otis Nixon still got it?
</P>
<P>
   The Braves franchise record-holder for stolen bases _ 72 in 1991
_ apparently still does, even at age 40. Nixon was a regular for
the Minnesota Twins last year and stole 37 bases in 110 games _
while fighting through a sore hamstring late in the season. Having
him and Walt Weiss in the lineup gives Cox a nice 1-2 punch at the
top of the order.
</P>
<P>
   10. What difference will Don Baylor make?
</P>
<P>
   That question probably will be answered best come playoff time.
Baylor's known for reviving careers, as he did with Galarraga and
Vinny Castilla in Colorado, and Klesko is his primary focus now.
The Braves are happy to have a coach of his experience and know-how
and will need him now more than ever with the loss of Galarraga.

 &HT;    High-profile managers in NL West spotlighted
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although no National League team from the West Coast
has won a World Series in 10 years, there will be no division in
the majors this season with a higher manager profile than the NL
West. The arrivals of Davey Johnson in Los Angeles and Jim Leyland
in Colorado assure the fact.
</P>
<P>
   From the bottom up, each team in the division is dwarfed by the
men in the dugout. Buck Showalter won 65 games in Arizona's first
season, fourth most among the 14 expansion clubs dating back to
1961. With the addition of Randy Johnson and Todd Stottlemyre, the
Diamondbacks become an instant contender, the notion bolstered by
Showalter's cachet.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Bruce Bochy has been a professional manager only
seven years but has finished first four times, including twice in
four Padres seasons. His club made the Series last October with
less offense than his 76-win team of 1997. In San Francisco where
Dusty Baker has twice won NL manager of the year, his Giants have
been alive for the playoffs on the last day of the season three
times in six years. He forced last years' one-game playoff with the
Cubs after a 5-7 slump in early September.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps then it is no wonder the Rockies are paying the largest
manager salary in history (three seasons at $2 million per) to get
Leyland. He has taken two franchises into the postseason four times
in the last 10 years and though only his infamous 1997 Florida
Marlins went all the way, he immediately inflated Colorado's stock
(even if the roster hardly shifted from Don Baylor's last season).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start kidding yourself and over-evaluating your
importance, you got a problem,'' Leyland said. ``Players see it.
Other people see it. And you normally don't last long.''
</P>
<P>
   That style is opposite that of Johnson, whose history for
clashing with the front office flags his .575 winning percentage,
the highest among all active managers. Johnson was the Dodgers'
third choice behind Leyland and Felipe Alou for the job, but he may
be best suited to run this team, a bloodless roster that simply
abandoned Bill Russell last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 7:30, there isn't anybody better,'' said Philadelphia
hitting coach Hal McRae, who worked on Johnson's Cincinnati staff
1995 staff. ``He wins regardless of where he manages. He's kind of
like (NFL New York Jets coach Bill) Parcells in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   HIRSUTE PURSUIT
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' decision to drop a 30-year ban on facial hair was
welcomed by different players for different reasons. Perhaps the
most legitimate reason belonged to outfielder Dmitri Young, who
said, ``Some people are real ugly without facial hair and I'm one
of them. We can hide behind beards and mustaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Danny Graves is apparently not one of them. ``It would
take me 10 years to grow (a beard),'' he said, ``and all you'd see
are some wild hairs. Maybe when I reach puberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves, for the record, is 25.
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever changes Lou Piniella has in mind for how he handles the
Seattle Mariners this year, the team figures to be a step ahead of
him. The M's have already scheduled a players-only meeting on the
first day the whole team reports to foster team unity. Said pitcher
Jamie Moyer, ``We need more discipline.'' . . . Orel Hershiser, 40,
continues to play teams against each other for his services, with
Florida, Philadelphia and Cleveland still showing interest. The
going rate starts at $2 million for one year but the Phillies have
grown suspicious about Hershiser's intentions. Three days after
receiving a Philadelphia offer, agent Robert Fraley called to say
he hadn't been able to reach his client, who had been
``traveling.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Opening Day at Pro Player Stadium: Marlin Alex Fernandez is
expected to face New York's Al Leiter, a former teammate.
Fernandez's last live pitch came in the third inning of Game 2 of
the 1997 NLCS, after Atlanta drilled him for five runs. Doctors
discovered his torn rotator cuff the next day. . . . Pittsburgh's
interest in Arizona outfielder Bernard Gilkey has become a money
deal. Although the Pirates had offered outfielder Al Martin and
second baseman Tony Womack for Gilkey and a pitching prospect, the
Pirates dropped the pitcher component in exchange for an extra $6
million to defray Gilkey's contract ($11.5 million over two years,
plus a $9 million annuity).

<P>
   _ Spring projects: Rookie LHP Bruce Chen becomes a spring
priority after the Braves discarded Neagle to pick up Boone. Kevin
Millwood and Chen, who has the No. 5 job to lose, are prominent
players in a camp short on story lines. Ryan Klesko replaces

<P>
   _ Spring projects: Boles inherits the train wreck of 1998. RHP
Alex Fernandez (rotator cuff) hasn't pitched in 18 months, and the
Marlins must get him on the mound if only to force a trade, as the

fight it out for third base, and rookie SS Alex Rodriguez inherits
Renteria's old spot.

start a player younger than 30. First, they need reassurance on

at four positions _ center field (Cameron and Jeffrey Hammonds),

   _ Spring projects: Their hopes for acquiring Roger Clemens
dashed, the Astros try to build a rotation around Shane Reynolds

Caminiti reintroduces himself at third base, and rookie Mitch
Meluskey has an opportunity to earn time at catcher.

<P>
   _ Spring projects: Having secured money for a new stadium, owner

   _ Spring projects: The D-Backs would like a reassurance that
closer Gregg Olson's (30 saves, 3.01 ERA) arm troubles are behind
him. The club also needs 3B Matt Williams to bounce back after a

</P>
<P>
   _ Spring projects: Hundley could provide the left-handed power
the Dodgers have missed for so long, provided he can still play
after elbow surgery and a 1998 disaster in New York. Brown will be
asked to elevate another pitching staff, but not as much as Johnson
must elevate an entire roster that has spent a half-decade
underachieving.

hole left by Brown on the pitching staff. George Arias tries to
make the town forget Caminiti at third base and Ruben Rivera moves
in to replace Finley in center. The bullpen remains a strength,
even as they try to dump Randy Myers. Bochy still thinks he can win

</P>
<P>
   _ Spring projects: While most of the division upgraded, the
Giants are standing pat, hoping that Baker can make something
happen again. After a 7-12 backslide, the club seeks to get No. 1
starter Shawn Estes back in form. Barry Bonds again shoulders a
huge load, but now he is 34 and pushing hard for the club to
exercise his 2001 option.

</P>
<P>
   _ Spring projects: Can they all just get along? Miller has to
meld Belle and Clark into a pretty crusty clubhouse, reigned over
by Cal Ripken. There is plenty of offense to be reclaimed, after
Palmeiro took his 43 homers and 121 RBIs to Texas. And a new
bullpen, led by Timlin, must be sorted out. Owner Peter Angelos is
paying $80 million for this?

with Offerman (and his $26 million contract) taking the job by

Torre had come to camp with no specific needs. Clemens' presence
will relieve any pressure on LHP Andy Pettitte (16-11), who tries
to rebound from an injury-plagued 1998. Mike Stanton must step up
as the only LHP left in bullpen. Ricky Ledee, Chad Curtis, Shane

spring for Randy Winn, who has first shot at center field. If he
fails, Quinton McCracken takes the job, and Canseco might be forced

Jays from playoff contention. Wells, back with his original club,
will not get the 6.84 runs a game he received in New York last
season. Hamilton and Chris Carpenter must prepare for a larger
load. Berroa, Fielder and Greene must fill Canseco's void. Is
Robert Person ready to close? He is Johnson's only option.

arm injury, could help the rotation. Raines and Phillips fight it

 &HT;    Revisiting a 1937 field of dreams
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOMASTON, Ga. _ It was more than six decades ago, but Hall of
Famer Bob Feller hasn't forgotten his visit as a teenage pitching
phenom to this central Georgia city of about 9,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mill town, I remember that,'' said Feller, 80. ``It was my
first spring training, and we had a heck of a crowd. Of course, we
did everywhere that year.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, Feller at 18 was the talk of baseball, and spring
training was very different. Teams barnstormed north for weeks,
hitting towns that would never get an up-close look at
major-leaguers in action today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indians traveled by train with the Giants and stopped
about everywhere,'' recalled Feller, who won 266 major-league games
and pitched three no-hitters. ``We played in a dust storm in
Oklahoma and all through the South. Everybody wanted to see me
pitch against Carl Hubbell.''
</P>
<P>
   Feller, who had struck out 15 in his first start for Cleveland
and a record-tying 17 later in the 1936 season, didn't pitch
against Hubbell in Thomaston. With sellouts at both Georgia sites
assured, Hubbell pitched in Rome the day before. But that didn't
dampen the excitement in Thomaston on April 13, 1937. Feller _ the
fastest-throwing pitcher since Walter Johnson _ and the defending
National League champion New York Giants were in town.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,000 crowded into Silvertown Ballpark to see the
Indians beat the Giants 8-6 in the city's first and last
major-league exhibition game. Feller struck out 12 in eight
innings, but was finally scored on by the Giants after 11 hitless
innings against him.
</P>
<P>
   Next weekend, Feller will return to Thomaston for the reopening
of Silvertown Ballpark. Built by B.F. Goodrich in 1936 to house its
Martha Mills textile-league team, the refurbished stadium will now
be home to Upson-Lee High baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to fix up everything just like it orginally was,''
Upson-Lee coach Bobby Smith said. ``There won't be a nicer high
school stadium anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Feller will participate in 11 a.m. rededication ceremonies
Saturday before Upson-Lee plays Pike County at 1 p.m. The game is
free, but a fee will be charged for Feller autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to going down there,'' Feller said from
his home in Ohio. ``I remember the town, but I don't remember a
darn thing about the game. I pitched in too many of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But only one in Thomaston. Fans met the teams at the train
station, then went to Silvertown, a mill village of small, neat
homes just north of downtown. Julian Bethel, like nearly everyone
else in Thomaston, was determined to see the game.
</P>
<P>
   Now 83, Bethel worked the soda counter at a pharmacy then.
``Some fellows from Macon came in and asked me to sell them my
ticket,'' Bethel recalled. ``They said they would give me anything
I wanted for it. I needed the money, but there was no way I was
going to miss seeing Feller pitch. The town about closed down for
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph McGill, writing in The Atlanta Constitution, called young
Feller the ``most publicized player since Babe Ruth.'' And after
seeing Feller's blazing fastball and sharp-breaking curve, McGill
was impressed. ``He is a great pitcher now,'' McGill wrote,
``needing only the polish of experience to become an even greater
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Frank Radcliffe, Thomaston's most famous baseball son, was
only 9 in 1937 and wasn't at the game. But he has fond memories of
Silvertown Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   It was there in 1948 that he struck out 28 batters _ one reached
base on the third strike _ in a nine-inning one-hitter for R.E. Lee
High, which merged into Upson-Lee in 1992. The Phillies gave
Radcliffe a near-record $40,000 bonus contract. An arm injury cut
short his career, but he played long enough in the minors to be a
teammate of Cliff Melton, who pitched vs. Feller in Thomaston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord a-mercy, Silvertown was a pretty park, especially with
that hedge around the outfield fence,'' Radcliffe recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But the ballpark lost its prime tenant in the 1950s when the
textile league folded, and it fell into disrepair in the early
1990s. Last year, a campaign to save Silvertown Ballpark began,
raising approximately $200,000. The grandstand has been restored,
dugouts built and a new scoreboard installed in left field. The
playing surface is as green as Turner Field. Lights are next.
</P>
<P>
   ``The park looks great,'' said Jim Fowler, chairman of the
rededication committee. ``Now, we just hope it doesn't rain next
Saturday.

 &HT;    Not so Great times
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If Wayne Gretzky is thinking about staying around one
more season to see if the New York Rangers turn it around, he might
as well retire. The team has one of the league's highest payrolls
with a plethora of elderly veterans _ Gretzky, Ulf Samuelsson, John
MacLean, Kevin Stevens, Brian Leetch _ and coach John Muckler is
starting to feel pressure to give extended playing time to some of
the team's younger players. Further, a number of the vets,
particularly Samuelsson and MacLean, will be sought before the
March 23 trading deadline. Notwithstanding Gretzky's five-assist
night this week in a win over Nashville, the Weary One has about
had it. ``It's not one guy, it's not two guys, it's the whole
team,'' he said. ``And it's always the same way. We take three or
four penalties in the first period, fall behind by a goal, and then
spend the rest of the night fighting for our lives. It's not good
enough.'' Postscript: the Rangers lost six of seven at home.
</P>
<P>
   JAGR-MEISTER
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that Mario Lemieux's league-mandated March 15
deadline to form an ownership group that would purchase the
bankrupt Pittsburgh Penguins is eight days before the trading
deadline. The significance? Jaromir Jagr is to earn $8.9 million
next season, and rumors that the club might deal him to a
big-market team haven't cooled, despite the Pens' recent 10-game
winning streak. Odds are that if Lemieux takes over, Jagr will
stay. Otherwise, current co-owner Roger Marino might wish to ease
the team's debt. Jagr is not shying away from the talk: ``If the
owners or general manager think they have to trade me, that's their
decision. I love to play in Pittsburgh. If they can't afford me,
then I would love to play in L.A. or New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ETC. ...
</P>
<P>
   If Art Williams doesn't sell Tampa Bay, he might turn operations
over to his son, Art III, who runs a sporting-goods store in
Covington. ... Jagr had 26 points, including 10 goals, during the
Pens' streak. ... How's this for a test? Pittsburgh's next four
games are against Philadelphia, Phoenix, Colorado and Dallas, four
of the top five teams currently. ... Scrappy Buffalo forward
Matthew Barnaby, who at first discounted trade rumors, now is
embracing them. He has asked the Sabres to deal him. ... Chicago
defenseman Chris Chelios dislikes the whispers that have him being
dealt to Philadelphia. Chelios captained the 1998 U.S. Olympic
hockey team that was ripped by Flyers' GM Bob Clarke. Quoth
Chelios: ``Just tell Bob Clarke to shut up and leave me alone.''
... Lightning GM/coach Jacques Demers on suggestions by Williams
that his job is in jeopardy: ``It's Art's team, and he can do what
he wants with it, but I'm not changing my plan. I'm not going to
leave a legacy here that says I screwed things up. I'm sticking
with my game plan.'' ... Philadelphia has one of the league's best
records but is only 5-6-3 in the second of back-to-back games. ...
Boston's oldest player, Ray Bourque (38) also leads the team in
minutes played (30-plus per game). ... So you want to coach the
Montreal Canadiens? Two headlines last week in Montreal newspapers
read, ``The season is over'' and ``Get out the golf clubs.'' So
much for optimism.

 &HT;    Eclipse of the Stars?
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With Detroit still sleep-walking and Phoenix having
leveled off, today's game between Colorado and Dallas (Fox, 3 p.m.)
should give some indication of the balance of power in the West.
Even though the Stars own the best record in the league, some
league scouts still view them Despite owning the best record in the
league, the Stars still are viewed by some league scouts as a
mentally fragile team that succumbs to pressure in close games and
could do the same in the playoffs. That's quite an indictment for a
team that has lost only 20 percent of its games, but the Avalanche
will be a severe test. Colorado has overcome an 0-4 start and
adversity that included goalie Patrick Roy busting some TV sets and
video equipment in a tirade; general manager Pierre Lacroix trading
his son Eric; and Keith Jones, among the players who felt Eric
Lacroix was a distraction, being traded to Philadelphia. But Roy
was signed to a contract extension and is now the hottest goalie in
the league, 11-2-1 in a stretch of 14 starts; the Avalanche had
lost only three of its last 18 games going into Friday's game at
Nashville; and forwards Peter Forsberg and Joe Sakic are thriving
as linemates. Even Jones, who was thrilled to be out of Denver, is
impressed. ``They're playing super hockey,'' he said. ``Now that I
can look back on it, there were many reasons for the (poor) start,
and it was just of matter of them getting back on track. if there
were some questions about the organization's commitment, they have
spent a lot of money and absolutely corrected that.''
</P>
<P>
   SAME OL' STORY
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the great views in British Columbia, it remains a
mystery why Marc Crawford took the Vancouver coaching job when
several other jobs figured to become available after the season,
even aside from the one in Atlanta. The hiring of Crawford hardly
changed the Canucks' fortunes. Mark Messier and Ed Jovanovski,
acquired from Florida in the Pavel Bure deal, are injured, and the
Canucks were so lethargic in an 8-1 loss to St. Louis that Crawford
said some of his players should be in a ``beer league.'' Gee.
Vancouver must be a little slice of paradise. Fired coach Mike
Keenan was 15-24-6 (.400). Crawford was 3-7-1 (.318) after
Thursday's 4-0 loss to last-place Chicago. GM Brian Burke continues
to take most of the heat. ``Whether we make the playoffs or not,''
Burke said, ``we're in a rebuilding process. I see a night and day
difference since Marc got here.''
</P>
<P>
   ETC. ...
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Phoenix to make any high-profile deals before the
playoffs. Coyotes owner Richard Burke said the team's projected
financial losses of $10 million this year will handcuff general
manager Bobby Smith to a degree. The Coyotes have the NHL's
sixth-lowest payroll but their revenues are hampered by
approximately 4,500 seats with obstructed views at America West
Arena that often go unsold. Burke now is backing off threats to
move the team, but he continues to push for a new arena or
renovations to the existing one. ... Los Angeles, desperate for a
player who can score goals and sell tickets, had a deal with
Calgary for Theo Fleury fall through when Fleury rejected a
five-year, $30 million extension. He will become unrestricted after
the season and thinks that the salary bar was raised by Bure's new
six-year contract, with salaries escalating from $8 million to $11
million.

 &HT;    JonBenet book puts slaying back in spotlight
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The appearance of a provocative new book on JonBenet
Ramsey has once again catapulted the unsolved slaying into
headlines, news shows, and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,'' by Lawrence Schiller, has been
the subject of extensive news reports, including a segment on the
show ``Dateline NBC.'' Newsweek magazine did a cover piece
featuring a lengthy excerpt. And the face of JonBenet's mother,
Patsy Ramsey of Atlanta, is once more on tabloid covers.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller, the author of ``American Tragedy,'' an account of the
O.J. Simpson trial, spent more than two years writing the book,
which does not try to solve the case but rather illuminate the
troubled investigation, including the deep divisions between the
police and district attorney's office, and the story's growth into
a media phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The 615-page book on the Christmas night, 1996, murder in the
family's former home of Boulder, Colo., offers more than a
half-dozen accounts that support the theory that JonBenet was
killed by an intruder, including that blood in her underpants
contained DNA traces from two unknown people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the book asserts that tests show a pubic hair found
on the blanket in which JonBenet's body was wrapped doesn't belong
to anybody in the family or circle of friends.
</P>
<P>
   But Schiller also reveals circumstantial evidence that he says
makes the girl's parents logical suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much much of the crime took place too slowly. There was no
fear of discovery. You would think an intruder would quickly get
the hell out of there,'' he said in an interview. ``But there was
40 minutes of work done afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he learned that Patsy Ramsey has a ``hard and
tough'' side to her. When Boulder police Detective Tom Haney told
Patsy Ramsey during a June 1998 interview that she had lied to him,
she replied, ``Pal, you don't want to go there. Don't start that,''
Schiller wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schiller acknowledged, ``No one fact breaks the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Boulder police and the district attorney's office had no comment
on the book. Attorneys for the Ramseys did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Patsy Ramsey's sister, Pam Paugh, said she would not read the
book. She declined Schiller's request to be interviewed. ``I do not
want to help someone make money off my niece's murder,'' said
Paugh, who lives in Dunwoody, a suburban town north of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said the Ramseys remain under suspicion in
JonBenet's death, though the Ramseys have repeatedly maintained
their innocence. A Boulder County grand jury has been reviewing
evidence in the case since September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect Murder'' has topped Amazon.com's Hot 100 best-seller
list. In the Ramseys' hometown of Atlanta, the book has been
selling moderately well, said Barbara Babbit Kaufman, president of
Chapter 11 Discount Book Stores. She said each of the 13 stores has
sold about eight copies.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Schiller said he believes ``one of the parents''
will be indicted, though he would not say which one. Still, he
said, enough information exists for a good defense attorney to win
the case.

REPUBLICANS URGE N.J. GOVERNOR TO RUN FOR U.S. SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ky., Nev.)  (bl)  
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ To help beat back efforts by Democrats to gain
control of the U.S. Senate in 2000, state and national Republican
leaders are heavily lobbying Gov. Christie Whitman to run for the
seat being vacated by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Since Wednesday, when Lautenberg announced his decision to
retire at the end of his third term, Whitman has been besieged with
messages and phone calls from party leaders and Republican senators
urging her to run.
</P>
<P>
   Before last week, Whitman would quickly dismiss questions about
whether she was planning a run for the Senate. After Lautenberg's
announcement, she said she would give a race ``serious
consideration,'' but added that she had much to think about before
deciding to run in 2000, a year before her second and final term
ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to decide what's the best way to serve the people of
this state, and family becomes very important in this as well,''
she said in an interview. ``Don't forget, there's a real world
outside of politics, too. And while my husband has some doubts
about whether I could stand it if I weren't still involved in
politics and government, I think I could, and that's another
option.''
</P>
<P>
   State and national Republican leaders say they are trying to
sway Whitman because she stands a good chance of becoming the
state's first Republican senator since Clifford Case in 1972. Until
a few days ago, they said, the New Jersey seat was assumed to be
solidly in the Democratic column.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey was not on the radar screen before Frank's decision
to retire,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., head of the
Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. ``It might have gotten on
the radar screen. But this is a total change in the situation. I
think that everyone would agree that Governor Whitman would be our
strongest candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell and other Republican leaders say the battle lines over
control of the Senate have been redrawn with Lautenberg's decision
and the announcement the following day by Sen. Richard Bryan,
D-Nev., that he would not seek re-election next year.
</P>
<P>
   There are now three Democrats, including Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., who are retiring and leaving open seats next
year. Hillary Rodham Clinton and New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani are among the people considering a race to succeed
Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened as a result of these retirements is that
Democrats are going to have to work to just stay even,'' McConnell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now hold a 55-45 edge in the Senate. But they must
defend 19 seats next year, including many held by first-term
Republicans, compared with 14 for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats, noting that New York and New Jersey voters
have leaned Democratic in presidential election years, contend that
they will hold all three seats. ``We also think that the
Republicans will have some retirements, in which we can put forth
competitive candidates to move those seats into Democratic
columns,'' said Michael Tucker, a spokesman for the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Rep. Robert Menendez, a Democrat from Union City
in Hudson County, is expected to announce, possibly as early as
Monday, that he will seek the Democratic nomination. He already has
more than $1.2 million in his campaign account for a race that
analysts estimate will cost $10 million to $12 million. There is a
long list of other possible contenders for the Democratic
nomination, including former Gov. Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a long list of potential Republican candidates,
but state party chairman Chuck Haytaian said that a decision by
Whitman to enter the race would probably clear the Republican field
so she would escape a bruising primary.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Duffy, a political analyst with The Cook Political
Report, which tracks state and federal elections around the
country, said she moved New Jersey into her tossup column from
leaning toward Democrat after Lautenberg's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Whitman runs, I would probably push it to Republican
favor,'' Ms. Duffy said. ``Democrats are going to be hard pressed
to come up with her equal. I am not saying it will not be a
competitive race. But her equal in terms of her ability to raise
money and her statewide name recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania is among several Republican
senators, mostly moderates, who have called Whitman in recent days
to urge her to consider running. Beyond helping their party
maintain control of the Senate, Specter said, Whitman could broaden
its national appeal with her brand of moderate politics. ``And we
don't have sufficient representation for the Republican Party at
the center of the political spectrum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, New Jersey's junior senator who is head
of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Whitman's
entrance into the race ``would make it very competitive.'' But he
added that he believed New Jersey Democrats were in good shape with
voters, and he noted that Mrs. Whitman won her 1997 re-election
campaign by only 1 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic chairman Thomas Giblin said that he and other
Democrats are concerned about what impact Whitman might have on the
gubernatorial contest in 2001. If Whitman went to the Senate, state
Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, a Republican, would become
governor. DiFrancesco is already planning to run for governor, and
being the incumbent would give him an enormous edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win this race,'' Giblin said of the Senate seat.
``It presents a big problem to the Democratic Party if we don't.
All of these elections are intertwined.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said that she expected to decide within a month whether
to create an exploratory committee. ``That's only fair,'' she said.
``There are a lot of people who are interested in this, and the
important thing, to me, is for the Republicans to win that Senate
seat. So I don't want to hurt someone else's chances.''

ALABAMA'S GOVERNOR MAKES AN END RUN  
 CALIFORNIA'S GOP FALLS ON HARD TIMES  
 THIS TIME AROUND, KENNEDY IS PREPARING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Calif., Mass., Mich.) (rk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alabama is one of a small number of states in which the governor
and the lieutenant governor run separately for election and can
hail from different parties. For much of this century, the
divisiveness that could result from such an election arrangement
never materialized because Democrats decisively dominated politics
in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, Republicans have been on the rise in the
state, as elsewhere in the South _ and so, too, has divisiveness
between Alabama governors and lieutenant governors.
</P>
<P>
   Until he was elected governor last fall, Don Siegelman, a
Democrat, was Alabama's lieutenant governor, playing No. 2 to a
Republican governor, Fob James. They tangled early and often, with
Siegelman repeatedly thwarting James' political aims and desires.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman was able to do that because Alabama was one of a small
number of states in which the lieutenant governor had significant
governing power, including the power to appoint legislative
committees, pick their chairmen and control the flow of many bills.
Siegelman helped kill many measures dear to the state's powerful
business leaders, most notably a proposal to tighten restrictions
on damage suits.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as governor, Siegelman, who ousted James last fall, is
himself contending with a lieutenant governor from the other party,
Steve Windom. And things are contentious, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Windom is the first Republican to be elected lieutenant governor
of Alabama this century. He was voted in with the strong financial
backing of business groups _ he spent more than $5 million in all _
and the first thing he promised in his victory speech was to use
his power to block a legislative vote on Siegelman's favorite
cause, creation of a state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   But Siegelman struck first, persuading the Democrat-controlled
state Senate a few weeks back to strip away the traditional power
of lieutenant governors to appoint committees and direct
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Windom, reduced to little more than a ceremonial figure, says he
may counter by taking the governor to court. ``We didn't elect him
dictator,'' he groused the other day.
</P>
<P>
   California's GOP Falls on Hard Times
</P>
<P>
   When California Republicans gather next weekend in Sacramento
for their annual convention, some may wonder if they are at a wake.
Consider:
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat is newly installed in the governor's office _ the
first in 16 years. Both houses of the state Legislature are under
Democratic control, more firmly now than in years past. The state's
two U.S. senators are Democrats, one re-elected last year and the
other headed for what looks like certain re-election next year.
</P>
<P>
   Further, a solid majority of the state's House delegation is
Democratic, with a third or more of the Republican members worried
that repercussions from the Clinton impeachment trial may cost them
the seats that they won only narrowly in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes even more bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, The Contra Costa Times took a close look at voter
registration trends over the last three months in 10 counties
around the state. Its finding:
</P>
<P>
   Through most of the 1990s, California, like most states, saw a
slowdown in Democratic and Republican registration and an increase
in independents. But the pace of Democratic registration appears to
be picking up again, or at least no longer slipping, whereas
Republican registration continues to lag and even slip.
</P>
<P>
   The paper found the shifts in numbers to be small, usually less
than a percentage point. ``But coming in just three months, they
are significant,'' it concluded, noting that the Clinton
impeachment trial took place during the period covered.
</P>
<P>
   In the East Bay area, east of San Francisco, the newspaper's
home territory, it found Democrats gaining strength and Republicans
losing. In Orange County, a Republican stronghold south of Los
Angeles, Democrats held their ground but Republicans lost strength
as independents gained. And in San Diego, Democrats and
independents both had a slight gain in strength, whereas
Republicans slipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going well for us,'' Bob Mulholland, a leading
Democratic strategist, told the paper.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican strategist, Dora Kingsley, did not disagree.
``We're not getting our message across,''she lamented.
</P>
<P>
   This Time Around, Kennedy Is Preparing
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., got a bit of a scare five years
ago when he ran for re-election. Overconfident after more than
three decades in office and focused more on his powerful position
on Capitol Hill than on the condition of his political fences back
home, he was slow, almost indifferent, about getting out of the
blocks, and his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, got an early jump
on him.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Romney, a wealthy businessman whose father, George, was
governor of Michigan and a presidential candidate in the 1960s,
actually was out front in the polls at one point.
</P>
<P>
   But then Kennedy began to pour in effort and money ($11.5
million eventually) and in the end won going away.
</P>
<P>
   Looking toward 2000, when he will be up for re-election again,
the senator seems to be keeping the lessons of 1994 firmly in mind.
For the last six months or so, he has been working the phones hard
in search of campaign money and has been showing up all over
Massachusetts at gatherings large and small, meeting and greeting.
His intent, aides say, is to demonstrate early strength and scare
off any potential challengers.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the oldest campaign tactics in the book, one that
often works. But Geoffrey Rehnert hasn't been scared off. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnert, a wealthy Republican fund-raiser and a member of Bain
Capital, the same venture capital firm that Mitt Romney once
belonged to, told The Boston Globe the other day that the odds were
``50-50 and trending upwards'' that he would challenge the senator.

 WILLIAM D. McELROY, RESEARCHER OF FIREFLIES' FLASH, DIES AT 82 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William D. McElroy, a biologist and administrator who never
abandoned his first love in research, fireflies, died on Wednesday
at Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego. He was 82 and lived in
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   McElroy was the director of the National Science Foundation for
three years during the Nixon administration and chancellor of the
University of California at San Diego for eight years after that.
But interspersed with his administrative jobs was a career in
research on bioluminescence that made him the leading authority on
the flashing bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Working at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, McElroy and
his colleagues uncovered the basic mechanism behind the flash,
which involves an enzymatic reaction and the compound ATP, or
adenosine triphosphate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a period of basic science,'' recalled J. Woodland
Hastings, a Harvard biologist who worked with McElroy at Johns
Hopkins. Fireflies were a ready subject for studies of
bioluminescence, about which little was known. ``They were not only
an example, but a leading example, and they were available,
especially in Baltimore.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers organized local schoolchildren to collect the
bugs, paying a bounty of 25 cents per hundred. Hundreds of
thousands of fireflies were gathered each summer, including more
than 37,000 by one 14-year-old boy in August 1952.
</P>
<P>
   William David McElroy was born in Rogers, Texas, and received an
undergraduate degree from Stanford University. He got a master's
from Reed College and a doctorate from Princeton University. He
came to Hopkins in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   He showed an early aptitude for administration, setting up the
McCollum-Pratt Institute, which researches nutrition issues, in the
early 1950s, and serving as chairman of the Hopkins biology
department from 1956 to 1969, when he was nominated to head the
National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   McElroy was the second choice for the job. The nomination of
Franklin A. Long, a Cornell chemist, was withdrawn by the White
House after it was discovered that Long had opposed a favorite
Administration project, the antiballistic missile system.
</P>
<P>
   McElroy, a Democrat, ``didn't like Nixon either,'' Hastings
recalled. ``But he didn't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   McElroy left the agency in 1972 to become chancellor of the
University of California at San Diego, where he was again a
compromise choice between those who wanted a disciplinarian and
others who favored someone with a strong scholastic background.
</P>
<P>
   While chancellor, he also served for two years as president of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He kept up
his research interests as well, working with his second wife,
Marlene DeLuca, who was also a biologist, on the genetic basis for
bioluminescence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was probably the consummate administrator,'' said Ed
Jablonski, who worked with McElroy and his wife in San Diego. ``But
he had such an insight into science that he couldn't help himself.
When he'd come home after being chancellor, he'd want to talk about
science.''
</P>
<P>
   McElroy's first marriage, to the former Nella Winch, ended in
divorce. DeLuca died in 1987. McElroy is survived by his wife, Olga
Robles McElroy; a sister, Lola Rector of Pismo Beach, Calif.; a
son, Eric of San Marcos, Calif., by his second wife, and two sons
and two daughters by his first wife: Mary McElroy of Boston, Ann
McElroy of Hickory, N.C., Thomas McElroy of Glen Arm, Md., and
William McElroy of Woods Hole, Mass.

 &HT;    Big dreams plentiful for Big Dog
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They don't talk about Glenn ``Big Dog'' Robinson when
the discussion is the NBA game excelling without Michael Jordan,
and, really, there's something inherently wrong with that. All the
1994 No. 1 pick out of Purdue has done since being selected by the
Milwaukee Bucks is average 21.4 points while being a solid citizen
off the court. He's got game.
</P>
<P>
   But he gets _ pardon the pun _ dogged when it comes to
recognition. When he was a rookie, Robinson averaged 21.9 points,
was the only first-year player to win the NBA Rookie of the Month
award twice, and yet Grant Hill of Detroit and Dallas' Jason Kidd
were named co-rookies of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, when critics complained because Robinson was selected to
Dream Team II, the 6-foot-7, 230-pound forward took himself off the
squad. Although he continued to put up impressive numbers playing
alongside Vin Baker, it was Baker who made the all-star team and
who got league-wide recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jordan is gone and the list of wannabes extends from Kobe
Bryant to Tim Duncan to Hill to Penny Hardaway to a dozen or so
others. But no Big Dog Robinson, although he's been more consistent
than most of them.
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson's playoff record gets in the way. He doesn't have
one. And even he understands that it matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I've always said, I feel like I'm one of the best small
forwards in the Eastern Conference and the NBA,'' Robinson said.
``Individually, I have great numbers. The only thing that separates
Glenn Robinson from Scottie Pippen and some of the other great
small forwards is they have W's. They have been to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks entered the season with a 128-200 record during
Robinson's time, with no postseason berths. But with new coach and
proven winner George Karl, Milwaukee _ and the Big Dog _ have
higher aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really look at it as a new start,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Karl, accomplished at meshing personalities, likes what he sees
in Robinson so far. But the lasting effects of losing remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenn has been great,'' Karl said, ``but I still see, not just
from Glenn, but everybody, some of those frustration scars of a
couple of years of losing.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, Robinson sometimes reverts to the player who forced the
issue offensively on a talent-starved team. With point guard
Terrell Brandon, rising star Ray Allen and a group of complementary
players, Karl's quest is to get Robinson to be multi-faceted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can be an all-star in this game by being a
one-dimensional player,'' Karl said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has shown a willingness to change his game and produce
victories, to be a better defender, passer and rebounder. ``I think
Glenn is driven to be a great player,'' Karl said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his greatness is on offense. Robinson forced overtime in
the season-opener in Charlotte with a jumper at the buzzer and hit
another jumper with 0.1 seconds left to win a game at Philadelphia
last week. But he averaged 17.3 points going into the weekend, an
indication of his willingness to share the load for the good of the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about what other people think, because deep down
inside I know what I can do,'' Robinson said. ``I'm going to prove
everybody wrong because I will be a part of a great team. I will be
on a championship team one day, and all the negative thoughts in
people's minds about Glenn Robinson will be totally erased.

   ATLANTA _ The best quarterback in the NBA has developed into a

   He went from playing just 10 games as a rookie to a starter on a
team with championship aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes Charlie so good for us,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy
said, ``is that he doesn't need the ball to make plays. He creates
things with his keen sense of knowing where to be on the court. And
when he does have the ball, he's always looking to make a play for
someone else. He's totally unselfish.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his reputation in some circles for alleged cheap shots,
the part of Ward's persona that could be most valuable to the
Knicks is his character.
</P>
<P>
   Ward has taken the responsibility of offering the notorious
Sprewell subtle guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latrell, like anyone else, needs to know the right path,''
Ward said. ``I'm there for him, like all my teammates. It's part of
being a teammate and a man.''
</P>
<P>
   STACKED WITH PROBLEMS
</P>
<P>
   If you noticed poor shooting statistics from Detroit's Jerry
Stackhouse recently, cut him some slack. He's been distracted, even
if he won't admit it, by the death of his sister, Lois. She died of
diabetes last week.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second sister he has lost in the last six years to
diabetes. And his mother and father also have it. Stackhouse has
not been diagnosed with diabetes, but he's aware that it could
develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I need to keep getting it checked,'' he said. ``I went
when I was in Philadelphia, but it wasn't a problem. But that's a
question I had, too, with the history of it in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Stackhouse went 0-for-7 against Orlando on Thursday, 1-for-11
against the Knicks earlier. Stackhouse at one point was just
7-for-27 from the field. But he said his misfiring was not a result
of his grieving.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was from, of all people, all-star Grant Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grant has been on a tear, and that's been great for him,''
Stackhouse said. ``But I don't think it's been so great for our
team. I think we've become stagnant in watching him. If you're
coming down the court, and you haven't touched the ball the last
two or three times down, it's hard to go down and chase a guy and
do all the little things you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the bottom line for Stackhouse is: ``I want the ball more.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill has refused to fire back at his cohort _ so far.
</P>
<P>
   THEY SAID IT
</P>
<P>
   _ ``No, I don't have any concern. They could, and maybe they
should, (fire me). I don't know.'' Charlotte coach Dave Cowens said
after publicly noting that he's the lowest-paid coach in the NBA at
$675,000 and that if he didn't get a raise after the season, he
would quit
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I must have killed somebody in a past life.'' Cleveland
center Zydrunas Ilgauskas after learning his season was over with a
broken foot
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I could have worn a thong.'' Miami swingman Dan Majerle, who
was omitted from this year's Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue
after an appearance last year.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   To Sacramento's Chris Webber. The exciting forward made it
public that he did not want to play for the Kings, and yet he's
playing the best ball of his career. He had seven double-doubles in
the first seven games and led Sacramento's upset overtime win
Wednesday over previously unbeaten Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   To Seattle's Vin Baker. For all the chatter about Shaquille
O'Neal's poor foul-shooting, Baker has been horrifying at the line.
He missed his first 18 free throws before making one. It has become
a mind thing for the SuperSonics' all-star forward. Still, pros
must do much better than that.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Turnaround in Ottawa
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the uninitiated, would-be hockey fans in the
South, here's a rough guide to Ottawa: Take I-85 to Richmond,
forget the left to Charlottesville, proceed north to Pennsylvania,
forget the right to Atlantic City, continue north, cross the
Canadian border into the province of Ontario and if you hit Hull _
the city, not the player _ you went too far.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that if the Canadian capital and its hockey
team haven't come up in conversation, fear not, for you're not
alone. Amid all the talk about the Dallas Stars' domination of
Detroit and everybody else, winning streaks by Colorado and
Pittsburgh and the assault on goalies by Philadelphia's John
LeClair and Eric Lindros, the Ottawa Senators were the third NHL
team to reach 30 wins. They surprisingly lead the Northeast
Division, ahead of Toronto, Buffalo, Boston and Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is talking about us, and that's fine,'' said defenseman
Lance Pitlick, one of several non-household names on the Senators'
roster. ``As Atlanta will find out, it takes a while to establish
yourself in the NHL. Even last year when we beat New Jersey in the
playoffs, all we heard was what New Jersey didn't do, not what we
did. Maybe soon, people will realize we're one of the elite
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Elite? Ottawa? Since entering the league as an expansion
franchise in 1992, the Senators had been a study in buffoonery:
</P>
<P>
   _ They finished last four seasons in a row.
</P>
<P>
   _ Twice in negotiations, they so infuriated No. 1 draft picks _
Radek Bonk and Alexei Yashin _ that the players signed with a
minor-league team in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   _ The team was fined $100,000 in 1993 when then-owner Bruce
Firestone suggested that tanking games would be a good idea to
secure the No. 1 draft pick. (Thus, the NHL lottery was born.)
</P>
<P>
   _ The arena locker rooms were robbed one year. All the video
equipment was stolen _ but the thief left the game tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were a long shot to even get into the league,''
said Ottawa president Roy Mlakar, an executive with Los Angeles at
the time of expansion. ``Unfortunately, when Ottawa got the
franchise, there were a lot of organizational problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Gauthier changed that. Hired as the team's third general
manager in 1995, Gauthier, who had been an assistant GM in Anaheim,
began a series of roster moves that shaped the club into a
conservative but smart team that made the playoffs two consecutive
seasons, including last year's upset of the Devils in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   But Gauthier resigned after the season, citing exhaustion and
personal reasons. It was known that his family was not enamored of
Ottawa. But Gauthier found himself deflecting rumors that he merely
was angling for the Anaheim job when he said he was moving back to
California. A firestorm in Canada then turned into a raging inferno
two weeks later when, indeed, the Disney-owned Ducks hired
Gauthier. Added to that, the Senators declined to pursue tampering
charges and/or seek compensation. Gauthier has proclaimed
innocence, and Mlakar backed him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be suspicious if Pierre and I didn't have an
excellent relationship and if I didn't have a 25-year relationship
with (Disney executive) Tony Tavares,'' Mlakar said. ``I'm 100
percent convinced when he left here he did not intend to go to
another job in hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier remains a villain to most in Ottawa, but the team is
thriving under coach Jacques Martin and new GM Rick Dudley. The
Senators play a style that Mlakar admits is ``boring to everybody
outside of Ottawa.'' They take few chances on offense and play
strong team defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a change from the early years,'' said Pitlick, who
is in his fifth season. ``Back then, this organization was in such
disarray. Guys just completely goofed up. We were playing in a
makeshift arena (while the Corel Centre was being built). It felt
like you were still in the minors. But we've gone from the whipping
boys of the league to one of the top teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Although that still remains somewhat of a secret.

 &HT;    Rink owner: `No hard feelings'
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Bardis, owner of The Cooler in Alpharetta, said
he has ``no hard feelings'' that the Thrashers are about to close a
deal for a practice facility with the Ice Forum in Duluth. The
Thrashers had negotiated with The Cooler first, but talks fell
apart after Turner Sports executives declined to foot the bill for
a 15,000-square-foot facility, which will cost approximately $1.7
million. The Ice Forum will build the facility and another sheet of
ice at a cost of $3.2 million, then lease the space to the
Thrashers. ``The fact that the Thrashers are coming to town is good
for all of us in this (ice-rink) business,'' Bardis said. ``They're
drawing fans to the sport. I have no hard feelings about the fact
they chose to go to Duluth. They had to do what's in their best
interest financially. We would've welcomed them at The Cooler, but
their economic objectives and our economic objectives were not
aligned in the short term.'' For what it's worth, Bardis is buying
season tickets. ... General manager Don Waddell is on a 14-day
scouting trip that included a stop in Calgary for last week's ``Top
Prospects'' game, which included 40 potential draft picks from the
Canadian junior leagues. One player was Quebec defenseman Martin
Grenier, who has 357 penalty minutes in 54 games. He was the only
all-star in the game with more than 300 PIM. ... In a skills
competition among the prospects, Grenier registered the hardest
slaps hot, at 96.3 mph. Forward Jamie Lundmark of Moose Jaw
finished among the top five in four events and set a record in the
60-foot dash at 2.541 seconds. He also won the 150-foot dash
(5.587) and ranked third in shot and puck-control events. Sudbury
forward Taylor Pratt won the fastest skater competition, circling a
rink at 14.139.

 &HT;    Turkey season approaches
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An army of more than 100,000 will be moving through
the forests of Georgia from March 20 through May 15, a special kind
of army.
</P>
<P>
   This army skulks in the misty predawn hours clucking and
gobbling like turkeys, hoping to bag the crafty Eastern wild
turkey.
</P>
<P>
   There will be men, women, even children like the eight-year-old
Landt twins, Nick and Rory of Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Their dad, Jim Landt, 38, will take the Tinsley Elementary
third-graders with him. They won't have guns; they'll just be
learning the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest, though, they'll experience the adrenaline rush
when they hear a gobble in answer to their dad's owl call just
before sunrise. . . .
</P>
<P>
   They'll gasp with exertion and excitement as they move in
careful haste toward the sound. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And they'll get giddy and grow goosebumps when an old gobbler
comes strutting into view. . . .
</P>
<P>
   If they've done their homework in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Wildlife Federation's Turkeyrama last weekend
offered the chance to talk to a pair of the state's better turkey
hunters about what to do in the preseason to increase the chance of
a successful hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Roscoe Reams, 74, of Morrow hunted turkeys in Georgia before the
big restoration and is the recognized expert. He is in great demand
as a seminar speaker and as a guide.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Chase, 46, of McDonough accomplished turkey hunting's
``World Slam'' _ all seven species _ in only one year. She shares
her experiences in her Slammin' Jan's Turkey Chase booth at various
shows and in seminars.
</P>
<P>
   The two know and respect each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first time I ever saw Jan,'' Roscoe said. ``I
was teaching a seminar, and she jumped up, holding up this Quaker
Boy `Easy Yelper,' saying, `I got my first turkey using this call.'
She's come a long way since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase replied, ``As a matter of fact, I am still using the same
Quaker Boy call he mentioned. I have probably taken over 90 percent
of my birds using that call. That sure was a great bit of advice he
gave me years and years ago. I admire and respect that man
tremendously _ always have.''
</P>
<P>
   The advice both give works on private land as well as Wildlife
Management Areas. Both are independent and do a thorough scouting
job, no matter what ``experts'' tell them about an area.
</P>
<P>
   Their general technique is similar because Chase has learned so
much from Reams.
</P>
<P>
   While thousands of men try to imitate a hen's clucks, purrs and
other sexy sounds to entice a gobbler, Chase has a different
approach.
</P>
<P>
   After declaring Rule No. 1 _ Don't use a turkey call in
preseason scouting _ Chase says, ``Birds on public land are called
to death and are used to aggressive calling. Use gentle calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Reams explains why hunters should leave their turkey calls at
home: ``Turkeys remember calls. When you are scouting, the worst
thing you can do is carry your turkey call with you. You'll use it,
and that's the worst thing you can do.'' The gobbler will remember
that call and won't respond to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use owl, crow, hawk or other locator calls (to make
them gobble), but not a turkey call,'' Reams said.
</P>
<P>
   Both warn about scouting too soon. Within their habitat, turkeys
migrate with the availability of food.
</P>
<P>
   During scouting, Reams said, walk the shady sides of fields and
other openings looking for droppings, shed feathers and tracks. In
areas with a healthy acorn crop, work waterways _ creeks and
streams _ scouting logging roads parallel to creeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water and turkeys go together,'' Reams declared.
</P>
<P>
   Chase looks for burns, either prescribed or accidental, because
``the ones you find in February will be a mecca for turkeys by the
time the season opens.''
</P>
<P>
   While scouting, she looks for food sources, droppings, tracks _
``I'm big on tracks'' _ at edges of fields, pastures and
clear-cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Reams said, ``Don't worry about finding gobbler tracks. If you
find hen tracks, that's fine. Gobblers have to go where hens are in
the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that, because of warm weather, gobblers already are
strutting, ``but they don't control things. The temperature doesn't
control the urge _ the amount of light available each day does and
the days aren't long enough yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase: ``Find out where everyone else wants to be and go
elsewhere. Find out where guys in hunt clubs say you shouldn't go.
That's where I'll be. They're there: They're just smart birds.''
</P>
<P>
   And more: ``Find a place you don't find all the vehicles.'' On
WMAs, hunters tend to stay close to roads. A little extra walking
pays big dividends.

 &HT;    Cajun lawyer takes on oil companies
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUMA, La. _ Michael St. Martin cranked up the roaring engine on
his airboat, put on ear protection and dark sunglasses, and checked
the time on his Rolex watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go for a ride,'' he said as he shot the airboat through
a skinny alley in the tall marsh grasses. The closeness gave way to
a vast open marsh covered with a carpet of viny vegetation, and St.
Martin sped up and skittered across the surface so fast it seemed
the boat would take flight.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in Cajun country between New Orleans and the Gulf of
Mexico, this waterworld of marsh and swamp is St. Martin's
``2,400-acre hobby.'' He has roamed it since he was a child, built
his estate next to it in the 1980s, and finally bought it in 1992.
It looks pristine and almost prehistoric: Alligator eyes poke out
of the water every few minutes, ducks fly overhead by the
thousands, coots fly in black masses and rest like carpets on the
surface of the water, and huge swamp rats, called nutria, dart
between the hanging moss and the gnarled trunks of cypress trees.
Swamp maples are in bloom and look like pink torches against the
deep greens, grays and browns of winter.
</P>
<P>
   This is the land St. Martin went to court to protect in a
lawsuit that could set new precedent in environmental claims.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-foot-wide canals cutting through the marsh like city
streets were dredged decades ago by oil companies with mineral
rights to the oil and gas below the surface of the watery land. St.
Martin does not receive money from the leases because he owns only
the surface of the swamp.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to breaks in the canal levees. A current of water
flows freely back and forth from the canals into other parts of the
marsh every time there's a boat or barge on the nearby Intracoastal
Waterway.
</P>
<P>
   Those breaks, he said, are an environmental disaster which,
unchecked, will turn the entire marsh into a lake, unable to
support any of the wildlife now flourishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the oil industry at its finest,'' St. Martin said, and
shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   In January, as a result of a 1997 lawsuit filed by St. Martin,
U.S. District Judge Marcel Livaudais Jr. ordered two major oil
companies to repair the breaks in the canals, and awarded St.
Martin $240,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been lawsuits against oil companies for
property damage, this case is unusual. It holds the companies
responsible for something that has been accepted as the way things
are done for as long as anyone can remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever takes them to task and says, `You can't just
leave,''' said St. Martin, a 56-year-old attorney and Houma native.
``As far as I'm concerned, this is now the war cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobil Exploration and Producing U.S. Inc., which had the mineral
rights under St. Martin's property until 1995, and Phillips
Petroleum Co., which has them now, deny the damage was caused by
their canals. They say the marsh is becoming submerged because of a
variety of natural and human causes for which they can't be held
responsible. And they dispute St. Martin's claim on the grounds
that the erosion existed when he bought the property in 1992. They
are appealing.
</P>
<P>
   But many landowners could follow St. Martin's lead, and oil
companies across Louisiana might wind up spending millions of
dollars repairing open spots in canals. Already, St. Martin has
plans to sue several other oil companies for damage to his land,
and he is helping the Terrebonne Parish School Board to sue any
companies that have damaged its land, which is adjacent to his.
</P>
<P>
   Every school board in Louisiana owns land, given to them in 1820
as a means of funding school systems. Much of it is wetlands, which
means they are cut through with oil and gas canals. School boards
alone, could account for dozens of suits.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin would like to see courts force the oil industry not
only to repair the breaks in the canals, but also to erase the
canals they no longer use by filling them with silt and replanting
marsh grasses. In his case, the court ruled that would be so
expensive _ millions of dollars _ that it would not be reasonable,
considering St. Martin paid $245 an acre for the land. But that
might not be the case in other suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were those oil companies, I'd be very nervous,'' said
Charlie Storrs, regional coordinator for the National Wetlands
Inventory in Atlanta, a project of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. ``There are so many canals that have never been filled,
and the price of oil has dropped so low, they may not have the
resources to fix the problem.'' For decades, oil companies have
leased the mineral rights below the surface of Louisiana's marshes
and swamps. The cheapest way to get in and drill is to dredge a
canal, and as a result, there are now 10,000 miles of oil and gas
canals criss-crossing Louisiana's wetlands. Lease agreements state
that the oil companies must maintain them, and they hold the
companies liable for any damages they cause to the property.
</P>
<P>
   But, St. Martin said, ``in most cases, like 99 percent, the
companies just depleted the reserves and left. A lot of them didn't
so much as remove a well head or a piling.'' During the trial, a
Mobil employee testified that the company has no program in place
for maintaining canals, and certainly no budget exists for filling
in the ones they have stopped using.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that the wetlands, which make up almost a third
of the state, are eroding at a stunning rate. Louisiana lost
518,000 acres of wetlands from 1970 to 1980, according to the
National Wetlands Inventory. One expert for the defense testified
during the St. Martin trial that in 30 to 50 years, several
parishes in southeast Louisiana _ places tens of thousands of
Louisianans call home _ could disappear under water.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is what is responsible for the land loss. Testifying
for St. Martin, Robert Chabreck of Louisiana State University said
that 100 percent of the damage to the marsh could be blamed on the
canals. However, experts for the defense, also from LSU, testified
that a variety of factors ranging from hurricanes to nutrias caused
the erosion, and the canals were only a minor player.
</P>
<P>
   The federal and state governments blame breaks in the
Mississippi River levees for much of the damage to Louisiana's
wetlands. Storrs said the canals are just one of many factors
contributing to the erosion, along with breaks in the levees,
natural subsidence and saltwater intrusion into freshwater marshes.
But he said his department has not done a study on how canals
specifically have contributed to wetland loss.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Houck, director of the Environmental Law Clinic at Tulane
University, said blaming the river levees is ``the government
line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are reluctant to tighten regulations on the oil and gas
industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most studies by independent scientists attribute anywhere from
50 percent to 95 percent of the wetland damage to the canals, Houck
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The canal cuts through a living system and interrupts all the
functions,'' he said. ``It would be just like a cut in your belly.
One or two acres of canals can put 100 to 200 acres of marsh into a
death spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   In the St. Martin case, the judge concluded that 60 percent of
the damage in St. Martin's marsh was due to the canals.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's case, Houck said, shows that private initiative can
step in when the government is doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important case, because it may start requiring oil
companies to pay the bill,'' he said. ``They have been walking away
from this stuff for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The canals at the heart of St. Martin's suit were dredged in the
1950s and '60s by Superior Oil, the predecessor to Mobil. The
company had leased the mineral rights from then-owner Southdown
Sugars to look for gas and oil. The previous owners never objected
to the canals.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Martin bought that property in 1992 and the canals and the
alleged damage were already there,'' said John Scofield, an
attorney for Mobil. Moreover, Scofield said, he was surprised by
the money awarded to St. Martin. The court decided to award him
$10,000 an acre for a 24-acre area that has been damaged since he
bought the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Supreme Court case holds you can't claim damages in an
amount in excess of the property value,'' he said. ``He bought the
property for $245 an acre. That's a pretty good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But this case isn't about money, St. Martin said. St. Martin,
who likes to call himself ``just a Cajun lawyer,'' is also a
prosperous '90s guy. He likes to listen to New Age Irish singer
Enya while he drives around in his Lincoln Navigator, an alligator
briefcase parked on the back seat. Another Navigator, two Mercedes
and several shiny powerboats are parked beside his large home on
the edge of his swamp. He owns about 10,000 acres of Louisiana
marsh, swamp and farmland. And he has a successful law practice
suing oil companies _ not for environmental damages, until now, but
in workers compensation cases.
</P>
<P>
   The swamp and philanthropy are in St. Martin's blood. He lives
next door to a home for battered and abused children that his
father established 25 years ago. The kids come over almost every
day to swim in his pool or relax in his hot tub.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he bought 7,000 acres of marsh and swamp behind his
home, kept 2,400 acres and immediately set aside the rest for the
Nature Conservancy to create a wildlife refuge. Because the
conservancy couldn't afford to buy the land, St. Martin helped them
raise money, getting Dow Chemical to make a large donation and
donating $140,000 to the cause.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to put the $240,000 he won from the lawsuit right back
into the swamp, he said, using it to restore what he can or buy
additional property.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants the oil companies to repair what they damaged
because it's the right thing to do, but also because he says he
doesn't have the expertise or the equipment to repair it himself.
</P>
<P>
   And though it might sound like St. Martin is an environment nut
with a grudge against the oil and gas industry, that is not the
case. St. Martin has a permit to catch and kill 70 alligators every
fall, and he likes hunting so much his finger ``gets itchy'' when
he sees all the ducks in his marsh.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps most surprising, he owns an oil company. He even
drills in his own marsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in oil fields,'' St. Martin said. His grandfather
was a rig builder, and his father owned several oil service
companies. St. Martin earned money while he was in law school by
driving a tanker truck, and he is a member of the Teamsters union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil and gas and the environment can get along together,'' he
said as he sidled the airboat up to a production rig. ``I spent
$750,000 extra . . . It costs a little more money to do business in
an environmentally safe way. The consumer should just learn to pay
a penny a gallon more to do what's right.

 &HT;    N.C. park success based on teamwork
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt

<TEXT>
<P>
   RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. _ Poor George is a goner, a
virtual-reality victim at the Research Triangle Institute.
</P>
<P>
   George, a computerized talking head, responded too slowly in
conversations with people. So he was replaced by fast-talking Rocky
and Roxanne, the rising stars at the institute, the Research
Triangle Park's oldest tenant.
</P>
<P>
   The pair of hip, high-tech 30-somethings illustrates some of the
latest fast-moving but practical research under way at the
institute. Its recent efforts in virtual reality also demonstrate
how the nonprofit research organization has dutifully clung to its
original mission of collaborating with the three universities that
started it in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina
State University in Raleigh and Duke University in Durham own the
institute.
</P>
<P>
   The institute operates independent of the universities and it
solicits research funds, expected to reach $200 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collaboration has been crucial,'' said Alvin M. Cruze, the
institute's interim president, who joined the staff in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Created in an era when independent research was rare in a region
dominated by textiles and farming, the institute has prospered
beyond the expectations of its founders.
</P>
<P>
   With a staff of 1,525 worldwide, including 1,325 on its 180-acre
campus in Research Triangle Park, the institute conducts research
under contract to government agencies, companies and foundations,
such as the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, NASA and pharmaceutical giant Glaxo Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   In its largest project, worth $205 million over eight years, the
institute is conducting a national survey on drug abuse for the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Sales of one of the
institute's anticancer discoveries, Taxol, approached $1 billion
last year for Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
</P>
<P>
   The institute opened an office in Atlanta last fall to be near
one of its clients, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The institute earned $4.2 million in revenue last year from the
CDC. It is involved in nine CDC projects, including national
surveys of smoking behavior and studying school health programs.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's research spans many fields, including economics,
chemicals,electronics and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of placing a research laboratory in the university
environment was fairly rare at that time,'' said George Simpson,
77, chancellor of the University of Georgia system from 1965 to
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was a UNC-Chapel Hill sociology professor who in 1956
became executive director of the committee created to establish the
institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's call it a long shot,'' Simpson described the institute's
initial odds for success.
</P>
<P>
   State leaders, including Gov. Luther Hodges, were troubled by
North Carolina's dependence on low wages in textiles, farming and
furniture. They envisioned tapping the universities' budding
research efforts to create an institute that, in turn, would anchor
a major research park to attract high-paying employers.
</P>
<P>
   When it decided five years ago to venture into virtual reality,
which creates a three-dimensional, interactive experience, the
institute sought one of the field's early developers, UNC-Chapel
Hill computer scientist Fred Brooks. He helped the institute select
computers and software to demonstrate virtual reality to potential
customers. The institute chose to invest its efforts in training, a
largely untapped market.
</P>
<P>
   It developed a virtual medical trainer prototype for the U.S.
Army that recreated on a computer monitor emergency scenes such as
an automobile crash and sniper fire. The institute is negotiating
with a publisher interested in selling the program on CD-ROM to
emergency medical agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to present a true-to-life representation of a
trauma, so the student can practice assessment and treatment,
especially in the first 10 minutes of coming onto the scene,'' said
Paul Kizakevich, a senior research engineer at the institute.
Another project was to develop virtual humans to provide training
for businesses. Last spring, researchers developed George, a
sometimes surly bank customer who wanted to cash a $25 check.
</P>
<P>
   His head bobbed and his lips moved as he told the teller, ``My
account number here is 1,2,3.''
</P>
<P>
   As he received two fives, a ten and five ones, his forehead
knitted and he scowled. ``I am not satisfied with your branch,'' he
said. George had a fatal flaw.
</P>
<P>
   He always paused for a couple of seconds, creating a jerky
conversation. That would diminish the effectiveness of training
customer service representatives, such as airline reservationists,
who handle a rapid succession of calls.
</P>
<P>
   George was retired and along came Rocky and Roxanne.
</P>
<P>
   The pair was a big hit recently at a national convention in Las
Vegas, where passersby were surprised to find themselves engaged in
conversation with virtual humans.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky and Roxanne were to demonstrate how they could assist real
people in manning booths at trade shows. Not only could that save
money, but it also could create excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is cool,'' said Dean Hering, the institute's manager of
commercial projects for virtual reality. ``People get hyped up
about it.''

 &HT;    Bumper-to-bumper traffic congestion clouds town's future
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORRISVILLE, N.C. _ For Grover and Peggy Lewter, a retired
couple who live on the outskirts of this fast-growing Research
Triangle town, one rule of the road exceeds all others. Don't
drive, if you can avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   Grover, 66, owns a red Chevy pickup, his 63-year-old wife a
beige Chevy Impala. They keep horses, chickens and two dogs,
Trouble and Amy, on six acres developers have been drooling over
for years.
</P>
<P>
   They've learned that, during rush hour, only fools _ and
thousands of Research Triangle Park commuters _ travel the
bumper-to-bumper stretch of Davis Drive that fronts the Lewters'
tidy brick home of 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the two-lane highway was partially paved, and traffic
was so scarce that Lewter went to the mailbox in his underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw about two cars a day come up and down the road, and
one of them was the mailman,'' Peggy Lewter said.
</P>
<P>
   The mail comes later now, slowed by the congestion of the
estimated 25,000 vehicles that pass every weekday. The couple
rarely ventures out between 7:30 and 10 a.m. or between 4:30 and 7
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is Wednesday night. Then it takes up to 30 minutes
to drive the mile and a half to supper and the prayer meeting at
Good Hope Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Short of divine intervention, it's hard to fathom how traffic is
going to get much better.
</P>
<P>
   With mind-boggling growth forecast for the region, the
congestion is expected to worsen until highway improvements
projected to cost $435 million are completed.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly frustrating in this region that boasts one of
America's highest concentrations of PhD.s has been the inability of
civic and political leaders to get much of a handle on traffic
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is bad but not as bad as Atlanta,'' said Scott Lane, a
long-range planner in Raleigh. ``But we are trying hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Lured by the Research Triangle's booming economy, people are
flocking to jobs centered on the research park. And 25,000 new jobs
are forecast for the region this year.
</P>
<P>
   But congestion threatens to stymie growth. One of the Research
Triangle Park's fastest-growing companies, computer networking
giant Cisco Systems, has raised public concerns about its ability
to meet expansion goals if traffic doesn't improve.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the Research Triangle could only dream of the
prosperity that has sprouted from the concentration of global
technology companies. In an ever-widening circle, small towns such
as Morrisville find themselves grappling with kudzu-like growth.
</P>
<P>
   Population estimates in Morrisville rocket from 2,808 in 1998:
5,439 this year, 14,250 in 2005 and 18,705 in 2010. The number of
dwelling units is forecast to jump by 466 percent, from 1,783 in
1995 to 10,095 in 2025.
</P>
<P>
   A 270 percent increase is expected in the number of people
working in Morrisville, from 10,334 in 1995 to 38,225 in 2025,
according to a forecast last year by the Capital Area Metropolitan
Planning Organization and the Durham-Chapel Hill-Carrboro
Metropolitan Planning Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Morrisville having 3,000 people, and you say this
is a small town,'' Town Manager David Hodgkins said. ``Then you
look at all of the people passing through and working here during
the day.'' Its proximity to the Research Triangle Park and
Raleigh-Durham International Airport has transformed Morrisville
into an industrial and commercial hub. As a result, the town's tax
base amounts to $228,000 a person.
</P>
<P>
   The town's prosperity is deceiving, Hodgkins said, because its
soaring population of residents and office workers is pressuring
municipal services. In a state whose nicknames include ``The Good
Roads State,'' North Carolina Transportation Secretary Norris
Tolson has recommended radical remedies to ease traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding one more highway or one more lane will not be enough,''
he said. ``We cannot just pave our way out of this congestion.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Transportation Department plans to widen I-40 and
other major roads, but it and other regional planning agencies are
recommending other steps, such as expanding bus routes and
encouraging greater car and van pooling.
</P>
<P>
   In a $250 million project slated for completion in 2004, the
Triangle Transit Authority plans to build a regional rail system
connecting Raleigh, Cary, Apex and Durham with the Research
Triangle Park.
</P>
<P>
   Tolson has suggested companies in the research park encourage
employees to telecommute and consider charging them for parking.
None of these is a sure-fire solution, partly because of the
sprawling design of Research Triangle Park. Nobody lives in the
6,900-acre park, so the roughly 50,000 people employees must
commute.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are scattered across the park, and office buildings
are set back from the roads. That complicates transporting rail
passengers to their offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very difficult area to ever take root to mass
transit,'' said Jim Goodnight, president of SAS Institute, a
software manufacturer in Cary. ''We have a lot of people talking
about it, but nobody is ever going to ride.''

 &HT;    Telecommunications competition sparks a middle-age rejuvenation
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. _ A child of California's Silicon
Valley, Cisco Systems decided to grow up in the Research Triangle
Park. But it suddenly finds its computer networking playground
crowded by two other big kids, Lucent Technologies and Northern
Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   The telecom competition has spurred unprecedented growth in the
Research Triangle Park. Combined, Cisco, Lucent and Nortel are
constructing six buildings in the region and have other projects on
the drawing board to accommodate several thousand additional
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, North Carolina leaders set aside 6,900 acres
between Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill in hopes of luring
companies and government agencies engaged in research and
development. It was a far-fetched notion, to sprout technology like
corn from a desolate patch of pine trees and overgrown fields.
</P>
<P>
   But promoters touted its proximity to budding research efforts
at Duke University in Durham, the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Research Triangle Park finds itself in the midst of a
middle-age rejuvenation that promoters believe will strengthen its
international recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in telecommunications technology is so explosive,
said Cisco Senior Vice President Selby Wellman, that companies want
to hire experienced people rather than to hire college graduates
and train them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about the labor pool, you talk about your
competitors,'' said Wellman, who oversees a Research Triangle Park
work force that's grown from 56 in 1994 to 960 today. It's forecast
to reach 4,000 by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif.; Lucent, based in Murray Hill,
N.J.; and Nortel, based in Brampton, Ontario, are pouring hundreds
of millions of dollars into the Research Triangle region. The
investments have put the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area at the
leading edge of a telecommunications revolution fueled by data
networking and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The investments by Cisco, Lucent, Nortel _ global giants with
annual revenue topping $50 billion _ are also likely to lure other
companies to the Research Triangle seeking to tap into the
cutting-edge developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``As companies battle together in a local area, they increase
the productivity of the industry in the area,'' said high-tech
economist Patrick Howie of Dynamic Resource Solutions in St.
Davids, Pa. ``You have information spillovers and structural
economic gains that build upon themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Research Triangle region is one of the South's hottest
technology hubs, but it's growth hasn't been smooth. The recent
past illustrates the volatility of technology.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, two semiconductor plants owned by Mitsubishi
and Motorola have closed. In a corporate streamlining, Nortel
eliminated 875 jobs in the Research Triangle Park last fall, even
as it is constructing three buildings to accommodate growth in
areas of hot technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest is ``convergence'' technology, and Cisco,
Lucent and Nortel are gearing up in the Research Triangle for a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Big changes are forecast over the next decade for the world's
telephone networks. In simple terms, telephone lines once carried
only people's voices. Now they're transmitting increasing amounts
of computer data as the Internet's popularity soars.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom companies are in the early stages of integrating voice,
data and video on a single, high-speed network. Cisco, Lucent and
Nortel have decided to develop this technology in the Research
Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are huge, estimated globally as a $450 billion a year
market in voice and data networking sales. Many companies, big and
small, are joining the competition. It promises to reach a frenzied
pace in the Research Triangle Park, some officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It drives entrepreneurship within those major corporations,''
said William Glynn, director of Southeast Interactive Technology
Funds, a Durham-based venture capital firm. ``It drives innovation.
When there is innovation within companies, it creates spinoffs.
That only adds to the critical mass that we are experiencing in the
Research Triangle Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The location was key. North Carolina leaders wanted to stop the
brain drain from the universities in an era when the state's
economy was tied largely to tobacco, textiles and furniture. The
latest surge of growth, officials said, reinforces the achievement
of that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, if you went to Duke, UNC-Chapel Hill or N.C. State
and had a graduate degree related to anything but agriculturally
related stuff, you had to leave North Carolina,'' said Jim
Roberson, president of the Research Triangle Foundation, the park's
developer. ``We are now an importer of Ph.D.s, not an exporter.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is organizing a 40th anniversary celebration and
symposium March 3 to tout the park's role in shaping North
Carolina's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The park's first anchor tenant _ and today its largest employer
_ is IBM. More than 2,000 of Big Blue's 14,000 employees in the
region work for its Networking Hardware Division.
</P>
<P>
   In competition with Cisco, Lucent and Nortel, the IBM division
designs and manufactures computers, switches, routers and other
equipment that allows companies to link their computer networks to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's network management software subsidiary, called Tivoli, is
expanding as well. It is building two 100,000-square-foot buildings
in the Research Triangle Park as part of the region's
networking-related construction boom.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent is in the midst of a major project and is exploring
another. It is building a 123,000-square-foot software research and
development facility in Cary, between the Research Triangle Park
and Raleigh. An estimated 200 Lucent employees will relocate to the
center when it opens at the end of the year, but the company has
enough acreage to expand more.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent is also negotiating to establish a research center at
N.C. State University's Centennial Campus. With plans for up to 500
employees, the center would tap into N.C. State's expertise in
computer networking research. The company also hopes to improve its
odds of recruiting the university's engineering graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel, with 7,500 local employees after last year's layoffs, is
adding three 100,000-square-foot buildings to its Research Triangle
Park campus. A park tenant since 1980, the company said its
three-year, $181 million project will relieve crowding in its
research and development facility and will make Nortel more
attractive to prospective employees.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, Cisco envisions half of its revenue coming from
convergence technology. With that research focused in the Research
Triangle Park, Senior Vice President Wellman said the company plans
rapid growth for its Kit Creek campus.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's corporate officials decided in 1994 to expand beyond the
Silicon Valley because of the region's tight labor supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Research Triangle Park was our choice, hands down,'' said
Wellman, citing the availability of engineers and the proximity of
Duke, UNC-Chapel Hill and N.C. State. Another consideration was the
region's quality of life, which Wellman said has suffered in the
past year because of worsening traffic that the growth of companies
such as his have created.
</P>
<P>
   Wellman has warned that traffic could slow Cisco's expansion,
but so far it hasn't. The company has four buildings, two more
under construction, and three more on the drawing board on its
170-acre campus. If that's not enough, the company has agreements
for adjoining property.

 &HT;    Incubator launches tide of high-tech whizzes
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ When the breeze blows across West Main Street,
the syrupy sweet smell of tobacco being turned into Chesterfield
and L&AMP;M cigarettes swirls into Max Wallace's office at Liggett
Tobacco Co.
</P>
<P>
   But the business of Wallace's fledgling company, Cogent
Neuroscience Inc., is anything but cigarettes. The biotechnology
start-up is renting space in Liggett's research and development
laboratory, a squat brick building across West Main from Liggett's
cigarette factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a natural launching pad for companies like ours,''
said Wallace, Cogent's 47-year-old founder and chief executive
officer, as he walked down a green-and-beige-tiled hallway leading
to small laboratories built in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Cogent raised $5.5 million in venture capital to
begin the long, expensive and uncertain process of discovering a
new treatment for strokes. Its eight scientists outnumber Liggett's
researchers, whose work includes testing the quality of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new era in this old tobacco town where some of the
best-known institutions _ from Duke University to the Durham Bulls
minor-league baseball team _ rose from the fortunes of the golden
leaf. The tobacco industry is fading, and a tide of high-tech
whizzes is rising from the ashes.
</P>
<P>
   They're on the verge of delivering, at last, on Tobacco Road's
promise to become a national hub of high-tech entrepreneurship in
biotechnology, software and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is real. I do not believe it is chamber of commerce hype,''
said Charles Moseley, general partner of Noro-Moseley Partners. The
Atlanta-based venture capital firm has invested $8 million in four
Research Triangle start-ups since September 1997 and it is scouting
more deals. ``It is one of the leading spots in the Southeast.''
</P>
<P>
   Located on 6,900 acres between Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill,
the Research Triangle Park is the nation's largest and one of the
oldest technology centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The universities understood that it was in their best interest
that this thing called the Research Triangle Park would become an
asset in the community,'' said Tom Wooten, who retired last fall as
president of Research Triangle Institute, a nonprofit independent
research organization and the park's first tenant. ``It was
enlightened self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the park earned its reputation by recruiting
major research companies and goverment agencies as tenants. Other
than in Washington, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has
its largest concentration of research facilities in the Research
Triangle. IBM employs 14,000 people in the region, the biggest
concentration of Big Blue employees in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Research Triangle Park plans to keep hunting ``big buffalo''
tenants responsible for thousands of jobs. Yet officials also
envision cultivating enough start-ups to attract venture
capitalists now pouring money into California's Silicon Valley and
the New England region centered on Massachusetts Route 128 in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see emerging technology as a real opportunity for
entrepreneurs to get started,'' said Jim Roberson, president of the
Research Triangle Foundation, the park's developer. Since
accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers started tracking venture
capital four years ago, the Research Triangle region has emerged,
along with metro Atlanta, as a Southern technology hot spot.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley easily tops the nation in venture capital, raking
in $4.6 billion from 787 deals in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists invested $247.3 million in 59 deals in the
Research Triangle last year. There was a total of 73 venture
capital deals in North Carolina last year, worth $300.4 million,
Pricewaterhouse said. Investments in the Research Triangle have
risen steadily since 1995's tally of 19 deals valued at $67.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in terms of raising money to launch high-tech entrepreneurs,
the Research Triangle region hasn't shaken loose from North
Carolina's tobacco and textile legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between Boston and Silicon Valley vs. here is
there is not that classic roll-the-dice culture that comes out of
central North Carolina,'' said Barrett Joyner, vice president of
North American sales and marketing for SAS Institute Inc., a major
software producer in Cary, just south of the Research Triangle
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, wealthy North Carolinians have favored investments
they could put their hands on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money that has been made was in textiles, tobacco, real
estate development,'' said Wallace, a former Duke University lawyer
who helped start three other biotech companies before Cogent
Neuroscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I go to them and say that I am going to discover the
genes that may provide new drugs for stroke patients and that I
need $50 million to get there, with no foreseeable returns?''
Wallace said. ``There has to be a culture change.''
</P>
<P>
   A Newsweek cover story last November on ''the hot new tech
cities'' excluded the Research Triangle. So did a Business Week
cover story in 1987 when it concluded that ''local start-ups ...
are rare'' in Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Some bristle at the unflattering comparisons, and some, like
Research Triangle Foundation's Roberson, say they're dead wrong. He
cites numerous surveys by publications including Money, Fortune and
Entrepreneur that rank the Research Triangle among the nation's
best places to live and do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting to get over the hump with more money coming
from outside the area, including from Atlanta,'' said David Blivin,
managing director of Durham-based Southeast Interactive Technology
Funds, a major investor of venture capital in the Research
Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the region's growing reputation, Southeast
Interactive has teamed up with Silicon Valley magazine Upside to
sponsor the fourth annual Southeast Technology Conference May 10-11
at Duke's Fuqua School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   People who work with entrepreneurs in the Research Triangle say
the region is poised for explosive growth in the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very much on the launch pad, if we haven't taken off,''
said Suzanne Cantando, training director at the Council for
Entrepreneurial Development in the Research Triangle Park.
</P>
<P>
   Officials tick off signs that conditions are ripening for
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1995 merger between pharmaceutical giants Burroughs
Welcome and Glaxo, some employees who left the companies stayed in
the Research Triangle and started more than a half dozen new ones.

PENTAGON REVIVES MOVE TO HALT BOOK ON IRAQI ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reversing itself for a second time, the Pentagon
has demanded that Scott Ritter, a former U.N. weapons inspector,
provide it with an advance copy of a book in which he is expected
to accuse the Clinton administration of hindering the search for
evidence of Iraqi chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Ritter's lawyer on Thursday, the Defense
Department said Ritter was required to turn over the book for a
security review before it could be published. A security review
would almost certainly delay publication of the book, which is
scheduled to be printed and distributed to booksellers next month.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter's lawyer, Matthew Lifflander, described the letter as an
effort to intimidate his client into silence.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, he said, would refuse to agree to the Pentagon's demand
for a security review, raising at least the possibility that the
Defense Department would go to court to try to block publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that the book is basically at the printers,''
Lifflander said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you could easily conclude that this is a last-minute effort
to delay publication. I don't think they have a legal leg to stand
on. I find this a very destructive approach.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's latest letter reflected another sharp and
potentially embarrassing turnaround in its strategy for dealing
with Ritter's book, which is expected to include accusations that
senior administration officials repeatedly hindered the work of
U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The book is being published by Simon &AMP; Schuster. A spokeswoman
said the publisher had no immediate comment on the government's
dispute with Ritter and how it might affect publication of the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, a former Marine intelligence officer, resigned from the
United Nations last summer and accused the administration of a
vacillating policy on Iraq that had led to repeated U.S. meddling
in the arms-inspection program, undermining the search for Iraqi
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States interfered with the arms inspections
in an effort to avoid direct confrontations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The entire arms-inspection program was ended late last year when
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq shut it down, a decision that
resulted last December in the largest U.S. airstrikes against Iraq
since the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department, which paid Ritter's salary while the
retired Marine worked for the U.N. Special Commission on Iraq,
initially demanded a prepublication security review of the book in
a letter to Ritter last month.
</P>
<P>
   But on Jan. 17, the day that news reports first appeared about
the demand, the Pentagon reversed itself, insisting that the letter
had been sent in error and that there had been no attempt to
intimidate Ritter.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the department reversed itself again. In its letter to
Ritter's lawyer on Thursday, the general counsel of the Defense
Threat Reduction Agency, the agency of the Pentagon that paid
Ritter's salary under contract, said that it expected Ritter to
``comply with his responsibilities'' and turn over the book for a
prepublication review.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are reminded that Ritter's contract requires that he may
not release any information pertaining to any part of the contract
or any program related to the contract without prepublication
review,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Although their constitutionality is questioned by lawyers,
Pentagon contracts routinely require contractors to submit to a
prepublication security review of books and other materials that
touch on their work for the government.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent reference to its earlier reversals on the issue,
the letter said that ``no prior statements or actions by DTRA
should be construed in any way as waiving under the contract or in
permitting Ritter to ignore his responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter of response on Friday, Lifflander said that the
Pentagon ``attempts once again to impose an unenforceable
censorship agreement on a former employee.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``For the agency to now reverse the position it
stated publicly and once again seek a right to censor Scott
Ritter's work is patently unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the book did not disclose any classified information
about the arms-inspection program in Iraq. ``Mr. Ritter,'' he said,
``continues to believe that nothing in the manuscript could
possibly be contested on a national-security basis by government
censors, although some of what he has to say may be distasteful to
some significant policy-makers.''

 &HT;    Telecommunications competition sparks a middle-age rejuvenation
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. _ A child of California's Silicon
Valley, Cisco Systems decided to grow up in the Research Triangle
Park. But it suddenly finds its computer networking playground
crowded by two other big kids, Lucent Technologies and Northern
Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   The telecom competition has spurred unprecedented growth in the
Research Triangle Park. Combined, Cisco, Lucent and Nortel are
constructing six buildings in the region and have other projects on
the drawing board to accommodate several thousand additional
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, North Carolina leaders set aside 6,900 acres
between Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill in hopes of luring
companies and government agencies engaged in research and
development. It was a far-fetched notion, to sprout technology like
corn from a desolate patch of pine trees and overgrown fields.
</P>
<P>
   But promoters touted its proximity to budding research efforts
at Duke University in Durham, the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Research Triangle Park finds itself in the midst of a
middle-age rejuvenation that promoters believe will strengthen its
international recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in telecommunications technology is so explosive,
said Cisco Senior Vice President Selby Wellman, that companies want
to hire experienced people rather than to hire college graduates
and train them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about the labor pool, you talk about your
competitors,'' said Wellman, who oversees a Research Triangle Park
work force that's grown from 56 in 1994 to 960 today. It's forecast
to reach 4,000 by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif.; Lucent, based in Murray Hill,
N.J.; and Nortel, based in Brampton, Ontario, are pouring hundreds
of millions of dollars into the Research Triangle region. The
investments have put the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area at the
leading edge of a telecommunications revolution fueled by data
networking and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The investments by Cisco, Lucent, Nortel _ global giants with
annual revenue topping $50 billion _ are also likely to lure other
companies to the Research Triangle seeking to tap into the
cutting-edge developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``As companies battle together in a local area, they increase
the productivity of the industry in the area,'' said high-tech
economist Patrick Howie of Dynamic Resource Solutions in St.
Davids, Pa. ``You have information spillovers and structural
economic gains that build upon themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Research Triangle region is one of the South's hottest
technology hubs, but it's growth hasn't been smooth. The recent
past illustrates the volatility of technology.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, two semiconductor plants owned by Mitsubishi
and Motorola have closed. In a corporate streamlining, Nortel
eliminated 875 jobs in the Research Triangle Park last fall, even
as it is constructing three buildings to accommodate growth in
areas of hot technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest is ``convergence'' technology, and Cisco,
Lucent and Nortel are gearing up in the Research Triangle for a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Big changes are forecast over the next decade for the world's
telephone networks. In simple terms, telephone lines once carried
only people's voices. Now they're transmitting increasing amounts
of computer data as the Internet's popularity soars.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom companies are in the early stages of integrating voice,
data and video on a single, high-speed network. Cisco, Lucent and
Nortel have decided to develop this technology in the Research
Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are huge, estimated globally as a $450 billion a year
market in voice and data networking sales. Many companies, big and
small, are joining the competition. It promises to reach a frenzied
pace in the Research Triangle Park, some officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It drives entrepreneurship within those major corporations,''
said William Glynn, director of Southeast Interactive Technology
Funds, a Durham-based venture capital firm. ``It drives innovation.
When there is innovation within companies, it creates spinoffs.
That only adds to the critical mass that we are experiencing in the
Research Triangle Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The location was key. North Carolina leaders wanted to stop the
brain drain from the universities in an era when the state's
economy was tied largely to tobacco, textiles and furniture. The
latest surge of growth, officials said, reinforces the achievement
of that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, if you went to Duke, UNC-Chapel Hill or N.C. State
and had a graduate degree related to anything but agriculturally
related stuff, you had to leave North Carolina,'' said Jim
Roberson, president of the Research Triangle Foundation, the park's
developer. ``We are now an importer of Ph.D.s, not an exporter.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is organizing a 40th anniversary celebration and
symposium March 3 to tout the park's role in shaping North
Carolina's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The park's first anchor tenant _ and today its largest employer
_ is IBM. More than 2,000 of Big Blue's 14,000 employees in the
region work for its Networking Hardware Division.
</P>
<P>
   In competition with Cisco, Lucent and Nortel, the IBM division
designs and manufactures computers, switches, routers and other
equipment that allows companies to link their computer networks to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's network management software subsidiary, called Tivoli, is
expanding as well. It is building two 100,000-square-foot buildings
in the Research Triangle Park as part of the region's
networking-related construction boom.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent is in the midst of a major project and is exploring
another. It is building a 123,000-square-foot software research and
development facility in Cary, between the Research Triangle Park
and Raleigh. An estimated 200 Lucent employees will relocate to the
center when it opens at the end of the year, but the company has
enough acreage to expand more.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent is also negotiating to establish a research center at
N.C. State University's Centennial Campus. With plans for up to 500
employees, the center would tap into N.C. State's expertise in
computer networking research. The company also hopes to improve its
odds of recruiting the university's engineering graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel, with 7,500 local employees after last year's layoffs, is
adding three 100,000-square-foot buildings to its Research Triangle
Park campus. A park tenant since 1980, the company said its
three-year, $181 million project will relieve crowding in its
research and development facility and will make Nortel more
attractive to prospective employees.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, Cisco envisions half of its revenue coming from
convergence technology. With that research focused in the Research
Triangle Park, Senior Vice President Wellman said the company plans
rapid growth for its Kit Creek campus.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Wellman has warned that traffic could slow Cisco's expansion,
but so far it hasn't. The company has four buildings, two more
under construction, and three more on the drawing board on its
170-acre campus. If that's not enough, the company has agreements
for adjoining property.

Park.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, wealthy North Carolinians have favored investments
they could put their hands on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money that has been made was in textiles, tobacco, real
estate development,'' said Wallace, a former Duke University lawyer
who helped start three other biotech companies before Cogent
Neuroscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I go to them and say that I am going to discover the
genes that may provide new drugs for stroke patients and that I
need $50 million to get there, with no foreseeable returns?''
Wallace said. ``There has to be a culture change.''
</P>
<P>
   A Newsweek cover story last November on ''the hot new tech
cities'' excluded the Research Triangle. So did a Business Week
cover story in 1987 when it concluded that ''local start-ups ...
are rare'' in Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Some bristle at the unflattering comparisons, and some, like
Research Triangle Foundation's Roberson, say they're dead wrong. He
cites numerous surveys by publications including Money, Fortune and
Entrepreneur that rank the Research Triangle among the nation's
best places to live and do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting to get over the hump with more money coming
from outside the area, including from Atlanta,'' said David Blivin,
managing director of Durham-based Southeast Interactive Technology
Funds, a major investor of venture capital in the Research
Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the region's growing reputation, Southeast
Interactive has teamed up with Silicon Valley magazine Upside to
sponsor the fourth annual Southeast Technology Conference May 10-11
at Duke's Fuqua School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   People who work with entrepreneurs in the Research Triangle say
the region is poised for explosive growth in the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very much on the launch pad, if we haven't taken off,''
said Suzanne Cantando, training director at the Council for
Entrepreneurial Development in the Research Triangle Park.
</P>
<P>
   Officials tick off signs that conditions are ripening for
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1995 merger between pharmaceutical giants Burroughs
Welcome and Glaxo, some employees who left the companies stayed in
the Research Triangle and started more than a half dozen new ones.

 &HT;    N.C. park success based on teamwork
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt

<TEXT>
<P>
   RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. _ Poor George is a goner, a
virtual-reality victim at the Research Triangle Institute.
</P>
<P>
   George, a computerized talking head, responded too slowly in
conversations with people. So he was replaced by fast-talking Rocky
and Roxanne, the rising stars at the institute, the Research
Triangle Park's oldest tenant.
</P>
<P>
   The pair of hip, high-tech 30-somethings illustrates some of the
latest fast-moving but practical research under way at the
institute. Its recent efforts in virtual reality also demonstrate
how the nonprofit research organization has dutifully clung to its
original mission of collaborating with the three universities that
started it in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina
State University in Raleigh and Duke University in Durham own the
institute.
</P>
<P>
   The institute operates independent of the universities and it
solicits research funds, expected to reach $200 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collaboration has been crucial,'' said Alvin M. Cruze, the
institute's interim president, who joined the staff in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Created in an era when independent research was rare in a region
dominated by textiles and farming, the institute has prospered
beyond the expectations of its founders.
</P>
<P>
   With a staff of 1,525 worldwide, including 1,325 on its 180-acre
campus in Research Triangle Park, the institute conducts research
under contract to government agencies, companies and foundations,
such as the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, NASA and pharmaceutical giant Glaxo Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   In its largest project, worth $205 million over eight years, the
institute is conducting a national survey on drug abuse for the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Sales of one of the
institute's anticancer discoveries, Taxol, approached $1 billion
last year for Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
</P>
<P>
   The institute opened an office in Atlanta last fall to be near
one of its clients, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The institute earned $4.2 million in revenue last year from the
CDC. It is involved in nine CDC projects, including national
surveys of smoking behavior and studying school health programs.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's research spans many fields, including economics,
chemicals,electronics and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of placing a research laboratory in the university
environment was fairly rare at that time,'' said George Simpson,
77, chancellor of the University of Georgia system from 1965 to
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was a UNC-Chapel Hill sociology professor who in 1956
became executive director of the committee created to establish the
institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's call it a long shot,'' Simpson described the institute's
initial odds for success.
</P>
<P>
   State leaders, including Gov. Luther Hodges, were troubled by
North Carolina's dependence on low wages in textiles, farming and
furniture. They envisioned tapping the universities' budding
research efforts to create an institute that, in turn, would anchor
a major research park to attract high-paying employers.
</P>
<P>
   When it decided five years ago to venture into virtual reality,
which creates a three-dimensional, interactive experience, the
institute sought one of the field's early developers, UNC-Chapel
Hill computer scientist Fred Brooks. He helped the institute select
computers and software to demonstrate virtual reality to potential
customers. The institute chose to invest its efforts in training, a
largely untapped market.
</P>
<P>
   It developed a virtual medical trainer prototype for the U.S.
Army that recreated on a computer monitor emergency scenes such as
an automobile crash and sniper fire. The institute is negotiating
with a publisher interested in selling the program on CD-ROM to
emergency medical agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to present a true-to-life representation of a
trauma, so the student can practice assessment and treatment,
especially in the first 10 minutes of coming onto the scene,'' said
Paul Kizakevich, a senior research engineer at the institute.
Another project was to develop virtual humans to provide training
for businesses. Last spring, researchers developed George, a
sometimes surly bank customer who wanted to cash a $25 check.
</P>
<P>
   His head bobbed and his lips moved as he told the teller, ``My
account number here is 1,2,3.''
</P>
<P>
   As he received two fives, a ten and five ones, his forehead
knitted and he scowled. ``I am not satisfied with your branch,'' he
said. George had a fatal flaw.
</P>
<P>
   He always paused for a couple of seconds, creating a jerky
conversation. That would diminish the effectiveness of training
customer service representatives, such as airline reservationists,
who handle a rapid succession of calls.
</P>
<P>
   George was retired and along came Rocky and Roxanne.
</P>
<P>
   The pair was a big hit recently at a national convention in Las
Vegas, where passersby were surprised to find themselves engaged in
conversation with virtual humans.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky and Roxanne were to demonstrate how they could assist real
people in manning booths at trade shows. Not only could that save
money, but it also could create excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is cool,'' said Dean Hering, the institute's manager of
commercial projects for virtual reality. ``People get hyped up
about it.''

 &HT;    Bumper-to-bumper traffic congestion clouds town's future
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORRISVILLE, N.C. _ For Grover and Peggy Lewter, a retired
couple who live on the outskirts of this fast-growing Research
Triangle town, one rule of the road exceeds all others. Don't
drive, if you can avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   Grover, 66, owns a red Chevy pickup, his 63-year-old wife a
beige Chevy Impala. They keep horses, chickens and two dogs,
Trouble and Amy, on six acres developers have been drooling over
for years.
</P>
<P>
   They've learned that, during rush hour, only fools _ and
thousands of Research Triangle Park commuters _ travel the
bumper-to-bumper stretch of Davis Drive that fronts the Lewters'
tidy brick home of 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the two-lane highway was partially paved, and traffic
was so scarce that Lewter went to the mailbox in his underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw about two cars a day come up and down the road, and
one of them was the mailman,'' Peggy Lewter said.
</P>
<P>
   The mail comes later now, slowed by the congestion of the
estimated 25,000 vehicles that pass every weekday. The couple
rarely ventures out between 7:30 and 10 a.m. or between 4:30 and 7
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is Wednesday night. Then it takes up to 30 minutes
to drive the mile and a half to supper and the prayer meeting at
Good Hope Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Short of divine intervention, it's hard to fathom how traffic is
going to get much better.
</P>
<P>
   With mind-boggling growth forecast for the region, the
congestion is expected to worsen until highway improvements
projected to cost $435 million are completed.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly frustrating in this region that boasts one of
America's highest concentrations of PhD.s has been the inability of
civic and political leaders to get much of a handle on traffic
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is bad but not as bad as Atlanta,'' said Scott Lane, a
long-range planner in Raleigh. ``But we are trying hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Lured by the Research Triangle's booming economy, people are
flocking to jobs centered on the research park. And 25,000 new jobs
are forecast for the region this year.
</P>
<P>
   But congestion threatens to stymie growth. One of the Research
Triangle Park's fastest-growing companies, computer networking
giant Cisco Systems, has raised public concerns about its ability
to meet expansion goals if traffic doesn't improve.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the Research Triangle could only dream of the
prosperity that has sprouted from the concentration of global
technology companies. In an ever-widening circle, small towns such
as Morrisville find themselves grappling with kudzu-like growth.
</P>
<P>
   Population estimates in Morrisville rocket from 2,808 in 1998:
5,439 this year, 14,250 in 2005 and 18,705 in 2010. The number of
dwelling units is forecast to jump by 466 percent, from 1,783 in
1995 to 10,095 in 2025.
</P>
<P>
   A 270 percent increase is expected in the number of people
working in Morrisville, from 10,334 in 1995 to 38,225 in 2025,
according to a forecast last year by the Capital Area Metropolitan
Planning Organization and the Durham-Chapel Hill-Carrboro
Metropolitan Planning Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Morrisville having 3,000 people, and you say this
is a small town,'' Town Manager David Hodgkins said. ``Then you
look at all of the people passing through and working here during
the day.'' Its proximity to the Research Triangle Park and
Raleigh-Durham International Airport has transformed Morrisville
into an industrial and commercial hub. As a result, the town's tax
base amounts to $228,000 a person.
</P>
<P>
   The town's prosperity is deceiving, Hodgkins said, because its
soaring population of residents and office workers is pressuring
municipal services. In a state whose nicknames include ``The Good
Roads State,'' North Carolina Transportation Secretary Norris
Tolson has recommended radical remedies to ease traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding one more highway or one more lane will not be enough,''
he said. ``We cannot just pave our way out of this congestion.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Transportation Department plans to widen I-40 and
other major roads, but it and other regional planning agencies are
recommending other steps, such as expanding bus routes and
encouraging greater car and van pooling.
</P>
<P>
   In a $250 million project slated for completion in 2004, the
Triangle Transit Authority plans to build a regional rail system
connecting Raleigh, Cary, Apex and Durham with the Research
Triangle Park.
</P>
<P>
   Tolson has suggested companies in the research park encourage
employees to telecommute and consider charging them for parking.
None of these is a sure-fire solution, partly because of the
sprawling design of Research Triangle Park. Nobody lives in the
6,900-acre park, so the roughly 50,000 people employees must
commute.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are scattered across the park, and office buildings
are set back from the roads. That complicates transporting rail
passengers to their offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very difficult area to ever take root to mass
transit,'' said Jim Goodnight, president of SAS Institute, a
software manufacturer in Cary. ''We have a lot of people talking
about it, but nobody is ever going to ride.''

 &HT;    The real shock for parents? That boys' skivvies are clean!
 &HT;    By Matt Reed
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Parents: Take a look at Calvin Klein's
controversial _ and hastily yanked _ ad for children's underwear.
</P>
<P>
   You're horrified, aren't you? And for good reason:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you kids! Stop jumping on that sofa!''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, you probably don't think twice about 3- and
4-year-old boys playing in their underpants. (Do you?)
</P>
<P>
   Because once you finally get them to wear undies, little boys
live in them. The grubbier the better, as far as they're concerned.
Perfect attire for watching Arthur, dashing to the Playskool Turtle
sandbox or cramming a Pop-Tart into the VCR.
</P>
<P>
   It's the thought of Junior hopping around in a pair of pricey
designer briefs that's a little troubling.
</P>
<P>
   But folks in New York had other concerns when Calvin Klein
unfurled its billboard in Times Square. Someone might get ... you
know ... the wrong idea, they said. Could this be ... kiddie porn?
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudy Giuliani _ who apparently never saw Underoos modeled
in a Sears catalog _ told the New York Post the ads ``did not look
like the kind of thing you'd want to do with young children.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper called them ``provocative ads, featuring semi-nude
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Provocative? Semi-nude?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with kids knows that a 3-year-old wearing tightie-whities
and some Spaghetti-O stains is half-dressed.
</P>
<P>
   And hats off to the parents of the two boys pictured: The truly
remarkable thing is that they got them into underpants at all.
</P>
<P>
   See, persuading a tot to wear ``big boy'' underpants for the
first time is a huge accomplishment for everyone involved. It means
the the little guy has to give up his beloved diapers. (Girls are a
little different: They can't wait to get into something fancy.)
</P>
<P>
   So you make a big celebration out of it, take little Danny or
Brandon to Target and let him pick them out himself. There's a
whole exciting lineup to choose from: Arthur, Barney, firetrucks,
Winnie-the-Pooh, Spider-Man, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   And you pray he takes the bait.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the first couple of packs end up bleached out or in
the trash after a predictable series of, shall we say, misfires.
</P>
<P>
   So, what mom or dad is going to pay big bucks for Calvins? Heck,
what 3-year-old is going to pick those dour, minimalistic CKs to
begin with over, say, the Rugrats?
</P>
<P>
   And wait one minute: Is one of those preschoolers in the ad
wearing boxers?
</P>
<P>
   That's not nudity. That's a boy who knows how to dress.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Reed's 3-year-old prefers Oshkoshes with tigers and
giraffes.

 &HT;    It's time to paint the house: Here's what you need to know to do
it right!
 &HT;    By Africa Fine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I painted my dorm room in a couple
hours, you figure, surely I can paint my house next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And if your standards are no higher than they were when you were
thumb-tacking that Farrah Fawcett poster over the lumpy spot on the
wall, you probably can.
</P>
<P>
   But most of us would prefer a more sophisticated job on the home
we've gone into deep debt to buy. A good paint job should last 10
years or longer, but a bad one may need to be redone in a year or
less.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say you can't do it yourself, just that there's
a lot to consider before you tackle it.
</P>
<P>
   Here, some guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   DO IT YOURSELF OR HIRE A PRO? The best do-it-yourself candidate:
</P>
<P>
   - has tackled home improvements before
</P>
<P>
   - has some painting experience
</P>
<P>
   - is willing to do his or her homework
</P>
<P>
   - is not afraid to ask for help
</P>
<P>
   - is patient and persistent
</P>
<P>
   If you do it yourself ...
</P>
<P>
   - Allow two to three times longer to complete the project than
the average pro estimate.
</P>
<P>
   - Have a plan. Talk to experts at a paint store and check the
Internet for home improvement sites.
</P>
<P>
   - Gather all supplies and equipment before you begin.
</P>
<P>
   - Be prepared to make some mistakes, and have a plan B just in
case.
</P>
<P>
   PROS
</P>
<P>
   - You have control
</P>
<P>
   - Cheaper (unless you make costly mistakes)
</P>
<P>
   - No risk of contractor fraud
</P>
<P>
   CONS
</P>
<P>
   - Can result in costly mistakes
</P>
<P>
   - May not look as good as pro job
</P>
<P>
   - Can be time-consuming
</P>
<P>
   If you hire a professional ...
</P>
<P>
   - Ask friends, neighbors, co-workers for recommendations of
painters they have used.
</P>
<P>
   - Talk to at least three contractors, and get estimates from
each before choosing one.
</P>
<P>
   - Deal only with licensed contractors; ask to see the license
plus at least one other form of identification.
</P>
<P>
   - Call the state licensing bureau to verify the license and
check for complaints.
</P>
<P>
   - Ask for references _ and contact them.
</P>
<P>
   - Get a written contract and agree on a payment method upfront.
</P>
<P>
   - Don't pay cash.
</P>
<P>
   - Don't pay the full cost upfront. Legitimate contractors will
not require more than half upfront; many will agree to a
pay-as-you-go arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   PROS
</P>
<P>
   - Professional-looking job
</P>
<P>
   - Experts know how to deal with any problems that arise
</P>
<P>
   - Saves time
</P>
<P>
   CONS
</P>
<P>
   - Unskilled contractor could do a poor job
</P>
<P>
   - More expensive (from $300 for one room to $3,000 or more for
the exterior of a 3-bedroom home)
</P>
<P>
   - You have less control
</P>
<P>
   BEFORE YOU BEGIN
</P>
<P>
   - Examine the area to be painted to determine the type and
texture of the surface, any imperfections that need repair and the
amount of trim.
</P>
<P>
   - Calculate the square footage to be painted.
</P>
<P>
   - Organize the supplies you already have and make a list of
things you need to buy. (See supply checklist.)
</P>
<P>
   - If you're painting outside, check weather reports to make sure
rain isn't forecast for 48 hours. Also avoid hot, humid conditions.
Moist conditions make paint sticky and increase drying time.
</P>
<P>
   - Make sure you have the time and commitment to finish the job.
Many factors affect how long a project takes, but if painting your
3-bedroom house would take a professional two to three days, it
will take most do-it-yourselfers about a week. Add time for high
ceilings, odd-shaped rooms and surfaces that need repair before
painting.
</P>
<P>
   PICKING THE PAINT
</P>
<P>
   - FORMULA _ Paint comes in two basic formulas: latex-based and
enamel. Latex is the most popular and the easiest to use. It's
water-soluble, takes about an hour to dry and cleans up with soap
and water. Enamel paint contains oils, so it resists staining
better than latex and can withstand heavy scrubbing in kitchens and
bathrooms. But it takes longer to dry and you'll need solvents for
cleaning up.
</P>
<P>
   - FINISH _ Exterior paints are available in several finishes:
flat (low-sheen, hides imperfections), semi-gloss (good for
high-traffic areas such as doors and shutters, repels dirt), satin
(all-purpose, durable) and gloss (high-sheen, good to accentuate
trim).
</P>
<P>
   - BRAND _ Prices range from about $6 for a pint of Glidden to
$30 for a gallon of Ralph Lauren paint, but a good-quality paint
will probably cost about $16 per gallon. Look for a resin content
of at least 20-25 percent _ the higher the resin content, the more
durable the paint. Otherwise, your choice should be based on your
familiarity with the brand, your price range and the colors
available.
</P>
<P>
   - COLOR _ Consider your furnishings and decor when choosing a
paint color for the inside of the house. If you're not absolutely
sure about a color, do a patch-test on a small area and live with
it for a few days to see how it looks in different light. Outside,
consider the style of your home and the colors of other homes in
the neighborhood. A lime green door might seem like a fun idea, but
consider how it would blend into the neighborhood and what
prospective buyers might think if you decided to sell.
</P>
<P>
   - AMOUNT _ At the beginning of the project, buy enough paint for
the entire job. It's better to have more than you need than to run
back for extra only to find that the new batch is a slightly
different hue. Plus, paint is cheaper if you buy it in four- or
five-gallon containers. Most paints cover about 400 square feet per
gallon for one coat; assume you'll need at least two thin coats.
For more help determining how much paint you need, check out
Benjamin Moore's Web site at www.bejaminmoore.com and use their
interactive calculator.
</P>
<P>
   SUPPLY CHECKLIST
</P>
<P>
   Expect the cost of supplies to paint the outside of an average
3-bedroom home to be $300-$500. Allow $100-$300 for interior
projects, depending on the number of rooms being painted.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   APPLYING THE PAINT
</P>
<P>
   - No matter what the label says, two or more thin coats are
usually better than one thick coat, which may drip, dry very slowly
and/or remain sticky. It's best to allow 24 hours drying time
between coats.
</P>
<P>
   - Inside, paint ceiling first, then walls.
</P>
<P>
   - Use rollers for the ceiling and large wall areas; they cover
more area and tend to drip less.
</P>
<P>
   - Use brushes for smaller wall areas, around door jams and in
corners.
</P>
<P>
   - Don't overload brushes or rollers with paint. Roll the roller
back andforth in the paint pan once or twice, then shake excess
back into tray. Try to load brushes without dripping, then tap
against the side of the can to remove excess paint.
</P>
<P>
   - Choose ONE directipon to paint _ horizontally or vertically _
and stick with it. Overlap strokes slightly.
</P>
<P>
   - Don't start painting a wall or the ceiling if you won't have
time to finish that area. You want each surface to dry evenly for a
uniform appearance.
</P>
<P>
   MOST COMMON MISTAKES MADE BY DO-IT-YOURSELF PAINTERS
</P>
<P>
   1. Neglecting to consider the weather. Best time to paint: When
the temperature is between 60 and 90 degrees. Avoid painting when
rain is expected within 48 hours or when it's very humid.
</P>
<P>
   2. Mistaking paint for primer, and vice-versa. It comes in the
same kind of can and is stacked in the same hardware-store aisle,
but it's not the same. Primers seal the surface or walls, and paint
protects that seal. Any surface that is porous, stained or bare
needs to be primed before painting, or the paint will seep into the
surface and leave it vulnerable to the elements.
</P>
<P>
   3. Failing to prepare the surface before painting.
</P>
<P>
   Inside:
</P>
<P>
   - Move as much of the furniture out of the room as possible
</P>
<P>
   - Cover the floor and remaining furniture with drop cloths
</P>
<P>
   - Cover light fixtures and electrical cover plates with plastic
bags or tape
</P>
<P>
   - If you're painting behind outlet covers, turn off the
electricity to the room.
</P>
<P>
   Outside:
</P>
<P>
   - Scrape all loose paint and sand those surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   - Wash the surface thoroughly with a cleanser designed for this
purpose. If there is mildew, add bleach according to the label
directions.
</P>
<P>
   - Rinse to remove soap residue
</P>
<P>
   - Repair any surface problems before beginning
</P>
<P>
   - Use a primer if you're painting over a darker color or making
repairs to the surface before painting.
</P>
<P>
   4. Using dirty equipment
</P>
<P>
   Make sure your brushes and rollers are clean and in good
condition to ensure the best, most consistent results. Latex-based
paints clean up easily with soap and water, while enamel paints
require mineral sprits. Be careful when using flammable solvents _
wear gloves and goggles _ and clean up immediately after you finish
the job.

 &HT;    `And the Beat Goes On'
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``And The Beat Goes On: The Sonny And
Cher Story'' : 9-11 p.m. Monday (ABC)
</P>
<P>
   They were the ultimate odd couple. He was short, she was tall.
She could sing, he couldn't. He was goofy-looking, she was an
exotic beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny and Cher definitely left their indelible stamp on pop
music. Their stormy relationship and Sonny's tragic death in a
skiing accident are the stuff of TV movies.
</P>
<P>
   In ``And The Beat Goes On,'' a touching, but mostly one-sided
story (it's based on Sonny's book), the phenomenon that was Sonny
and Cher is colorfully recreated. The film stars Jay Underwood
(``Afterglow'') as the controlling Sonny and Renee Faia (``The
American President'') as the moody Cher. I recently caught up with
Faia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you afraid Cher will kick your butt if she doesn't like
your performance?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, I wouldn't expect that from her. She's an actress and she
knows what that's about. I'm sure she'll have her criticisms. But I
think she'll be pleased that the love story came through.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Watching you as Cher really freaked me out because you looked
just like her. Were you freaked out, too?
</P>
<P>
   A: A little bit, mostly in the beginning. It was a wild
experience. When we started putting on the wigs, it was really
coming together and it got a little freaky.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was that your real nose in the movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, they didn't have to do anything to my nose. Now, Jay
got, like 19 fake noses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After wearing many of those garish '70s get-ups, didn't you
just want to burn them all?
</P>
<P>
   A: I thought they were great. I really loved the leather,
whipped stitch pants. I thought they were cool. I just dig that
whole style.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The leather, whipped, WHAT?
</P>
<P>
   A: Whipped stitch. It's an industry term, baby.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Before getting this role, did people tell you that you looked
like Cher?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not really. My hair is lighter and shorter. The cast didn't
even recognize me out of costume.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You worked on `A Few Good Men' as a costume designer and
secretly studied Jack Nicholson. What did you learn?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would go down to the set when they were doing the courtroom
scenes and I saw how professional he was and how he would give 110
percent on and off camera. He's such a professional and he has fun
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Jack ever hit on you?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, the most he would say was, `Hi, gals.'
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the last few months, have you a desire to wear see-through
Bob Mackie outfits, date young guys and curse out David Letterman?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Laughing) No, I've done all that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you get tired of listening to Sonny and Cher sing?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, I really enjoyed their music. I wasn't that familiar with
it, other than `I've Got You Babe.' I even kept one of the CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who's got YOU, babe?
</P>
<P>
   A: Who's got me? My boyfriend, for a year-and-a-half.

 &HT;    Why is a play about pedophilia so popular?
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Domestic violence. Gay parenting.
Prostitution. Pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Vogel makes us laugh at the most unlikely things.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, when her brother died of AIDS, she wrote ``The
Baltimore Waltz,'' a surreal farce and cathartic comic take on her
loss. And three years ago, she wrote a response to ``Lolita,''
turning it into a seductively humorous tale of a teen-age girl
called Li'l Bit and the sexual advances of her Uncle Peck.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``How I Learned To Drive,'' the play motors down the dark
roads of child abuse and incest with an unexpectedly light tone.
Rather than a story of villain and victim, it tells a more complex
tale of Li'l Bit's ability to take control of her life and move
beyond the potential scars of molestation.
</P>
<P>
   The play not only won the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, but
will be the most produced stage script in America this season, with
26 regional productions scheduled, including the Florida premiere
at Boca Raton's Caldwell Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Why has ``How I Learned to Drive'' become so popular?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Vogel responds automatically, with the
weariness of a writer who has fielded the question too often. ``You
know what? I have to tell you, this is my survival strategy. In
order to survive all the years of rejection, I had to be in a state
of denial. So now I'm denying the success, because I don't
understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   After so many rejection slips for her quirky scripts _ some of
which, Vogel concedes, deserved to be rejected _ this roly-poly,
47-year-old playwright is getting the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always feel that the way we, if not entrap an audience but
get them involved and engaged, is through the response of
laughter,'' says Vogel, by telephone from her Providence, R.I.,
home. ``Once you've laughed at something, you're inside the play
world, you've accepted the rules of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``So of course, I'm making people laugh at Li'l Bit. I'm making
them laugh at the family and at Peck,'' she says, referring to the
richly comic dinner table scenes which show Li'l Bit as
misunderstood and mocked by her blue-collar Maryland clan. ``And
the second that they start laughing, I got them.''
</P>
<P>
   To theatergoers resistant to seeing a play about pedophilia,
Caldwell's Artistic and Managing Director Michael Hall downplays
the label. ``It's really a play about people who are attracted to
each other for very real reasons,'' he says. ``The two of them are
really fascinated by each other, and I want to forget for a long
time that they are related. It's a love story.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact that it is receiving so much attention remains a
puzzlement to Vogel. She begs off the question, but others have
their theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just takes you by surprise,'' says Kim Cozort, who plays
Li'l Bit at the Caldwell. ``She will make you laugh and then, all
of a sudden, she'll (produce) a line or a scene that hits you in
the gut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a writer who dearly loves the theater, and audiences
respond to that, no matter the subject,'' adds director Susan
Booth, whose production of ``How I Learned to Drive'' is at
Chicago's Northlight Theatre and will next transfer to Atlanta's
Alliance Theatre. ``I think she could take on any topic. She's just
not going to take it on in the way that Lifetime television for
women is going to take it on.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Vogel carried the notion of responding to Lolita from
a woman's viewpoint, looking for a striking, personal route into
the story. The breakthrough came when she had a visual image: ``I
saw a woman adjusting a rear view mirror and having a dead man
materialize in the back seat of her car. I knew somehow that that
was the metaphor for my Lolita and that that was my Humbert
(Lolita's older lover) in the back seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a detective, she worked backward from the image to deduce
what her play should be. ``I went, `OK, you've got a woman
adjusting a rear view mirror, it has something to do with driving.'
And I mulled that and thought driving is a wonderful metaphor,
because we learn to drive at the age of sexual ambiguity and
maturity. Sexual adolescence and driving correspond.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogel wrote the relationship between Li'l Bit and Peck as a
series of driving lessons, with metaphorical quotes from a driving
manual. ``I saw how to do that, how I can be seemingly talking
about cars, but actually cars are the female body, which is a
connection that's made by this culture in all of the
advertisements,'' she notes.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was finished, Lolita had been drained from the
play. Unlike such previous Vogel plays as ``Desdemona,'' her
perspective shift on ``Othello,'' or ``Meg,'' her version of ``A
Man For All Seasons'' as told by Sir Thomas More's daughter, ``How
I Learned to Drive'' cruises along on its own power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think where I am now is I've gone from adaptation and
translation into response,'' says Vogel. ``I'm now thinking, `How
do I create a parallel universe that's not the same thing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, ``How I Learned to Drive'' connects with
theatergoers, and Vogel's career is in overdrive. ``I think the
times are in tune with me or I'm in tune with the times,'' she
offers, calling it a ``union between playwright and audience and
zeitgeist. This happens to be my point in time, and I don't know
for how long that will be.''
</P>
<P>
   So she's keeping busy. Her newest play, ``The Mineola Twins,''
opened off-Broadway on Thursday. Published together with ``How I
Learned to Drive'' in a volume dubbed ``The Mammary Plays,'' ``The
Mineola Twins'' is the more overtly comic flip side of the Pulitzer
Prize winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dealing with the same period of time, the '50s through
the '80s,'' explains Vogel. ``It's meant to be the satyr play to
the tragedy. It's dealing with the female body, but in the same way
that Greek playwrights were asked to burlesque their Medeas on the
same night,'' so that audience would go home smiling instead of
depressed. The play spoofs the evolution of suburban life as seen
through identical twins _ one good, one evil _ both played by
Swoosie Kurtz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's me saying, `OK, folks, now for something completely
different.'''
</P>
<P>
   In any mode, colleagues feel she will be a major force in the
theater for a long time to come. ``Paula has always been a
wonderful writer and will always be a wonderful writer,'' says
Molly Smith, who helped develop ``Drive'' at Perseverance Theatre
in Alaska and will present it again this spring at Washington's
Arena Stage, where she is the new artistic director. ``She always
writes about hot-button areas of society. She's constantly going to
places that other writers would be afraid to go to.''
</P>
<P>
   After she won the Pulitzer and had a champagne-fueled party in
Boston with friends and her longtime partner, biology professor and
author Anne Fausto-Sterling, Vogel gave herself a more lasting
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit my day job,'' she says, referring to her resignation as
the director of Brown University's graduate program in playwriting.
``I am now going to be something called professor-at-large, which
always reminds me not to eat dessert. I'm putting the writing first
as sort of my celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   You would too, if you were booked solid with stage and film
writing projects through 2002. First she has to polish her
screenplay of her geriatric hookers play, ``The Oldest
Profession'', scheduled to begin shooting in September with Olympia
Dukakis. For Arena Stage, where Vogel has been named
playwright-in-residence, she has to rewrite her pornography
industry play (``Hot 'n' Throbbing'') and start a history-based
musical called ``A Civil War Christmas'' to premiere at holiday
time in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   She's writing an original script for Showtime cable and is
supposed to deliver her screenplay of ``How I Learned To Drive'' to
director Fred Schepisi (``Roxanne,'' ``Six Degrees of Separation'')
by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great, but it feels a little bit like O'Hare Airport,
with plays circling,'' Vogel laughs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, she has been treated well by film executives, and
doesn't expect to go Hollywood. ``I know who I am and I'm not going
to be somebody who wants to make millions of dollars and buy a big
house in L.A.,'' Vogel insists. ``I'm a New Englander, I've got my
house in Providence. My life is very good, I don't want to change
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she has an academic curiosity about film, and wants to
rethink ``How I Learned To Drive'' for the big screen. ``It's going
to be incredibly seductive, and it's not going to be anything like
the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may go, `Oh, my God, I loved the play, how could
you do this?' And other people who have never seen the play will
ask, `How could that have ever been a play?'''

A MALL'S OPPONENTS DON'T GIVE UP EASILY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBRA WEST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST NYACK, N.Y. _ When the Palisades Center mall opened here in
March, the developers might have thought their long battle with
opponents in the community was finally over. They would have been
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   An average of 300,000 shoppers pass through the glistening mall
doors each week. They pick up lumber at Home Depot and pressed
linen suits at Ann Taylor, kitchen elegance at Williams Sonoma and
bargains at Target.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of Rockland County residents who opposed this
mall-cum-city since it was first proposed in 1985 are not to be
found among the crowds. They still are shocked that the mall, all
four stories and three million square feet of it, was not only
built but has apparently triumphed, while they are still scarred
and paying legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who have devoted a quarter of their lives to
fighting this mall,'' said Linda Rauer, a former shopkeeper and
inveterate environmentalist who became involved in opposing the
mall in the early 1990s when she found out that it was being built
on top of two landfills about 20 miles northwest of Manhattan.
``They are not going to just give up, walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   The opponents, some of whom still hope to close the mall down,
are now focused on insuring that a proposed expansion of the
Palisades Center is voted upon in a public referendum, as promised.
The expansion, which would permit the use of 1.15 million square
feet of unoccupied space at the center, would make it the second
largest mall in America.
</P>
<P>
   So when Rosie O'Donnell, who lives in Nyack, went on her morning
talk show last month and joked about rumors that the mall in her
town was sinking and would soon close, it only made the acrimony
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rauer and the loyal members of the Rockland Civic
Association, a grass-roots organization that was formed to stop the
mall, were incensed. Their last hope for closing the mall _ the
possibility that cracks in the concrete floor and a distinct shimmy
in the structure meant it was unsafe _ was being turned into a
joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a public safety issue,'' Ms. Rauer said. ``We
want a structural engineer to come in and measure whether the mall
is settling. We want a seismic engineer to find out why that
building shakes. The mall is built on two former, unregulated
landfills,'' she said, adding that she fears that despite a system
designed to collect them, contaminants could percolate through the
soil and end up in the drinking supply.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Valenti, a developer of the Palisades Center, concedes
that the underground parking lot at the mall has settled, that
cracks run helter-skelter across the bare concrete floors and that
the building's shake is disconcerting. None of it, however means
the mall is dangerous, Valenti said. He noted that the mall has
been inspected by engineers and backed by bonds that put the
Pyramid Companies, the nation's largest mall developer behind the
$390 million project.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are never satisfied with anything you do,''
Valenti said. ``You clean up landfills and that's not good enough.
You solve the traffic problems, stop the roads from flooding and
that's not good enough. No matter what solution you provide, it's
never going to be good enough for them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Palisades Center was built by the Pyramid Companies of
Syracuse, and their reputation for aggressiveness preceded them
when they came to Rockland County.
</P>
<P>
   The company was investigated by the New York Commission on
government Integrity for spending $776,967 to influence the 1985
election of the Poughkeepsie Town Council to elect members who
favored the construction of the Poughkeepsie Galleria.

in White Plains, brought five suits against Pyramid. Copland, who
lives in West Nyack and in good weather kayaks across the Hudson
River and then bicycles to work, became involved in 1996 when
Pyramid announced its plan to expand from 1.85 million square feet
to more than 3 million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The developer prevailed in all five of Coplan's suits.
</P>
<P>
   The final blow to the opponents came when Pyramid, without
approval from the Clarkstown Planning Board or Town Board went
ahead with plans to build 3 million square feet rather than the
1.85 million that officials had approved. The only approval Pyramid
obtained for the larger structure was from the town building
inspector, Aldoph Milich.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the additional space remains empty, on floors above Lord
&AMP; Taylor and Filene's. A Supreme Court judge ruled, after the
building already was under construction, that the extra space could
be completed but not occupied. It is that empty space that the mall
opponents hope to stop from being filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see how they operate, you can understand why no one
in town believes a word they say,'' said Coplan.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Lasker, the founder of the Rockland Civic Association,
decided that the only way to fight the expansion of the mall, and
what she sees as the overdevelopment of Rockland County, was to run
for the Clarkstown Town Board. She ran in 1997 and lost in a close
election.
</P>
<P>
   She is gearing up for another race this November.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I loved, what I came here for, the parkland, the open
space, is nearly gone to overdevelopment,'' said Ms. Lasker, 48,
who teaches disabled children and has lived in West Nyack for 17
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lasker, like Ms. Rauer and other devoted members of the
Rockland Civic Association, don't patronize the mall. Coplan,
however, has had to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your son is invited to a skating party at the ice rink,
you can't very well tell him that it's the Death Star and you just
can't go,'' Coplan said. ``I went, but I didn't enjoy it.''

<P>
   CONAKRY, Guinea _ When the sun sets, a damp breeze blows in from
the Atlantic Ocean, turning the day's dust to grit, and crowds of
young people congregate along the rutted streets. With them come
the police and the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In this shabby capital of one million on Africa's west coast,
men in uniform are as ubiquitous as the evening's mosquitoes. The
military and some police officers carry guns, especially at the
numerous checkpoints set up after midnight in and around the city.
They demand identity cards. They grab criminal suspects from the
milling throngs, often by the throat, and pat them down. They
search bags and pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The tools of the security forces _ harassment, beatings, even
muggings _ are brutal, but usually not deadly. Human rights
monitors and ordinary Guineans say shootings by police officers are
rare. That is one reason the story of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed
Guinean immigrant shot to death by four New York City police
officers in the Bronx on Feb. 4, resonates so deeply here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence happens, but it's not something we fear all the
time,'' said Mamoudatu Diallo, an uncle of Diallo who used to
travel between New York and Guinea buying and selling electronic
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all its publicity here and the uneasiness it created
among families with relatives in New York, the Diallo killing is
not likely to stem the flow of Guinean immigrants to the United
States. Fear of the authorities at home is not what drives them to
leave. Hardened by the casual brutality and hardships of their
daily lives, many take a certain level of crime and violence for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, like Diallo, Guineans flock to foreign embassies for
visas in growing numbers in the hope of rising above the poverty
that afflicts their country like a chronic disease.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, under the former Socialist regime, university
graduates were guaranteed jobs, and prices were controlled. Now,
unemployment and the cost of living are spiraling upward. So in
Guinea's teeming markets, crumbling shantytowns and lackluster
universities, the image of New York City remains one of vast
opportunities available for the price of loneliness, danger and
hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guineans by nature and temperament are very dynamic, and when
they see the freedom and dynamism of the United States and its
strict judicial and legal system, they are drawn to go there,''
said Alpha Absoulaye Diallo, a prominent Conakry lawyer and former
Guinean diplomat who is not related to the young immigrant slain in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guineans are also very fatalistic. They believe that what will
happen will happen,'' he added. ``For those who know the United
States, they know the police are very severe. That is true in all
countries where there are bandits, and it's especially so in the
United States, where people can freely buy weapons.'' Weapons
purchases are restricted in Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   Guinea declared its independence from French rule in 1958. Once
the richest of France's West African colonies, with 30 percent of
the world's known reserves of bauxite, it is now one of the world's
poorest nations. Only about 20 percent of the 7.5 million people
can read and write. The life expectancy at birth is 44 years.
</P>
<P>
   Under Sekou Toure, the president from independence until his
death in 1984, all Guinean industry was owned by the state. The
regime was brutal and arbitrary, killing or imprisoning thousands
of Toure's opponents. Many people left, by whatever means they
could. An estimated 2 million lived outside the country by early
1980. France, then more welcoming to immigrants from its former
colonies than it is now, was a popular destination. So were
neighboring West African countries and, to a lesser extent, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, 8 out of 10 Guineans relied on subsistence
farming. Private business was outlawed, but some merchants, like
Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, set up trading companies in
next-door Liberia and the Ivory Coast to market goods from Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   When an army general, Lansana Conte, seized power in 1984, he
promised a free-market economy. Later elected president, Conte has
reached out to the diaspora to return and help rebuild. His prime
minister, justice minister and the head of the Supreme Court are
all former emigres.
</P>
<P>
   But change came too slowly for some Guineans, among them
Diallo's father. He moved back to Guinea from Liberia in 1980 but
left with his family again, this time for Thailand, in 1985.
``There were no laws yet to protect businessmen,'' he said,
recalling his decision to leave home again. The father still lives
abroad, in Vietnam, where he imports West African gems.
</P>
<P>
   For those who stayed, life became harder still. The government
cut its work force in half, offering many bureaucrats money to
leave voluntarily, and simply firing many more. People now must pay
for their electricity and the rent on their once-subsidized
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wake-up was brutal,'' said Prosper Dore, editor in chief
of two of Guinea's independent weekly newspapers, La Lance and Le
Lynx. ``Suddenly we had to pay for this and we needed that.
Unemployment exploded. People who finish university don't have
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   While the more open economy drew foreign companies to Guinea,
they needed employees with computer and other skills that local
universities did not provide. At the same time, civil war broke out
in Liberia and then in Sierra Leone, making cross-border trading
hazardous. Even movement within Guinea is more time-consuming and
perilous, as the government has increased the number of army
checkpoints in an effort to prevent foreign fighters from slipping
into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Many Guineans leave home with unrealistic expectations,
especially about the educational possibilities open to them, Dore
said. ``A lot of Guineans think they only have to show up at a
university and enroll,'' said Dore, who has used his newspapers to
explain how to prepare better for the immigrant life.
</P>
<P>
   Like Diallo, some find their dreams cut short by violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that many Guineans before Amadou were killed in New
York,'' said Mohamed Mouktar Diallo, a cousin of Diallo who studied
economics and computer science in Canada and Washington. ``But they
are usually doing something dangerous, like driving a cab in
Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Diallo, who sold tube socks and other goods from a sidewalk
table in Manhattan to finance his computer classes, many Guineans
also find that earning a living and an education abroad is an
exhausting enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've talked to young people there in America who say that
if they tighten their belts, they can eventually take care of their
families better and even put some money aside,'' Dore said. ``They
say they prefer to live in the subway in New York, even with the
dangers, than be back in Conakry, where there are no jobs.''

 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To a Colombian woman just 21 years old and dirt-poor,
the chance to earn $10,000 was too enticing to turn down. So she
swallowed one tiny balloon after another packed with heroin _
nearly a pound in all _ and boarded a flight to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sent by traffickers back home to deliver the heroin to
wholesalers in New York, she began a race against time to clear
customs at Newark International Airport before the dozens of
thumb-size pellets passed through her intestines or disintegrated
in her stomach, triggering a potentially fatal overdose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed the money,'' she said. ``They always look for young
people who need money.''
</P>
<P>
   Known on the streets and by federal agents as swallowers, the
young woman and scores of others like her have become an important
link in a heroin trafficking chain that extends from Colombia to
New York. The trade is not new: New York has long been a prime
destination for smuggled heroin, not only as a bustling
international transport hub but also as a market in its own right,
where as much as half of the heroin in the United States is
consumed.
</P>
<P>
   But the flow of the drug _ which has declined in price as it has
risen in purity _ is escalating. At Newark and Kennedy
International Airport, 75 percent of drug investigations now
involve heroin, according to U.S. Customs Service officials.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents have expanded their operations at the airports in
their ever-evolving cat-and-mouse game with traffickers _ one that
now largely pivots on catching the couriers who smuggle heroin in
their luggage, under their clothing and, increasingly, inside their
stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question there are more internal carries,'' said
John C. Varrone, the special agent in charge of Customs Service
investigations in New York and New Jersey. ``The most preferred
method now used by drug couriers is to smuggle internally,
primarily by swallowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Customs inspectors said they have found drugs on airline
passengers as old as 84 and as young as 13. Traffickers are using
more and more women to swallow the heroin, often more than 100
pellet-like little balloons at a time, in the hopes they will
arouse less suspicion at checks.
</P>
<P>
   For the swallowers, being paid thousands of dollars per trip is
hardly easy money. Ruptured balloons, a consequent massive drug
overdose and possibly fatal coma are not uncommon. Neither is
getting caught: the number of swallowers stopped by the authorities
in New York increased last year to 319, from 273 in 1997 and 233 in
1996, according to Customs officials.
</P>
<P>
   Couriers have also turned up dead near Newark and Kennedy, the
authorities said, their stomachs ripped open to salvage the heroin
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the public is aware how vicious these
organizations are,'' said Lewis Rice Jr., the special agent in
charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration's operations in New
York. ``The people who use heroin at a party don't think about what
it took to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Customs agents and inspectors in New York and New
Jersey intercepted 1,066 pounds of heroin, about one-third of
federal seizures of heroin in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian traffickers, who the authorities say are responsible
for 70 percent of the heroin sold on the East Coast, have blitzed
New York so relentlessly that heroin has declined in price while
its street purity has soared. An analysis of drugs bought by
undercover agents in 1997 and 1998 found the purity of heroin sold
in parts of Brooklyn and the Bronx above 90 percent, compared with
barely 5 percent in the early 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes an organization less effort to fill up a courier with
heroin than to package and ship a larger amount of cocaine with the
same value,'' said Varrone, explaining why heroin is now the
product of choice for smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian woman said she underwent a 15-day procedure to
prepare her body for ingesting the heroin, including prepping her
throat by swallowing grapes and then carrots shaped like pellets.
The day before the trip, she said, the courier is taken to a
pharmacy and injected with a relaxant to facilitate swallowing.
``They don't tell you the size of the pellets,'' she said in a
recent interview. ``They say it's very easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the flight, she said, a swallower is given a pill to
control the bowels, and a tranquilizer and a liquid anesthetic to
numb the pain. ``The pellets usually scratch your throat and it
starts to bleed.''
</P>
<P>
   To catch smugglers, Customs officials scrutinize passenger
manifests of flights before arrival. In the terminals, they employ
drug-sniffing dogs and the intuition of roving inspectors. Kennedy
has installed a $100,000 body scanner that detects drugs concealed
inside clothing.
</P>
<P>
   But with more heroin carried on or inside the body, the
inspectors have had to resort to more invasive X-rays, pat-downs or
strip searches of suspects, who may be detained and given a
laxative on the suspicion they have swallowed drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The growing use of heroin swallowers has coincided with a boom
in air travel, engendering a new strategy in which customs
inspectors stop far fewer travelers, but grill those more
thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stopped everybody coming in would we get more?'' asked
John J. Martuge, the customs area director at Kennedy. ``Yes. But
would Congress stand for that kind of scrutiny? It would bring air
traffic to a screeching halt.''
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Colombian traffickers routinely dispatch a handful of
couriers unknown to each other on the same flight, counting on one
arrest to distract inspectors while the others slip unnoticed into
the United States. ``If you can get five swallowers on a plane and
one gets caught and four get through, you've had a good day,'' Rice
said of the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 50,892 airline passengers were searched nationwide,
of whom 709 underwent X-rays. Heroin and other contraband were
found on 2,116 passengers, or 4 percent of those searched, but in
28 percent of those subjected to X-rays, according to customs
statistics. At Kennedy and Newark Airports, 61 percent of the
passengers stopped and X-rayed were found smuggling drugs; in
Miami, the figure approached 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the searches have not come without controversy. Travelers
have sued the Customs Service, alleging that they were stopped and
searched because of their race or ethnicity. Some of the cases have
been dismissed; others are pending.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Court decisions support the right of governments to search
people coming into the country,'' said Raymond W. Kelly, the
customs commissioner and former New York City police commissioner.
He denied that inspectors profiled potential couriers by race or
ethnic group, adding that, ``What we do is focus on high-risk
flights from high-risk countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 50,892 passengers searched nationwide last year,
according to Customs statistics, 15,379 were Hispanic, 13,183 were
white, 6,641 were black and 3,841 were Asian. The rest (11,857)
were not identified by race.
</P>
<P>
   Heroin trafficking is driven not merely by demand but also by
breathtakingly lucrative profits. A kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, of
heroin refined in Colombia from $4,000 worth of opium gum can fetch
from $75,000 to $100,000 on arrival in New York. The kilo delivered
by the courier is immediately taken to a drug ``mill,'' where it is
cut with a diluent and repackaged in about 35,000 glassine
envelopes for sale at $10 _ a ``dime bag'' _ netting a total of
$350,000 on the street.
</P>
<P>
   For the 21-year-old Colombian woman and other swallowers, their
mission is to get rid of the ingested heroin before it gets
absorbed into the bloodstream from the stomach, with possibly fatal
consequences. When a pellet wedges in the intestine, death is
slower but more agonizing, said Dr. Sally L. Satel, an addiction
psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian courier, who spoke on condition that her name not
be used for fear that traffickers would harm her family, said her
first trip left her hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my first trip, the pellets were not properly wrapped, and
when I swallowed them, I became dizzy, very tired and nauseous,''
she said. After delivering the heroin, she said, she went into a
coma for five days.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she made two more trips. She said swallowers usually make 10
trips before the organization lets them quit. ``Because when you
get involved, they always need you,'' she said. ``They look for
you. And when you say no, they say they know where your family is
and where your kids are, and please to do them this favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly of customs described the traffickers as predatory in their
recruitment. ``They use women,'' he said in a telephone interview
from Washington. ``They use pregnant women. They use children. They
use any means.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last half of 1998, customs officials counted six
travelers nationwide who subsequently turned up dead with heroin in
their stomachs. Five of the bodies were found within a short drive
of Newark Airport. The sixth, in Chicago, involved someone who
traveled through Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other such fatalities. Between May 1995 and last
October, four bodies, some of them gutted, were crammed into
suitcases or bags and dumped in western Queens. The Queens County
District Attorney Richard A. Brown concluded that the victims were
swallowers who failed to excrete their drug loads.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is the individual sitting in a room with the drug
dealers starts to get sick, the condoms burst,'' he said. ``They
let that individual die and once he's dead, they cut him open and
get the drugs and dump him in a desolate area.''
</P>
<P>
   The flow of Colombian heroin also is increasingly routed through
Nigeria, drug agents said. But because the trip is considerably
longer, the couriers often hide the drugs under their clothes or in
luggage or packages they carry aboard airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   One such courier, a 30-year-old Nigerian woman who was traveling
with her infant son, was arrested in September at Newark Airport
after being found carrying a box containing four pounds of heroin
hidden under smoked fish. The inspector, she said, ``felt that the
box was funny.'' She added: ``He just pinched it with his knife and
he saw the drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the traffickers never told her how much heroin she was
carrying. ``I just knew it was drugs in the bag,'' she said. The
woman, who is serving 38 months in a federal prison, admitted
having made two earlier drug-runs because she and her husband, who,
she said, earned $35 a month back home between them, needed the
money. ``I decided I should do what I had to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents try to use arrested couriers to trace the drugs
back to the trafficking rings. But Lloyd Epstein, a New York lawyer
who has defended heroin swallowers, said most couriers do not know
anyone substantially higher in the trafficking ring and have
nothing to offer beyond a telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are paid for their stomachs, not their minds,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian courier's smuggling days are over. She was
arrested at Newark airport last fall after making her third trip;
another courier identified her to drug agents.
</P>
<P>
   She faces a minimum of 20 years in a federal prison.

 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden _ with its antique
lanterns, cherry and pine trees, shrubs and flowers and waterfalls
_ has been the esthetic heart of Brooklyn since its opening as the
centerpiece of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden in 1915. It is
breathtakingly colorful in the spring and sublimely austere in the
snow, and attracts Brooklynites and tourists from near and far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little piece of Japan transplanted to Brooklyn,'' said
Eugene Himmelstein, who lives in the nearby Flatbush neighborhood
and visits the garden frequently.
</P>
<P>
   But gardens, which face the incessant effects of rainfall,
drought and the inevitable death of plants, are disturbingly
impermanent. The Japanese Garden has been falling apart, and the
Botanic Garden has begun an intensive program to save it.
</P>
<P>
   Because the garden is so beloved, however, its admirers fret
about any change. People worry that trees will be needlessly cut
down; that animals living in the pool _ including a giant snapping
turtle named Godzilla _ will be harmed, and that the intentions of
the garden's designer, Takeo Shiota, will be obliterated because no
Japanese-trained horticulturalists are involved in the restoration.
For the garden's first quarter-century, almost all the gardeners
were Japanese. No plans for the Japanese Garden have been found,
and it is not even clear if Shiota drew any.
</P>
<P>
   ``The garden needs to have the hand of someone trained in Japan
to certify the authenticity of the change,'' said Victoria Ehrlich,
a member of the garden's auxiliary who works in the garden one day
a week as a volunteer. ``Being about right or 99 percent right
isn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ehrlich, whose adherence to Zen Buddhism influences her own
esthetic sensibility, pointed out that as in calligraphy, painting,
flower arrangement and other branches of Japanese art, formal
gardens follow specific formulas.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Zuk, the garden's president, insists that the current
work will be largely invisible after it is finished, and that
Japanese experts will be called in if something unexpected comes
up.
</P>
<P>
   The design is being done by Vollmer Associates, landscape
architects, because of the firm's experience remodeling the Turtle
Pond in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zuk is concerned enough about fears that the garden's
character will be marred that she had a long meeting with Ms.
Ehrlich to answer her questions. She also met with Jane Gill, a
Brooklyn Heights resident who had written a letter wondering
whether Ms. Zuk was destroying the garden in order to save it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gill's worries were allayed. ``As happens with root canal,
I'll try to make it through the digging and construction phase,''
she wrote in a second letter. ``And I look forward to more springs
of Weeping Cherry blooms reflected in the pond.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zuk's case is simple: repairs are urgently needed, or the
Japanese Garden will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have now is a big mud puddle rather than a pond,'' she
said, explaining that erosion has turned what was originally a
five-foot-deep lake into two feet of water resting over three feet
of muck. Fully four feet of shoreline has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last five years, it's been an almost geometric
progression,'' she said. ``This is like the Mississippi Delta.''
</P>
<P>
   But erosion is not the only problem. The sad truth, Ms. Zuk
said, is that the four-acre garden has not been properly tended in
years.
</P>
<P>
   Some tree roots are exposed because of erosion. Young trees have
not replaced those that died. The lovely Japanese irises are gone.
The tree peonies are dangerously diminished. The azaleas are fading
from old age.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is to close the garden for six months beginning in
July. The pond will be drained, and the muck will be trucked away.
Eroded hillsides will be rebuilt, shorelines will be girdled to
hold them in place, the storm drain system will be upgraded. A new
fence will replace one that is falling down, and trees will be
planted to fill what Ms. Zuk calls ``gaps in the garden's teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost will be $3 million, with $2.5 million coming from
appropriations won by Brooklyn members of the City Council and the
remainder from the 1996 state environmental bond act.
</P>

   Repairing the Japanese Garden is one of a series of smaller jobs
at the Botanic Garden in the wake of opening a $25 million
conservatory, a new children's garden and a new administrative
building over the last decade. Other projects include redoing
paths, replanting the fragrance and herb gardens and fixing the
leaking Rose Arc Pool. ``Over the next decade we'll be looking at
all the garden features,'' Ms. Zuk said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Japanese Garden, perhaps the most popular place in
Brooklyn for wedding photographs, comes first.
</P>
<P>
   Walking around it, Ms. Zuk said to imagine four feet of the
shoreline filled in. There will again be double-blossom cherries on
both sides of the path. She pointed to the young Korean pines,
nestled among older Austrian pines, as an example of how the garden
should have been managed over the years. There are too many old
trees, she said, though she promised they will be propped up as
long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Features will return that have been gone for generations,
including two statues of storks standing elegantly in the lake that
old photographs show. Lotus plants, a standard in Japanese gardens,
will again bloom, but this time they will be confined by underwater
wires to prevent them from taking over the pond as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the koi _ the orange, white and black carp
species _ will return. So will many box turtles. But Ms. Zuk would
not promise that Godzilla would be back, although he would
definitely find an appropriate home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love him,'' she said. ``He's a nice old guy.''

OLIVETTI MAKES $60 BILLION BID FOR MAJOR RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story has been added to the front page.)

<P>
   ROME _ In a hostile move not unlike David's bold assault on
Goliath, Olivetti SpA, the midsized Italian computer and telephone
company, announced Saturday that it was opening an effort to
acquire the former Italian state telephone company, Telecom Italia
SpA, for 52.24 billion euros, about $60.56 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal moves ahead, it would be one of the largest
corporate acquisitions ever, intended to restore direction and
purpose to the former Italian state telephone monopoly, which has
been largely rudderless since it was privatized by the government
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government, which holds a ``golden share'' of 3.4
percent in Telecom Italia, could block the move at any time, and it
was unclear whether Olivetti had disclosed its plans to government
leaders before making its offer.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia, which is now owned by banks, pension funds and
the Agnelli family, is said to be mustering troops to defend
itself, considering a rival takeover bid by its own mobile
telephone subsidiary, Telecom Italia Mobile SpA, known as TIM, to
counter what it evidently viewed as a hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia, measured by market capitalization, is more than
five times the size of Olivetti, the 90-year-old former typewriter
company that nearly went bankrupt in the mid-1990s before
reinventing itself as an operator of phone systems.
</P>
<P>
   The bid appeared for the moment to set the stage for a dramatic
struggle for control of Telecom Italia, an unusual development in
the chummy world of corporate Italy, where deals are usually struck
quietly and announced only when they have been signed and sealed.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Olivetti said the bid would be mounted by its
computer subsidiary, Tecnost SpA, and would involve 5.26 billion
shares of common stock with a nominal value of 1,000 lire (0.51
euro, or 59 cents) each, representing all of Telecom Italia's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti officials published the bid in a filing to the Italian
stock-market regulatory body Consob.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia ranks as the world's sixth-largest phone company,
but it has undergone three changes in management in the last 18
months. Franco Bernabe, its present chairman, is a hard-nosed
executive who successfully ran the giant Italian oil group, ENI
SpA, before he was given the top job at Telecom Italia last year
and charged with putting it back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Bernabe, as was expected, did not take the attack lying down,
and managers at Telecom Italia said he had scheduled meetings
Saturday for the boards of Telecom Italia and TIM to consider a
rival takeover bid to counter Olivetti's move.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning appeared to be that TIM, which has been raking in
earnings thanks to Italy's vibrant mobile-phone market and which is
60.14 percent controlled by Telecom Italia, would use its resources
to raise the capital needed to defend the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Olivetti announced that its board would meet on
Sunday to review a ``strategic investment'' regarding Telecom
Italia. But the company apparently decided to jump the gun after
details of the planned offer became public.
</P>
<P>
   According to the terms of the bid that Olivetti announced
Saturday, Olivetti is expected to raise some $10 billion by selling
its telephone subsidiaries, Infostrada and Omnitel Pronto Italia,
to Mannesmann AG of Germany, its partner in those ventures. It said
it would obtain guarantees from Italian and foreign banks for the
remainder of the cash needed.

N.J. COLUMN: A RISKY MIX _ SMALL ROADS AND BIG RIGS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST AMWELL, N.J. _ The interstate now begins at the end of
Barbara Gill's driveway, on what the maps still call County Road
179.
</P>
<P>
   At least it feels that way to Mrs. Gill. County Road 179 is no
more than two lanes wide, but it has become a lot scarier now that
caravans of semitrailer trucks are constantly growling through this
and other back roads and main streets of central New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   If one of those trucks is coming up behind Mrs. Gill when she is
getting ready to turn left into her driveway, she just keeps going,
down to the corner where the gas station used to be. Then she turns
around and goes back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no telling how good his brakes are, or if he even sees
us,'' Mrs. Gill said. ``We don't even try to turn.''
</P>
<P>
   For reasons ranging from highway construction to toll rates to
the online shopping phenomenon, New Jersey's familiar north-south
highway pattern is spreading east to west. People in little towns
like this have found that roads laid out for horses, and later for
drivers who drove slowly enough to wave, are now clogged with
tractor-trailers that come from far away and are headed for no
place near here.
</P>
<P>
   For someone accustomed to the whispering silence of county
roads, the sudden appearance of a semi with Texas plates bulking
over a hill can be as disorienting as encountering a locomotive on
a sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the business of the left turn has become such a
topic around here, where roads are too narrow to let an impatient
teamster muscle past on the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little trips, like going down 31 to the Pennington Market,
that used to be a piece of cake are just no fun at all anymore,''
said Andy Reid, a township committeeman for East Amwell, next door
to here. ``You're sitting there waiting to turn left with your
blinker on and your eyes on your rearview mirror and your heart in
your throat, and you're scared to death.''
</P>
<P>
   An elderly couple died last year when their car was rear-ended
by one truck and driven head-on into another as they waited to turn
left at the Amwell Diner on Highway 31. Two others have died on
that road in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   So when The Hunterdon County Democrat ran a letter not long ago
about the perils of left turns in the age of semis, its headline
was ``Pray for Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Reed, the mayor of Princeton Township, another
truck-clogged place, said he believed that the surge in semis was
due mostly to the completion of Interstate 287 through northern New
Jersey, which connected the highway with the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey
Thruway. Now trucks from the Philadelphia region can take a rural
road, like U.S. 206 through Princeton, to pick up I-287 in
Somerville and avoid tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   But adversity has made trucking experts of many these days, and
what Reed and others have discovered is that the very commercial
geography of New Jersey and its neighbors has shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was because of 287,'' the mayor said. But traffic
counts show that 25 percent of the trucks passing through this
region are from Easton, Bethlehem and Allentown in eastern
Pennsylvania, ``where government programs have helped turn all
those closed-down steel mills into distribution centers,'' Reed
said.
</P>
<P>
   And the enemy is also us, said Reid, the East Amwell
committeeman. ``Just-in-time stocking has really boosted trucking
exponentially,'' he said, ``and so has home shopping through
catalogs and online purchases, where the goods come directly to our
houses. So some of this is a problem of our own life styles.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Turnpike Authority has cut truck tolls at certain
hours to lure back some traffic, and Princeton, the Amwells and
other towns have lowered some speed limits. The state police have
stepped up truck checks on back roads and the use of portable
roadside weigh stations to keep big rigs legal, and perhaps to
nudge a few drivers back onto no-hassle interstates.
</P>
<P>
   But this is scant comfort to Marian Williamson, Mrs. Gill's
neighbor here. She, too, often has to drive out of her way to avoid
turning left into her driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here a long time,'' she said, ``and this is not
progress, I can tell you that.''

MORTGAGE REFINANCING STRATEGIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Homeowners thinking of refinancing their loans to
take advantage of the prevailing low interest rates, as well as
borrowers who simply want the lowest monthly payment possible,
should be aware of two potential strategies in the always complex
world of mortgages _ swapping ``jumbo'' loans for less costly
``conforming'' loans or, for shorter terms, making use of
adjustable-rate loans calculated by using a 40-year amortization
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say that the mortgage refinance market has pretty much
died,'' said Neil Bader, chief executive officer of Skyscraper
Mortgage, a Manhattan mortgage broker. ``But for many homeowners,
it can still make sense to refinance.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that a recent increase in the maximum loan amount
acceptable to Fannie Mae _ the nation's largest source of
residential mortgage funds _ may make refinancing attractive for
homeowners who, until now, have not had any real incentive to cash
in an old loan for a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good time for homeowners to sit down and crunch the
numbers on their mortgage,'' Bader said, explaining that while it
might not have made sense for some homeowners to refinance as
little as two months ago, it might make sense to do so now. The
main reason, he said, is because of the increase in Fannie Mae's
limit on ``conforming loans'' _ loans that meet the company's
underwriting criteria.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Bader said, the maximum loan that Fannie Mae would
accept on a single-family home was $227,150. On Jan. 1, however,
the loan limit for such dwellings was increased to $240,000. Limits
on two-, three- and four-family dwellings increased
proportionately, Bader said, going from $290,650 to $307,100,
$351,300 to $371,200 and $436,600 to $461,350, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``These increases present a substantial savings opportunity for
homeowners who want to swap their jumbo mortgages for conforming
loans,'' Bader said. He explained that jumbo loans _ those that
exceed the Fannie Mae limit _ typically carry interest rates that
are .50 to .75 of a percentage point higher than conforming loans.
As a result, he said, any increase in the conforming-loan limit
means more homeowners are likely to benefit from refinancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in a position to cash in on the new limits are those
whose original loans have been paid down to within striking
distance of $240,000,'' Bader said. Thus, he added, it might even
make sense for such a homeowner to use any cash available to pay
down the existing mortgage enough to be able to refinance at
conforming-loan levels.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the difference between the cost of a jumbo loan
and a conforming loan Bader provided the following example:
</P>
<P>
   A $241,000 jumbo mortgage at 7.25 percent interest, he said,
would result in a monthly payment of $1,644. A $240,000 conforming
loan taken at the same point in time, however, would generally
carry an interest rate of 6.75 percent. That would result in a
monthly payment of $1,556 _ $88 less a month for just a $1,000
difference in the loan amount.
</P>
<P>
   Bader said that lower monthly payments alone don't always
justify refinancing. He noted that borrowers must also take into
consideration closing costs of the new loan and determine whether
the loan will be held long enough to recover those costs.
</P>
<P>
   Bader pointed out, however, that the interest rates used in the
above example reflect only the difference between jumbo and
conforming loans at the same point; those who are paying interest
rates on jumbo loans taken out several years ago _ rates that are
probably higher than prevailing rates for such loans today _ would
save even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This increase in the conforming loan limit hits right in the
breadbasket for borrowers in the New York area,'' Bader said,
explaining that the average loan made by his company last year was
around $252,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential benefit for some borrowers, Bader said, is the
increasing willingness of lenders to offer adjustable-rate loans
with payment schedules based on a 40-year amortization.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage
publishing company in Butler, N.J., said that such mortgages could
be useful for borrowers who want to pay the smallest monthly
payment possible for a relatively short number of years.
</P>
<P>
   Adjustable-rate mortgages, Gumbinger explained, carry initial
interest rates that are somewhat lower than fixed-rate loans. The
initial, lower rate, however, is subject to change after a fixed
period of time, usually from 1 to 10 years. And while monthly
payments are usually calculated on a 30-year payment schedule, such
loans generate the greatest savings when they are held for a short
period of time _ usually as long as the low initial rate lasts.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching the amortization period of the loan from 30 to 40
years lowers the monthly payment even further.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gumbinger said, the monthly payment on a $200,000
loan at 7 percent interest using a 30-year amortization schedule
would be $1,330. The same loan paid on a 40-year schedule, he said,
would cost $1,242 a month _ a savings of about $80 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The longer such a loan is kept, however, Gumbinger said, the
more it ends up costing in the long run. After just five years, for
example, the borrower in the above example would have paid $69,099
in interest and would owe a balance of $188,263 using a 30-year
payment schedule. Five years' worth of payments on a 40-year
payment plan, on the other hand, would result in the payment of
more money in interest _ $69,116 _ with a higher outstanding
balance of $194,545.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 40-year amortization loan is certainly an option if you want
to keep your out-of-pocket expenses down,'' Gumbinger said. ``But
keep in mind that it's only good for the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   But keeping a mortgage for the short term isn't necessarily good
for lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Oded Ben-Ami, senior loan officer for Sterling National Mortgage
in Great Neck, explained that investors who make mortgage money
available to lenders have traditionally earned a good portion of
their income by servicing loans they purchase from the lenders.
Because of the expectation that the service agreements would last
for seven years, investors have usually been willing to offer
no-point financing programs to their lenders, who then make them
available to borrowers. Points are fees, expressed as a percentage
of the amount borrowed; 1 point on a $200,000 loan would be $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the wave of refinancings in recent years has made servicing
loans a losing proposition because the loans are often exchanged
for a new loan before the servicing arrangement turns a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investors are now acting defensively,'' Ben-Ami said.
``They're realizing that they better collect some money up front or
these loans may not pay anything back at all.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, it is now becoming increasingly common for
investors to discourage lenders from offering ``zero-point''
mortgage programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely differences from lender to lender,''
Ben-Ami said. ``So it is now more important than ever to shop
around.''

RELIC INDIANA RESORT HOTEL IS FOR SALE AT $31 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT SHAROFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST BADEN SPRINGS, Ind. _ For sale: Architecturally stunning
turn of the century resort hotel on 710 acres in rustic downstate
Indiana. Guests included Diamond Jim Brady and Al Capone. No golf
course or swimming pool but abundant mineral springs. Partially
renovated. Price: $31 million or best offer.
</P>
<P>
   Any takers?
</P>
<P>
   William Cook, by most reckonings the richest man in Indiana, has
spent $31 million over the last two years renovating the historic
West Baden Springs Hotel in this fading resort town of 675 people
about an hour west of Louisville, Ky., and two hours south of
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Cook is the founder of Cook Group, a medical instrument
manufacturer in Bloomington, Ind. His personal fortune has been
estimated recently by Forbes magazine at more than $1 billion. Now
he and his partner in the project, the Historic Landmarks
Foundation of Indiana, are trying to sell the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that it won't be easy. ``It's a fantastic place
but it's in the middle of nowhere,'' he said. ``When I got involved
with it, I wasn't thinking dollars and cents. I wanted to save a
part of history.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, he has done so. But at the same time, he is
learning one of the great realities of the historic renovation
business _ that finding new uses for architecturally significant
historic buildings can be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   No one says the hotel is not worth saving. When the West Baden
Springs Hotel opened in 1902, it was billed as the Carlsbad of
America and the eighth wonder of the world. Until the construction
of the Houston Astrodome in the mid-1960s, it had the world's
largest enclosed atrium and dome. The hotel's name (pronounced West
BAYden) alludes to Wiesbaden, the town in Germany that is
celebrated for its mineral springs, as is the former Carlsbad, now
known as Karlovy Vary, in what is now the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The building was designed by Harrison Albright, a West Virginia
architect who designed a number of hotels and public buildings. It
is generally acknowledged, however, that the idea for the atrium
came from the hotel's owner, Lee Sinclair, a banker turned hotelier
with a flair for hype and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier hotel on the site, also owned by Sinclair, burned in
1901. In planning its replacement, Sinclair was determined to trump
his neighbor down the road, the better known French Lick Springs
Hotel in French Lick.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the towns of West Baden Springs and French Lick
were two of the most famous resort communities in the country.
Founded before the Civil War, they became famous because of the
innumerable mineral springs in the area, which were presumed to
have great medicinal value. An early advertisement for the West
Baden Springs Hotel claimed that drinking the sulphurous water that
gushed from several springs on the property would cure more than 50
health problems, including alcoholism, pimples and malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Later, with the onset of Prohibition, the emphasis switched from
curing alcoholism to encouraging illegal drinking. In the '20s the
area developed a raffish reputation as a haven for illegal drinking
and gambling. A character in the original 1927 production of the
musical ``Show Boat'' talked about winning ``a thousand at roulette
alone'' at French Lick. The line was later cut after the owner of
the French Lick Hotel protested.
</P>
<P>
   To say that the hotel dominates the town of West Baden Springs
is an understatement. Nothing else comes close. Visitors approach
the hotel by passing through a double arched entry gate off Route
56 in the middle of town and driving a quarter mile or so under an
overarching canopy of trees. In the distance are acres of
landscaped grounds and a number of architecturally distinctive
secondary buildings that once housed everything from stables to
bowling alleys.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the hotel comes into view _ an enormous, round
six-story building constructed of yellow brick with a scalloped
roof line and a wide veranda around the base. There are four
Moorish towers, two at each of two main entrances. And topping it
all off is a gigantic red tiled dome studded with skylights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building is unique _ there's eight acres under one roof
here,'' said George Ridgway, president of G.S. Ridgway and
Associates of Vincennes, Ind., the architecture firm overseeing the
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, said Ridgway, ``the guest rooms are almost secondary to
the building. They just happen to be around the atrium.'' The
atrium _ surrounded by two rings of rooms separated by a corridor _
is a stunner: 100 feet tall and 200 feet in diameter and ringed
with 24 enormous Ionic columns.
</P>
<P>
   The floor is marble terrazzo in an elaborate pattern. Many guest
rooms that surround the atrium have wrought-iron balconies that
provide dizzying views of the interior. The final effect is closer
to a Baroque church in Rome than a hotel in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The West Baden Springs Hotel went out of business in the
Depression and afterwards became first West Baden College, a Jesuit
seminary, and then an independent college, the Northwood Institute.
It has been vacant since 1983 and for a long time was tangled in a
complicated bankruptcy case.
</P>
<P>
   By 1991, the building had deteriorated to the point where a
section of the outside wall had collapsed and the building was
included on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's annual
list of the most endangered national landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The next year the Indiana Historic Landmarks Foundation spent
just over $200,000 to stabilize the building, and four years later
bought it outright for $250,000. ``We knew if we didn't do it, it
would just cave in,'' said Tina Connor, director of marketing for
the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Cook, who had been involved in a number of
historic renovation projects in Bloomington and other parts of the
state, offered to help. His agreement with the foundation is an
unusual one. ``There's nothing on paper,'' said Ms. Connor. The
foundation continues to own the building through a subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   But this did not stop Cook from embarking on an extensive
renovation effort that involved reinforcing the building and
restoring the public areas, beginning with the atrium. The project
was completed last fall and unveiled at a lavish benefit dinner
that attracted over a thousand people, including Indiana's Gov.
Frank O'Bannon and two former governors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cook, the building is about half renovated. Still
to be done are the guest rooms and the ballroom. The hotel at one
time had more than 700 rooms with just one elevator (it now has
two), but many of the rooms were small and without bathrooms. Cook
said that after renovation there would be perhaps 260 rooms. He
noted, however, that work is being done on just one model suite on
one of the upper floors, pending determination of the building's
use.
</P>
<P>
   What that use might be is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, 14 different rail lines converged on the area and
travelers could choose from more than 20 hotels. Today the trains
are long gone and the only hotel still functioning as such is the
venerable French Lick Springs Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the things the area had going for it in the first part
of the century no longer apply,'' said Mark Siegel, assistant vice
president of finance at Duke Realty Investments, a real estate
investment trust in Indianapolis, who has looked at the property.
</P>
<P>
   There is also considerable uncertainty about how to market the
building. So far, no brokerage firm has been engaged. Marketing
efforts are being coordinated jointly by the Landmarks Foundation
and executives at Cook's company.
</P>
<P>
   Cook has fixed a possible price of $31 million on the property,
based on what he needs to recoup at least part of his investment,
but no one really knows what it is worth. ``We got into it thinking
that it possibly could be used as a back office for a corporation
or as a hotel or _ naively, I guess _ as a casino,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling does not appear to be an option at this point and many
real estate professionals think the outlook for the other two
possibilities is mixed at best.
</P>
<P>
   Cook is more optimistic but also sees what he is up against. ``I
got carried away by my passion for it,'' he said, explaining why he
got caught up in a cause in which he might have to take a loss.
``But selling it is another question.''

NYC TO SEIZE CARS OF PERSONS ARRESTED FOR DRUNK DRIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In what city officials described as the toughest
municipal policy against drunken driving in the nation, the New
York City Police Department will begin seizing cars from people
arrested on charges of drunken driving, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which is to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Monday, will
allow a police officer to seize a suspect's car where it is
stopped, regardless of the driver's circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a very, very useful way to reduce even more the
number of traffic fatalities in the city,'' Giuliani said at a news
conference at police headquarters in lower Manhattan. ``If you've
had even one drink, you should find somebody else to drive your
automobile or you should stay where you are, or use public
transportation. We have to find every possible way to get that
message across to people.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials first floated the seizure plan about a month ago.
Since then, Giuliani said, he had Michael Hess, the city's
corporation counsel, study the legal ramifications to make sure
that the plan would survive what the mayor said were almost
inevitable court challenges from civil liberties groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to spend some time preparing this in a way that we
will have a very strong argument, and one that will prevail, that
this is legal, constitutional and a fair balance of the rights of
individuals as against the right to protect society against drunk
driving,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the initiative raised constitutional issues
but could act as a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can put the driver in jail for being drunk while
driving, it seems to me there's no greater deprivation in taking
the instrumentality of that crime from him,'' said Richard Uviller,
a professor of criminal law at Columbia University Law School.
``It's a Draconian measure, there's no question about it. But if
people know they could lose their cars if they drink too much, they
may not drive them, and that could be very effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Laws in 22 states authorize municipal officials to confiscate
the cars of drunken drivers, but virtually all those laws involve
repeat offenders, officials with the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration have said.
</P>
<P>
   State law allows the seizure of vehicles owned by drivers who
repeatedly drive while intoxicated, but that law has rarely been
enforced. In taking the initiative, New York City is expanding a
city forfeiture law that municipalities use to cut down on drug
trafficking and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of civil liberties groups bristled Saturday at
Giuliani's plan and and promised to seek constitutional challenges
to it in court.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said the law gave too much authority to the police
to determine punishment. ``It's not up to the police commissioner
to impose the penalty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new seizure law will create ``a lot of chaos in the city,''
predicted Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union. ``People driving cars around New York are not
going to be too happy about this. I think it's really a reflection
of Giuliani's instinct for authoritarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the New York City police made 6,368 arrests for
driving while intoxicated, in which a driver's blood alcohol level
is 0.10 percent or higher. In New York, drivers can also be stopped
for driving while impaired, in which the threshold for blood
alcohol is 0.06 percent to 0.09 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the new seizure policy will only affect driving while
intoxicated, said Police Commissioner Howard Safir.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's plan was enthusiastically endorsed by a
representative of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, a national
organization that has long advocated harsher penalties for drunken
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drunk driving is a violent crime, and the weapon of choice is
a vehicle. Does MADD have any sympathy for the drunk drivers who
may lose their expensive cars? Absolutely not,'' said Maureen
Fisher-Riccardella, president of the New York state chapter of the
organization, who stood beside Giuliani during the news conference.
``Do we want to hear about the possible hardships to them and their
families? No.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some experts said they wondered whether taking away a family car
might inadvertently punish the innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose that's the only car in the family, and it's relied
upon by the family,'' said Robert Blecker, a professor of criminal
law at New York Law School. ``You have innocent parties suffering
whether or not the person is found innocent or guilty. You want the
response to be proportionate to the level of the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems with forfeiture is that you can effectuate
a criminal punishment under a civil label,'' Blecker said. ``You
can obviate a necessity for many due process guarantees, like proof
beyond a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the goal is deterrence, then we can ask, `Does the
intoxicated person before he enters his car retain the ability to
clearly discern the potential punishment?''' he continued. If the
answer is no, then the whole law is undermined, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, if you know you're going to drink and you
get stopped that might stop you from driving,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts also wondered about the propriety of seizing a
leased car or one that was bought with a bank loan. ``If you allow
this procedure and don't establish an innocent-owner defense, so
that the leasing company is held strictly liable, the net effect
will be that the insurance rates will rise. The long-term effect
will be higher rates for leasing for everybody,'' Blecker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rates for everybody will go up,'' he said, ``so that, long
term, people who don't drive drunk will be subsidizing those who
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite vows to challenge the policy from the New York Civil
Liberties Union and other groups, Hess said there was legal
precedent for such forfeiture programs and that the city was
confident it would pass constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new application of a legal process that has been
tested and approved constitutionally over several decades,'' Hess
said.

LOFTY PRICES SEND LOFT PIONEERS IN SEARCH OF NEW FRONTIERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DENNIS HEVESI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jacques Roch sometimes has the sense that he is back
in the Paris of the late 1950s, once again living in a neighborhood
with slant-roofed garrets and bustling street life. But this is no
deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   Roch, ponytailed at 60, lives in a loft in Williamsburg,
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fourth-floor walkup _ ``The freight elevator, it is long
kaput,'' he says in a French-tinted lilt _ with pulleys still
bolted to the loft's century-old corrugated tin ceilings. Leaning
against the walls of the long-defunct factory stand 12-foot-high
paintings by Roch in what he describes as his ``comic-style, dark
humor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a man like me,'' he says of living in Williamsburg, ``it
has to do with Paris in the old days, a kind of nostalgic feeling
from when I was one of all the young artists in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   Roch is one of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of artists,
craftspeople, art-scene followers and those simply searching for
the open space of loft living who have migrated across the East
River to old industrial neighborhoods like Williamsburg and
Greenpoint in Brooklyn, Long Island City and Astoria in Queens, and
the South Bronx _ squeezed out of lower Manhattan by a burgeoning
luxury loft market in which the average price is closing in on
$700,000.
</P>
<P>
   It is a frustrating development for the struggling artists who,
unlike the wealthy ones who can afford grand spaces, consider
themselves the loft pioneers. They are the ones, they point out,
who, with a wink from commercial landlords, slipped into desolate
downtown Manhattan factories and warehouses two and three decades
ago, built live-in studios by dint of their own hammering, sawing,
painting, plumbing and rewiring, and, over time, spurred the
creation of vibrant, attractive neighborhoods _ too attractive for
the good of those pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more and more uptown money is muscling into Soho, Noho,
Tribeca, Chelsea and Nolita (North of Little Italy). ``Downtown is
catching up to uptown prices, and we are no longer the cheaper
alternative,'' said Helene Luchnick, a senior vice president at the
Douglas Elliman brokerage who specializes in high-end lofts.
``We're getting more Upper East Side people purchasing downtown
because they like the space of the lofts, the downtown casualness,
the trendy restaurants, the name stores like Louis Vuitton and
Prada.''
</P>
<P>
   And even in less-fashionable areas, like the Lower East Side,
space can get costly when sets of up-and-coming professionals share
_ two pals from grade-school days, a college buddy of one and the
kid brother of the other pooling their resources to rent raw lofts
for $2,000 to $3,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, said Jonathan Miller, the president of
Miller Samuel, a leading Manhattan real-estate appraisal company,
there has been ``a significant upper progression'' in the average
purchase price of lofts below 34th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Basing his calculations on the sale of 774 co-op and condominium
lofts in the three-year period, Miller said that the average price
for a downtown loft was $404,645 in 1996 and $484,290 in 1997 _ an
18 percent increase. Then, ``as supply tightened in 1998,'' he
said, ``we saw a 28 percent increase, up to $693,754.'' The highest
price paid for a loft below 34th Street last year, Miller said, was
$4.5 million for a 6,000-square-foot expanse (1.25 NBA basketball
courts) on Wooster Street with an additional 3,000 square feet of
roof terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Avra Jane likes the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jane, who said she ``was a Wall Streeter'' for 14 years, is
now living in her third downtown loft _ 2,500 square feet in a
former fan factory, the Acorn Machinery Building on Lafayette
Street in Soho.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got the classic brick walls, the big windows, the steel
beams and pillars,'' she said. ``When I got here, it was raw, dark
and empty.''
</P>
<P>
   After paying $540,000 for the space in July 1997, Ms. Jane ``put
in another couple hundred thousand dollars,'' she said. ``I put
down wide-plank, white maple floors, mahogany frames on the
windows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On whatever walls I have,'' she said, ``I used an Italian
artist technique _ sandblast and plaster, then tint beeswax with
yellow, green or pink pigment, then rub it on. You want to run your
hands across them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jane has bought and renovated three lofts, ``sold them and
moved to the next,'' she said. And now she's becoming a full-time
loft developer _ along with one friend who is an architect and
another, a Wall Street trader who, she said, ``used to live uptown
on the park, Fifth Avenue, but sold that to move downtown, like
most people, to get more space and light'' _ and profit.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling partnership is currently converting a building on
Laight Street in Tribeca into 31 units that are due to go on the
market in the spring of 2000 for $1 million and up, or between $400
and $450 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem in keeping with the current trajectory of
per-square-foot prices. In 1996, said Miller of Miller Samuel, the
average price per square foot of downtown loft space was $258. Two
years later, it was $390 _ a 51 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   But those are just averages. As Ms. Luchnick pointed out: ``Last
year, I sold a property in Soho for a record of $900 a square foot.
And so far this year I have two properties heading into contract,
one at over $900 a square foot, another at over $1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   In a less-dear district downtown, Anthony Borelli and Tom
Pfister, both 28, Brad Trent, 27, and Pfister's 26-year-old
brother, Mike, are renting.
</P>
<P>
   Borelli, an urban planner, and Tom Pfister, an architect, have
been buddies since grammar school in Cambridge, Mass. A year and a
half ago they began looking for a two-bedroom to share. ``We looked
uptown near Columbia,'' Borelli said, ``all over downtown. What we
found was small and too expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Trent, also an architect, was moving out of his
childhood home in Midwood, Brooklyn. And soon after, Mike Pfister,
currently a bartender but with ears open for a sound technician's
job, came to the big city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brad found a loft listed by Benjamin James,'' Borelli said,
referring to a downtown brokerage, ``2,200 square feet near the
Seaport'' _ the second floor of a warehouse, built in 1831, on
Front Street. It is not quite chic.
</P>
<P>
   There were ``semipermanent walls'' left up by a previous tenant,
Borelli said. ``Nothing matches; the stove clearly doesn't match
the countertops.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a fireplace that doesn't work, and a pool table left by
the previous tenant. And a safe, Borelli said, ``so heavy that it's
probably been there since the building was built; we had to cut the
rug around it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone's interested in cracking the safe, we'd oblige,''
Borelli said. ``Could be one of those disastrous `Geraldo
Rivera-Opens-Al Capone's-Safe' things.'' For now, there's a candle
on the safe.
</P>
<P>
   The young men pay $2,500 a month _ split proportionally
according to the size of their bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Between the influx of young out-of-towners, uptown transplants
and mounting competition for commercial space among law firms,
financial companies and the computer-driven ``new media'' industry,
there is little affordable room left for those loft pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original artist colony from downtown,'' said Sharon Zukin,
a professor of sociology at Brooklyn College, ``is now living in
lofts across the river and working for the `new media' operations
in their old lofts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all rather ironic,'' she said, ``that as non-artists
become active in cultural consumption, from looking at art in
museums and galleries to wanting to live `like artists,' the
consumer demand prices artists out of their lofts.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Zukin, who is author of ``Loft Living'' (Rutgers University
Press, 1989), a study of the phenomenon, wonders: ``Does somebody
who pays $2,000 to $3,000 a month live in luxury? That's the going
rent now. I'm amazed. I don't know who can pay this. This is the
real social problem of rising rents.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Schurr is a loft pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   A painter and photographer, Schurr lived in a loft in Tribeca in
the late 1970s, paying $450 a month in rent; then in another loft
in Long Island City, where he paid $800. And then, eight years ago,
he moved into a 7,000-square-foot space in an old fiber mill in
Greenpoint, Brooklyn, for which he now pays $2,100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The artists who are still downtown are either very lucky to
have a longterm lease or are very well established _ that's my word
for rich,'' said Schurr, who is 43 and describes his art as a
paradoxical blend of ``abstract and representational.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his high windows, Schurr looks out at smokestacks, the
Pulaski Bridge, the Midtown Tunnel approach and the less than
pristine Newtown Creek. A ``romantic industrial landscape,'' he
calls it.
</P>
<P>
   The bay doors, loading docks and freight elevator in Schurr's
building _ for decades portals for bales of raw fiber, then
finished fabric _ now make it possible for at least 60 painters,
sculptors, lighting designers and cabinet makers to create and
transport their often ample works. One man there carved a menagerie
of phantasmagorical carousel creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have projects I've worked on for years,'' Schurr said, ``so
storage and wall space are very important.''
</P>
<P>
   For such space, Suzy Kline, owner of Kline Realty on the
Greenpoint-Williamsburg border, would broker rental deals at $10 to
$20 a square foot a month _ would if she could.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary, I can't help them,'' she said of her loft clients.
</P>
<P>
   Checking her records, Ms. Kline said that in December and
January she had 114 loft customers, but her company managed to
place only five. ``I'm suffering what every real-estate broker is
suffering,'' she said, ``the shortage of housing stock in New
York.'' In January, Ms. Kline did manage to rent a
1,100-square-foot ground floor space in a Greenpoint loft building
for $1,550 a month, or $17 a square foot. ``That's pretty
typical,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're either Soho refugees or Soho wannabes,'' Ms. Kline
said of her clientele. ``We do get artists, sculptors, but also
computer whizzes, Wall Street brokers. Instead of a loft, we put
them in a storefront.''
</P>
<P>
   Such spaces, lofts as well as storefronts, are usually zoned for
commercial occupancy _ not residential. ``For the record, no one
lives here,'' Schurr said. And sprinkled throughout Greenpoint and
Williamsburg, large-letter signs have been bolted to buildings,
saying, ``A.I.R.'' (Artist in Residence) _ something akin to those
Tot-Finder decals affixed to home windows, directing fire fighters
to children in peril.
</P>
<P>
   The A.I.R. signs in Brooklyn are, in fact, unofficial, as
opposed to those found on some buildings in Soho and Noho where,
under a 1972 zoning change, residents must be artists certified by
the city's Department of Cultural Affairs _ who have been
classified as performing ``light manufacturing,'' and allowed to
set up living-work spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Dolgin, vice president of Kalmon Dolgin, a brokerage in
Greenpoint, has nothing but appreciation for the influx of Soho
refugees and wannabes. ``God bless them,'' Dolgin said, ``because
since the downturn in manufacturing in this area they have taken up
the surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Without them,'' he said, ``there would have been so much space
on the market that it would have sent many more owners into tax
arrears and possible foreclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dolgin said his company receives 30 to 40 inquiries for lofts a
week and places two or three. ``Now,'' he said, ``you're getting
Manhattan investors, looking to come into the area to buy property
for potential conversion. We get at least a dozen a week, but
everything has been gobbled up.''
</P>
<P>
   With a broker's inherent optimism, Dolgin envisions a shift in
his market. ``There are no condos or co-ops yet,'' he said, ``but
as rents increase and the city becomes more favorable to zoning
changes, condos and co-ops could develop in the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who rue the day. Scrawled on walls throughout
Williamsburg, and on storefronts where brokers have posted leaflets
with those tear-off phone number strips, is the message: ``Yuppies
Go Home!''
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers do tend to change the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   As Dolgin pointed out: ``They bring their boutiques,
restaurants, craftsy-type stores.'' There are now a dozen art
galleries in the neighborhood, and an underground movie house in a
mayonnaise factory, where a truck bay has been transformed into a
candle-lit reflecting pool.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hindy, president of the Brooklyn Brewery on North 11th
Street, producer of 27,000 barrels a year of Brooklyn Lager since
'89 _ 1989, that is _ has witnessed the change. ``I didn't know it
then,'' he said, ``but back when we were looking to build our
brewery, our competition was not industry, it was artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Hindy's brewery shares the old Hecla Ironworks complex with what
is now a residential building. ``It has a cast-iron facade,'' Hindy
said, ``and the lofts are dazzling. The roof has an outdoor garden
you wouldn't believe _ 6,000 to 8,000 square feet with fountains
and decks and lush shrubbery. There's a bed there; sometimes they
sleep up there in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside a storefront on Bedford Avenue _ the artist
colony's Main Street _ Kimberly Reed says some degree of tension
exists between the newcomers and long-established Hispanic,
Hasidic, Italian and Polish residents living in small apartment
buildings, row houses and aluminum-sided, chain-link-fenced private
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrant communities are very stable,'' she said. ``They've
been here for generations, own their own homes and rent to one
another. So they aren't about to gentrify overnight or leave any
time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is some friction, she said, with the industrial
sector. In a hoped-to-be published book called ``Changing Spaces,''
Dr. Reed, a sociology professor at Queens College, has documented
how artists ``reconfigure their spaces and neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Reed lives in a converted industrial garage in Greenpoint,
cater-corner to a food distributorship where cargo bays are fed by
freight pallets hoisted on forklifts, and across from an old
packaging plant where a row of spindly trees has been planted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a sign that the building has been colonized by artists
or loft-livers,'' Dr. Reed said. ``They landscape so that there
will be shade in the summer.'' And also, she said, ``because in an
industrial area, 18-wheel trucks often pull up on the sidewalk; so
the trees restrict the sidewalk from being used to deliver goods.''
</P>
<P>
   There are far more significant tradeoffs that come with living
in an industrial area. As Eric Goldstein, senior lawyer for the
Natural Resources Defense Council, said: ``Greenpoint-Williamsburg
has received more than its fair share of environmental burdens.''
It has, Goldstein said, at least two dozen garbage transfer
stations that receive ``thousands of tons of waste a day from a
stream of diesel-spewing trucks.'' There are ``the 17 million
gallons from an underground Mobil oil spill back in the '70s'' that
are still being cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the huge Newtown Creek Sewage Plant sometimes send odors
wafting into the community,'' Goldstein said. ``Let's just say that
Williamsburg-Greenpoint is no environmental paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Dr. Reed points out, many artists have set those
concerns aside. ``Many art processes involve toxic materials _
kilns, forges, resins for mold-making,'' she said. ``They need a
live-work space where they aren't too concerned about the mess.''
</P>
<P>
   So, who is stenciling those ``Yuppie Go Home!'' signs around the
neighborhood? Hindy, for one, believes ``it's being done by artists
because they view what's happening here like what happened in
Soho.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, as Roch, the French expatriate, points out: ``Some
artists get a longterm lease, renovate, subdivide and sublet. So,
some artists are also entrepreneurs, and they are making money off
the backs of other artists.''

TEEN-AGE GIRL AND BUILDING OWNER KILLED AT DRUG HOUSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 14-year-old girl was one of two people killed by
gunfire on Friday night at a dilapidated brownstone in Brooklyn
known as a haven for crack cocaine users, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors had been complaining for months about drug users,
including teen-agers, frequenting the house in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Everyone inside fled after the shootings, the police said, and they
have no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The other victim, and the apparent target of the gunman, was
Harry Carter, the owner of the brownstone. Carter, 49, was found
lying inside the front door of his apartment with a fatal gunshot
wound to the head, according to police. The girl, Marion Pittman,
had managed to run a few feet before being shot in the back, they
said, adding that she died shortly after arriving at Kings County
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers recovered a .40-caliber Smith &AMP; Wesson handgun
outside Carter's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager was from the Bronx, the police said, and it
remained unclear Saturday afternoon what had brought her to
Carter's apartment in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said Carter's mother had been a longtime neighbor, and
her son's trouble started after her death 18 months ago. In
despair, he turned to crack cocaine, according to his friend Joseph
Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised by this, but I'm saddened,'' Clarke said
Saturday, shaking his head in the quiet shadow of the two-story
brick building.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of that culture of drugs,'' he added. ``His
mother's death sent him over the edge, but it was his decision to
continue to do this. I wanted him to change his ways, but this is
the end result.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke and other residents said they had made several calls to
police to complain about the activity in Carter's home and that the
police were a frequent presence on the street outside, although the
house remained open. Neighbors said school-age children could be
seen coming up his stairs most hours of the day, while the night
brought a caravan of other users to his door. At other times Carter
would try to get neighbors to move in and pay some rent. When he
saw Clarke walk by on Friday afternoon, he quickly asked for
repayment of a $5 loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to get me to move in, but I didn't want to be
involved,'' Clarke said. ``There were people coming in and out all
the time, young people who should have been in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I told him, `You can throw your life away, but not our
children's lives,' and I tried to convince him to go straight,'' he
said. ``This was the last time I saw him.''

 SUPPLY AND DEMAND MAKE NEW YORK PARKING BIG BUSINESS  (jw) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This city is not a particularly friendly city for
motorists. There are fleets of aggressively driven cabs to contend
with, and lumbering buses and bulky delivery trucks further crowd
the streets. Nevertheless, parking is a big business here, and one
that has seen a national company buy up two of the most familiar
local names in the field in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers report that multilevel underground parking lots in
commercial buildings can produce as much as $1 million in annual
lease payments for property owners, who typically lease the space
to specialized parking companies.
</P>
<P>
   Parking spaces inside residential buildings can command from
$250 to $500 a month, in addition to the apartment rental, and
waiting lists for spaces are common. In at least one case the
monthly rental was set at $1,000 by an operator who wanted to
reduce the number of residents parking in the building to open up
space for more lucrative transient traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Although a spokesman for the City Planning Commission denies
that there is a moratorium against building new parking garages,
brokers and developers say that, as a practical matter, few
free-standing parking garages have been built in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Anne DeMarzo, the president of DeMarzo Realty Co., a brokerage
concern specializing in parking garages and lots, said that until
the planning commission granted permission to expand two garage
buildings on Greenwich Street between Spring and Canal streets from
60 to 188 cars last year, it had not issued such a permit for 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, so ingrained is the notion among people in real estate
that a moratorium is in effect that it has been used as a sales
point. Recently, the Carlton Group was hired to sell four
development sites near the Javits Center. One, between 37th and
38th streets and 10th and 11th avenues, was advertised as being
approved for construction of a five-level, 485-space garage. ``This
is particularly attractive,'' an announcement said, ``since there
is currently a moratorium on garage construction and this site is
grandfathered.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Miller, a senior vice president of the Carlton Group, said
that even if there is nothing written down, a moratorium is in
effect. ``If you take a piece of land and try to get it approved as
a garage, you can't,'' he said. ``All you can get is a certain
number of spaces in apartment buildings.'' He said that in some
parts of the city, parking garages would be more valuable to an
owner than residential property, if they could be built.
</P>
<P>
   This lack of new supply and the influx of visitors to New York
has attracted the attention of a Nashville-based company, Central
Parking Corp., which argues that sophisticated management and
economies of scale can improve the financial performance of smaller
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Central, a publicly traded company that manages more
than a million parking spaces, acquired the New York-based Kinney
Parking for $206 million in cash, stock and the assumption of debt.
Kinney operated 171,500 spaces, 76,600 of them in the New York
metropolitan area, and was the area's largest parking operator.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Central acquired Square Industries of Jersey City,
which operated 117 parking facilities containing 61,000 spaces. Of
those garages, 49 were in New York and 17 in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Central has had a huge impact on parking in New York over the
last two years,'' Ms. DeMarzo said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these acquisitions, people parking at such noted
New York locations as Yankee Stadium, Shea Stadium, Rockefeller
Center and the Waldorf-Astoria are sending a portion of their
parking fees to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Most parking-lot operators do not own the real estate involved.
Typically they run the parking operation for the building's owner
and receive a management fee for the effort. In other cases, the
operator leases the space, the way a retail or office tenant would,
guaranteeing the owner an annual rent and sometimes a percentage of
gross revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most building owners with significant parking capacity don't
want to operate it by themselves,'' said Jeffrey Baker, a senior
director of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, a real estate brokerage and
services company. ``It's a pretty specialized business.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker noted that an underground garage does not count against a
building's allowable size under city zoning rules, giving
developers of new properties the opportunity to increase revenues
by digging a deeper hole in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that in New York, the need to provide ground-level
access for cars means giving up space that could be used for
stores, an important consideration in high traffic areas. ``You
don't want to give up valuable retail space for parking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 126,884 parking spaces in indoor garages in Manhattan
and an additional 35,000 in outdoor lots, said Joel Stahl, the
executive director of Metropolitan Parking Association, citing
figures collected by the city's Department of Consumer Affairs. The
other boroughs have a total of 193,889 indoor spaces and 111,218 in
lots.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl said that the operating part of the parking business
generally mirrors the overall state of the regional economy. ``When
times are good,'' he said, ``people are more likely to drive in to
go to a restaurant or to the theater.'' But he said good times
could also squeeze parking operators, because landlords demanded
sharply higher rentals when leases expired than when the economy
was less robust.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He said the parking business in the city was quite competitive
and highly dependent on location. ``If there is a garage in the
middle of the theater district, all you have to do is go two blocks
west and you will pay two-thirds or one half as much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. DeMarzo, ground-level parking lots can last a
long time because they provide a good income for the property
owners, with returns on investment of 5 percent to 7 percent a
year. But ultimately, most are building sites in waiting.
</P>
<P>
   That explains why a 200-space parking lot has occupied the
western half of the block bounded by 49th and 50th Streets and
Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas for most of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuous in a district of high-rise buildings, the lot has
been a holding action for the Rockefeller Group, which owns the
land and cleared away the old buildings in the late 1980s. Now that
Rockefeller Group has an agreement with the investment banking
company Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to build a 1 million-square-foot
office building on the site, the lot's days are numbered.
</P>
<P>
   A Rockefeller Group spokesman said the company hopes to begin
excavation for the new building in the fall, after the city reviews
modifications requested by Morgan Stanley to the previously fully
approved building design.
</P>
<P>
   Because there will be no commercial parking in the new building,
the loss of the ground-level lot will increase a shortage of
parking in a neighborhood that was already losing half the garage
space at Rockefeller Center to a new Christie's auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the invasion of corporate parking management represented
by Central, some independent garage operators remain on the scene
who are able to take their own noncorporate approach to running the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Semone Grossman, the founder of GGMC Parking, which operates 27
garages in Manhattan and Brooklyn, believes that brightening the
often-dank spaces with paint and art posters is good for business.
He personally selects the posters from the Metropolitan Museum of
Art and Museum of Modern Art that are illuminated in light boxes on
the walls of his garages.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said the poster displays and bright paint make drivers
happy and make it easier for him to renew his leases, particularly
in residential buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Grossman won permission from Republic National
Bank to operate a parking lot on land it owns on 40th Street facing
the side of the New York Public Library. In an attempt to make the
lot blend in with the look of the area, Grossman built a
stone-looking wall along 40th Street that is topped with metal
grille work, which will eventually be ivy-covered when his
plantings have grown.
</P>
<P>
   A wrought iron gate in the wall allows admission by pedestrians,
but all cars will enter and leave by 39th Street. In addition,
Grossman said he plans to commission a local artist to paint a
mural on the brick wall behind the attendant's kiosk, which itself
will be adorned with his trademark posters.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York needs this kind of appearance,'' Grossman said,
adding that the costs do not affect parking rates. ``We have never
charged a premium because of decorating.''

STAMFORD LOOKING TO REVITALIZE SOUTH END 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   ELEANOR CHARLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ After decades of polishing its corporate
image, Stamford is turning its attention to the South End and
Waterside, south of Interstate 95.
</P>
<P>
   There, in the shadow of Swiss Bank, Champion International and
other offices on the north side of the highway, neglected
factories, utility plants, and rusting oil tanks _ vestiges of the
city's industrial heyday _ mingle with rundown businesses and the
deteriorated housing of the city's poor.
</P>
<P>
   But beginning this year and extending over the next five to 10
years, Stamford will work on an ambitious plan to bring a variety
of housing, business and recreational improvements into the area _
a peninsula and an area to the west comprising a total of a scant
three square miles, joined by a small bridge over a canal.
</P>
<P>
   Early next month, after completing a $200,000 study, Sasaki
Associates, of Watertown, Mass., expects to present to the city its
preliminary plans for a linear park designed to link downtown and
the South End while increasing public access to the water.
</P>
<P>
   The park would run along the Mill River from Broad Street to the
harbor, where it would continue to wind around the perimeters of
both neighborhoods. Existing and new development, as well as
Kosciusko Park in the South End and Southfield Park in Waterside,
would be incorporated into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aim is to help the city establish a civic landscape,
taking into consideration the aspirations of existing residents,''
said Alistair McIntosh, a principal in the Sasaki firm.
</P>
<P>
   More imminent is the construction, to begin this year, of a road
designed to alleviate a longstanding South End traffic problem.
</P>
<P>
   An $18 million grant from the Federal Highway Administration
will pay for a 90-foot-wide east-west road parallel to the south
side of I-95. It will connect the Stamford train station to Elm
Street and eliminate a labyrinth of narrow, one-way streets that
confound truck drivers and other motorists coming off Exit 8 of
I-95 into the South End.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with it, the state will build a 1,200-space, $16
million parking garage behind the existing 762-space garage at the
station, where the waiting list has reached 800.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals for new apartments are also being welcomed by the
city, where apartment vacancy rates are in the single digits and
demand is expected to grow as the increase in office rents, now up
to $35 a square foot a year for prime space, generates new office
construction.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-acre parcel on the eastern shore of Waterside that is owned
by the Hoffman Fuel Co. and Northeast Utilities has been optioned
by Clearview Investment Management of Stamford for the construction
of 327 luxury rental apartments in two four-story buildings.
</P>
<P>
   A boardwalk, marina and fishing pier are included in
applications submitted to Stamford's Planning and Zoning Boards,
the Army Corps of Engineers and the state's Department of
Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   When plans are approved and the fuel company has removed
contamination from the site, Avalon Bay Communities of Alexandria,
Va., is to exercise its option with Clearview to build and manage
the complex, and to buy the property outright. Apartments are to be
ready for occupancy in October of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A second Northeast Utilities property, 20 acres on the western
shore of the South End, has been under option by the Collins
Development Co. of Greenwich for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago a Collins plan for developing housing, retail
space, and a marina on the site was rejected. A new plan for
market-rate condominiums to be submitted by the company in the
spring will, according to Arthur Collins Sr., president of Collins,
be compatible with an existing marina and a proposed terminal for
ferry service to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Work is to begin this summer on a five-year project to build 315
rental apartments and 15 for-sale town houses at Southfield
Village, a public housing complex in Waterside that had been
overwhelmed by drugs and crime. Four high-rise buildings were
demolished in an effort to clean it up two years ago, leaving 34
bungalows still to be razed. The developer, Beacon-Corcoran
Jennison Partners of Boston, will eventually own and manage the
property. To date, it has received a $26.4 million grant from the
Federal Housing and Urban Development Agency and a $3 million
commitment from the city of Stamford. It is seeking state
assistance through the Connecticut Housing and Finance
Administration for financing the estimated remaining $50.6 million
cost of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the units will be available to tenants who live there
now, one quarter of the remaining units will be rented at market
rates, and tenants occupying the other 25 percent will be required
to have incomes that do not exceed 60 percent of the area median of
$94,300, or around $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that south Stamford has been
perceived as a viable site for development. The offices of the
280,000-square-foot Metro Center and First Stamford Place, a
three-building, 780,000-square-foot complex on the south side of
the highway, and the offices at Soundview Farms _ 750,000 square
feet in 13 buildings _ overlooking Waterside's harbor were built
during Stamford's boom of the 70s and 80s.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, undaunted by down-at-the-heel
surroundings, other developers have ventured into the area,
successfully building a handful of waterfront condominium
complexes, modest offices and high-tech industrial buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Dannel Malloy, Stamford's mayor, believes that the district is
benefiting from a tight downtown market. ``The value of property in
Stamford,'' he said, ``is what's driving this renaissance. People
want to invest here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While much of the area's older housing is in poor repair, there
are still pockets of well-maintained early 20th-century homes that
were built for the families of workers in nearby factories.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the damage to housing resulted from the loss of industry
and a change in zoning. In an effort to draw manufacturing back to
the city, the South End and Waterside were rezoned in the '60s from
industrial and residential to industrial alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the zone change, housing could no longer protect itself
from small industries creeping in, reducing property values and the
residential character of the neighborhood,'' explained Rick
Redniss, partner at Redniss &AMP; Mead, a Stamford consulting firm that
has drawn up many of the plans and zoning applications for new
development in the area.
</P>
<P>
   People who live south of I-95 for the most part welcome the
prospect of change, with certain caveats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be sure it's not going to disturb people who are
already here,'' said Bob Owens, chairman of the South End
Neighborhood Revitalization Committee, and a member of the Stamford
Board of Representatives. ``We welcome water-related uses, and we
look for rehabilitating existing housing stock to bring it up to
code, not to gentrify the place.''
</P>
<P>
   David Anderson, president of the Stamford Partnership, whose
recommendations underlie much of the planning, values industry.
``There should be no big box stores, office buildings or shopping
centers in the South End,'' he said. ``Whatever comes out of all
this must be community based.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideas, some under consideration for years, have grown numerous
and quite grand. ``Much of it is a vision,'' said Malloy, ``but
we're confident that a lot of the housing, parks and recreational
space will come to fruition.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to hundreds of housing units, suggestions have
included a waterfront hotel and conference center, hockey arena,
entertainment district with nightclubs and restaurants, research
and development businesses, artists' lofts, an amphitheater,
expanded city marina facilities, food markets, dry cleaners,
drugstores, discount clothing stores and banks.
</P>
<P>
   Notable for its absence in the city's overview of the district
is the disposition of the former Yale &AMP; Towne Lock Co.'s property
and buildings. Covering 22 acres on Canal Street in the South End,
its original million square feet has been reduced by demolition to
about 580,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buildings are functionally obsolete,'' said Kathy Rorick,
director of development for Heyman Properties of Westport, owners
since the factory closed in the '40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to redevelop it ourselves as a mixed-use facility
for retail, office, some light assembly,'' said Ms. Rorick.
</P>
<P>
   At present, about 100 spaces in the complex are rented for $6 a
square foot a year and up to artists, antiques dealers, wholesale
furniture dealers, a motorcycle dealer, truck and car rental
companies, a vertical climbing gym, and others.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Kahn, head of the Historic Neighborhood Preservation
Program, is concerned about stifling such evidence of ``a natural
renaissance taking place outside of the major developments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 300 antique dealers in old warehouse buildings with
waiting lists, and I like the diversity of scrap metal dealers and
barges on the canal,'' she said. ``With all sorts of planning and
natural regenerative forces going on it's difficult to say which
way things will go, especially if the economic bubble bursts.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Colonial farmers were bedeviled by and indebted to stones. When
they plowed, dug wells or excavated for foundations, they struggled
with stones. But as the farmers denuded the Northeast's forests,
lumber became too valuable to be used in fences, and stone,
ubiquitous and cheap, took its place.
</P>
<P>
   In rural New York, stone walls still snake along hillsides and
country lanes and divide densely wooded tracts that once were open
fields. But increasingly, these artifacts of early America are
threatened by development.
</P>
<P>
   Some are being dismantled and rebuilt in wealthy suburbs,
particularly in Westchester County, where they have become a
popular landscaping accessory. Perhaps a bigger threat to stone
walls may be the widening of roads originally built for
horse-and-carriage traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Older roads edged by stone fences are usually narrow. When a
town decides to improve these roads, it will typically widen them
to accommodate two lanes of traffic, to remove overhanging trees
that keep sunshine from melting ice and to install drainage
ditches.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, where the tourist value of the rustic life is
well understood, stone walls are frequently protected by local
ordinances. But there is little, if anything, in New York's local
laws to prevent highway departments from bulldozing walls to make
country roads wider and straighter _ and safer.
</P>
<P>
   About 170 cities, towns and villages in New York have enacted
historic preservation laws, but few, if any, specifically protect
stone walls, said Lucy Breyer, an analyst for the state Office of
Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   If an old stone wall is associated with a historic building or
site, state money may be available to protect it, said Maureen
McCarthy, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Transportation.
But because the vast majority of stone walls are privately owned
and not associated with a registered historical site, state
agencies have no authority to prevent local highway departments
from destroying them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our roads are changing, and our walls are disappearing,'' said
Gilbert Vincent, president of the New York State Historical
Association in Cooperstown. Indifferent highway superintendents are
``destroying the traditional esthetic of the countryside,'' he
said. ``But it's hard to argue that esthetics or history should
take precedence over safety.''
</P>
<P>
   But George Bean, who owns and old farm in the Dutchess County
town of Clinton, said such safety concerns are not the real issue.
Bean, a Manhattan real estate manager, is a trustee of the
Preservation League of New York State, a private group advocating
the protection of scenic and historic roads.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Bean and some neighbors on an old road petitioned the
town board to preserve their stone walls, which include a stone
wall Bean has been restoring for a decade. He was ordered to remove
700 feet of the wall because the town contended that it encroached
on its property. He refused, facing down the board in an expensive
legal battle until the town dropped its suit.
</P>
<P>
   Bean said that highway departments, motivated by fear of
liability, widen roads far more than necessary. ``Too often safety
is used as an excuse,'' he said. ``Simply because someone says this
is a safety issue doesn't make it so.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wyant, Clinton's highway superintendent, finds little
charm in unimproved roads. ``Country dirt roads are a nightmare,''
he said. In the winter, they require at least four times as much
salting and sanding as a paved road, he said. And, he said,
residents overwhelmingly prefer paved roads because they want safe
routes to their homes during icy winters and muddy springs.
</P>
<P>
   Wyant said that the conflict in Clinton is being driven by
politically active, wealthy newcomers, not the longtime residents.
And he insisted that the main problem with stone walls was poor
maintenance. When, for example, the walls collapse down a bank into
a road, his department unceremoniously pushes them out of the way.
``My crew is not paid to make someone's property look pretty,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Hyde Park, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was a great
admirer of the old stone walls that lined Route 9 in front of his
home, said Winthrop Aldrich, the state's deputy commissioner for
historic preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Ghee, a former Dutchess County historian, was among those
living in the region in the 1970s who became concerned with the
destruction of the walls. She founded a group to raise awareness of
the beauty and value of stone walls, with some success: businesses
along Route 9 are not only restoring walls, they are also building
new ones. ``Our walls are now being protected by a community
mind-set, not laws,'' Mrs. Ghee said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Department of Transportation is frequently required by
law to relocate a stone wall in the path of a highway, local
transportation officials generally are unwilling to spend the money
to do so, said Aldrich. ``A town road superintendent with a
hard-pressed budget will laugh at you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Building new stone retaining walls costs about $25 per square
foot upstate and about $35 to $40 downstate, said Kevin Riley, a
stone mason based in Ithaca. A freestanding wall is twice as
expensive, and it costs at least as much to move an existing wall,
he said. He also said that it was not uncommon for wealthy
Westchester homeowners to spend $500,000 on stone fences.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Devonshire, a Manhattan architect who specializes in
historic preservation projects, worries that the growing popularity
of stone as a building and landscaping material could eventually
lead to the ``cannibalization of our heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Devonshire said that he sees no near-term prospect that old
stone boundaries will disappear as long as it is more economical to
purchase new quarried stone. In the Hudson Valley, he said, six
bluestone quarries, including two that have reopened, are ``going
great guns.'' But he is concerned that if demand continues to rise,
more salvaged stone may appear on the market.
</P>
<P>
   According to an 1871 survey by the federal Department of
Agriculture, New York once had about 95,000 miles of stone fences,
said Susan Allport, the Westchester County author of ``Sermons in
Stone: The Stone Walls of New England and New York'' (W.W. Norton &AMP;
Co., 1994). She said no one knows how many miles of these walls
remain.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allport noted that unlike today's preservationists, many
19th-century farmers were not so fond of stone walls and, in fact,
came to despise them. As mechanized farm machinery made it
necessary to increase the size of farm fields, the stone walls had
to be removed, she said. Often the walls were sold to be crushed
for road work.

 PAUL SCHMIDT,   TRANSLATOR, POET AND ACTOR , DIES AT 65  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul Schmidt, a librettist, translator, poet, teacher
and actor who collaborated with many major avant-garde theater
artists, died at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center on Friday. He
was 65.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was complications of AIDS, said his brother
Jim.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt was known best for translating the complete works of
Rimbaud and the plays of Chekhov. He also devoted many years to
translating the complete works of Velemir Khlebnikov, a
little-known Russian poet who died of malnutrition in 1922 at the
age of 37. A production of Khlebnikov's play ``Zangezi,'' first
seen in Los Angeles in 1986 and directed by Peter Sellars (it was
later staged at the Brooklyn Academy of Music) was one of Schmidt's
several notable collaborations with leading experimental directors.
</P>
<P>
   Another was his libretto for ``Alice,'' an adaptation of Lewis
Carroll's ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ``Through the
Looking Glass,'' which was a high point of the Brooklyn Academy of
Music's Next Wave Festival in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A collaboration with the director Robert Wilson and the composer
Tom Waits, ``Alice'' was praised by The New York Times for
elucidating ``an international theatrical style in which
Minimalism, German Expressionism, Japanese kabuki and American pop
bump up against one another in a grand, eye-catching pageant.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt's libretto was described as capturing ``a strain of
late-19th-century romantic lyricism and drawing it out with a
graceful literary refinement.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Wooster Group's 1990 theater piece, ``Brace Up!,''
Schmidt supplied a translation of Chekhov's ``Three Sisters'' that
incorporated dance sequences and video, and he also appeared in the
production. It was one of many small roles he played on the stage.
For JoAnne Akalaitis' 1989 production at the Guthrie Theater in
Minneapolis of Jean Genet's five-and-a-half-hour, 100-character
play ``The Screens,'' he created the text out of three versions the
playwright had left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Other playwrights whose works he translated for theater
productions include Gogol, Brecht and Marivaux. ``Black Sea
Follies,'' his original play about Stalin and Shostakovich (with
music by the composer) was presented by Playwrights Horizons and
the Music Theater Group in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt was born in Brooklyn and attended Colgate and Harvard,
where he wrote his dissertation for his doctorate in Slavic
languages on the influential Russian director Vsevolod Meyerhold.
While at Harvard, he became involved with a now-legendary circle of
friends who produced plays at the Agassiz Theater in Cambridge in
the summers.
</P>
<P>
   The group included the actors Lindsay Crouse, Tommy Lee Jones,
John Lithgow, Kathryn Walker, Stockard Channing (to whom Schmidt
was married for seven years) and the director and writer Tim Mayer,
whose collected poems and plays he edited under the title ``Running
From America.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1958 to 1960, he served in the U.S. Army as a member of
Army intelligence. From 1967 to 1976, he taught Slavic languages at
the University of Texas in Austin. He published two volumes of
poetry, ``Night Life'' and ``Winter Solstice'' (both 1996, Painted
Leaf Press).
</P>
<P>
   A collection of Rimbaud translations with photographs by Robert
Mapplethorpe, titled ``A Season in Hell,'' was in published in 1997
(Little, Brown).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his brother Jim, he is survived by three sisters,
Mary Kay Murray, Margaret Sand and Anne Schmidt; another brother,
Thomas, and his friend, Mark Bennett.  &QL;

DR. JAN HAWKINS, AN EXPERT   ON USING COMPUTERS IN SCHOOLS , DIES
AT 47 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., Va. Ohio, Calif., Mich. )   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Jan Hawkins, a pioneer in the use of computers
and other technology in education, died Feb. 9 at New York
Presbyterian Hospital. She was 47 and lived in Cambridge, Mass.,
and in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was breast cancer, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the education faculty at Harvard University in
September, Hawkins established her reputation through her work as
director of the Center for Children and Technology, an agency
founded in 1981 by the Bank Street College of Education in New
York. Hawkins joined the group that year, long before computers had
become an integral part of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``She worked to find the mutual fit needed so technology could
work in an educational setting,'' said Dr. Howard Gardner, a
colleague of Dr. Hawkins' at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins was often called upon for help and advice by school
districts, museums and other educational institutions looking for
ways to integrate computers into their programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the one person that everyone went to,'' Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   In her first studies during the early 1980s, she showed that
children, especially girls, used computers in sociable and
collaborative ways, not in isolation as critics had feared, said
Dr. Margaret Honey, a longtime colleague of Hawkins' at the center.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Center for Children and Technology became a
division of the Education Development Center, based in Newton,
Mass. Dr. Hawkins became a vice president of that association,
which, like the Center for Children and Technology, is a nonprofit
research and development group financed by grants and contracts
with foundations and government institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Hawkins was born in New Canaan, Conn., and received her
bachelor's degree in psychology and English from Tufts University
in 1973. She received a master's degree in psychology and a
doctorate in developmental psychology from the Graduate Center of
the City University of New York in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   She belonged to numerous boards and advisory groups in her
field. She was an editor of professional journals and at Cambridge
University Press, dealing with its ``Learning by Doing'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hawkins is survived by her parents, John and Francette
Hawkins of Mountain View, Calif.; two sisters, Kim Hawkins of
Cleveland and Cynthia Rahilly of Manhattan; a brother, John Hawkins
of Virginia Beach, Va., and her fiance, Rand Spiro of East Lansing,
Mich.

IN NEW YORK POLITICAL THEATER, UNDERSTUDIES WAIT IN THE WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Fla.)  (See also MRSCLINTON-NEWYORK and SENATE-DEMOCRATS) 
(jw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ For several weeks now, Hillary Rodham Clinton
and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani have been starring in a shadow
play titled ``Senate 2000,'' garnering top billing in a race they
have yet to join officially.
</P>
<P>
   But while Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton coyly deflect questions
about their intentions, their would-be understudies _ Rep. Nita
Lowey and Rep. Rick Lazio _ are quietly campaigning in the wings,
positioning themselves to step into the bright lights should the
headliners fall from grace or off the political stage.
</P>
<P>
   And for that reason, both Ms. Lowey, a Democrat from
Westchester, and Lazio, a Republican from Suffolk County, were
crisscrossing upstate New York this month, meeting potential
contributors, road-testing their messages, gauging the support of
local kingmakers and trying to broaden their paper-thin name
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   With an ice-clogged Niagara River as a backdrop outside, Ms.
Lowey told a lunch crowd of Democrats at a Buffalo restaurant on
Friday that she could win a statewide campaign because her
district, which snakes from suburban Westchester into the Bronx and
Queens, is as diverse as the Empire State itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of hard work to win my first race,'' she told
the group. ``Sounds a little like the Senate race. No one thought I
had a prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Being second fiddle in the race to replace Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, who plans to retire at the end of next year, carries its
own special burdens.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowey and Lazio must constantly parry the skepticism of
local politicians and reporters who view them as dark horses. Each
will have trouble winning endorsements or expanding fund-raising
lists while Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani cast their long shadows over
the race.
</P>
<P>
   And both must endure a seemingly endless stream of news reports
that focus on the mayor, a Republican, and the first lady, a
Democrat, while mentioning Ms. Lowey and Lazio in buried paragraphs
that inevitably begin, ``The other potential candidates are . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. Lowey and Lazio, as well as many political analysts,
contend that being the unnoticed understudies has potential
benefits at this early stage. The mere possibility of Giuliani's
and Mrs. Clinton's entering the race has discouraged others from
joining the fray, increasing the likelihood that Lazio and Ms.
Lowey will emerge as the presumptive front-runners if the
headliners choose not to run.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the intense media focus on Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani
has allowed Ms. Lowey and Lazio to work on their own campaigns in
relative peace, suffering fewer distractions from intrusive camera
crews and badgering reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stressless,'' Lazio said in Syracuse on Wednesday. ``I
think it makes it comfortable for me to move around, to ask
questions, for people to be honest with me.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be an added benefit for Ms. Lowey, her supporters say.
She has praised Mrs. Clinton as the party's strongest candidate and
said she would drop out if the first lady decided to get in. By
displaying such loyalty, Ms. Lowey could grab the support of Mrs.
Clinton's fans should the first lady skip the race. And polls
indicate that those fans are legion in New York State.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowey, who has spoken with the first lady several times in
recent weeks, said Mrs. Clinton has promised to back Ms. Lowey if
she does not run herself. Mrs. Clinton has said she is ``carefully
considering'' the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be second to Hillary Clinton is an honor,'' Ms. Lowey said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, on the other hand, has said he is prepared to challenge
Giuliani in a primary.
</P>
<P>
   Though he would be considered the underdog, Lazio has support
among the conservatives who usually dominate Republican primaries.
Though each is widely considered a moderate, Lazio runs with the
backing of the Conservative Party in his district and voted for
impeachment _ which is likely to endear him to primary voters _
while Giuliani loudly opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he had heard Republicans in northern New York express
concerns about having two senators from New York City. (Sen.
Charles Schumer, a Democrat, is from Brooklyn). Like many
Democrats, he also raised questions about whether Giuliani's
iron-fisted governing style would work in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people like about him as a mayor may not be what they
want in a senator,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Lazio and Ms. Lowey say they have not decided
whether to enter the race. Ms. Lowey says she expects the Democrats
to retake the House in 2000, which would give her a senior position
on the powerful Appropriations Committee. Lazio holds a leadership
position now, assistant majority leader. And both say they are not
thrilled about having to raise $15 million or more for the Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews, the two representatives said they were
leaning strongly toward running. And both sounded very much like
candidates on their recent upstate tours. (Both declined to talk
about what it would be like to run against each other).
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, a boyish-looking 40, seemed in full-scale campaign mode
last week, when Congress was in recess, as he drove his wife,
Patricia, and their two daughters, Molly Ann, 6 and Kelsey, 5, from
Buffalo across the state to Long Island. Between speeches, a
hearing on housing issues and meetings with local Republicans,
Lazio sandwiched in family visits to Niagara Falls and other
upstate attractions.
</P>
<P>
   At each of his stops, Lazio delivered a message that illustrated
his efforts to balance between the party's dominant conservative
wing and its Northeastern moderates. He emphasized what he
considered traditional Republican values _ hard work, personal
responsibility and strong families _ but also endorsed an array of
traditionally Democratic policies, like health insurance for the
poor, federal spending on public education and the arts, and strong
environmental regulations. He also supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Americans don't clearly know what the Republican
Party stands for,'' he said in an interview in the lobby of the
Hotel Syracuse. ``I'm saying government is not the enemy. We can
talk about the end of big government, but we should also talk of
the beginning of the era of good government. Which means some of
these programs that we are getting value from, we should be
supporting.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, in his fourth term, is a lawyer and former county
prosecutor who, at 34, defeated Rep. Thomas Downey in 1992. Lazio's
youthful enthusiasm impressed John Long, the Republican chairman of
Niagara County. ``People up here would support a down-home person
like Rick,'' he said. Asked about Giuliani, Long replied, ``I think
he's perceived as being a little liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   But echoing a concern raised by other Republicans, Long
suggested that Lazio might not be strong enough to defeat Mrs.
Clinton. And several Republican officials said they wanted to avoid
a primary at all costs, which many think will involve encouraging
Lazio to drop out.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lazio, Ms. Lowey has tried to position herself as a
centrist within her party, advocating gay rights, abortion rights
and strong environmental policies on the liberal side, while siding
with Republicans on some welfare and trade policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people look at my record, they say, `She's a moderate
Democrat,' '' said Ms. Lowey, a former assistant secretary of state
under Gov. Mario Cuomo. Ms. Lowey is now in her sixth term. ``I
consider myself an independent progressive.''
</P>
<P>
   But in her speech in Buffalo, Ms. Lowey, 61, did not sound
particularly independent, outlining essentially the House
Democratic agenda: expanding federal aid for school construction
and after-school programs, making tuition tax-deductible and
increasing consumer protections in managed care policies.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the year, Ms. Lowey has traveled upstate
five times, as well as to California to meet with potential donors
and to Miami to address the national convention of the AFL-CIO,
where she was introduced as ``one of the two great women'' thinking
of running for the Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Many state Democratic leaders say Ms. Lowey is widely perceived
as the party's next best candidate after Mrs. Clinton. Steve
Pigeon, the Erie County Democratic chairman and a supporter of Ms.
Lowey, said many Democrats thought she could exploit the
Republicans' gender gap problems and negate their traditional
strength in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   He also contended that Ms. Lowey, a grandmother with a toothy
smile and easygoing manner, would provide a pleasant contrast to
the combative Giuliani. ``He's mean, he's scorched earth,'' Pigeon
said. ``In the Senate, you want somebody who will build bridges,
not burn them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Democrats privately fret that a Lowey-Giuliani race
could be a repeat of Gov. George Pataki's decisive victory over
City Council President Peter Vallone last year. But such concerns
were not evident among the party loyalists who gathered in Buffalo
to meet Ms. Lowey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giuliani has name recognition, no question,'' said Camille
Brandon, vice chairwoman of the Erie County Democratic Committee.
``So did Sen. D'Amato. And it didn't help him.''

GRETZKY RETURNS TO SCENE OF PAST GLORY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty years ago, before he joined the NHL, Wayne
Gretzky of the Rangers played with the Edmonton Oilers in the last
season of the World Hockey Association.
</P>
<P>
   His 43 goals with Edmonton that season, plus three with
Indianapolis early in that 1978-79 schedule, were the first 46 of a
total that has reached 1,071 in a 21-year professional career.
</P>
<P>
   The best of those years were with Edmonton, where he played on
teams that won the Stanley Cup four times from 1984 to 1988.
Gretzky's goal total includes the WHA and the NHL regular-season
games and playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   His figure equals that of Gordie Howe, who also played in both
leagues, from 1946 to 1980. Gretzky has eight goals this season,
none in his last six games and only one in his last 16.
</P>
<P>
   But a coincidence of scheduling could create a significant
moment in an appropriate place. Gretzky and the Rangers play at
Edmonton Sunday night in the first game of a two-game road trip to
Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Oilers' arena stands a statue of Gretzky, frozen in
time, holding the cup over his head. And he has done important
things there as a visitor. On Oct. 15, 1989, Gretzky set the NHL's
regular-season career point record of 1,850, breaking a Howe
record, while playing for the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   A record-setting goal against the Oilers Sunday night would be a
highlight of what could be the final Edmonton appearance of his
career. Although Gretzky may return for another season next fall,
the unbalanced schedule for interconference games gives no
guarantee that the Rangers will visit all Western cities like
Edmonton.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  As for the Rangers, they would be satisfied with merely
another victory. By beating Pittsburgh, 6-1, on Friday night in
Madison Square Garden, they moved, at least temporarily, into 11th
place in the Eastern Conference, four points behind the Florida
Panthers, who hold the eighth and final playoff spot. Also
contending for that berth are Montreal, Washington and Boston. The
Panthers, Canadiens and Capitals played Saturday night. The Bruins
play Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting the Oilers, the Rangers move south in Alberta to
play at Calgary Monday night, ending a stretch of seven games in 11
nights. Both Western foes, the Oilers and the Flames, have records
comparable to the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Two or more points on the trip could leave the Rangers within
range of post-season play when they return home to begin their
final 24 games on Friday night against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in there,'' said John MacLean, who sparkled Friday
with three assists. ``It's a strange game, and that's how you have
to look at it. You never know. The opportunity is still there and
we will try to make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have won only five of their last 15 games, but they
have maintained a professional approach even in their worst skids.
</P>
<P>
   Ulf Samuelsson, who scored one of Friday's goals, said that
``there are an incredible amount of points'' still to be gained in
the standings and that ``it's too early to start panicking'' about
the possibility of missing the playoffs for the second consecutive
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to focus in and have a good trip,'' Samuelsson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Stevens scored twice for the Rangers against the Penguins,
who lost for the second straight time after a 10-game winning
streak. The other Ranger goals were scored by Richard Brennan, Petr
Nedved and Adam Graves.
</P>
<P>
   Playing well in goal was rookie Dan Cloutier, who lost his
shutout at 14 minutes 26 seconds of the third period, when Kevin
Hatcher scored for Pittsburgh. Cloutier played in all four games
last week, two of them starts and both starts victories.
</P>
<P>
   There is a possibility that he will start at least one of the
games in Alberta. Mike Richter, the first-string goalie, has been
pulled from his last two starts after giving up three early goals
each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing the puck pretty well, and I got lucky on a few,''
Cloutier said. ``I'm just thrilled to get a chance to play and gain
some experience. I have to take this opportunity to play well
because Mike is going to bounce back and play well for us.''
</P>
<P>
   As for playoff possibilities, Cloutier said: ``We're very
confident. We have a real close team here. There's a lot of games
left and a lot of things that could happen.'' &QL;

ST. JOHN'S ELUDES UPSET BY GEORGETOWN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The small St. John's contingent was saying bye-bye
to the departing Georgetown fans with a few seconds left in
Saturday's 74-66 Red Storm victory, a bit of bravado on behalf of a
team that had to scramble in the last minute to hold on to a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown has shown promise in the last few weeks and St.
John's got a preview of what could be one of the better Big East
teams next season.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied with 1 minute 44 seconds to go, before St.
John's hit four consecutive free throws. Lavor Postell, who had a
magnificent day with 18 points and 15 rebounds, grabbed a crucial
rebound of a missed jumper by Trey Kilpatrick, was fouled and sank
the two free throws that had eased St. John's back to safety with a
four-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   When Bootsy Thornton, who scored only two points in the second
half, stripped Georgetown's Kevin Braswell of the ball, and Erick
Barkley finished with a layup, St. John's was back up by six, a
lead large enough to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   In the teams' first meeting in January, Georgetown dominated the
inside game as Tyrone Grant was limited to 11 minutes because of
his wrist injury. This time, St. John's had Grant back but the
Hoyas, glimpses of its bruising past resurfacing, still manhandled
the Red Storm in the paint early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Grant had a superb flurry early in the second half when St.
John's desperately needed it. Georgetown had moved ahead by 35-34
when Anthony Perry fouled Barkley and Barkley responded with an
elbow to Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was hit with a technical foul for unsportsmanlike
conduct at 17:38 and Braswell hit the two free throws to give
Georgetown its first lead since 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Grant then took over, scoring six points in 40 seconds and
adding a steal. St. John's was back in front, 40-35, as the Hoyas
went scoreless for more than three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgetown kept banging St. John's. When Jameel Watkins went
for a rebound, he was called for a foul with 11:15 left to play and
St. John's leading by seven. Georgetown coach Craig Esherick argued
the call and was charged with a technical.
</P>
<P>
   But Albert Richardson missed the front end of the one-and-one,
and Barkley made just one of the two free throws and St. John's
squandered a chance to get four points at the line.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's was struggling and it only got worse. Barkley picked
up his fourth foul with 7:04 left and Georgetown was down by one
with five minutes left when Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje hit a baby jumper
to make the score 56-55.

MIAMI, DOWN 14 POINTS, UPSETS UCONN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ Moments after the game ended, Miami's players
were hugging each other in celebration at midcourt. Connecticut's
players were walking to their locker room dejectedly, forced to
digest their second loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming a 14-point first-half deficit, and holding off a late
rally by Connecticut, Miami kept its poise and escaped with a
thrilling 73-71 victory this afternoon at Gampel Pavilion. The
victory improved the Hurricanes' record to 19-5, and continued one
of the best basketball seasons in Miami's history. The Huskies are
23-2, but they lost a chance to clinch at least a share of the Big
East regular season title.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was decided on Connecticut's final possession.
Trailing by two points, the Huskies called time out with 17.4
seconds to play, but they failed to convert a game-tying basket.
</P>
<P>
   With five seconds to play, Richard Hamilton passed to Khalid
El-Amin, who was forced into an off-balance 17-foot jumper over the
tough defense of John Salmons. El-Amin's shot was an air ball, and
the horn sounded as the two teams scrambled for possession of the
rebound, giving the Hurricanes their first win ever at Connecticut
in seven attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Both Miami and St. John's are now 13-3 in the Big East, one game
behind Connecticut (14-2), with two games remaining. The Huskies
who entered the game ranked No. 2 in the Associated Press poll,
will be forced to regroup before Monday's game at Providence. With
Miami leading 73-71, Jennings missed a 14-foot jumper in the lane
with 31 seconds to play, giving Connecticut a chance to tie. The
Huskies brought the ball to the front court and called timeout with
17.4 seconds left, setting up the final sequence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A stunning 8-0 run by Connecticut tied the game at 71-71 with
two minutes left. With Miami leading, 71-63, Hamilton made a
3-pointer from the right corner to make the score 71-66. Then after
a steal by Ricky Moore, Hamilton made one of two free throws to
pull the Huskies to within 71-67 with 3:35 left.
</P>
<P>
   Then after Tim James missed badly on a 14-foot baseline jumper,
Kevin Freeman scored on a driving bank shot, shaving Miami's lead
to 71-69, and the crowd was in a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the basket looked smaller to the Hurricanes, and after
James missed another jumper, the Huskies made the type of poised
play that quality teams make. Jake Voskuhl made a beautiful
back-door cut away from the ball, and Moore fed Voskuhl for an
uncontested dunk, tying the score, and forcing a Miami timeout.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Hemsley of Miami missed a jumper from the top of the key
when play resumed, but James rebounded and was fouled by El-Amin.
James made both foul shots with 1:40 left to put Miami ahead,
73-71. Connecticut went to Hamilton, its leading scorer, but he
missed a jumper from the top of the key. James rebounded for the
Hurricanes, who called timeout with 53.7 seconds left to set up the
final sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Mounting an impressive comeback on the road against a quality
team, Miami opened the second half with a 15-2 run to take a 50-45
lead with 16:47 left to play. The Hurricanes were getting solid
play from three starters _ James, Hemsley and Mario Bland, making
it difficult for Connecticut's man-to-man defense to key on any one
player. Miami was not intimidated by Connecticut's impressive
record or by the hostile atmosphere, and it became clear that this
game would not be won easily by either team.
</P>
<P>
   As the game's momentum changed, the Huskies became more
frustrated. Jim Calhoun, Connecticut's coach, received a technical
foul during Miami's 15-2 run, and Calhoun angrily removed his
jacket in disgust. The play was intense and physical, and if
Calhoun was looking for a tough game to prepare his team for the
coming postseason, this was it.
</P>
<P>
   After Connecticut led by as many as 14 points, Miami regained
its composure and pulled to within 41-35 at halftime. But for the
first eight minutes, it looked as if Connecticut might win in a
rout.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Huskies' final home game of the season, which was
particularly emotional for their seniors, who were playing their
final game on campus. After pre-game ceremonies to honor the senior
class and their families, the Huskies roared to a quick 18-8 lead.
While Connecticut looked quick and intense, Miami looked shaky and
sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   Once Miami finally settled down, the Hurricanes looked more like
the solid team that barely lost, 70-68, in overtime when these two
teams met last month in Miami.

CLEMENS SWITCHES ALLEGIANCE AND GETS DOWN TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Originally skedded as BBA-YANKEES) 
(lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ After Roger Clemens was traded to the New York
Yankees two days ago, his sister wrote a poem for him about the
Yankees. He would not reveal the lines specifically, but they were
about tradition and pinstripes, about Clemens, about winning, and
it rang true to him.
</P>
<P>
   He became part of that tradition and wore pinstripes in his
first workout with the Yankees Saturday, when he attracted as many
reporters, photographers and camera operators as any rock star.
Shortly after Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman met him at the
airport, Clemens chatted briefly with Manager Joe Torre and then
pulled on a Yankees cap and held up his No. 12 jersey at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a second chance to be part of the Yankees, I'm very
thrilled,'' said Clemens, who had turned down an opportunity to
sign with the Yankees as a free agent after the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens _ sporting a slight goatee that will come off to meet
the dress code of the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner
_ smiled a lot and stated repeatedly how excited he was to have a
chance to win a championship, how that is what drives him now.
Clemens has warred with the Yankees for years, but he wants all
that to be forgotten, in this new challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to continue to punish my body and do everything I
can to continue to be a power pitcher,'' he said. ``I definitely
met my match with Steinbrenner when it comes to winning. He's not
satisfied with last year.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Clemens hit Derek Jeter and Scott Brosius with pitches,
in two beanball incidents, but Clemens brushed that history off.
``The same guys you want to knock down are the same guys you want
on your side sometimes,'' Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   When pitching with Boston and Toronto, Clemens would run after
games outside the ball parks, but he smiled when asked if he would
continue that tradition in the Bronx. ``I don't know if I'll be
going too far outside there,'' he said. ``I'll have to ask Joe, and
maybe he'll have some insight on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre met with Clemens for about 10 minutes and, Torre said
later, he was taken by the mass of the man, his oak-tree legs and
Sherman tank chest, the shoulders and arms that could pass for
bucket loaders. Clemens began his spring training regimen two days
after the other Yankees, but one look and there was no doubt: He is
in extraordinary physical condition. This is one reason Yankees
officials prefer him to David Wells, whom they traded to Toronto
with reliever Graeme Lloyd and infielder Homer Bush for Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens dressed in his uniform and played catch briefly with Mel
Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, before heading to the
bullpen for his first throwing session with his new team. Catcher
Joe Girardi met Clemens near the gate to welcome him, and Clemens
swung an arm out and gripped Girardi's hand.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen here is at the end of the stands down the
right-field line, and as Clemens strolled to the second of five
bullpen mounds, fans were lined up three and four deep in the
stands. It could have been a theater, the bullpen a stage. Clemens
set forth on the rubber. The first of his 59 warm-up pitches popped
loudly in Girardi's glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, Roger,'' somebody yelled.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this informal 13-minute workout, everything about how
Clemens threw was precise, and this is always the case. He would
hold both hands in front of his face as he stared in at Girardi's
mitt, over the webbing of his own glove. He would begin his motion,
plant his back leg _ the right leg, for the right-handed pitcher _
and drive off that leg, his left foot moving in a straight line at
Girardi, his hand cocking the ball and then whipping forward,
catapulting the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is careful with his mechanics, and if anything seemed
out of place on a particular pitch, he would quickly mimic the
motion of what should have happened: he should have extended his
arm more, he should have followed through, or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   He would wipe his face and touch the back and bill of his cap
before each delivery. Torre and Stottlemyre stood nearby and
watched, mostly in silence. But then, what was there to say? This
is Roger Clemens, the Rocket. Yankee pitchers have won four Cy
Young Awards over the years; Clemens has won five himself.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens finished the workout, stepped forward and shook hands
with Girardi again, and some in the crowd clapped and called his
name. ``Good luck, Roger!'' another yelled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His hair glistening wet and his cap darkened at the brim from
the sweat, Clemens moved down the stands along the right-field
line, a uniformed Hillsborough County sheriff at his side. Fans
scurried and jumped over seats and pushed forward, extending
baseballs and pictures and pens, yelling for him to sign. Jammed
together, several crashed through a gate and tumbled forward to the
dirt at Clemens' feet. The pitcher stepped back, glanced down to
see if they were all right, and then continued signing.
</P>
<P>
   The scene could be the same in Yankee Stadium in two months,
when Clemens is there in pinstripes, an enemy no longer. Wells
pitched a perfect game and got the keys to the city; if Clemens
meets expectations, if he wins 20 to 25 games, challenges for the
Cy Young Award and leads the Yankees to another championship, he
may get the deed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those close to Clemens, 36, have told him that this is a
perfect way to end his career, with an organization steeped in
tradition and with annual expectations for championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants that ring,'' his agent, Randy Hendricks, said. ``He
lusts after that ring. It's a big missing part of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's his destiny. He has earned the right to be part
of a legendary team.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials familiar with Clemens believe that, if all goes
according to plan, he can work out a contract extension within the
next two months that will allow him to end his career with the
Yankees. When asked if he believes Clemens will finish his career
in pinstripes, Hendricks said, ``It's more likely than not.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clemens: ``I've got a team of All-Stars behind me. When I
take the mound, it'll be exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry, attempting a comeback from colon cancer, took
batting practice Saturday for the first time since his surgery and
reported that all went well. ``I'm kind of surprised I'm swinging
the bat as well as I did at this early stage,'' said Strawberry,
among four outfielders who will compete for playing time in left
field.

WILSON, DOTEL FACE TOUGH ROAD TRYING TO BREAK INTO METS' PITCHING
STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Va.)  (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ The crowd came out Saturday to see Mike
Piazza, who is finally and firmly entrenched as the Mets' catcher.
But beyond the spotlight on the first official workout for pitchers
and catchers, two bright pitching prospects began trying to get
some attention.
</P>
<P>
   It is a difficult task for Paul Wilson and Octavio Dotel,
though. The staff that Piazza will be catching this season is all
but set.
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter, Rick Reed, Bobby Jones, Masato Yoshii and Hideo Nomo
are the starters. John Franco, Armando Benitez, Dennis Cook, Turk
Wendell, Greg McMichael and Allen Watson are the relievers, with
Watson _ whose contract is guaranteed _ figuring as a spot starter.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine said one of those 11 pitchers could
conceivably lose his job, but that does not give much hope to
Wilson and Dotel.
</P>
<P>
   A third perennial prospect, Jason Isringhausen, will begin the
year at Class AAA Norfolk after missing all of last season while
recovering from elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Unless something extraordinary happens these next six weeks,
that is where Wilson and Dotel will be, too. Still, it might be up
to someone like Wilson or Dotel to inject a little life into the
pitching staff as the season wears on.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who will be 26 by the time the season starts, can be
excused if he is becoming a little impatient.
</P>
<P>
   The former No. 1 overall pick in the 1994 draft, who put in a
full season at the major league level in 1996, reported to camp the
strongest he has ever been. And yet, after throwing only 57 innings
split between Class A and Class AAA last season, Wilson _ who
missed most of 1997 after undergoing shoulder surgery _ knows he
will probably not begin the year with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at the point now where `just let me help,''' said Wilson,
who went 4-1 in seven starts for Norfolk with a 4.42 earned run
average last season. ``I know I can help. But I'm pretty much
resigned to my fate. There are six guys here with guaranteed
contracts, six guys here who are established. So where do I go?
What do I do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to go out and show them how far I've come and let
them make a decision. But just get me in the door. That's all I
want, my way back in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotel is trying to get through that door for the first time.
After going 12-8 with a 2.84 earned run average at Class AA
Binghamton and Class AAA Norfolk, Dotel was brought up to the major
leagues in September, but he did not pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old is beginning his seventh season in the
organization and many feel that Dotel _ who was 5-0 with a 1.29 ERA
in the Dominican winter leagues this year _ has the potential to
become a star.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson compared Dotel to Pedro Martinez. Dotel is a tad bigger
than Martinez, but does resemble him. With a 90-plus-mile-an-hour
fastball, Dotel also throws nearly as hard as Martinez, but he
knows he needs to work on his changeup.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel also is likely to start the season at Norfolk, where he
tossed 99 innings last season. But, he said, ``If they give me the
opportunity, I'd like to show them here that I can throw.''

MEDIA INVASION BOOSTS JASPER BUSINESSES, 
BUT MANY RESIDENTS EAGER FOR HORDE TO GO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Okla.) 
 
By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ There hasn't been anything like this to hit the
Belle-Jim Hotel since Mamie Patten built the place in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   Every noon the old wooden establishment's dining rooms are
flooded with hungry spectators from the courthouse across the
square. Others line up at the front desk to pick up orders of daily
specials like chicken pot pie or enchilada casserole to carry out
to the courthouse press room or to the satellite TV trucks that
line one side of the square.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hungry television cameras roam the square,
looking for someone important to photograph. At the same time the
locals look out on the scene and wonder just what has become of
their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circus has come to town,'' mused local real estate agent
John Matthews, who stepped from his office on the square with his
old dog, Domino, to survey the hubbub. He smiled as he looked at
all the photographers and reporters milling around, looking for
their piece of the action in the trial of John William ``Bill''
King, 24, a white supremacist on trial in the dragging death of a
black man.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews has seen the media ``circus'' before. It was here last
June when the dismembered body of James Byrd Jr., 49, was found a
few miles east of town. It was here again later when Ku Klux Klan
members came to rally on the courthouse steps and were met by
members of black militant groups.
</P>
<P>
   And he'll see it again, though probably on a smaller scale, when
two co-defendants are tried separately in Byrd's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just be glad when it's over and you can all go home,''
Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a common sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   David Stiles, who operates the Belle-Jim as a bed and breakfast
with his wife, Pat, said the trial has definitely affected his
regular business. ``A lot of our regular customers have stayed
away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, his crew has had to struggle with almost half again as
many noon lunch orders as usual to help feed the big crowds that
pour out of the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   This time of year is generally fairly quiet for the little bed
and breakfast in downtown Jasper, he said, but this time news
reporters have taken all eight bedrooms. Last week he had to open a
ninth bedroom to make room for a fisherman with a long-standing
reservation. The Swann Hotel, a block from the courthouse, is
filled as well.
</P>
<P>
   Full hotels aren't rare in Jasper. ``When we moved here nine
years ago, it was almost impossible to ever get a motel room,''
said Diane Domenech, director of the Chamber of Commerce. It's just
that they're usually full of visiting workers, businessmen and bass
fishermen, not reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Locals would rather Jasper be known for its fishing than as the
place where a terrible racial murder occurred, said James Shumake,
who runs a fishing tackle shop. He said most folks agree with a
former police chief who said, ``We'd like for you all to go home
now. And when y'all come back, come back to go fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishing is a $9 million-a-year business in Jasper, the
cornerstone of its tourism income. Only forest-related industries
have more impact on the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, members of the media have been made welcome in the
friendly town of 8,000 in East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Most have found their way to local eateries like Texas
Charlie's, where Charlie and Nancy Nicholson are now accustomed to
being interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Twirling one end of a longhorn-style moustache, Charlie
Nicholson, 63, said Jasper residents tend to welcome strangers _
although he would never be considered a native, because he wasn't
born in the county and has operated a business there only since
1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will accept anybody,'' he said. ``They like for you to be
a bit of a rogue, to be able to tell a story, but they don't want
you to beat your wife or dog, they want you to pay your bills and
have some semblance of a church life.''
</P>
<P>
   As for being in the news, Jasper folks don't care for that. ``We
can read about it,'' Nicholson said. ``We do read the papers. We'd
just like to stay out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Nicholson said Byrd's slaying has caused many in Jasper to
rethink their racial attitudes. She had just joined the City
Council when the crime occurred. She said civic leaders _ black and
white _ quickly started meeting to see what needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Diggles, a black man who heads a multicounty council of
governments, said it was difficult for whites to understand how
deeply Byrd's death affected black residents. ``Something like this
brings back all that pain from the days of slavery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Mayor R.C. Horn, who is also black, has formed a
special task force to look into all facets of the town's racial
climate.
</P>
<P>
   That task force, Nancy Nicholson predicted, will help make
Jasper a much better place to live. ``You come back in 10 years,''
she said. ``We will see walls come tumbling down.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Nicholsons have gotten used to having news
reporters eating in their restaurant, nighttime business has fallen
off. ``It just seems like people aren't going out at night as much
as they used to,'' Charlie Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   Local motel operators said tourism seemed to drop off last
summer, especially after the Klan and black militant groups came to
town.
</P>
<P>
   But this week every room in town is filled _ and not just with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the big bass fishing tournaments hit town last week
just as testimony was starting in the trial. There will be a
different tournament almost every weekend through the spring,
summer and into next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd heard about it when it happened,'' said professional bass
fisherman Tom Biffle of Wagoner, Okla. He said fishermen on the
tournament circuit said to each other, ``Jasper? Can you believe
something like that happened in Jasper?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't believe it,'' he added, checking his boat
after parking it in front of his motel room within sight of where
police think the suspects picked up Byrd the night he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   He said he never considered not returning to Jasper for the Bass
Angler Sportsmen's Society's tournament. The top prize is $40,000
and points earned there can qualify fishermen for even
higher-paying contests.
</P>
<P>
   John Rogers, another tournament fisherman who came from New
Hampshire, said the trial doesn't concern him. His interests are
simpler: ``It's all about fishing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rogers and 300 other fishermen zipped across the
114,500-acre Sam Rayburn Reservoir at speeds higher than would be
legal on the highways, each searching for wherever the
money-winning fat bass were hanging out.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back on the square, Beaumont musician Ricky Jason was
making a few bucks selling T-shirts with a portrait of James Byrd
Jr. on them, as well as CDs by his group, Colorblind, and caps that
said, ``Trial of the Century, Jasper, Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason said his group had the portrait of Byrd painted shortly
before the CD, ``Love, Peace and Harmony,'' was released. He said
10 percent of the sales of the disc will go to Byrd's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is real good,'' he said. ``We're going to be here
right through this trial, the next trial and the one after that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the world's view of Jasper was primarily formed by what
was going on in the 110-year-old courthouse, many of the pictures
the world was viewing went through the same place: the
film-developing machine at the one-hour photo lab in Jasper's
Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Many news photographers brought their film there to be processed
before scanning the images into computers for transmission around
the world. Autopsy photos and police pictures of the crime scene,
King's many tattoos and other case-related film also were processed
at the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not proud of what we had to do, but we're proud they
(the photos) turned out well,'' said lab manager Charles Griffing.
</P>
<P>
   It's an attitude echoed all around Jasper by townspeople who are
dismayed by the murder that occurred there, but remain proud of
their town.
</P>
<P>
   They're ready for justice to be done at the courthouse and for
life to get back to normal.

 &HT;    Wohlers pleased with performance
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Mark Wohlers walked away from the mound
happy on Saturday morning, which was a welcome feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Just two days after facing live batters for the first time since
mid-August and looking as raw as ever, Wohlers came away from
Saturday's batting practice throwing session looking much more like
a man who might make this comeback.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't hit anybody. He didn't throw anything out of the
batting cage. He was hitting his target with his fastball, and the
pitches in the dirt came less often. Out of 30-plus pitches, seven
or eight were in the dirt as compared to double-digits on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day was kind of bad,'' Wohlers said. ``I was really
nervous out there. Yesterday got a little bit better. I'm not
saying I was consistent with my fastball, but I was more consistent
(today) than the previous day, which was good.''
</P>
<P>
   One big difference Wohlers found was when he bounced balls down
and away against right-handed hitters - he had hit Mike Mahoney
twice on Thursday, including once with a fastball - he could make
some mechanical adjustments to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two days I was throwing 10 or 15 in a row whereas
today I'd throw one or two then make the adjustment,'' Wohlers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wohlers wasn't ready to go out and celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to have the approach that it was a good day but
you know what, I'm supposed to have good days,'' Wohlers said.
``I'm realistic (enough) to know there might be days when it looks
like I've never picked up a baseball before in my life, and I'm
prepared for that. I'm not going to drive myself crazy...
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the thing that's going to help me is having the
attitude that I don't give a damn, whereas deep down I care dearly.
That's my problem. I care too much. I'm self-critical. I care too
much about pleasing my teammates, fans watching in the stands,
people watching on TV. I don't allow myself room for error.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers joked that he was considering launching his first pitch
over the batting cage to start each workout in spring training to
entertain the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm able to laugh at it now,'' Wohlers said. ``I don't let it
get deep like it did last year. I'm trying to keep it on the
surface and say `Oh well, whatever happens happens.'''
</P>
<P>
   Moves on hold
</P>
<P>
   With the announcement of Brian Hunter's signing on Friday,
general manager John Schuerholz said Saturday for now he's not
looking to bring anybody else in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're satisfied with what we've got right now,'' Schuerholz
said. ``As we scout other teams and see what other teams have
available, that may change. But right now we're not going to go out
and sign anybody else or bring anybody else in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter first contacted the Braves through former dugout coach
Jim Beauchamp six weeks ago before the Braves had any openings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always like Brian's bat and his defense at first base,''
manager Bobby Cox said. ``He'll be a great late-inning guy if Ryan
Klesko is playing first base. We could platoon him.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez on the mend
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Perez spent another night in Osceola Regional Medical
Center Saturday night recovering from surgery to stop testicular
bleeding after he took a foul tip in the groin during batting
practice on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors predicted it would take Perez seven to 10 days to
recover, but the Braves don't expect Perez to be ready to get back
in there and catch for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can catch in even three weeks, it will be OK,'' Cox
said. ``The thing is he won't be able to do any running, lifting,
swinging, not much of anything right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marino golf tournament
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux and John Smoltz were given Cox's blessing to throw
early Saturday and leave and miss Sunday's workout so they could
play in Dan Marino's charity golf tournament Saturday and Sunday.
The event _ the First Plus Financial Celebrity Golf Invitational _
raises $300,000 each year for the Dan Marino Foundation which
donates money to a treatment facility for children with
neurological disorders. Marino's son Michael is mildly autistic.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other participants are Chris Chandler, John Elway,
Mario Lemieux, Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and Alex Rodriguez.

COCHRANE ASSEMBLING LEGAL TEAM FOR DIALLO CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyer Johnnie Cochran joined the Rev. Al Sharpton
Saturday morning at a rally in Harlem, vowing to seek justice in
court for the family of Amadou Diallo, the West African street
peddler slain by four New York police officers, and for the broader
black population.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran said he was assembling a legal team similar to the one
that won acquittal for O.J. Simpson, and that it would include a
``community lawyer.'' He offered no specifics about his plan for a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the police accountable?'' Cochran asked the crowd of about
400 gathered in the auditorium of Sharpton's National Action
Network for the two-hour rally, which was also broadcast on radio
station WWRL-1600 AM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are these four going to be held responsible and accountable?
The police are not above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   With people in the crowd wearing buttons with faces of people
shot by the police, several Latino politicians recalled Anthony
Baez, killed by officers in 1994 after a confrontation that began
over a game of street football, and Luis Baez, a mentally disturbed
man, unrelated to Anthony Baez, who died in 1979 in a hail of 24
bullets fired by five officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is safe,'' said U.S. Rep. Jose E. Serrano, D-N.Y., of
the Bronx. ``I used to worry only, as a congressman, about the
local mugger. I am worried more now about the local police than I
am about the local mugger.''
</P>
<P>
   Serrano noted that he was now the ranking Democrat on the
appropriations subcommittee that handled funding for the Justice
Department, and said he would try to hold up funds if he was
unsatisfied with the federal role in investigating the Diallo case.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran spoke of his recent visit to the Wheeler Avenue
apartment building in the Soundview section of the Bronx where
Diallo, 22, lived and was shot at 41 times in the vestibule on Feb.
4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is such a small area, it is a death chamber,'' Cochran
said. ``He couldn't go anywhere. You would not shoot an animal in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, who returned Thursday from Diallo's funeral in Guinea,
called the shooting ``an international disgrace'' and led the crowd
in chants of ``No justice, no peace,'' and ``Amadou, Amadou,
Amadou.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This young man, Amadou, represents to us, in our judgment, the
test case in whether or not judicial procedures in this country are
for everyone,'' Sharpton said. ``There's more on trial here than
four police. The U.S. itself is on trial before the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The four officers, Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon
and Richard Murphy, have turned in their guns and are on
administrative duty. A grand jury in the Bronx has been convened to
consider the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said daily vigils at the Bronx courthouse where the
grand jury meets will continue, with a larger rally there scheduled
for Wednesday. Demonstrators are also planning to rally Sunday
afternoon at White Plains Road and East Tremont in the Bronx, and
Monday in front of City Hall.

 &HT;    Elie puts Spurs to San Antonio
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mario Elie made a living with Houston by beating the Spurs in
big games. Now that Elie is in San Antonio, he's dumping on
teammates who are notorious for their lack of emotion and fire.
</P>
<P>
   After the Spurs blew an 11-point fourth quarter lead to Phoenix,
Elie reminisced. ``We had guys (in Houston) who were warriors,'' he
said. ``(Coach) Rudy (Tomjanovich) didn't have to tell those guys
what to do. I'm tired of the attitude here, that we're the Spurs
and all we have to do is walk out and play. It's the guys'
demeanors, and I can't change that. They tell me it's been that way
here for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie didn't have to name anyone. The Spurs' front line of David
Robinson, Tim Duncan and Sean Elliott is notorious for being
laid-back.
</P>
<P>
   The Rodman watch
</P>
<P>
   He might be putting the best face on it, but Lakers exec Jerry
West is going crazy over the Dennis Rodman saga in L.A. At a recent
home game, he complained of not feeling well and went home early.
He talks about the situation to anyone who asks, telling friends
that he'll re-sign.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that wouldn't happen, even if owner Jerry Buss wanted
to bring in Darryl Dawkins. After all, West signed a new contract
for $3.5 million a year and he isn't going to leave that on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant are feuding, and
Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones keep hearing that they're going to
Charlotte, while coach Del Harris swings in the wind on the final
year of his contract. Players talk behind his back like he's
history.
</P>
<P>
   A new streak
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Vin Baker said he wasn't going to make a big deal
about it when he finally made a free throw. But when he ended the
streak of misses at 18 Wednesday and got a standing ovation from
17,000, Baker was clearly relieved. ``I have to be honest: It was a
tremendous relief. I got the monkey off my back. I think I was
tremendously tense. But I have a long ways to go. It's a joke to be
one for 19 or whatever I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Try 1-for-20. He missed the next one.
</P>
<P>
   Ref's best friend?
</P>
<P>
   Terry Cummings has no use for Karl Malone. After the Utah
forward tuned up the Warriors with 35 points and 12 rebounds,
Cummings complained, ``The referees gave him every break. It ain't
like they let you play him. They let me play him. But when the
other guys (Jason Caffey and Adonal Foyle) were playing him, they
can't do anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Karl does is cry,'' Cummings said. ``I've never seen a
team go to the championship twice and cry and whine so much. And
they've been there and come home with nothing. That's why. You
can't cry in the championship. They don't do nothing there when you
cry.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the Kings were complaining when referee Sean
Corbin called a foul against Chris Webber on Malone's 3-point try.
Malone made all three shots, tying a game Utah won in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Same ol' Nuggets
</P>
<P>
   Denver blew a 19-point lead to Phoenix and coach Mike D'Antoni
was so angry he kicked the bucket _ the Gatorade bucket _ and broke
a couple of toes. The Nuggets went to Portland and lost their
seventh in a row at the Rose Garden arena. The 15-point beating
dropped their average margin of defeat in that span to 27.6 points.
</P>
<P>
   Layups
</P>
<P>
   Malik Rose's landmark 22 points, nine rebounds in his hometown
of Philadelphia had no impact on his role with the Spurs. Two days
later, he did not leave the bench in Chicago. ... Mike Bibby still
won't forgive dad Henry for leaving his mother. When Vancouver
played in Los Angeles, the son did not leave tickets for his dad,
whose Southern Cal basketball team had the night off. ... Kevin
Garnett of Minnesota, on playing his last game in the L.A. Sports
Arena: ``I've had some memorable moments in here. But at the same
time, it would be nice to have some hot water in the showers.''

AFTER A BRIEF DRY SPELL, IT'S GOOD TO BE A YANKEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ When he isn't offering his persistent platitudes
toward the departed David Wells, George Steinbrenner is walking
with more of a swagger and talking with more bravado. The Yankees
shocked Wells and most of the baseball world by acquiring Roger
Clemens late Wednesday night, and Steinbrenner, despite his
feelings about Wells, is gleeful that the already attractive
Yankees are staying in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   It is good being affiliated with the Yankees these days. Very
good.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone used to hate the Yankees. But it is difficult to hate a
team led by a popular manager and populated by gracious players.
Everyone used to want to beat the Yankees. Now it seems that
everyone wants to be a Yankee. Who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a pretty good job of people wanting to become
Yankees,'' Steinbrenner said. ``It hasn't always been this way, but
it has changed. I think guys aspire to be Yankees. I don't think
guys want to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Jeff Nelson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once guys get to New York, this is a great place to play,''
Nelson said. ``It's not like it used to be or what some people
think. I love playing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who arrived at Legends Field Saturday, spurned the
Yankees once, but he did not let his second chance vanish. Two
years ago, Clemens ignored Steinbrenner's personal sales pitch and
signed a four-year contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. This time,
Clemens jumped into Yankeeland even though they declined to extend
his contract beyond the remaining two years and $16.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty fortunate,'' Clemens said earlier in the week of
his second chance to join the team.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had never expressed an undying love for the Yankees, but
after the trade was completed, he reminisced about how he discussed
the Yankees as a boy and claimed he wore the Yankee jacket and cap
that Steinbrenner had given him when he was wooed two years ago. If
it sounded as if the only five-time Cy Young Award winner in
baseball history was thrilled to be a Yankee, Clemens was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the tradition, I love it,'' Clemens said. ``I love
pitching at Yankee Stadium. The monuments and all the stuff that
goes with it, I love it. I'm excited about getting the opportunity
to go there and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heady atmosphere these days, even Steinbrenner
conceded that it has not always been easy to persuade players to be
Yankees. Clemens did not want to join the team in his first
opportunity. Before the 1993 season, Greg Maddux opted for Atlanta
even though the Braves offered $5 million less than the Yankees,
and Barry Bonds signed with San Francisco even though the Yankees
were offering a similar contract to the one the Giants gave him.
Even David Cone declined an opportunity to sign with the Yankees
that season, calling them too disorganized. Instead he signed with
his hometown Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any players who don't want to be in New York,''
Steinbrenner said at the time. The statement rang hollow since the
players had already said no, but now it the issue is moot.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill and Cone stayed with the Yankees for less than what
they likely could have received on the open market, and Bernie
Williams never really wanted to leave the team, although in the end
the $87.5 million contract he received made that a nonissue for
him.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Yankees appealing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think guys want to be Yankees because we win,'' Nelson said.
``We've won it all in two of the last three years. The team doesn't
change and, if it does, it's to get someone like Clemens. If guys
have a chance to come here, they should.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are more reasons than that, though. Torre is a player's
manager who has few rules, many friends and a superb success rate
in New York. Steinbrenner is no longer as vocal in his criticism of
players and has grown to be appreciated because he continues to
open his checkbook to keep the Yankees in contention for the World
Series. The owner also brings in former Yankees like Whitey Ford,
Rich Gossage, Ron Guidry, Mickey Rivers and Craig Nettles at his
own expense as instructors in the spring and keeps such former
players as Mel Stottlemyre, Willie Randolph and Chris Chambliss
employed as coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens conceded that Steinbrenner's will to be the best was
seductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met my match in a guy who wants to win,'' Clemens said.
``This guys settles for nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner is also thoughtful in how he treats his players.
The Yankees have a full-time masseur, two batting practice pitchers
and two trainers who travel with the team. They received an
upgraded weight room at the Stadium shortly after one player
mentioned that some equipment was below par, and the players even
have protein shakes waiting for them after each spring workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's because we do things first class,'' Steinbrenner
said. ``Joe has a way with his players, and I give him full credit
for that. I'm proud that people want to play on the Yankees.''

 &HT;    Oakley is still firing at Knicks
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Oakley won't let his hostility for Knicks' management
go. He now maintains that a meeting with bosses Ernie Grunfeld and
Dave Checketts greased his exit to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just conversations and stuff we didn't agree on,''
Oakley said. ``I always would try to tell them the truth, but
that's not what they want to hear. With them, it's like playing
poker. You never want anyone to see all your cards. They're like a
guy standing around the table, and you figure maybe you would be
smart to hold down some of your cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might not have liked some of my comments to the press,''
Oakley said. ``We know it's all about making money; all of us are
about making money. But they try to make it into something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley added that the pressure to justify continually raising
the price of seats at Madison Square Garden has forced the team to
make bad decisions. ``Every year they have to make it look like
they're doing something _ trade somebody, make a move,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last four or five years, they made a move every year.
It made it hard to play together. With Pat Riley, we were together
for a while. The good teams around the league, like Indiana, have
kept their key pieces together. The Knicks trade away their main
pieces and then hope the new guys can catch on. It ain't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Good-time Charlie
</P>
<P>
   When Toronto's Kevin Willis elbowed Knicks guard Charlie Ward,
he said he remembered how Ward took P.J. Brown's knee out two years
ago to ignite a Game 5 playoff brawl. ``It was the same type of
situation as Miami,'' Willis said. ``You just don't want to be in
that situation where a guy hits you like that and damages my knees
or puts me out for a game or, even more seriously, my career. ...
He was pushing down toward my knee or going at my knee.''
</P>
<P>
   Not-so-sweet Charlotte
</P>
<P>
   Dave Cowens could be replaced as Charlotte's coach the next few
days after complaining about money. Club president Bob Bass did not
offer a vote of confidence: ``The only thing I'll say about that is
that he's the coach at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowens confirmed a conversation with Bass: ``Yeah, he was upset.
He wanted to know why I said what I said. I just told him I
answered some questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowens, who led Charlotte to 54- and 51-victory season seasons,
is reportedly the lowest-paid coach in the NBA. His contract pays
$675,000 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Fakin' it?
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Brandon, accused of feigning injury and angling to get
out of Milwaukee, said, ``I was disappointed. No one really ever
asked me how I felt. I've always played hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of it came from the disappointment of me not
being on the court. But I tried to turn it around to the positive
and see that people maybe appreciated me being here and were
frustrated I couldn't play. And when I thought about it like that,
I felt pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   No special feet
</P>
<P>
   So, how smart was Wayne Embry in Cleveland to sign up Zydrunas
Ilgauskas for six years and $70.9 million? When the 7-foot-3
Lithuanian broke his left foot, it became the third season in four
he has missed with injuries to his feet.
</P>
<P>
   The injury also raised the question of what the Cavaliers will
do with Vitaly Potapenko. Unwilling to tie up more big money in the
middle, they were shopping him in tandem with Bobby Sura until the
Ilgauskas injury. Ilgauskas averaged 13.9 points and 8.8 rebounds
last season as a starter, Potapenko 7.1 and 3.9 off the bench.

 Develop the saving habit: Pay yourself first  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you ever feel as though your working life is a treadmill to
oblivion because the proceeds from your paycheck seem to belong to
everyone but you?
</P>
<P>
   Those trapped in the nightmare of living from paycheck to
paycheck know the frustration of sharing their income with everyone
except themselves. Sometimes there's a smidgen left to finance some
fun, sometimes not. If not, well, there's always the credit card,
but putting it on the cuff speeds up the treadmill by expanding the
claim on future paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a younger worker trapped in this situation, your
future is bleak unless you do something about it. Before you know
it, you wake up an older worker facing retirement with nothing to
sustain your post-working life except Social Security benefits and,
if you're lucky, a modest pension.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the question for those whose working life is an exercise
in futility is how to escape the trap. The solution, fortunately,
is as easily said as done: Pay yourself first.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Pay yourself first. With the MoneyWise Personal
Finance Fair scheduled to focus on such matters Friday and
Saturday, this is a good time to revisit this best money-management
strategy ever devised.
</P>
<P>
   The pay-yourself-first concept in this sense doesn't mean
setting aside mad money to blow on a good time. Rather, this
pay-yourself-first plan is designed to ensure that you get as much
long-term reward from your work as those to whom you write checks
each month. They're using your money to make money, so why
shouldn't you do the same?
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of embracing the pay-yourself-first concept is
building an asset base that gets your moneymaking some money. A job
with a regular paycheck is the foundation stone of financial
security, but progress toward financial independence can be
accelerated significantly by putting your money to work as well.
</P>
<P>
   If your resources are relatively meager, your starting point
might be as basic as putting a set amount from each paycheck into a
savings account until you accumulate enough to get into a mutual
fund or purchase a certificate of deposit with a higher interest
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The higher your income, of course, the more latitude you have.
You might think about getting into a mutual fund immediately and
initiating a systematic plan to make a substantial deposit once or
twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky enough to work for a company offering a 401(k)
plan, you're already far ahead of the game. Not only does the
company help ensure discipline by withholding your savings at the
source, but many employers sweeten your pot with a profit-sharing
contribution that partly matches yours.
</P>
<P>
   Don't despair, though, if no company saving-and-investment plan
is available. Look into the options available for establishing
individual retirement accounts, tax-advantaged and otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Paying yourself first is about developing the saving habit.
</P>
<P>
   Many people don't save because they don't think they can afford
to put anything aside. In truth, they can't afford not to put
something aside for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not in the saving habit, your challenge is to convince
yourself that you have as much right to your money as anyone else.
Try it. You'll like it.

NEW YORK'S ECONOMY SURGES DESPITE JOLTS OF '98 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Six months ago, storm clouds loomed on New York
City's economic horizon. The stock market was sliding, securities
firms were laying people off and financial firestorms were sweeping
through Asia, Russia and Latin America. Citing the city's
dependence on Wall Street, doom-meisters predicted that the city's
economy would soon stumble.
</P>
<P>
   Were they ever wrong. Statistics from city and state government
suggest that the last six months of 1998 were among the strongest
ever for New York, and 1999 looks likely to be very good.
</P>
<P>
   Employment is up, incomes are up and tax revenue is up.
Inflation remains low. In fact, the strength of the economy may
have caused the slight rise in the unemployment rate _ more people
are searching for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And new estimates suggest that the expected plunge in Wall
Street's bonus payments _ which affect everything from the price of
luxury co-ops to the level of income-tax collections _ did not
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all that could change this year if the stock market
drops 10 percent, as it did last summer, and does not recover, as
it did last autumn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market slide was a warning to the city and state not to
build a whole economic house on a Wall Street foundation,'' State
Comptroller H. Carl McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock market had not rebounded, job growth would have
been cut in half, according to Regional Financial Associates, an
economic consulting firm. ``Expectations in regard to New York's
economy move one for one with the Dow Jones industrial average,''
said Mark Zandi, the firm's chief economist.
</P>
<P>
   Such warnings irk Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E.
Pataki, who prefer to attribute the strong economy to tax cuts and
crime reduction, rather than the surging stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doom and gloom types are all in the business of finding
something wrong,'' said Randy L. Levine, the deputy mayor for
economic development. ``We just had the largest growth in jobs in
the history of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   This is true. Jobs in the private sector increased by 84,400
last year, a record. In December, the city regained all of the
private-sector jobs that were lost in the recession of the early
1990s, according to data from Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   And though the number of jobs in government has been falling,
``we're within an eyelash of the highest employment of all time,''
said Marc Goloven, an economist for Chase Manhattan Bank. ``The
thing to stress is the extensive nature of today's economic growth,
in industries that weren't even on the city's radar five years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of jobs in the motion-picture and amusement industry
jumped by 7,800 last year, 1,700 of them in the last three months
of last year. Business services, which can include anything from
temporary agencies to car services to technology consultants, added
5,100 jobs in the final quarter of last year and 21,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   And not only were more people working, but they were also making
more money. Average wages rose for most employees paid by the hour,
including construction workers, store clerks and bank employees,
Hevesi's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Personal income tax collections, which the city comptroller's
office uses as a an indicator of personal income, jumped almost 12
percent in the last six months of 1998. Businesses withheld more
money from fatter paychecks and rich people paid more in quarterly
estimated tax.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even the fattest of cats on Wall Street made out better than
they expected back in August and September, said Joan Zimmerman, an
executive recruiter at G.Z. Stephens Inc., which specializes in
financial firms. ``That's absolutely the case _ last year, the
feeling was, `Good God, we'll be remortgaging the house.'''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's office estimates that annual bonuses for those who work
in the financial industry fell a total of about $1 billion, to
about $11.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That works out to more than $75,000 for every man and woman who
works on Wall Street, though the bonus pie is not divided up
evenly; the chairmen of firms like Lehman Brothers and Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter received millions of dollars in bonuses last
year, not including stock options. By contrast, the average
stockbroker got a cash bonus of about $8,700 in 1997, the most
recent year for which statistics are available, according to the
Securities Industry Association. Taxes on some of these bonuses
were withheld in December, but many will not show up in tax revenue
until January's figures are released in the next week or two.
</P>
<P>
   Sales tax receipts in the last six months of last year were 6.5
percent higher than they were during the same months in 1997, so
some were spending a lot of money in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate taxes also roared ahead. The transaction tax jumped
almost 70 percent, to $236.4 million. The mortgage transfer tax,
which people pay when they get mortgage financing, almost doubled,
to $225.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Property tax revenue was down in the last six months of the
year, probably because there is no longer a discount for those who
pay their taxes early, said John Tepper Marlin, chief economist in
the city comptroller's office. Revenue from several taxes on
businesses also fell, including a tax on banks, but general
corporate tax revenue rose more than 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Outside watchdogs say that if Wall Street does hit the skids
this year, city government is well positioned to ride out the
storm, due to the Giuliani administration's conservative budget
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current financial plan is one of the best, with a surplus
rollover of $1.5 billion,'' said Martin Arrick, a director at
Standard &AMP; Poor's, the bond rating firm. The one stubborn piece of
economic data in the city is the high unemployment rate. In
December, 8.1 percent of the work force was looking for a job, more
than double the 3.9 percent jobless rate in the rest of the state,
and much higher than the 4.3 percent national average. A year ago,
the city's unemployment rate was 8.5 percent, but it had fallen to
under 8 percent in mid-1998, according to the state Department of
Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials say the unemployment rate, which measures
the number of people seeking jobs, is artificially inflated because
many people are moving off public assistance and looking for work.
Indeed, 53.9 percent of adults in the city now have jobs, the
highest level since economists began calculating the measure in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials, on the other hand, say that unemployment
in the city is understated because so many people are discouraged
from looking for work. They note that the percentage of working
adults working averaged 64.1 percent in the rest of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Initial claims for unemployment insurance rose somewhat in the
fourth quarter of last year, and the number of help-wanted
advertisements dropped compared with the same period last year,
according to Hevesi's office.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of building permits rose. All three statistics
are leading indicators of how the economy will perform in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin, interpreting these mixed signals, said he expected the
city economy to continue to grow this year, though at a slower pace
than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He remains concerned about the problems that emerged last year:
the stock market decline and economic turmoil overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``the big story is that the U.S. survived this,
was not knocked down, and so did New York City.''

   ONLINE-PRIVACY _ WASHINGTON _ ``You're kidding!'' my wife
exclaimed. I had just told her that someone had gained access to
our private bank records, lifted our account number and recorded
our balance. She listened in stunned silence. There was more. They
had also tracked our recent long-distance calls, identifying those
we had telephoned by name, address and occupation. And they had
compiled dossiers on us, complete with Social Security numbers,
property holdings and financial dealings. ``That's incredible,''
she said. ``How can they do that?'' Easily, it turns out, in the
computer age. (Alexander, Cox News Service).

<P>
   w/ONLINE-SLEUTH _ WASHINGTON _ Many private detectives use
``pretexts'' to fool banks into releasing a customer's confidential
financial data. Al Schweitzer, an investigator who once pleaded
guilty to illegally obtaining Social Security numbers, told the
House Banking Committee last year how he used ``gags'' to get
information. (Cox News Service).

<P>
   ONLINE-LAWS _ WASHINGTON _ At first glance, a pending House bill
seems to be on the side of the angels: it would make it a federal
crime for anyone to fraudulently obtain information about your
account from a bank. But Dana LeJune, a Houston attorney, says that
in order to find where debtors are hiding their money, it is
sometimes necessary to trick banks into revealing if a deadbeat has
an account. (Jaspin, Cox News Service).

   TAX-CUT _ WASHINGTON _ Prospects appear good for a federal tax
cut this year, but it may not be the 10 percent across-the-board
income tax cut favored by some congressional leaders. Instead,
Democrats and many Republicans appear to favor tax cuts targeted to
specific groups they find deserving, such as married couples or
families needing home health care. The sentiment is fueled by polls
showing few Americans favor the broader cuts. (Mollison, Cox News
Service).

   BUSH-THEN&AMP;NOW _ WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush is a man who has
played opposite roles on the national scene. As the son of a
president under fire, he became the ardent and sometimes angry
defender of his father and the adviser deputized for the tough
jobs. Now as the popular Texas governor, he is seen as the cheerful
optimist. Who's the real George W.? (Malone/Herman, Cox News

   DEMS-2000 _ Dick Gephardt wants to be speaker of the House come
Jan. 2001, and Democrats need a gain of just six seats in the next
election to make it happen. Two Georgia seats, held by Republicans
Saxby Chambliss and Charlie Norwood, are crucial to the Democrats'
quest. Gephardt, Patrick Kennedy, John Lewis and others will be in
Atlanta Monday to raise money for those and other campaigns. Of
course, Democrats were whistling the same tune two years ago, but
could not recruit top-flight challengers. They say 2000 will be
different. (Sherman, Cox News Service). Will move by 7 p.m.)

   MARSHLAND _ HOUMA, La. _ Deep in Cajun country between New
Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico, a waterworld of marsh and swamp is
Michael St. Martin's ''2,400-acre hobby.'' He has roamed it since
he was a child, built his estate next to it in the 1980s, and
finally bought it in 1992. It looks pristine and almost
prehistoric: Alligator eyes poke out of the water every few
minutes, ducks fly overhead by the thousands, coots fly in black
masses and rest like carpets on the surface of the water, and huge
swamp rats called nutria dart between the hanging moss and the
gnarled trunks of cypress trees. Swamp maples are in bloom and look
like pink torches against the deep greens, grays and browns of
winter. And when St. Martin's found damage to that land, he sued
two oil companies that had leased drilling rights. The precedent
could lead to hundreds of other lawsuits and cost oil companies
millions to repair past damage. (Konigsmark, Atlanta

   TURKEY-KURDS _ ANKARA, Turkey _ Kurds climbing on roofs, taking
hostages, tussling with the police, setting themselves ablaze and
occupying embassies in a dozen countries across Europe this week
threw an unusually bright spotlight on this nation of people
without a state. Who are these people that have come blazing into
American living rooms the last few days? How can such a diaspora of
people be organized enough to mount simultaneous demonstrations in
different cities, yet factionalized enough not to agree on how to
go about building their own nation-state? What is the nature of
their relationship with the United States? Developing. (Holmes, Cox
News Service). MOVED.

   RUSSIA-POLITICS _ ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ With its rough
democracy and market economy, Russia is often compared to the Wild
West. If so, reformer Galina Starovoitova was widely viewed as one
of the white hats. The St. Petersburg legislator was gunned down
last November in what appeared to be a political assassination.
Then, she was viewed by her allies as a respectable martyr whose
death would surely inspire some essential changes to Russia's
faulty experiment with democracy. But three months later, her death
is almost an after-thought. There are no dead martyrs in today's
Russia, just as there are no living heroes. That's unfortunate in a
country with a broken economy, and the election of a new parliament
and president scheduled to take place in the next 18 months.

   CAMBODIA-ROYAL _ PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Only a few monarchs left
in the world really matter. And not one has mattered for longer
than King Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's master of dramatic intrigue
for the last 58 years. In the 1940s, Sihanouk acted the playboy
king with scores of mistresses, the self-described ``randy
rabbit.'' In the fifties, he became the father of Cambodian
independence from France and the slippery Cold War neutralist. In
the sixties, he occupied himself as the absolute ruler who doubled
as a film maker. In the seventies, he became the figurehead of the
genocidal Khmer Rouge guerrillas and then the Khmer Rouge's gilded
prisoner. Twenty years ago, when Sihanouk was an exiled prince with
slim prospects of reclaiming his country, he was told by Henry
Kissinger that he was as good an actor as Lawrence Olivier. Now
Sihanouk is back on the throne, playing the most improbable role of
his checkered career. (Kunstel-Albright, Cox News Service). MOVED.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ ``Let me see if I can understand this,'' I
remarked to a colleague who had spent time with Kurds in northern
Iraq and Turkey in the days immediately after Desert Storm. ``We
are in daily combat with Iraqi defenses over no-fly zones that we
established for reasons that included protecting Kurds from Saddam
Hussein's attacks and now the Kurds are attacking the embassies of
our NATO allies and others because a Kurdish leader, who many
identify as a terrorist the like of Osama bin Laden, has been
jailed in Turkey, which Saddam Hussein now says may be targeted by
Iraqi missiles because our planes take off from Turkey and bomb
Iraqi defenses in the zones in which we are protecting Kurds.''

   RAMBOUILLET, France _ The Clinton administration and its
partners in negotiating peace for Kosovo said Saturday night that
Serbia continued to refuse NATO ground troops to police any accord,
but that enough progress had been made to justify extending talks
until Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The extension comes after President Clinton said on Friday that
it would be ``a mistake'' to let the talks run on beyond the
original deadline of noon (6 a.m. Eastern time) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who arrived here Saturday
morning, said that after a day of stalled negotiations she spoke to
Clinton and they agreed that the ``United States and the
international community should stay the course.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-day extension of the talks, while not as long as some
European countries had requested, forestalled the air strikes which
NATO had threatened against Serbia if no accord emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The major stumbling block Saturday was the refusal of the
Serbian delegation, headed by the Serbian president Milan
Milutinovic, to consider accepting a NATO-led force as peacekeepers
in Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic is a close ally of the Yugoslav President, Slobodan
Milosevic, the sole decision maker for the Serbs, who has remained
at home in Belgrade but continues to exert absolute control over
the delegation here.
</P>
<P>
   Albright criticized the Serbian delegation for taking ``every
opportunity for evasion and delay.'' In contrast, she said, the
ethnic Albanians, who are seeking an independent Kosovo but
apparently will agree to the autonomy on offer here, had negotiated
with ``discipline and unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the good faith behavior by the ethnic Albanians, it was
a setback for the Clinton administration that they declined at the
last moment to sign the political portion of the overall peace
settlement. With the agreement of the ethnic Albanians on the
political make up of Kosovo during the three year interim
agreement, the Clinton administration had hoped to pile extra
pressure on the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has said it will deploy up to 30,000 soldiers, including a
small contingent of U.S. troops, to monitor an accord intended to
end the year-long conflict in Kosovo. As leader of Yugoslavia,
which consists of Serbia and Montenegro, Milosevic has consistently
refused to contemplate such a foreign presence on his soil.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and four European foreign ministers arrived Saturday
morning at the 14th-century castle where ethnic Albanian and
Serbian delegates have been sequestered for two weeks, and tried to
squeeze an accord out of them.
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 400 NATO strike and support planes remained
at the ready, there was little talk at the castle on Saturday of
airstrikes, and greater concentration on working out details of
making NATO soldiers acceptable to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who stripped Kosovo of its autonomy 10 years ago, has
insisted so far that NATO troops in Kosovo would represent an
infringement of the sovereignty of Serbia and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement proposed here would grant Kosovo autonomy for
three years, but leave unresolved any question of eventual
independence, which the ethnic Albanians seek.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO secretary-general, Javier Solana, was empowered by the
alliance's 16 member nations two weeks ago to order air strikes if
the Serbs failed to go along with an agreement to end the fighting
in Kosovo, which has claimed 2,000 lives in the last 12 months,
according to estimates. As many as 200,000 people have been driven
from their homes in the province, where an estimated 90 percent of
the 2 million population is ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   NATO ambassadors in Brussels scrapped a meeting planned for
Saturday as the talks here dragged on. Solana had said he would
consult with NATO members before ordering any bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent attempt to water down the NATO deployment,
Milutinovic raised the prospect on Friday night of using armed
civilians working under the auspices of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe as a substitute for alliance
troops keeping the Kosovo peace, Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO was extremely unlikely to accept such a proposal, it
was the first sign that the Serbs might eventually accept armed
foreigners on their territory. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of
Britain said no changes were made in the composition of the force,
and rebuffed any suggestion that it might fall under the authority
of anybody except NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs are also not pleased that they would be required under
any settlement to make dramatic reductions in their security forces
in Kosovo _ for the police, who have been blamed for massacres of
ethnic Albanian civilians, and for the Yugoslav army, which patrols
the borders with Albania and Macedonia. Ethnic Albanian guerrillas
have received weapons mostly across the porous, mountainous
frontier with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army are
required under the proposed pact to disarm over a period of six
months.
</P>
<P>
   A major sticking point for the ethnic Albanians Saturday evening
was the failure of the political agreement to stipulate that a
referendum would be called after the three-year interim period. The
delegation believes that such a referendum would result in a vote
for independence from Serbia, a status that the international
community opposes.
</P>
<P>
   The high-stakes drive to reach an accord in Kosovo began after
the massacre of 45 ethnic Albanian civilians by the Serbian
security police last month in the village of Racak.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The killings dramatized what many had known: that the hatred
between the two ethnic groups in Kosovo was irretrievably deep.
Unlike other parts of former Yugoslavia, where different ethnic
groups spoke the same language and intermarried, there is little
intermingling between the ethnic Albanians and the Serbs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the two ethnic groups deteriorated further
when Milosevic revoked the autonomy of Kosovo in 1989, swept
Albanians from all important posts and introduced a repressive
Serbian police and military regime in the province.
</P>
<P>
   The Racak massacre also illustrated that both sides in the
conflict were rearming for renewed hostilities in the spring. In
the last month, international monitors in Kosovo have reported
seeing fighters of the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army
carrying new, highly sophisticated sniper rifles as well as other
new weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian police and Yugoslav army increased the numbers of
their units in violation of a cease-fire agreement worked out in
October by the Clinton administration's special envoy, Richard
Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   With the danger of an unchecked conflict in Kosovo spoiling the
celebrations in Washington in April for the 50th anniversary of
NATO, the administration moved quickly in late January to forge a
combination of diplomacy and military force that would convince
both sides to sign a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Albright urged the Contact Group _ which includes the United
States, France, Germany, Britain, Italy and Russia _ to run the
diplomatic negotiations that have taken place at Rambouillet.
During her visit to Moscow in late January, the Russians made clear
they were ready to work toward a solution in Kosovo and signaled
that they were ready to distance themselves from their traditional
allies, the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO, the administration fought hard to get the 16 alliance
members to give Solana the authority to order airstrikes against
Serbia if peace talks failed. It also moved, but with less
appetite, to have Americans included in a NATO-led ground force
that would enforce any political settlement emerging from the
Rambouillet talks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the administration, the toughest part has been making the
case for a second deployment of U.S. troops to the Balkans in less
than four years. Clinton, announcing his readiness to deploy some
4,000 men in Kosovo if there is a peace accord, said last week that
this was in the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that continued war in Kosovo could spill over into
neighboring Albania and Macedonia, and possibly envelop two NATO
partners, Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The peace in Bosnia, where U.S. troops remain stationed, and the
credibility of NATO were also at stake, Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the U.S. troop commitment on Feb. 13, President
Clinton stressed that this time _ in contrast to Bosnia _ the
Europeans would be providing the bulk of the NATO force. The U.S.
offer of 4,000 troops was only 15 percent of the deployment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 Marines from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit
based at Camp Lejeune, N.C., were poised this weekend on ships in
the Mediterranean to be among the first troops to land in Kosovo in
the event of a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding to allow Europe to do most of the work in Kosovo,
the administration is trying to ensure that it does not lose its
leverage. It is a new and at times seemingly uncomfortable
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington doesn't want to pay the bills but doesn't like
being the junior partner,'' said a NATO official of the military
plans for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, whose countries are most concerned about
waves of impoverished ethnic Albanian refugees flooding into
Western Europe if the fighting continues, has pledged hundreds of
millions of dollars in civil reconstruction money for Kosovo over
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The diminished role of U.S. troops will mean that a British
general will be the commander on the ground in Kosovo for the first
months of the peacekeeping operation. Thus, U.S. soldiers will have
to get accustomed to a non-American commander on the ground under
the authority of an American, Gen. Wesley Clark, who is the supreme
commander of NATO.

 &HT;    Democrats size up political chances in Georgia
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six seats in the House of Representatives separate
the Democrats from their fondest hopes for the 2000 election,
expressed on simple blue-and-white posters here at their
congressional campaign headquarters: ``Speaker Gephardt.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) is expected in Atlanta Monday for
three fund-raisers as the Democrats focus on races in Georgia that
could help them win control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.), chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, and Georgia's three Democratic
representatives, Sanford Bishop, John Lewis and Cynthia McKinney,
also are scheduled to attend the closed-door luncheon and two
private receptions later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Although Democrats, aided by organized labor, are expected to
pour more money and effort into promising districts in the
Northeast, upper Midwest, California and the Pacific Northwest,
they like their chances of adding a couple of seats in the South,
where Republicans have come to dominate congressional elections
after decades of Democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   Using public reaction against the Republican-led impeachment as
a fund-raising tool, the Democratic leaders will make clear why
they believe 2000 is the year to end Republican control of the
House and why they think Georgia Republicans Bob Barr, Saxby
Chambliss and Charlie Norwood are vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us good candidates and we'll win at least one of those
seats,'' said Mark Gersh, a consultant to the Democratic campaign
committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Gersh's refrain is familiar in Georgia. Democrats have
almost nowhere to go but up in terms of House seats in Georgia.
Before the 1992 election, they controlled nine out of 10.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-1995, they held just three of 11 (Georgia having gained a
seat after the 1990 census), and have been unable to win any back
in the past two elections.
</P>
<P>
   They vowed to field strong challengers to Norwood and Chambliss
in 1998, but did not, even though both men represent districts
President Clinton carried twice and where other statewide
Democratic candidates run well.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Chambliss and Norwood narrowly prevailed after
court-ordered redistricting left them with significantly new
constituencies. Chambliss represents Macon and a swath of counties
running south to the Florida line. Norwood's base is Augusta, Ga.,
but his district stretches west to the outer Atlanta suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say next year will be different. One reason is the
strong showing of Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia in the 1998
election. ``He showed us the way a centrist Democrat, with appeal
to the black community, can be successful,'' Gersh said.
</P>
<P>
   Black voters, overwhelmingly Democratic, made up nearly 30
percent of the electorate in 1998, and their support helped
Democrats to a surprisingly strong showing in a year in which
Republicans were counting on making strong gains.
</P>
<P>
   But Chambliss and Norwood received 62 percent and 60 percent of
the vote, respectively, in their districts, far more comfortable
victories than they recorded two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Those results persuade Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who has
done work for both men, that the congressmen will retain their
seats if they run again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just wishful thinking on the part of the Democrats,''
Ayres said. ``I don't see any particular problem for them, any
particular dislike.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rothenberg, a Washington political analyst who writes the
Rothenberg Political Report, said, ``I've heard over and over again
how these are targeted seats. The `out' party says this is going to
be the year we win these seats. After three cycles, I'm
skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg and Emory University political science professor
Merle Black said the Democrats could make a stronger showing in
Barr's 7th District, west and northwest of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, it ought to be a Republican district,'' Black said.
``But the way Barr has chosen to represent it is to emphasize
ideology at the expense of everything else. That is not the way to
expand your base of constituent support.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr is one of several House prosecutors in President Clinton's
impeachment trial whom Democrats would love to replace in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats point to Barr's relatively lackluster showing in 1998
against a little-known, poorly financed Democrat. While he won 55
percent of the vote, he carried Cobb County, located north of
Atlanta, by just 900 votes of 36,000 cast and Floyd County, with
its Rome population base, by 1,000 votes out of 21,000 cast.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's margins in the two largest population centers of his
district should entice a strong Democrat who can raise $800,000 to
$1 million into the race, Gersh said.
</P>
<P>
   An additional uncertainty in 2000 is the impact of the
presidential campaign on the congressional races. ``The image of
the parties will be defined by their presidential nominees,'' Ayres
said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has been hotly contested in the past two elections,
going for Clinton narrowly in 1992 and against him, also narrowly,
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, if he is the nominee, would enter with
the advantage of coming from neighboring Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But Black said it might be difficult for Democrats to repeat
their 1998 performance in 2000 if the Republican presidential
nominee is Texas Gov. George W. Bush or another GOP candidate who
can bridge the gaps between the party's various factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone with broad appeal would make it tough on Gore in
Georgia,'' Black said.

 &HT;    Terrapins playing in the zone
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to be Dick Vitale to know that No. 5 Maryland has
the talent to be a Final Four team. From Steve Francis, the
spectacular JUCO transfer, to sophomore Terence Morris, who might
be the most underrated player in college basketball, to Laron
Profit, the steady and dependable warrior, this could be the most
talented team in the country not named Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland (22-4, 10-3 ACC) has been ranked in the Top 10 for 15
consecutive weeks. The Terps have four victories over teams in the
Top 10: Stanford, UCLA and North Carolina twice. Their only losses
are twice to No. 1 Duke, at No. 6 Kentucky and at Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The only question being raised about the Terrapins as the NCAA
Tournament looms is whether they have the hearts and minds to be
champions. Today's game at Georgia Tech could go a long way toward
providing the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago Maryland looked like a team in trouble. The
Terps were caught napping against Wake Forest _ a team they had
beaten by 23 points on Dec. 3 _ and lost 85-72. Three days later,
they were crushed at Duke 95-77 in a game that
</P>
<P>
   wasn't that close.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the last half hour of the Feb. 9 practice, senior center
</P>
<P>
   Obinna Ekezie suffered a ruptured Achilles' tendon and was lost
for the year. With five games left in the regular season, the Terps
suddenly were without a pivotman who had started 105
</P>
<P>
   games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't change anything. That's the last thing you want to
do,'' coach Gary Williams said. ``The question then became, would
the others step up and compensate for Obinna?
</P>
<P>
   ``If so, I thought we had a chance to be okay.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams got his answer the next night at N.C. State. Maryland
held the Wolfpack to 12-of-47 shooting (25.5 percent), the worst in
school history, in a 63-50 victory. Told he had to pick up the
rebounding slack with Ekezie gone, Morris pulled down 16.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last Saturday against No. 14 North Carolina, Maryland
unleashed all of its talented fury. The smaller Terps blocked 14
shots and forced 25 turnovers, the most the Tar Heels had committed
in two years. Maryland won 81-64 and for the first time in nine
years, the Terps won both regular-season games against UNC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people wonder how we were going to respond,
and we wanted to send a message without Obinna,'' Profit said
afterwards. ``We wanted to be aggressive from the opening tip.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is pleased about, but wary of, these most recent
events. He has seen other teams have a temporary surge after losing
a key player. Invariably, those teams can't sustain the effort and
the hole in the lineup begins to show.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Sunday's game at Georgia Tech is so important.
Maryland has had an entire week to rest but also to lose the
adrenalin high from its reaction to Ekezie's injury. Georgia Tech's
front line of Alvin Jones (6-11) and Jason Collier (7-0) could
present problems now that Williams is starting freshman Lonny
Baxter (6-8, 260) at center.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets play reasonably well at home, as evidenced by
their 10-point lead over Duke before losing to the Blue Devils on
Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game is a major-league test to see if Maryland really
has the right stuff to overcome the loss of Ezekie and make a
serious run in the NCAA Tournment, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're a team that has the luxury of playing
average,'' said Williams, in his 10th year in College Park. ``When
we play our game, we can play with anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to do this the rest of the year.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyer Johnnie Cochran joined the Rev. Al Sharpton
Saturday morning at a rally in Harlem, vowing to seek justice in
court for the family of Amadou Diallo, the West African street
peddler slain by four New York police officers, and for the broader
black population.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran said he was assembling a legal team similar to the one
that won acquittal for O.J. Simpson, and that it would include a
``community lawyer.'' He offered no specifics about his plan for a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the police accountable?'' Cochran asked the crowd of about
400 gathered in the auditorium of Sharpton's National Action
Network for the two-hour rally, which was also broadcast on radio
station WWRL-1600 AM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are these four going to be held responsible and accountable?
The police are not above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   With people in the crowd wearing buttons with faces of people
shot by the police, several Latino politicians recalled Anthony
Baez, killed by officers in 1994 after a confrontation that began
over a game of street football, and Luis Baez, a mentally disturbed
man, unrelated to Anthony Baez, who died in 1979 in a hail of 24
bullets fired by five officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is safe,'' said U.S. Rep. Jose E. Serrano, D-N.Y., of
the Bronx. ``I used to worry only, as a congressman, about the
local mugger. I am worried more now about the local police than I
am about the local mugger.''
</P>
<P>
   Serrano noted that he was now the ranking Democrat on the
appropriations subcommittee that handled funding for the Justice
Department, and said he would try to hold up funds if he was
unsatisfied with the federal role in investigating the Diallo case.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran spoke of his recent visit to the Wheeler Avenue
apartment building in the Soundview section of the Bronx where
Diallo, 22, lived and was shot at 41 times in the vestibule on Feb.
4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is such a small area, it is a death chamber,'' Cochran
said. ``He couldn't go anywhere. You would not shoot an animal in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, who returned Thursday from Diallo's funeral in Guinea,
called the shooting ``an international disgrace'' and led the crowd
in chants of ``No justice, no peace,'' and ``Amadou, Amadou,
Amadou.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This young man, Amadou, represents to us, in our judgment, the
test case in whether or not judicial procedures in this country are
for everyone,'' Sharpton said. ``There's more on trial here than
four police. The U.S. itself is on trial before the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The four officers, Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon
and Richard Murphy, have turned in their guns and are on
administrative duty. A grand jury in the Bronx has been convened to
consider the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said daily vigils at the Bronx courthouse where the
grand jury meets will continue, with a larger rally there scheduled
for Wednesday. Demonstrators are also planning to rally Sunday
afternoon at White Plains Road and East Tremont in the Bronx, and
Monday in front of City Hall.

-- A traffic officer in Conakry, Guinea, minds a crossing near
Niger Market. The police presence in this West African country is
constant and sometimes brutal, but rarely deadly, which is a reason
the news of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed Guinean immigrant shot to

-- A drug-smuggling suspect shows how heroin is prepared for
couriers -- usually young women who are dirt poor -- who swallow
it, packed into pellets made from the fingers of surgical gloves.
Known on the streets and by federal agents as swallowers, the women
have become an important link in the heroin trafficking chain that

-- Customs agents at Kennedy International Airport use a body
scanner, instead of a pat-down, to detect drugs concealed inside of
clothing. Federal agents have expanded their operations at the
airports in their ever-evolving cat-and-mouse game with traffickers
-- one that now largely pivots on catching the couriers who smuggle
heroin in their luggage, under their clothing and, increasingly,
inside their stomachs. (Librado Romero/New York Times Photo)

fixed income, Ms. Smith has seen her spirits sag, her finances
falter, and her blood pressure medication double. ``It's been a
disaster!'' she says. (Nicole Bengiveno/New York Times Photo)

 &HT;    Turmoil in Lions' front office only part of problem
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ His nickname is ``Boss'' and, indeed, former
Georgia Tech coach Bobby Ross remains very much the man in charge
of the Detroit Lions. To keep his job, though, Ross had to
short-circuit a quiet insurrection in December that, if successful,
would have resulted in his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The story, which can now be told in more detail: Hoping to
reshape the front office, Lions vice chairman Bill Ford Jr. sought
to hire Fox television analyst Matt Millen for a high-profile
management position. When Ross caught wind of that proposed move,
he went to chairman and owner William Clay Ford and told him he
would quit if Millen was brought in to run the football operation.
</P>
<P>
   Millen, who considered the possibility for about two weeks,
actually had conversations with San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci,
whose future with the 49ers was uncertain at that time, about
succeeding Ross. The coup disintegrated, however, when the elder
Ford sided with Ross and Millen opted to stay in the television
booth. Ross, who is here for the NFL combine workouts, won't
discuss the events but it is no secret that he and general manager
Chuck Schmidt remain bitter about them.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the power struggle behind them, the Lions have myriad
problems, not the least of which is that tailback Barry Sanders
continues to think about retirement.
</P>
<P>
   On bended knee
</P>
<P>
   After two months on the banquet circuit, Heisman trophy winner
Ricky Williams came here at 244 pounds, 20 pounds over his 1998
playing weight, and begging to be selected by Cleveland with the
first pick in the draft. ``When I meet with (Browns officials),
I'll be on my knees,'' the Texas tailback said. ``I'll pray and
I'll beg.'' The puffy Williams didn't even stick around, however,
for the physical exam and blew off all the on-field workouts. He
will not have an on-campus workout for scouts but allowed he'll
consider a private session for the Browns. Team officials remain
split over what to do with the first pick. President Carmen Policy
is sold on quarterback Tim Couch and director of operations Dwight
Clark is leaning to Williams. The tiebreaker will be coach Chris
Palmer and, given his background with the passing game, Couch is
the likely selection.
</P>
<P>
   On wounded knee
</P>
<P>
   The most compelling evidence that former Georgia star Robert
Edwards will never play again came last Tuesday morning. At a
meeting of the league's finance and expansion committees in an
Atlanta hotel, New England owner Robert Kraft asked his colleagues
to award him compensation _ an extra draft pick at the end of the
first round _ for the loss of Edwards. He also sought salary-cap
relief on Edwards' contract. The request will be considered at the
annual league meetings next month, but Kraft has little hope of
success. Oakland got no such relief last year after second-round
choice Leon Bender died following a seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Combine stuff
</P>
<P>
   Florida offensive tackle Zach Piller helped himself Friday when
he did 40 repetitions in the 225-pound bench press, best for any of
the linemen. ... Offensive tackle looks to be one of the few strong
areas of the draft with John Tait (Brigham Young), Kris Farris
(UCLA), Matt Stinchcomb (Georgia), Lonnie Shelton (Eastern
Michigan), Solomon Page (West Virginia), Chris Terry (Georgia),
Aaron Gibson (Wisconsin) and Floyd Wedderburn (Penn State) all
first-round possibilities. ... Stock of Miami tailback Edgerrin
James is on the rise, and he rates second only to Williams at his
position. Like the Heisman winner, James sports dreadlocks and was
upset Friday when someone mistook him for Williams. ... In an
effort to improve draft chances, Missouri quarterback Corby Jones
also will work out at running back. ... Scouts are anxious to see
the workout of Fort Valley State defensive lineman/linebacker Peppi
Zellner, a physical specimen who is raw as a player. ... Syracuse
star Rob Konrad clearly is the top prospect at fullback, and the
dropoff after him is a big one.
</P>
<P>
   Oversized cap
</P>
<P>
   Last week provided a graphic reminder of how big an advantage
the Cleveland Browns, with about $30 million of salary cap room,
have over the rest of the league. Cleveland signed four top-shelf
unrestricted free agents _ center Dave Wohlabaugh, offensive tackle
Orlando Brown, cornerback Corey Fuller and punter Chris Gardocki _
in a span of three days. The Browns doled out $18.2 million in
signing bonuses and the quartet will earn total compensation of
$21.73 million in 1999. The signings, however, put a dent of just
$6.63 million in the Browns' cap total. The upshot: Until owner Al
Lerner stops the flow of upfront money, the Browns can outbid any
team for a player they really want.
</P>
<P>
   Northern exposure
</P>
<P>
   Colts president Bill Polian, former general manager in Carolina,
continues to acquire players from the Panthers' inaugural draft
class. Indianapolis now has three players _ defensive end Shawn
King, corner Tyrone Poole and strong safety Chad Cota _ selected by
Carolina in '95. Only center Frank Garcia remains with the Panthers
from that draft, in which Carolina chose 11 players.
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s)
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame tailback Walter Payton on the 10,000 pieces of mail
he received in the six days after he announced he needed a liver
transplant: ''If I had been a jerk, people might have felt sorry
for me, but there wouldn't have been this outpouring.''

VICAR IS FASTEST OF A SLOW BUNCH IN FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ A herd of 3-year-old colts ran the slowest
Fountain of Youth Stakes in 36 years Saturday, raising more
questions than they answered about their pathways to the Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   And they finished the Fountain in the same tight way they
started it: Vicar first by a neck over Cat Thief, and Certain
three-quarters of a length back in third.
</P>
<P>
   All three colts are booked for a return match in the Florida
Derby on the same Gulfstream Park track on March 13, the final
flourish in Florida for horses bound for Kentucky. But while all
three probably gained some experience from the Fountain of Youth,
none of them ran a rocket race, and the issue remained wide open:
Who is the ranking 3-year-old horse in the East?
</P>
<P>
   ``We at least found out that this horse wants to be a race
horse,'' said Carl Nafzger, who trains Vicar for James Tafel, a
retired book publisher from Illinois. He also trained Unbridled to
victory in the 1990 Kentucky Derby. ``But there were six or seven
horses in the race who will be on the Derby trail, and they'll all
get better.''
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas, the trainer of Cat Thief, lost his other
Kentucky Derby hopeful this week when Cape Canaveral injured his
right front shin. But Lukas, nurturing Cat Thief as his ace in the
hole, said: ``He ran an excellent race, just what I wanted to see
from him. He hung tough in the stretch, and I think he'll continue
to improve. The Florida Derby is definitely next.''
</P>
<P>
   And Leo Azpurua, the trainer of Certain, echoed the sentiments
when he said: ``I couldn't be happier with his performance and
effort. If everything goes right, he'll be back in the Florida
Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner ran the mile in 1:38 4/5 and the mile and sixteenth
in 1:45 3/5 on a dry, fast track that did not produce fast times.
In fact, he did not come within 5 seconds of the track record. But
the top three came within one length of each other, leaving the
impression that their story was yet to be told.
</P>
<P>
   Vicar, who ran fifth in the Holy Bull Stakes at Gulfstream Park
last month after running into a pack of trouble on a wet track, has
won three of his five starts and gained ground in the Triple Crown
standings. In his only other loss, he ran second last November in
the Kentucky Jockey Club Cup to Exploit, the nominal leader of
California's Derby candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief, a seasoned runner from the Lukas stable, ran third in
the Hutcheson Stakes three weeks ago and has run in the money in
eight of his nine races. Certain came to the end of a four-race
winning streak Saturday, but has run in the money in all six of his
starts. And behind them came a flock of contenders: Grits'n Hard
Toast, Successful Appeal, Legal Street, The Groom is Red, Casanova
Star, Aly's Alley and one of the favorites, Doneraile Court, who
ran last under Jerry Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to think,'' said Nick Zito, who saddled The
Groom Is Red (seventh) and Doneraile Court (10th). ``The Groom Is
Red ran well enough to earn a shot back in the Florida Derby. But I
don't know about Doneraile Court. We tried something different with
him; we took him back. It didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The race followed a strict script. Vicar, breaking from the No.
3 post under Shane Sellers, stepped in front at the start and
stayed there. Cat Thief, with Pat Day riding, broke from No. 7 and
quickly challenged for the lead. Certain, under Kent Desormeaux,
was third after 400 yards and, after giving a little ground to
Doneraile Court in the middle stages of the race, reclaimed third
place in the homestretch. And they were still there as they raced
past the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Vicar paid $11.20 for a $2 bet to win and went home with
$120,000.

FERTILITY (Phoenix) _ The ultrasound screen showed one tiny life in
Cathy Cimoch's uterus. Then two, three and four. Her husband became
silent as the reality sank in: Soon, they would become parents of
quadruplets. But the real shock hit them a few moments later. She
and her husband faced an agonizing choice they never knew they'd
have to make: End some of the lives they had sought so hard to
conceive, or have Cathy undergo a harrowing, potentially dangerous
pregnancy that could result in premature children with lifelong
disabilities. By MAUREEN WEST. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WEBCAM _ There's a high-tech peephole into Pirkko Essen's kitchen
near Stockholm, Sweden. Fire up your computer and you can see her
teen-age children staring longingly at the devil's food cake she
baked Monday. Closer to home, you can get a pretty good view into
the Chandler computer room of Steve and Connie Fannon. In an
intriguing phenomenon sweeping the Internet, people like the Essen
family are broadcasting fragments of their lives into cyberspace
using digital cameras that cost as little as $59. By JONATHAN
SIDENER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GUARD-TURKEY _ Somewhere along the Turkish border, 26,000 feet
above ground, Copperheads from Arizona are fueling the military
campaign against Saddam Hussein. Since the Gulf War ended eight
years ago, Air National Guard members with the 161st Refueling Wing
have been helping patrol the skies of Iraq. Three hundred men and
women, mostly from Arizona, leave behind families and civilian jobs
to serve three-week tours. They are not just pilots and navigators,
but maintenance crews, intelligence officers and others. By DENNIS
WAGNER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) _ Her obituary in the Feb. 15 ``Arizona

RUDD ADAPTS TO REGULATION CHANGES, CAPTURES CUP POLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKINGHAM, N.C. _ For some NASCAR regulars, the 1999 Winston
Cup season did not begin with last Sunday's Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   For Ricky Rudd, the real season shifts into gear today at North
Carolina Speedway with the Dura Lube/Big K 400. It is the first of
30 Cup races to be run without carburetor restrictor plates, on the
first of the ``downforce tracks'' that place a premium on handling
over horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I don't think we got started at Daytona,'' said
Rudd, who finished 30th at the 2.5-mile Daytona International
Speedway in a disabled car after getting swept up in a 12-car
restrictor-plate wreck. ``We're just beginning right here, it looks
like.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd celebrated his escape from Daytona, where eventual
race-winner Jeff Gordon nearly drove up his tailpipe while passing
Rusty Wallace for the lead, by bagging the pole position for
today's race. Rudd toured the 1.017-mile oval in 23.284
seconds/157.241 mph for the 24th pole of his career but first since
Oct. 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   That was 101 races ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even remember the last time I won a pole,'' said Rudd,
owner/driver of the No. 10 Tide Ford Taurus. ``Going into today, we
weren't good until the final 10 minutes of practice, and we ended
up third-fastest on the speed charts. I was just hoping and praying
I could duplicate that lap, just to get back to third because our
season hasn't started real well. I really didn't expect a pole lap
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, who is running engines supplied by Larry Wallace of
Penske-Kranefuss Racing, failed to better Mark Martin's track
qualifying record of 157.885 mph set on Feb. 21, 1997. But Rudd had
enough steam to knock Jeff Burton (157.180 mph) off the pole and
withstand Gordon's run (157.167) late in the one-lap session. Rudd,
who has won at least one Cup race for 16 consecutive seasons, and
Burton will occupy the front row when the 43-car field takes the
green flag for 393 laps at 11:30 a.m. CST.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the Daytona 500 pole- and race-winner, will start third
and be joined in Row 2 by Jeremy Mayfield (157.018). Mark Martin
(156.931) qualified fifth and will be joined in Row 3 by Wallace
(156.904). Rounding out the top 10 are Mike Skinner (156.864),
Brett Bodine (156.689), Bobby Labonte (156.676) and John Andretti
(156.649).
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying was reduced to one hot lap yesterday after rain
washed out Friday's scheduled two-lap session.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ``The Rock's'' traditionally abrasive and
tire-chewing surface, teams will be faced with a revised set of
aerodynamic regulations for the first time this season. Gone are
the ``5-and-5'' regulations governing rear-spoiler height and
front-air-dam ground clearance instituted at the beginning of last
year. NASCAR officials had hoped that package would reduce speeds
by making the cars less stable through the corners, theoretically
forcing the drivers to lift off the accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   But the 5-and-5 package not only made the cars less stable, it
also made them almost impossible to run side by side. After a
series of driver complaints and miles of single-file racing, NASCAR
revised the aero package for the season-ending NAPA 500 at Atlanta
Motor Speedway in November. Those specifications, with only a
slight modification, will be in effect today and until further
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Tauruses, like Rudd's and Burton's, will compete with a
rear spoiler 6.25 inches high and 55 inches wide. Chevrolet Monte
Carlos, like Gordon's, will run a rear spoiler that is 6.50 high
and 57 wide. Pontiac Grand Prixs, like those qualified by Labonte
and Andretti, are running with rear spoilers 6.875 high and 57
wide.
</P>
<P>
   In a switch, NASCAR is not requiring a specific rear-spoiler
angle. Last year at AMS, it was 65 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, front air dams on all makes of cars are required to
have a ground clearance of 3.5 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me, the rear spoiler and the air dam has a huge part on
how the handling is,'' said Wallace, driver of the No. 2 Miller
Lite Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have the spoiler back on the car, it's gonna make
for good racing with a lot more people in the mix,'' said Dale
Jarrett, who will start 11th in the No. 88 Quality Care/Ford Credit
Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona 500 runner-up Dale Earnhardt also is forecasting better
racing with the bigger rear blade directing more air _ and creating
more downforce _ on the rear deck lid of the cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tire wear should be better, and I think you're going to see
some side-by-side racing,'' said Earnhardt, who will start 18th in
the No. 3 GM Goodwrench Service Plus Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, winner of a record-tying 13 races last year, said this
race will begin to sort out the title contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the guys you see run well here _ not just here but the
next couple of races _ are really the ones who will be a threat for
the championship,'' said Gordon, winner of both events here last
year in the No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevy. ``Every race
is important, but I think the downforce tracks are the ones that
are really important.''

BURTON, MARTIN FINISH 1-2 IN ALLTELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKINGHAM, N.C. _ The mutual admiration Roush Racing teammates
Jeff Burton and Mark Martin share in NASCAR's Winston Cup Series
has spilled over to the Busch Grand National ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Burton and Martin teamed to carve their way from near the rear
of the 43-car field to a 1-2 sweep in the Alltell 200 at North
Carolina Speedway yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The field was set according to 1998 points after rain washed out
qualifying on Friday. That relegated Burton to the 30th starting
spot, two ahead of Martin, a three-time winner of this event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fortunate part of being a bad qualifier,'' said Burton,
driver of the No. 9 Track Gear Ford Taurus, ``is you learn how to
pass a lot of people. I don't get freaked out about where we start.
It sounds silly, but I've gained a lot of experience by starting in
the back in Winston Cup. Those things pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roush twins began to assert themselves beginning on lap 126
of the 197-lapper, when Burton passed defending race champion Matt
Kenseth. With the exception of lap 155 _ led by Martin _ Burton
paced his teammate and the field home the remainder of the
distance. The winning margin in Burton's 10th career BGN victory
was 2.647 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying hard to live up to the reputation that Mark Martin
has made in Busch Grand National racing,'' Burton said of his
mentor, the series' winningest driver with 34 victories. ``I have
to run so well in my Busch car because Mark runs so good in his.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said his charge to the front was hampered by a
backstretch pit stall, but even that excuse was a bit lame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet we couldn't beat Jeff anyway, but it kind of took our
chance away of having a shot there,'' said Martin, driver of the
No. 60 Winn Dixie Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Burton and Martin's BGN teams are housed in the same shop in
Mooresville, N.C., but separate from their Cup garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team I've got and the team Mark has got is really good,''
said Burton, who averaged 108.599 mph in a race slowed six times by
caution flags. ``They prepare these teams with the intent of
leading every lap and winning every race. That's the mind-set, and
they're good enough to convince the drivers they can do that. I'm
real proud to finish 1-2, starting 30th and 32nd. That says a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Third-place Kenseth led four times for a race-high 108 laps
around the 1.017-mile oval, but none after lap 125.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dominated the first half of the race, but that was the
wrong half to dominate,'' said Kenseth, who started second in the
No. 17 DeWalt Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``The first half of the race
was good, but when Mark and Burton and Randy \RLaJoie\S and all
those guys got their adjustments, they were a little better than
us. I didn't know what else to do to the car. It just didn't have
the grip that we needed to pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth was followed by LaJoie, a two-time series champion, and
18-year-old rookie Casey Atwood, whose car flipped and
barrel-rolled in the late stages of last Saturday's NAPA Auto Parts
300 at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   Reigning series champion Dale Earnhardt Jr. started on the pole
but finished 35th after he was tagged in a five-car accident in
Turn 4. Little E., who was credited with completing 126 laps, is
17th in points.
GORDON STREAKING
</P>
<P>
   Defending Dura Lube/Big Kmart 400 race champion Jeff Gordon will
start a very confident third today in search of his fourth
consecutive victory over two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has won four of the past eight races at The Rock,
including both events in 1998. Gordon scored his 12th victory of
1998 in the ACDelco 400 on Nov. 1, and locked up his third Cup
championship in the process. Gordon closed the 1998 season at
Atlanta Motor Speedway with his record-tying 13th victory on Nov. 8
and won the season-opener at Daytona last Sunday to stretch his
streak to three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon attempted to downplay his lastest series domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like last season was last season,'' said Gordon, driver
of the No. 24 DuPont Automotive Refinishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
``I feel very good about this racetrack because the last two times
we've been here, we've been very strong _ and we won. But I don't
know about the four-in-a-row thing. We're just trying to put
together a good string of runs.''
JARRETT STUCK IN SECOND
</P>
<P>
   Perennial championship contender Dale Jarrett is winless in 23
Cup starts at Rockingham but has finished second in five of the
past six races here.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett will start 11th after hot lapping at 156.595 mph
yesterday. He is 36th in points after finishing 37th in the Daytona
500, where he was swept up in a 12-car wreck. Jarrett trails Gordon
by 123 points after the first of 34 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave him a 100-point lead on us,'' said Jarrett, driver of
the No. 88 Quality Care Service/Ford Credit Taurus. ``But as I look
at it, it's only 3 1/2 points per race that I've got to make up on
Gordon, so we can catch him. We have finished second five out of
six races here with this team, so it would be nice to get into
Victory Lane.''
LAST WORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to race these guys again. You don't have to hit each
other. You can still race clean. That's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Randy LaJoie, Busch Grand National points leader, after
finishing fourth at The Rock

`THE SWAP' STILL HAUNTING MAVERICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week marked the two-year anniversary of the largest trade
in NBA history, the nine-player deal in which the Mavericks sent
Sam Cassell, Jim Jackson, George McCloud, Chris Gatling and Eric
Montross to the Nets for Robert Pack, Khalid Reeves, Ed O'Bannon
and Shawn Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as it was then, the swap is a disaster for the Mavericks
and general manager Don Nelson. After just 10 days on the job,
Nelson traded away his starting five for Pack and Bradley, labeling
them ``our point guard and center cornerstones of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, but those cornerstones come off the bench for a
1-7 team that would likely get beat in a seven-game series by the
five players Nelson traded on Feb. 17, 1997. While O'Bannon and
Reeves were released, the Nets start Cassell, give major minutes to
Gatling and parlayed Montross and Jackson into landing Keith Van
Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has 868 wins as an NBA coach and 36 years of experience
as a player, coach and GM. But he also owns a 17-57 record as
Mavericks head coach, better than only Quinn Buckner and Gar Heard.
Jim Cleamons, the coach he fired, was 28-70.
</P>
<P>
   With Nelson in control, the Mavericks have more organizational
stability than at any time in franchise history. They also,
however, have a coach/GM whose hyperbole is the only thing worse
than his transactions:
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 7, 1997: ``I have no intentions of coaching ever again. I'm
finished.'' Less than 10 months on the job as GM, Nelson fires
Cleamons and returns to coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 17, 1997: ``We got our point guard and center cornerstones
of the future.'' The foundation of Dallas' second unit, Bradley and
Pack combine to average only 14 points and 39 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
   June 25, 1997: ``He'll be the best running big man in the NBA.''
So maybe Chris Anstey should run on Nelson's track team, because
the team's '97 No. 1 draft pick is playing only eight minutes per
game on his basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 18, 1997: ``He's my kind of player. He's the real deal.''
Despite having only 28 games of NBA experience, Erick Strickland
gets a four-year, $14 million contract from Nelson. He averages 4.2
points, 1.8 rebounds and 0.8 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 13, 1999: ``I'd be surprised if he doesn't win Rookie of
the Year. He's got skills that could revolutionize the game, and
we're going to be playing him an awful lot.'' Two weeks into the
season, 20-year-old Dirk Nowitzki averages 8.8 points, 4.8 rebounds
and sat out the entire fourth quarter in consecutive losses to the
Grizzlies and Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 26, 1999: ``I'm not going to put a number on our wins, but
I'll promise we'll play an up-tempo, high-scoring style that is fun
to watch.'' During their 1-7 start, the Mavericks broke 100 just
once and averaged only 90 points per game.
SPOTLIGHT ON ...
IMMENSELY TALENTED LAKERS STILL LACKING MATURITY TO WIN TITLE
</P>
<P>
   Perfect example of why the Lakers aren't mature enough to win a
championship:
</P>
<P>
   Leading the Nuggets by two points in the final minute, guard
Kobe Bryant waves off his teammates for an isolation against
Denver's Bryant Stith. He blows by Stith, elevates and drops in a
soft bank-shot with a foul to seal the win with fist-pumping
theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   The problem? When Bryant made his move, there was :16 left on
the shot clock and :23 in the game. Lacking the savvy to match
their immense talent, that's where veteran guard Derek Harper was
supposed to step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so much physical skills that we fool ourselves,''
Harper said. ``We need to sacrifice a few highlights for the good
of the basketball team, but we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Added forward Rick Fox: ``We haven't matured one bit from last
season. We lose some games to veteran teams before we leave the
locker room because mentally we lag way behind.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS AROUND THE EAST
</P>
<P>
   There's trouble in Detroit, where a 3-0 start has quickly turned
into back-biting among Grant Hill, Jerry Stackhouse and Bison Dele.
Hill constantly rides Dele for a lack of effort, and last week
Stackhouse basically called Hill a ball hog. ``Grant's been scoring
a lot for our team, but I don't think that's exactly what our team
needs,'' Stackhouse said. ``If you're coming down the court and you
haven't touched the ball the last two or three times down, it's
hard to go down and chase a guy and do all the little things you
have to do. I want the ball more.''. ... Just 13 days after signing
a contract extension worth $70.9 million, Cavaliers center Zydrunas
Ilgauskas broke his left foot and will miss the season. ``I must
have killed somebody in a past life,'' he said. ... Hornets coach
Dave Cowens says he doesn't plan to coach next season in Charlotte
without a contract extension, and he doesn't expect to get one.
Cowens has won 50-plus games each of the past two seasons and is
the lowest-paid head coach at just under $700,000 this season. On
top of that, the team lost Vlade Divac and Matt Geiger in free
agency, lost Anthony Mason to a preseason injury and has yet to
suit up star Glen Rice. ``It's just about feeling appreciated,''
Cowens said. ``I'm underpaid and underappreciated.''
AROUND THE WEST
</P>
<P>
   Attention fans of the Clippers, Nuggets and Mavericks _ both of
you: The top four lottery picks should be Duke power forward Elton
Brand, Maryland guard Steve Francis, Connecticut shooting guard
Richard Hamilton and Rhode Island small forward Lamar Odom. ...
It's not yet a sophomore jinx, but Spurs center Tim Duncan is
struggling with aggressive double-teams coming at him in the low
post. ``Tim is just going to have to figure it out,'' said Spurs
coach Gregg Popovich. ``He's holding the ball too long and
everybody on every planet in the universe knows that everybody is
going to come.'' ... Warriors rookie Antawn Jamison had a horrible
start, averaging 13.8 minutes and 4.7 points on 26.8 percent
shooting through six games. ``Honestly, there were times on the
court where I was holding back crying,'' said Jamison, who scored
21 points, hit 7 of 8 shots, grabbed 11 rebounds and tipped in the
game-winning basket with four seconds left against Minnesota last
week. ... Suns guard Jason Kidd had two triple-doubles in three
nights last week, and two quarters to remember. In the third
quarter against the Nuggets, he scored 10 points, grabbed six
rebounds and dished out five assists. In the fourth quarter against
the Spurs, he either scored or assisted on each of the Suns' eight
field goals, and he had a hand in all but two of their 22 points in
the quarter.
INSIDE THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   Bad news for Bulls fans, the Class of '96 is disappearing faster
than David Copperfield's assistants. The Mavericks apparently won't
sign Samaki Walker to a contract extension before the March 13
deadline, but six other players from that draft crop already have.
Chicago is saving its salary-cap money for free-agent runs at
players who won't be available. A look at the players who have
signed the maximum six-year, $70.9 million extension:

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chris Rawlings was a boyish-looking 30-year-old
with a lot of flash, but oh, how he could sell the adult's dream of
fast, hard, cold cash.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of what federal investigators are calling a
$19million ``fraudulent telemarketing boiler room'' operation run
from Calabasas in northwest Los Angeles County to West Los Angeles,
Rawlings and a small circle of associates took in up to $50,000 a
day in checks from the elderly, retirees and others across the
country to support a glamorous lifestyle built around leased or
purchased upscale homes, foreign cars, expensive jewelry and fancy
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings wasn't always the one in charge as the cadre moved from
offshore Florida gambling ventures to Hollywood movies and even
into cosmetic sales, though he's named as an equal partner in four
firms in federal indictments.
</P>
<P>
   But Rawlings was the one who could make them all believe _ in
him and in the companies' promises, those who knew him told the
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Feb. 8, coming home from a run to the market for
diapers, words apparently failed the ``super salesman'' in a
confrontation with two men in the garage of his home in suburban
Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was the fancy Bentley and expensive Rolex watch that
caught two robbers' attention and led them to his home, or a
premeditated attack for business reasons, Rawlings was beaten,
stuffed into the car's trunk and critically injured when he was
thrown from the vehicle when it crashed following a high-speed
police pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   He died two days later.
</P>
<P>
   The assailants remain at large, but LAPD detectives and federal
authorities have begun to unravel Rawlings' complex business
dealings in the days since the salesman's death.
</P>
<P>
   In numerous interviews and company documents obtained by the
Daily News, a picture of those dealings has emerged _ dealings
federal authorities now say were built on criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   To those who knew Rawlings and did business with him, the
revelations have come as a shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just such a super salesman,'' said David Hackman, a
Vail, Colo., condo complex manager who invested more than $50,000
in several deals solely on the force of Rawlings' personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always seemed to know what he was doing, that he was the
kind of person who could get things done. He'd present a project
and say, You're going to make some serious money, and so am I.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after an offshore Florida casino deal offered by Woodland
Hills-based Coastal Gaming shut down in June 1997 and Hackman lost
most of his investment, he remained so confident in Rawlings that
he invested about $25,000 in Calabasas-based Hollywood Films Inc.
to finance a movie on the salesman's advice. He never got the
promised return on that deal either.
</P>
<P>
   Hackman said he just couldn't bring himself to believe the young
man who had spent so much time on the phone with him and had seemed
so sincere reminiscing about boyhood ski trips to Vail could steer
him wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He invested another $25,000 in West Los Angeles-based Skyline
Entertainment Financing IV, ostensibly to fund several more movies.
That firm is among those listed in federal documents as part of the
alleged telemarketing scam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just liked him,'' Hackman said. ``Whether or not he was
doing something I didn't know about, I still liked him. We talked
about everything and anything. It was a guy talking type of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors often said they came away from a deal feeling that way
_ like they'd just written a check to a friend of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings was a legend among the telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   His pep rallies could have come straight out of his days at
Crespi High School in the upscale suburb of Encino where he starred
in football and teammates remember him as the smallest player at 5
feet 7 inches with the greatest desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone towered over him, but what was quintessential about
Chris was the size of his heart,'' said former Crespi running back
J.J. Lasley, 29, who now lives in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made up for his size or lack of ability was his will to
be there on the field. He got knocked down a lot, but he got up
every time and earned respect. He had this gumption to get up and
get things done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was going to stop Chris from being successful.''
</P>
<P>
   At the office, Rawling would get his team of a half-dozen or so
telemarketers so energized that they'd ``smile and dial'' with an
upbeat gusto that hooked investors. Some of the telemarketers were
paid $4,000 or more a week, according to company records.
</P>
<P>
   The sales force would even joke about their frequent investors,
calling them ``mooches,'' and even crafted scripts, called the
``moochy close,'' aimed specifically at them.
</P>
<P>
   If customers bit at all, Rawlings was among the star executives
who jumped on the phone to reel them in. Some sent $70,000 or more,
even dipping into their IRAs or other retirement funds on the
promise they could double their money _ or better, records show.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Last May, Rawlings told salespeople he would be closing all the
deals at their new start-up cosmetic company, International
Cosmetics, because they lacked the experience, federal documents
state.
</P>
<P>
   He would tell the salespeople, ``Get straight to the money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rawlings, a former Marine, also had a hard streak and when
pushed could take a tough-guy stance.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings' attorney, Gary Fidler of Woodland Hills, said he saw
that side when Rawlings filed a lawsuit against his Malibu
landlord, claiming the oceanfront home he was leasing at the time
was unsafe, among other allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he filed the lawsuit, he said he didn't care what it
took, that he'd get the guy, he'd make him pay for what he did to
his wife and kids,'' Fidler said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when the matter went to court, Rawlings backed down. The
case he'd vowed to fight on principle was settled instead in a
``very gentlemanly'' manner as a misunderstanding, Fidler said. The
men shook hands in a hallway with no exchange of money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what that told me was that Chris talked big, and
didn't really follow through.''
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings was cocky but also naive, Fidler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the feeling he might have had some early business
success, and that he felt he was good at what he did and that he'd
always make money,'' he said. ``He felt very good about himself,
like he had the world at his feet. Yet, in a lot of ways, I thought
he was immature. There was something that bothered me about him,
like he was someone who would make a lot of money, then lose it,
then make it all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Money, and what it could buy, was always central to Rawlings,
friends and former employees said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Keiling, 29, was Rawling's best friend in high school,
after the two had grown up together in Westlake Village northwest
of Los Angeles and attended St. Jude's Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He attracted lots of friends because he was so outgoing, and
he always had rich tastes. He liked to play around in the (San
Fernando) valley and drive nice cars,'' Keiling said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Lasley: ``Chris was very charismatic. He had the gift of
gab and women loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   Crespi classmates remember his panache.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman, for instance, he wore a white tuxedo to a formal
dance to upstage the juniors and seniors.
</P>
<P>
   He loved the best cars, the finest clothes and the money to
lavish gifts on family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall he convinced his favorite fashion consultant to leave
his job at Bachrachs for a share in a new store, Gentleman's
Quarters in Woodland Hills. Rawlings decked out the place with
stylish furniture, a wine and cappuccino bar, and a pedicurist.
</P>
<P>
   The racks were stocked with $1,000 Italian and domestic suits,
and equally expensive shirts, sweaters and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   For himself, Rawlings preferred Andrew Fezza virgin wool suits
in distinguished, understated blues, grays and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved the way they felt and draped on him,'' said Rodney
Leonard, his partner.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the same attention to his leased white Bentley. The car
had to be spotless and gleaming, which meant a top-to-bottom
cleaning two or three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when he first got the Bentley. He drove that car
every day. Everybody used to say wow,'' said Stan Wueshcher, an
employee at Distinctive Detailing in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings was intent on upgrading the car with a $15,000
navigational and security system, talking about it just days before
his death.
</P>
<P>
   He liked jewelry, too.
</P>
<P>
   Former acquaintances remember the delight he took in going to
Tiffany's to buy diamonds for his wife, Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in mourning, Rawlings' relatives declined to comment for
this story on the advice of their attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings' tastes weren't all rarefied. He liked his Coca-Cola
during the day, a 40-ounce Old English malt liquor at night,
Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   He could be ``really down to earth and would just hang out with
the guys'' while he waited for his Bentley to be polished,
Wueshcher recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the reaction to his death was, ``How could this happen
to such a nice guy?''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his death, details of Rawlings' business dealings
emerged in a federal affidavit linking Rawlings and three business
associates, John Charles Watson, Peter Aro and Scott Courtney, to a
series of alleged telemarketing scams.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of trouble came in November, when, following an
eight-month FBI investigation, Aro and Courtney were indicted on
mail fraud, in connection with a gaming scam that began in April
1996. The Woodland Hills company, Coastal Gaming Inc., mostly
targeted the elderly offering shares in a Florida offshore casino,
the Dixie Duck, federal documents show.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Investors lost approximately $5 million as a result of
fraudulent misrepresentations made to investors concerning the
profitability of the investment in casino boats,'' the documents
state.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney was arrested and is free on bail pending trial. He
could not be reached for comment. An arrest warrant has been issued
for Aro, who is missing.
</P>
<P>
   Hackman, one of the investors, said Rawlings talked up the
Florida deal and convinced him to join the 280-investor group that
financed the 100-foot floating casino, which operated briefly off
the Key West coast. Rawlings was not named in the Coastal Gaming
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and former employees said Rawlings was intrigued with
gambling, taking frequent trips to Las Vegas. After the Dixie Duck
was forced into dry dock, investors said he often would talk about
getting back into gaming.
</P>
<P>
   The Coastal Gaming investigation, however, led to companies
involving Rawlings that were each set up to raise between $3
million and $6 million, records show.
</P>
<P>
   WRI Holdings was promoting investment in unreleased recordings
by Marvin Gaye and the Beatles; UST&AMP;T was pushing a public
utilities company; International Cosmetics Corp. was pitching
makeup; and Skyline Entertainment Financing was pushing motion
picture production investments, federal records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the telemarketing operations was conducted by
Christopher Rawlings, Scott Courtney and Peter Aro,'' records filed
in the Watson indictment say.
</P>
<P>
   John Charles Watson, the owner of record for WRI Holdings, was
arrested at Rawlings' funeral and charged with money laundering and
fraud in connection with the telemarketing operation. Watson was
released Thursday on $50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, federal agents arrested two other men suspected of
being involved in telemarketing fraud with Rawlings. Timothy
Carinell Griffieth, 32, and John Darris Dickens, 33, were charged
with mail fraud, sale of unregistered securities and money
laundering, said FBI spokeswoman Laura Bosley. Griffieth and
Dickens were employed at WRI Holdings Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings, Courtney and Aro disguised their involvement in WRI
Holdings, as well as in a series of other businesses, by setting up
an elaborate corporate structure using fronts, federal
investigators concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a part of the scheme, corporate documents, bank accounts,
office leases and other public documents were used which identified
one of their several employees as the owner of the company. In the
case of WRIH, the employee who was designated to serve as the
record owner was John Watson,'' the federal case concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides getting checks for tens of thousands of dollars each
month from their companies' accounts, Rawlings, Courtney and Aro
laundered WRI Holdings back into their own pockets by getting
Watson to write checks to other people who cashed them and funneled
the money to the three officers, federal records say.
</P>
<P>
   Former employees and acquaintances said the relationship between
Rawlings, Courtney and Aro was very close. Aro and Rawlings, in
particular, worked hand-in-glove, writing the sales scripts
together.
</P>
<P>
   The subterfuge ran much deeper inside the telemarketing boiler
rooms, which moved around L.A.'s San Fernando Valley as angry
investors closed in on them, court and company records show.
</P>
<P>
   An elaborate system built on aliases and fake business cards was
set up, such that investors often did not really know who they were
speaking with.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents, for example, show that Aro used the name Leo
Getz with customers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes receptionists would have to scramble to match up the
phony name with the right salesperson, federal records show.
</P>
<P>
   Each investor was given a high-pressure pitch:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, just to let you know, most of this stock has already been
purchased by existing clients from previous films and new clients
like yourself ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the average position for our investors is between $50,000
and $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I don't have a crystal ball, but if past performance is
any indicator of future success, you could be looking at a 3-to-1
return in the next 12 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors were told there would be a $20,000 minimum, then were
enticed to keep pumping checks into each company after receiving a
quick dividend _ though never nearly as much as the original
investment, investors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got one small dividend, actually it was a pretty substantial
dividend, but not nearly what I put into it,'' Hackman said. ``If
they'd kept coming like that, the return would have been real
substantial. As it is, I'll be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Determined investors were pacified with elaborate cover stories,
including never-realized promises that big-name stars like Faye
Dunaway and Keanu Reeves would be appearing in movies they were
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as the heat from disgruntled investors grew, Rawlings
and the others stopped taking messages, phones were disconnected
and the boiler room moved elsewhere. They would leave behind post
office boxes so that investors would not be disconcerted by mailing
checks to new addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, there's no address or phone number,'' Hackman
said. ``It's very disconcerting when you can't talk to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Rawlings' circle moved into its last-known business
address in the spring of 1997, Skyline Entertainment Financing IV's
suite at 9645 Wilshire Blvd., the operation was in high gear,
federal and company records show.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FOURTH TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Skyline Entertainment Financing IV began to claim ties to
Skyline Entertainment, an independent production company owned by
Jason Goldberg and Elan Sassoon located in the same building. Its
telemarketers stressed the name of Vidal Sassoon, Elan's father and
``hair care mogul,'' according to scripts contained in company
records.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg is listed on Skyline Entertainment Financing IV's
California incorporation papers. But attorney Matthew Tambor said
Goldberg's name may have been added to the records without his
consent or knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Sassoon and Goldberg could not be reached for comment. Tambor
said he was unaware of a business connection between his clients
and Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
   At Skyline Entertainment Inc., Goldberg and Sassoon once were
sued by an investor claiming they made misleading claims about the
movie, ``Love Lies Bleeding,'' _ the film Rawlings and his
associates were pushing investors to finance.
</P>
<P>
   Tambor said the lawsuit was dismissed, but that the terms were
confidential. He added ``Love Lies Bleeding,'' a story of Jack the
Ripper, was made, but that he could not discuss what he
characterized as complicated finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys were just trying to make movies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall at Skyline Entertainment Financing IV, Federal
Express packages would arrive daily at the door containing checks
worth tens of thousands of dollars, supposedly to finance ``Love
Lies Bleeding'' among other movies. Investors said they never saw
the promised returns.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, messengers would be dispatched from the West Los
Angeles office to Calabasas where investors were still sending tens
of thousands of dollars each day to Hollywood Films Inc.'s mailing
address.
</P>
<P>
   Company records show that Chris Rawlings was paid more than
$30,000 in some months by Hollywood Films. That company alone took
in over $170,000 some months, but wrote out more in checks _
upwards of $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   It now seems those kind of expenditures had begun take a toll on
Rawlings and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   While they continued to flash wads of hundred-dollar bills and
lived high, their debts had started to soar. Vendors began to
complain, and even the person delivering the much-coveted phone
lists refused to leave the building until payment was made in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Aro still owes Fidler, Rawlings' lawyer, for four hours of legal
work on a commercial lease. ``He'd call and say, I'm writing the
check out right now, but I never saw it,'' Fidler said.
</P>
<P>
   Watson claimed to be so broke at his recent court appearance
that he couldn't afford an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, those may have been signals that the meteoric
rise of Rawlings, the boy who had always played larger than he ever
really was, was on the wane. Still, no one expected it to end so
horribly, in a crush of metal on Tampa Avenue after the hijacking
and police chase.
</P>
<P>
   The lingering tragedy of Chris Rawlings' life and death, say
those who knew him, is that he never slowed down long enough to
learn that money couldn't buy him peace or happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just going so fast,'' Hackman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had so many irons in the fire.''

ALLIES EXTEND DEADLINE ON KOSOVO

<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France _ The Kosovo peace talks were extended
Saturday until Tuesday, and NATO airstrikes against Serbia were
averted, after the Western allies said there had been enough
progress at the talks to set a new deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after a marathon round of all-night negotiations,
representatives of the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans said
the main sticking point was the refusal of the Yugoslav government
to accept up to 30,000 NATO troops to police a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright was more pointed in
her criticism, saying the Serb delegation representing Yugoslavia
bears ``the lion's share of responsibility'' for not meeting
Saturday's deadline to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Albright praised the ethnic Albanian delegation, saying that
despite hedging at signing an agreement, they had negotiated ``with
unity and discipline of purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, she said, the Serbs ``did not want to engage at
all'' on the deployment of NATO troops, which the Contact Group
says is essential to keeping the warring factions apart while a
settlement is implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she was ``extremely reluctant to offer extra
time'' because of the refusal by the Serbs to even discuss NATO
ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   But the European powers, and especially the Russians, who are
sympathetic to the Serbs, were more enthusiastic about granting the
three-day extension and postponement ofpossible NATO airstrikes
against Serbian military targets.
</P>
<P>
   While US officials said only the ethnic Albanian delegation had
asked for an extension, the Europeans stressed that both sides had
asked for more time to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In an indirect slap at Albright, the Italian foreign minister,
Lamberto Dini, said it would be wrong to put most of the blame on
the Serbs for missing the deadline, which was set three weeks ago
by the Contact Group, made up of the United States, Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Albright, who was unflinching in her praise of the ethnic
Albanians and her criticism of the Serbs, the European allies were
more discreet in apportioning blame. Hubert Vedrine, the French
foreign minister, who is hosting the talks at a 14th-century castle
35 miles southwest of Paris, said the 75-hour extension was granted
because ``very substantial progress has been made'' on the
framework of an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement would return to Kosovo the autonomy it had
enjoyed until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic unilaterally
suspended it in 1989. Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
the 2 million people in Kosovo, would be allowed to police,
educate, and govern themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the ethnic Albanians would agree to remain part of
Serbia for at least three years, a prospect that most of them find
offensive, especially in light of the crackdown that Serb
authorities launched last year to crush an Albanian separatist
movement. Some 2,000 people, most of them ethnic Albanian
civilians, have died in the fighting between Serb forces and Kosovo
Liberation Army separatists.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter of ethnic Albanian civilians last year by Serb
forces led the US and European allies to intervene in Kosovo, first
by threatening NATO airstrikes last October, then by convening the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The air strikes were postponed after Milosevic accepted a
compromise brokered by US envoy Richard Holbrooke. But the deal
collapsed as ethnic Albanian fighters and Serb forces routinely
flouted the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   A senior US official Saturday said that if the talks end with
the Albanians agreeing to sign a settlement and the Serbs refusing,
NATO would bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what would happen if both sides refuse to sign a
settlement, the official conceded, ``NATO decision-making is not
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``We have no doubt the Serbs understood what
would follow if there is a Kosovar Albanian yes and a Serb no.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said the ethnic Albanians are resisting signing an
agreement because there is no guarantee that there would be a
referendum on independence after three years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, said Albright, wording on what happens then is
purposely being left vague. She said that any agreement would be an
interim settlement that would be reviewed under international
supervision after three years. The vagueness is meant to appease
the Serbs, who refuse to countenance independence for Kosovo, which
is considered the birthplace of Serbian national and spiritual
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Albright suggested that Albanians may alter or defer their
demands for independence after they are allowed to run their own
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years in our very dynamic world can bring different
results,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Vedrine insisted that both sides had made ``progress in
the right direction'' on political arrangements, he acknowledged
that the Serbs ``will not make concessions that we view as
indispensible.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Contact Group representatives sidestepped
suggestions that one of the compromises being floated is for a
peacekeeping force made up of other than NATO troops. The idea of
putting another, unspecified force on the ground is seen as a
face-saving gesture for Milosevic, who has said he will never allow
NATO troops to occupy a part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   But the Contact Group cannot agree on the makeup and even the
need of NATO troops to police a settlement. Albright acknowledged
that ``the Russians do not favor such a force.''
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Minister Robin Cook appeared to rule out any
watering-down of the NATO ground forces. When asked if there was
any ``winking room'' between him and the Serbs on the subject,
Cook, who has been nearly as caustic a critic of the Serbs as
Albright, replied, ``I can assure you that the last thing the Serb
delegation did was wink at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, unlike Albright, Cook was generous toward the Serbs,
saying, ``Belgrade has moved quite farther than they had last
night.
</P>
<P>
   There was a palpable difference between the briefings given by
the Europeans and Albright's tough talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not permit Belgrade to create a new humanitarian
catastrophe,'' Albright declared. ``I would hope that President
Milosevic would wake up and smell the coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who briefed President Clinton by telephone, said she
intends to remain in France until Tuesday. She said she had no
plans to fly to Belgrade to meet with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, meanwhile, there was less of the tension that
marked the days before the last NATO deadline in October. The
Yugoslav capital was quiet, and unlike last fall there was no run
on groceries or disruption of services.
</P>
<P>
   A group of rambunctious young people packed a train headed for a
soccer match in Nis, unconcerned that it is one of the areas that
NATO is expected to bomb.

NEW YORK ACCENT FOR CLEMENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ Roger in pinstripes. What's next, Ted Kennedy delivering
the keynote speech at the Republican National Convention? Seiji
Ozawa conducting the New York Philharmonic?
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket landed at Legends Field in Tampa Saturday and it was
a hideous sight for those who remember the 12 years he toiled for
the Boston Red Sox. It's been two years since he wore carmine hose,
but time cannot dull the pain of seeing Clemens in a Yankee
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-nine years after former Sox hurler Babe Ruth reported to
the Yankees' spring training site in Florida, Clemens retraced the
Bambino's steps on a sun-splashed Saturday afternoon. He claimed to
have some knowledge of how his new status has been received in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to some people back there,'' said the Rocket after
throwing for 20 minutes and running a few miles around the Yankee
complex. ``I heard someone say, `All Red Sox fans report to the
Tobin Bridge.' Hey, it isn't the Red Sox fans I mind. It's just one
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens-the-Yankee hasn't forgotten how he was slighted by
Boston general manager Dan Duquette on his way out the door two
years ago. After Duquette said Clemens was in the ``twilight'' of
his career, the Rocket went to Toronto and won back-to-back Cy
Young Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not keen on him assessing my baseball abilities,'' Clemens
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it would be a thrill to pitch the All-Star Game at
Fenway in Yankee pinstripes, especially if Anaheim Angel Mo Vaughn
is at first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely crazy pitching there the first time in a
Blue Jays uniform,'' he said, ``and I'm sure this will be not much
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee GM Brian Cashman wanted to know how this was playing up
in Boston. Informed that some of the locals were distraught,
Cashman said, ``That's great! It's icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens will wear No. 12, a huge concession for a man who has
worn No. 21 throughout his big-league career. Yankee outfielder
Paul O'Neill wears No. 21, and Clemens observed, ``I think Paul's
even more superstitious than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 12 is the inverse of 21, but it's also the number worn by
Wade Boggs when he played for the Yankees. Boggs was probably
Clemens's least-favorite teammate in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   There's been a lot of speculation about ``special'' treatment
for Clemens, and Yankee manager Joe Torre and Cashman went out of
their way to insist that Clemens is happy to conform to all club
rules. This means no Clemens K-kids on the field or in the
clubhouse before games. In Toronto, Clemens's sons had lockers next
to their dad's, and the boys were almost a daily presence at
SkyDome. Not in New York. And Roger's goatee will have to go. There
are no whiskers allowed in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee beat reporters are already adjusting to Clemens's unique
dialect (``expec-ta-ted'' was Saturday's gem), and it's possible
that George Rose _ the private interpreter hired for Hideki Irabu _
will be retained to translate Rogerspeak.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens dodged the question regarding what cap he would choose
for his Hall of Fame plaque. Clearly, it won't be a Blue Jays cap,
and his antipathy for the Red Sox might be hard to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to accomplish a lot of great things while I was
there,'' he acknowledged. ``Since this deal was made, I've talked
to a lot of people back in Boston and they say they are Yankee fans
now. They're going to come along for the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are his friends. We all know that rank-and-file Red Sox
fans are not going to jump on the S.S. Steinbrenner just because
the Rocket has landed in the Bronx. A large portion of Red Sox
Nation no doubt believes Clemens went to the Yankees just to stick
it to the Red Sox one more time. That would be truly shameless.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's shameless is the $10 million, four-year offer the Red
Sox gave Roger two years ago,'' countered Clemens's agent, Randy
Hendricks. ``That's what it amounted to, with another $10 million
in nonguaranteed money. They treated him like a rookie with
everything to prove, and at the time I said, `This is Nolan Ryan
leaving the Astros all over again.' And it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think we owe blood to the Boston blood bank? Two years
ago, when Roger didn't go to New York, he talked about how the
people in Boston would have taken it. This is two years later. A
lot has gone on. There's no `in your face' to Boston this time.
This is about winning. And Roger's passion to win is still fueled
by what happened in the 1986 World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Roger Clemens went 24-4, won the Most Valuable Player
award, the Cy Young, and the All-Star Game MVP. The Red Sox took a
3-2 World Series lead, and Clemens led Game Six, 3-2, after seven
innings before John McNamara sent Mike Greenwell up to hit for him.
There has always been debate about Clemens's departure. He had
retired the side in order in the seventh and had a four-hitter with
no walks. He was young and strong, but had a blister on a throwing
finger, which took away his slider. After the game, McNamara told
the national media, ``My pitcher asked out of the game.'' You can
be sure this story will surface if the Rocket gets to the 1999
World Series with the mighty Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was so early in his career,'' said Torre. ``I'm sure at
the time it was no big deal. But when you play for a while, you
realize the impact of winning it, of closing that circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens said, ``So much time has gone by, you look back now and
you figure it just wasn't meant to be. Back then I thought it was
going to be pretty easy to get to postseason play. It did happen a
lot early in my career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still motivation. I've had a great deal of individual
success. But each year when I'm home I see these guys celebrating.
That's what I want now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees come to Fenway May 18.

MITCHELL COMMISSION TO FOCUS ON PROCEDURES FOR FUTURE BID CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Shorted)  
 (HLW)  
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS _ George Mitchell, chairman of the U.S. Olympic
Committee's ethics panel, said Saturday that his commission's
investigation of the Salt Lake City scandal would focus on
recommending procedures for future bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader, said that his
report was not intended to be an exhaustively detailed laundry list
of allegations of misbehavior. Rather, he said, ``We intend to
place emphasis on recommendations for rules, compliance and
enforcement which we hope, if adopted, will prevent the occurrence
of actions in the future of the type that led to the creation of
the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mitchell did not discount that new improprieties would be
revealed in his commission's report, which will be released on
March 1 in New York, he said that looking ahead was his
commission's primary objective. ``We think that's the most
important aspect of this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One senior USOC official has been implicated in the Salt Lake
City scandal thus far. Alfredo La Mont, the committee's director of
international relations, resigned after it was revealed that he had
carried on secretive business dealings with the Salt Lake City bid
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC has commissioned a review of its practices by the law
firm of Hogan and Hartson.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mitchell and Bill Hybl, the president of the USOC, said
that Mitchell's five-member commission had not discussed details of
its investigation with USOC officials. But based on its own
internal review, Hybl said, ``We have seen nothing that would
indicate any substantive new evidence involving the USOC and Salt
Lake City.''

`BUS DIPLOMACY' RAISES HOPES IN INDIA, PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAHGA BORDER, Pakistan _ Welcomed with applause, flowers, and a
19-gun salute courtesy of his nation's archenemy, India's prime
minister crossed into Pakistan on Saturday and embraced his
counterpart, vowing to resolve differences that have divided the
hostile neighbors since their partition half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The historic visit by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, inaugurating the
first bus service between the two countries, comes just nine months
after he shocked the world by testing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The blasts prompted Pakistan to follow suit and raised the
stakes in the nations' long-running battle over the disputed
Himalayan territory of Kashmir. Hindu-majority India and Muslim
Pakistan have fought three wars since they were created in 1947,
two over the predominantly Muslim and strategic state of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee is the first Indian leader to set foot in Pakistan
since 1989, and in the last decade, the Kashmir conflict has
escalated with a Muslim insurgency that has claimed as many as
25,000 lives _ including at least 22 in the last two days _ and
fueled bitter anti-Indian sentiment here.
</P>
<P>
   India's Vajpayee heads a Hindu nationalist party and Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif leads a hawkish Muslim party, making
their common bid for peace even more remarkable. Analysts are
divided on whether the scheduled 27-hour visit will yield
substantive agreement on the key stumbling block of Kashmir, but
the symbolic value of the talks is indisputable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is not so far away when Pakistan and India will be
able to live as the United States and Canada,'' Sharif declared at
a dinner Saturday night in Vajpayee's honor at a 16th-century
Mughal fort in the state capital of Lahore.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee said he was joyful to be ``returning here after 21
years with the message of friendship. My regret is that we have
spent so much time in mutual bitterness. ... I am convinced there
is nothing in our bilateral relations that can ever be solved
through violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee was not uniformly welcomed in Pakistan, however.
</P>
<P>
   Several small groups of anti-Indian hard-liners staged violent
protests in Lahore Saturday that cost the life of at least one
police officer. Still, most Pakistanis interviewed said they want
the talks to yield breakthroughs in trade, travel, and military
confidence-building measures.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides will give a joint statement Sunday that many
observers expect to include economic deals as well as some military
cooperation agreements to reduce the chance of an accidental
nuclear strike.
</P>
<P>
   The summit began at the border with a pomp-filled ceremony heavy
on handshakes and hope. Vajpayee smiled and waved from the window
of the bus, and stepped off onto a red carpet to the roll of drums,
where he was welcomed with a hug by a beaming Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's military honor guard stood at attention, and its band
played India's national anthem before its own. India's and
Pakistan's flags flew side by side for the first time at this
border crossing, while colorful banners of welcome flapped
alongside nationalist slogans _ ``Long live Pakistan'' and ``Our
India is great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important event ... since the fall of the
Berlin Wall,'' said Saqlain Imam, an editorial writer for
Pakistan's Daily Business Recorder who watched the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bus diplomacy is taking place in an environment preceded
by a series of hostilities, terrorist insurgencies, increasing
fundamentalism on both sides, and of course, the nuclear issue.
Now, after declaring the potential to destroy each other, they are
learning to live with each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Indian side, folk performers danced in front of
Vajpayee's slow-moving bus until it reached a 15-foot stretch of
no-man's land between huge metal gates on both sides. Garlands of
marigolds _ traditional for festive occasions in India _ were
strung above a barbed wire fence, and villagers and soldiers
strained to see the bus, which bore the Hindi phrase
``Sada-e-Sarhad,'' or ``Call of the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaborately turbaned border guards on both sides marched to the
gates and flung them open for the bus carrying Vajpayee and a
delegation including Indian artists, actors, businessmen,
parliamentarians, and a cricket star. The guards from the Indian
side then marched into Pakistan bearing a basket of candies.
</P>
<P>
   The Delhi-Lahore bus service marks the first time Indians and
Pakistanis can cross at this border. A train and infrequent flights
between the two cities exist, but visa restrictions make travel
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the village of Wahga said they were thrilled about
Vajpayee's visit, but were disappointed when they discovered that
the ceremony did not mean the border wall and fences would now be
removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want peace so we can come and go freely,'' said Rashid
Ahmed, 41, who said the village was divided in 1947, when Pakistan
and India were partitioned.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed said there was more contact with villagers on the other
side until 10 years ago, when a barbed wire fence went up. ``Before
that, their cattle would come over to our side and we would herd
them back. We exchanged gifts, we atttended their marriages.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some members of the border patrol, trained to regard the
other side as a dangerous enemy, seemed moved by the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an extraordinary day. My heart is very happy,'' said a
shyly smiling Gulam Abbas, 25, a Pakistani ranger.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that sentiment will last and spread on both sides of the
border depends largely on what comes out of the leaders' summit
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say that economic and military realities have
pushed the two sides to the bargaining table. Western nations
outraged at the nuclear tests last year slapped sanctions on both
sides and have pressured them to sign nonproliferation treaties and
make peace.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pakistan is suffering a tremendous
balance-of-payments deficit, and would benefit greatly from
increased trade with India, from whom it could import goods more
cheaply than from the West. Officially, the two sides grant each
other most-favored nation trade status, but in practice, trade is
sparse and cross-border economic deals are difficult to secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade has grown 100 percent between 1993 and last year, and we
feel it can grow even more,'' said Ajay Khanna, senior director of
the Confederation of Indian Industry, and a member of the visiting
Indian delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the issue that remains at the heart of the conflict is
Kashmir, and there is no sign that there will be a breakthough on
that. Yet Khalid Hasan, author of a book on the struggle, said the
difference now is that India seems willing to talk about the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem in the past has been that when there's a strong
government in India, they don't want to talk. When there's a weak
government, they're ineffectual,'' Hasan said. ``Whatever the
reasons, it's an act of courage on Vajpayee's part to come here,
and on Nawaz Sharif's'' to receive him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the Kashmir problem that's intractable; it's the
positions that are intractable,'' Hasan said. India ``needs to
acknowledge there's a problem. . . . I think it's new ballgame
starting today.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone here gives the Indian side that much benefit of the
doubt. Members of the extremist Muslim group Jamaat-i-Islam blocked
Lahore streets and clashed with police, resulting in injuries and
the death of one officer.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters also assaulted the cars of more than a dozen foreign
diplomats, preventing them from attending the dinner at Lahore
Fort. A mob punctured the Turkish ambassador's tire and damaged the
Swedish ambassador's car.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani Senator M. Akram Zaki, chairman of the Senate foreign
affairs committee and a member of Sharif's ruling party, called the
summit ``one of the most important of the year between two men who
will hopefully make a turn in South Asian history.''
</P>
<P>
   But some other politicians said that while they hoped Vajpayee
was sincere, they feared he might have made the journey to divert
attention from anti-Christian violence at home and to woo the
Muslim Indian vote away from the opposition Congress Party. He
might also be trying to soften his image as a hard-liner after
setting off nuclear tests.

GORDON LAID IT ALL ON LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ray Evernham took all of a nanosecond to reply when asked if
Jeff Gordon's victory in the 41st Daytona 500 was more attributable
to the car than the driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was driver,'' said Evernham, crew chief of Gordon's No. 24
Dupont Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``All driver.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon suggested otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some help, but it didn't come from any race driver or
car that was on the track,'' he said. ``I guess the only help I had
was Ray and the guys in the pits. Ray, even after the race was
over, didn't feel like he gave me the fastest car out there. I
believe if it wasn't the fastest, it was one of fastest cars out
there all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was apparent that what carried Gordon to his second
Daytona 500 triumph in three years last Sunday was his enormous
driving talent. It was never more evident than on Lap 190 when
Gordon executed a winning move by hugging a low line through the
start/finish line of the 2.5-mile trioval to draw even with Rusty
Wallace, narrowly averting a rear-end collison with Ricky Rudd's
hobbled car on the apron of Turn 1.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had no intention of letting off his accelerator, as he
held his ground in this game of 190-mile-per-hour brinksmanship and
squeezed between Rudd and Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably in some other races you might not do something like
that, but it's the Daytona 500,'' said Gordon, whose victory paid
him a record $2.1 million and gave him the early lead in the NASCAR
Winston Cup points race heading into Sunday's Dura-Lube/Big Kmart
400 at Rockingham, N.C. ``It's such a big event. Late in the race
like that when you're making a charge, you take every opportunity
you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to see the tape of the closing laps. I knew it
was intense and very exciting from where I was sitting. I'm sure it
was very exciting from where the fans were sitting or standing.''
</P>
<P>
   The finish was so scintillating that CBS drew 900,000 more
viewers than a year ago, earning its highest TV rating ever for the
event, a 9.5 with a 25 share. That was a significant improvement
over last year's race, which earned an 8.6 rating/23 share.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got me on the apron down there and I just couldn't
block him off enough,'' said Wallace. ``I thought I had him blocked
off and he just kept going there and I said, `Man, I'm not going to
wreck a bunch of cars.' So I pulled up and he got me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was going to drive right into the back of Rudd. I
said, `Man, there's going to be a big wreck, and I'm not going to
wreck a bunch of cars and get somebody hurt,' and that's what
would've happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gordon, with some unlikely drafting support from Dale
Earnhardt, won a three-wide drag race with Wallace and Mike Skinner
down the backstretch and into Turn 3, where he finally pulled ahead
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon then held off Earnhardt's bete noire, the black No. 3
Goodwrench Chevrolet Monte Carlo, keeping it in his rearview mirror
in a pulsating 10-lap shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a great way to get the season started, by
having such a great win in the Daytona 500,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of things that did a lot for us this week. We sat
on the pole, got ourselves back in the Bud Shootout (a race for
Busch Pole Award winners). Then we got the Daytona 500 win and got
the first win of the season out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so important to get that first win. After the previous
season's over, you go, `Do we have what it takes to get to victory
lane next year? Are we going to be a championship contender?' I'm
still not sure about the championship part, but we've definitely
got one win out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, in large part, to the driver's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's hierarchy underwent a subtle yet significant change
last week when president Bill France announced the appointment of
Mike Helton as senior vice president and chief operating officer.
Helton, 45, will oversee day-to-day operations in addition to his
current duties as vice president for competition. It marks the
first time since the France family founded the sanctioning body 51
years ago that the NASCAR helm has been handed to an outsider.
``With the France family controlling the stewardship of the sport,
we can only expect great things to continue,'' Helton said. ``The
best part is that nothing is broken, so there is no urgent mission
for a fix.'' . . . Gordon's record windfall at Daytona, bolstered
by the $1 million bonus paid by the Winston No Bull 5 program, gave
him an incredible jump on matching last year's record earnings of
$9 million. Ray Grimm, a 46-year-old corrections officer from
Hagerstown, Md., who claimed to be a devout Earnhardt fan, also won
a $1 million Winston No Bull 5 bonus. He was one of five lucky fans
paired with a No Bull 5 eligible driver . . . With Indianapolis
Motor Speedway set to host the US Grand Prix Formula One race next
year, construction began last week on the new F1 garages. The
concrete foundation was poured for 36 two-story garages and 12
suites. It marked the second of an eight-phase plan to reconfigure
the garage and infield areas. ``This is the largest construction
project in track history,'' said IMS president Tony George, who
reportedly has agreed to spend upwards of $20 million to make the
alterations. ``It may seem overwhelming, but I am sure that we can
and will accomplish it.'' . . . Jay Leno has been tabbed to drive
the Chevrolet Monte Carlo pace car at the Indianapolis 500 May 30.

<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ The Red Sox will have 28 pitchers in camp: 21
on the roster, seven by invitation.
</P>
<P>
   As improbable as it may seem, there may be exactly one job open,
for a middle reliever.
</P>
<P>
   That could change, of course, because of injury or if a pitcher
or two crashes and burns this spring. But, clearly, these are not
your father's Red Sox, or your grandmother's.
</P>
<P>
   A staff that was second to the Yankees in the American League
last season may be even better this year, and that's without adding
Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most stable we've been coming into spring training
in the three years I've been with the team,'' said Dr. Joe
Kerrigan, pitching M.D., who this spring has added a laptop
computer to the arsenal of charts, videos, and mannequins he
employs in his capacity as pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the personality of the pitching staff was as
faceless as one of Kerrigan's wooden Pitching Pals. No one knew
whether Bret Saberhagen could contribute after shoulder
reconstruction, or whether Tom Gordon could make the conversion
from starter to closer. A rookie, Brian Rose, was an unknown
quantity, and lefthander Butch Henry lasted just two starts before
he was lost for the season with a knee injury. Rose's elbow gave
out soon thereafter. Dennis Eckersley arrived with much fanfare,
but he was merely a ghost of his Cy Young past.
</P>
<P>
   There was a new ace, Pedro Martinez, but he was coming to a new
league, had just signed what was then the game's biggest contract,
and would be facing constant comparisons to the Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast all of that with the present state of affairs:
</P>
<P>
   --The Sox have five veteran starters, all of whom won 10 games
or more last season, and five homegrown starters-in-waiting, all of
whom most likely will begin the season in Pawtucket but may see
Boston by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the newcomers, Mark Portugal or Pat Rapp, fires the
imagination the way a front-line starter would, but both have been
serviceable major league pitchers who should end the
bottom-of-the-rotation roulette that the Sox had to play last
season, when Rose, Jin Ho Cho, Robinson Checo, John Wasdin, and
Derek Lowe all auditioned unsuccessfully for a starting slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be a little more secure in the fourth and fifth hole,''
Kerrigan said. ``Those guys can give you innings, and they'll
protect your bullpen. We should have a rested bullpen. Last year,
we scrambled like a son of a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   --Gordon returns as the league's premier closer, with Lowe
emerging as a potentially first-rate setup man and backup closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flash should remain a dominant closer,'' Kerrigan said. ``I've
seen him make too many good pitches. I've seen it with other guys
who have made that switch, like (John) Wetteland: Once a guy has
it, he usually stays with it.''
</P>
<P>
   --Saberhagen, protected beautifully by Kerrigan and manager Jimy
Williams, is coming off a 15-win season, and while he will continue
to require constant monitoring and special treatment, he matches up
well against any of the top pitchers in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen made 18 starts last season in which he was coming off
more than the usual four days' rest. In those starts, he had a 9-3
record with a 3.33 ERA. Martinez also was given extra rest on 15
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll still be judicious with him,'' Kerrigan said of
Saberhagen. ``He averaged 88 pitches a start last season; we'll
probably bump that up to 95 or 96 pitches, which on the average is
about another two outs per game. That should give him another 20
innings, to around 195.''
</P>
<P>
   --Martinez won 20 games last season, including one in the
playoffs over the Indians, and handled switching leagues and the
added pressures with apparent ease.
</P>
<P>
   And there should be no repeat of the stomach ulcer problems that
caused him to lose a half-dozen pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro's stomach disorder was the only scary part,'' Kerrigan
said. ``He was hurting. You could see it in his face when he was
throwing on the side. He was scared. He got to Detroit and he
couldn't sleep, he was tossing and turning. This wasn't your usual
bellyache. He felt a sharp pain in a big area around his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical part wore him down, but the worrying wore him
down, too. He was really scared. He lost six or seven pounds, which
is like us losing 15 or 20 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   --The Sox have added a veteran lefthanded setup man, Mark
Guthrie, which they did not have last season until Dan Duquette
traded for Greg Swindell.
</P>
<P>
   The negatives? Martinez is the only starter under age 31. There
is no lefthander in the rotation. Pete Schourek, purchased from
Houston last season, pitched ably down the stretch and brilliantly
in his controversial playoff start, but he signed with Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tossed and turned with that,'' Kerrigan said. ``I know he's
a good pitcher and has good stuff, but he needed a lot of
maintenance. Pitch counts, and cutting back on throwing on the
side, and you not only had to worry about his elbow but his
shoulder, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen and Portugal are both health risks, Rapp's wildness
could prove deadly in Fenway Park, and Gordon undoubtedly will have
some slippage from last year's near-perfection.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerrigan, who will oversee his first official workout Sunday
after six days of informal sessions, will gladly take his chances
with this group. He's already well under way in one of his bigger
projects of spring, a makeover of long reliever John Wasdin, who in
96 innings last season gave up 111 hits, 44 for extra bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got too good an arm and too good stuff for that to
happen,'' Kerrigan said. ``We've altered his delivery quite a bit.
He's coming from over his head. He did it on his own, over the
winter. He's added a better turn, and has more deception. You can't
pick up the ball as easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from over the top, he'll get the ball downhill better,
instead of that flat-plane fastball he was throwing for extra-base
hits. We tried subtle changes before, and they didn't work. I like
what I've seen so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The middle reliever will emerge from a group that includes
back-from-Japan import Kip Gross; former Brave Brad Clontz, who had
bone chips removed from his elbow; Bob Wolcott, whose one shining
moment came when he started for the Mariners against the Yankees in
the '95 playoffs; Greg Mix, another former Braves farmhand;
lefthanded holdover Ron Mahay; and El Guapo, Rich Garces, if his
elbow is OK after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The sorting-out process begins Sunday.

UMASS MAKES POINT _ BARELY _ AGAINST XAVIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST _ After 26 contests, they're still a difficult team to
figure, one capable of beating or losing to practically any
adversary. Say this about the University of Massachusetts's
enigmatic campaign: The outcome of its previous game is no
indication of what will happen next.
</P>
<P>
   The same team that blew a 15-point second-half lead in a loss to
Atlantic 10 rival Rhode Island a week ago, then played horribly at
the start of Wednesday's loss to league foe George Washington,
rendered one of its guttiest and most complete performances of the
season Saturday _ a 78-77 double-overtime win over Xavier, which
entered the contest with the conference's best overall record.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Chris Kirkland had 25 points and 13 rebounds to lead the
Minutemen, who had players with double-doubles for the first time
Feb. 28, 1996. withstood several defensive lapses in regulation and
the extra frames to improve to 12-14 overall, 8-6 in conference.
(19-8, 11-3), which entered tied with George Washington in first
place in the Atlantic 10 West, its second loss to the Minutemen in
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   UMass center Lari Ketner (20 points, 12 boards, 3 blocks) hit a
fadeaway jumper with seconds left that to be the winning basket. On
the game's last possession, Xavier guard Gary Lumpkin split the
Minuteman defense for a layup attempt, but the shot caromed off the
rim as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier forward James Posey (19 points, 12 rebounds) put
Lumpkin's miss back in on a dunk, but it was ruled the attempt came
after the horn sounded. ``We took the ball right to the rim,'' said
Xavier coach Skip Prosser. ``Can't get a much better one.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass's victory made up for its usual ending in regulation. The
Minutemen led, 63-61, with 24 seconds left, but they missed two
one-and-one free throws and then saw Xavier tie it when forward
Winston Smith fouled Posey in the backcourt with 2 seconds left.
Posey sank the two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even see what happened,'' said Ketner about the foul.
``I just ran up the court, next thing you know, I heard a
whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, UMass led, 70-68, with 37.3 seconds remaining, but
with 7 seconds left, Xavier guard Lenny Brown (23 points) hit a
driving layup in the middle of the defense to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they came to the bench we just kept saying we were
going to win the game,'' said UMass coach Bruiser Flint. ``In
practice, we talk about playing in five-minute sessions. We just
kept saying, `Let's go out and play another five-minute session.'
''
</P>
<P>
   With two league games to play, the Minutemen are within a game
and a half of second-place Rhode Island (which visits St. Joseph's
Sunday) in the A 10 East.
</P>
<P>
   The conference tournament is less than two weeks away, and
Saturday's victory over Xavier and narrow defeats against George
Washington and Rhode Island prove that the Minutemen could win the
tournament and salvage a most disappointing season with an NCAA
Tournament automatic bid.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, losses to Fordham (fifth place in the East) and St.
Bonaventure also mean the Minutemen could suffer an early exit. But
Flint said his team, which also got 21 points and 10 rebounds from
guard Monty Mack, is fighting through adversity better than it did
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we just stayed with it,'' he said. ``Nobody put their
heads down. We're still fighting hard.''

WORLD GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS HAS WINNING FORMAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Want a sure bet? There will be some titanium clanging around
Carlsbad, Calif., at the debut of the World Golf Championships this
week. Want another? You'll hear lots of complaints, too, because
this tournament is match play.
</P>
<P>
   The critics will sound their tired battle cries _ that match
play is not a true test of championship golf, that it involves too
much luck, that a guy shooting 66 can go home while a guy shooting
74 can advance. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And a 1-iron is a tough club to
swing.
</P>
<P>
   So what? Our weekends are filled with medal-play tournaments
with leaderboards populated by bright red numbers and birdie
barrages that leave us dizzy. Surely there is room for a match-play
event that will make these millionaires grind.
</P>
<P>
   Match play is a terrific way to determine a golf champion.
Surely, the best player doesn't always win _ not at match play and
not at medal play. But great players will rise to the occasion,
regardless of the format, and you need only turn the pages of time
to appreciate what sort of champion wins at match play.
</P>
<P>
   From 1921-27, for instance, the PGA Championship was won by
either Walter Hagen or Gene Sarazen. You will drive it 450 yards
before you find anyone to argue that those men weren't the premier
players of their time. The fact that each won a pair of US Opens
tells you that they adapted their games quite well for stroke play,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Want more? During the 1940s, Byron Nelson, Ben Hogan, and Sam
Snead each won two PGA Championships at match play. Seems to me
you'll find their names a few times if you look for winners of
stroke-play events, too.
</P>
<P>
   There also was a certain player by the name of Bobby Jones who
somehow managed to beat the opposition at whatever format was
demanded. (Substitute the name Tiger Woods if you prefer hip to
historic.)
</P>
<P>
   Do you get upsets in match play? Most definitely. Long before
the world watched Costantino Rocca defeat Woods in the 1997 Ryder
Cup, a player by the name of Bob Hamilton upended Nelson in the
1944 PGA Championship final. In the 1929 Ryder Cup, both Hagen (by
10 and 8) and Sarazen (by 6 and 4) were dealt stunning defeats.
Fresher in some minds is the memory of Christy O'Connor Jr. beating
Fred Couples in the 1989 Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But to those folks who moan that stroke play delivers a truer
champion, there are entries in the record book that prove
otherwise. The 1969 US Open, for instance. Or the 1971 Masters. Or
the 1973 Masters. Or the 1996 PGA. Orville Moody, Charles Coody,
Tommy Aaron, and Mark Brooks, respectively, won those majors, and
you can still find people shaking their heads in disbelief at that.
</P>
<P>
   Anything short of a final between Woods and David Duval will be
fuel for those who dislike the idea of this match play
championship. So imagine the outcry (not to mention the sound of TV
clickers) if next Sunday's 36-hole finale gives us Bob Estes vs.
Dudley Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Other observations on this match play championship:
</P>
<P>
   --Nick Faldo, barely three years removed from his third Masters
triumph, has fallen to 65th in the world rankings but earned a spot
in the field because Jumbo Ozaki had the good sense to withdraw.
Somehow, Ozaki is ranked 14th in the world, though few observers
would put him in the Top 200. Then again, perhaps Ozaki didn't do
Faldo any favors, for the final spot in the field wins a
first-round matchup with Woods. Admit it, images of 10 and 8 are
dancing in your head.
</P>
<P>
   --When Tom Lehman announced that he would withdraw from this
weekend's Nissan Open, speculation began that he would not play at
Carlsbad, either. Not true, said folks at Signature Sports, the
agency run by Lehman's brother, Jim. The 1996 British Open champ
had surgery on his shoulder late last year but plans to make his
return this week. He draws Scott Verplank in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   --An intriguing first-round matchup is Craig Stadler vs. Colin
Montgomerie. The over/under for scowls has to be 30. On the front
side, that is.
</P>
<P>
   --Ernie Els won three straight select-field world match play
titles, but his first-round foe should give him fits. Paul Azinger
thrives in this sort of competition, as his 2-0-1 Ryder Cup singles
mark proves.
</P>
<P>
   --It's too easy to pick Woods, and Couples speaks for many in
the field when he says of the three-time US Amateur winner: ``He'll
be licking his lips when he gets to LaCosta.'' True enough. But
Couples isn't exactly a weekend hacker when it comes to this (since
that '89 loss to O'Connor, Couples is undefeated in Ryder Cup
singles play), and it says here he will win. He plays well at
LaCosta (six top 10 finishes in the years the Mercedes Championship
was held here), and his laidback reputation overshadows the fire
that often burns inside.
</P>
<P>
   --How ready is Greg Norman? He had a great partner (Steve
Elkington) at the Presidents Cup in December, then looked rusty, at
times tentative, in a few tournaments before taking a six-week
rest. Two weeks ago he missed the cut at his own invitational back
home, but his game was sharp in a runner-up finish last week at the
Australian Masters. Having dropped to 28th in the world rankings,
he draws John Cook as his first opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Think the television folks like to see Woods in the hunt? He
barely made the cut at San Diego last week, so he played too early
for the cameras in Round 3, which means the CBS telecast opened
with news of his scorching 62 at Torrey Pines. Next day, with Woods
stalking his first victory in almost a year, the ratings for the
Buick Invitational were large, and here in Boston it ranked No. 1
with a 7.96 rating, swamping the NBA (reportedly it is back in
business) and college basketball (Duke-Wake Forest reaped an 0.79;
heck, a Duke-Wake Forest chess match would rate an 0.79) . . . Talk
about a finishing kick. In last Sunday's final round of the Buick,
Jason Gore holed out his approach to the par-4 17th, then reached
the par-5 18th in two and drained a 20-foot putt. The eagle-eagle
finish for the former Pepperdine star lifted him into a tie for
26th, good for $20,385. Not bad for a Monday qualifier . . . It
helps to have a little bit of luck, even if you are a world-class
player. At the Australian Masters last weekend, Craig Parry caught
his bunker shot thin, his shot flying the green. But the ball hit a
huge leaderboard and bounced back onto the green. He two-putted for
bogey . . . If it's consistency you like, check out Michael
Campbell at last week's Dubai Desert Classic: 71-71-71-71. He
finished in a tie for 11th at 4 under . . . Alex Cejka, a talented
player on the European PGA Tour who has shown flashes of stardom,
is off to a nice start in 1999 and is tied for ninth in the Ryder
Cup standings. Should he stay in the picture for September's event,
expect to hear more about his family's tale of escaping communist
Czechoslovakia to settle in Germany . . . And there's still a long
way to go, but did you notice that European captain Mark James
threw in three straight 69s in Dubai to finish in a tie for third,
moving him to 21st in the overall Ryder Cup standings? ``I'm very
suspicious of this form,'' James joked with reporters in Qatar
after opening this week's stop with a 67.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   After a 19-year run at The Quechee Club in Vermont, the NEPGA is
moving the New England Open to The Woodlands and Portland CC in
Falmouth, Maine, this year (Sept. 13-15). A few weeks before that,
the NEPGA has two gems lined up to host the section's championship
_ Winchester CC and Kernwood CC in Salem . . . Some New England
pros are working successfully in Florida this winter. Gene
Peterson, the former head pro at Cohasset CC, teamed with Tom
Tarsia to win the PGA Senior-Junior title. Larry Startzel of the
Country Club of Vermont finished second with Dan Wilkins. Sal
Ruggiero of Stow Acres earned a victory in the PGA Senior Stroke
Play Championship in the over-60 age group, while Mike San Filippo
of Nashawtuc CC currently leads the PGA Winter Series money list .
. . Looking to purchase something for the coming season? There's a
golf fair Sunday at Stow Acres (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.), and three local
club pros _ Andy Froude of Charles River, Jim Lane of Winchester,
and Bob Carey of Fresh Pond _ will hold a golf equipment sale
Friday-Sunday at Howard Johnson's in Woburn. Part of the proceeds
will benefit the Mass. Golf Association's Inner-City Golf Camps.

LATEST BC LOSS THE PITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The whistles still seemed to be ringing in Kenny Harley's ears
as he stood against a wall outside Boston College's locker room,
explaining the disappointment of Saturday's 67-66 Big East loss to
Pittsburgh before a Conte Forum crowd of 4,347.
</P>
<P>
   With 28 seconds remaining and BC with a 66-63 lead, Harley was
whistled for a foul that put Vonteego Cummings on the line for a
pair of free throws. On the ensuing inbounds play, Harley stepped
out of bounds to relieve guard Dwayne Pina but was whistled for a
5-second violation when he failed to call a timeout. It led to the
go-ahead basket by Stephen Flores, a reserve who came off the bench
to score 8 points, including the winner on an offensive putback
with 8.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little stunned (about the 5-second violation), I
thought I had a clock going in my head, but it might've been a
little too late to call the timeout,'' said Harley, who led the
Eagles (6-18, 3-13) with a career-high 21 points on 9-for-19
shooting. ``Maybe it was a lack of recognition on my part. But what
I was really surprised at was the foul they called on me down the
stretch. I mean, the whole game we'd been playing agressive and I
don't really think that was a foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did BC coach Al Skinner, who jumped up and down to
protest Ed Corbett's touch call against Harley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, by far, is our most difficult loss,'' said Skinner,
whose team was without junior forward Michael Cotton (sprained
right ankle), but still took a 29-24 halftime lead and increased it
to 52-40 in the second half before a 15-0 Pitt run. ``It was there
for us,'' he said. ``We had our opportunities, but, yeah, it was
certainly our most difficult loss all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the officiating didn't help matters. Skinner, whose
frustration over what he sees as his team's lack of respect from
officials has been mounting, wondered how his point guard, Pina,
was unable to get to the line after he was brutalized by Pitt's
defense for 40 minutes and committed seven of BC's 19 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't complain about judgment calls,'' Skinner said. ``I'm
just unhappy about them and I'm disappointed, considering the way
the game was being played. If Dwayne wasn't getting bumped like
that all game long, then I wouldn't have any complaints. If they're
allowed to push up, and reach around and grab, then fine. We should
be allowed to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, however, found no relief from the officials. So when
Kenny Walls took an inbounds pass from Jonathan Beerbohm with 5.3
seconds left, ``We weren't expecting to get any calls,'' said BC
freshman Brian Ross, who recorded his second double-double of the
season with 16 points, 10 rebounds. ``We just wanted to try and get
it to the goal.'' But Walls let fly of a 3-pointer from the top of
the key that hit the front of the rim and caromed out of bounds as
time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings and Kellii Taylor each had 16 points for Pitt (13-14,
4-12), while Ricardo Greer had 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go back and lick our wounds and come back and live to
fight another day,'' said Skinner, whose team must regroup before
hosting No. 21 Syracuse on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there'd be games like this, but we just have to deal
with it. But we're not going away.''

   NEW YORK _ Oscar De La Hoya wasn't within 2,500 miles of New
York, but his long shadow hung over Pernell Whitaker and Felix
Trinidad all week.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker and Trinidad were in the final days of preparation for
the biggest fight of their careers, Saturday night's International
Boxing Federation welterweight title clash at Madison Square
Garden, but so much of the talk was about the winner fighting De La
Hoya that Whitaker finally remarked, ``What's wrong with you guys?
This ain't about Oscar De La Hoya. This is a big fight, not some
tuneup. This is for the title.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it was, and a case could be made that the holder of that
title when the first bell rang, Trinidad, was every bit as
dangerous as De La Hoya, if not more so. But such has been the
marketing of De La Hoya that that is the only comparison in which
they are equals.
</P>
<P>
   Other than fight ability, nothing about Trinidad or the
four-time world champion, Whitaker, is close to boxing's new Golden
Boy. After a stirring victory a week ago over undefeated Ike
Quartey, De La Hoya enhanced the perception that he is the new king
of the ring, a point even HBO made by tying its promotion of
Saturday night's telecast into De La Hoya in a two-page
advertisement in Friday's New York Times. The first page hyped the
rebroadcast of De La Hoya-Quartey prior to the IBF title fight,
while the ad for Whitaker-Trinidad was on the following page.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of pairing these fights on back-to-back weekends was to
create a Final Four effect, and the constant talk of De La Hoya all
week made it clear that end of the promotion was working. The plan
(although not yet a promise) is that the winners fight before the
year is out to determine who is the best welterweight in the world.
Such a fight would be good not only for the participants but also
the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey could even be on the undercard of such a fight against
either World Boxing Association champion James Page, himself a
fearsome puncher, or Saturday night's loser, thereby setting up a
round robin that could drum up the kind of rooting and gambling
interest that used to exist in boxing's golden days.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad's promoter, Don King, even went so far as to join
forces with one of his sworn enemies among what he calls ``the Boss
scribes.'' King stole a line from New York Daily News boxing writer
Michael Katz and said that if De La Hoya didn't agree to fight the
Whitaker-Trinidad winner, he was indeed ``Chicken De La Hoya.'' And
De La Hoya was only a spectator to this fight.
</P>
<P>
   For some unexplainable reason, Katz has taken to calling De La
Hoya chicken, claiming he is ducking the toughest opponents and
even criticizing him after the final round of the Quartey fight for
allegedly not fighting the full three minutes after nearly knocking
Quartey cold in the first 60 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   There might be some truth to the complaints about some of De La
Hoya's opponents, but certainly not Julio Cesar Chavez the first
time or Whitaker or Quartey, all of whom he defeated. Yet so intent
are some of De La Hoya's few remaining critics that they've begun
demeaning Quartey, who a week ago they said would stop De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   One day Quartey was portrayed as the most dangerous guy in the
division, someone who was going to KO the Golden Boy. Then he gets
knocked flat twice, nearly gets stopped in the final round, and
loses a split decision. Suddenly he had a lousy trainer, spent too
much time in the gym, suffered from too long a layoff, and didn't
have the heart to duke it out down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has learned to laugh about such things, even though
they're no longer funny. Meanwhile, HBO Sports CEO Seth Abraham
remains hopeful that he can work out a major pay-per-view fight
between De La Hoya and the Whitaker-Trinidad winner for the fall,
which would give the division a nearly unified title and perhaps
finally satisfy what's left of De La Hoya's detractors.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, De La Hoya said before Saturday night's fight, ``I
have to fight Trinidad, I have no choice,'' meaning Trinidad
represents the unknown force in the division and eventually will
have to be faced by whoever wants to emerge from this era as the
premier fighter at 147 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   That is because at 35, Whitaker is the past, especially since De
La Hoya already holds a decision over him, albeit a controversial
one that this corner did not agree with.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when asked what he thought of Trinidad insisting he receive
financial parity for such a fight, De La Hoya quickly put on his
new co-promoter's hat and said, ``That's nonsense. If he fights on
pay-per-view he'd have 25,000 people watching. He should just try
to get the biggest payday he can, which we've already offered him.
If he wants to get greedy, there'll be no fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Apprised of that, even Trinidad's father couldn't disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parity is not important as long as I am satisfied with what
Tito gets,'' Felix Trinidad Sr. said barely 48 hours before his son
was set to face the toughest and most elusive opponent of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Someone should have reminded the Trinidads and everyone else
associated with the promotion that that opponent was not Oscar De
La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   At least not yet.

   HBO has closed a deal for Floyd Mayweather Jr., one of boxing's
hottest properties, to defend the World Boxing Council super
featherweight title April 17 on ``Boxing After Dark'' against Goyo
Vargas, with Angel Manfredy-Ivan Robinson the second fight.
Manfredy was originally set to fight IBF junior lightweight
champion Roberto Garcia, but Garcia pulled out last week.
Mayweather defended his title for the second time last week in his
hometown of Grand Rapids, Mich., pushing his record to 20-0 with a
unanimous decision over the resilient Carlos Rios. Mayweather hopes
to break Joe Louis's record of 25 straight title defenses . . .
Former bantamweight champion Wayne McCullough was enraged to learn
that World Boxing Organization featherweight champion Prince Naseem
Hamed's first title defense in his new deal with HBO would not
involve a rematch with McCullough. Instead, Hamed will fight
European champion Peter Ingle at the NYNEX Centre in Manchester,
England, April 10. But the news wasn't all bad for McCullough.
After Erik Morales successfully defended his WBC super bantamweight
title on the De La Hoya-Quartey undercard with a second-round
starching of Angel Chacon, it was announced that McCullough would
be Morales's next opponent on a May 8 card . . . Hamed will next
appear in the US this summer, as HBO Sports senior vice president
Lou DiBella spent three days in England negotiating a deal to give
the network primary status in his career. Time-Warner had to ``buy
the world,'' a source said, meaning it had to buy the worldwide
rights to Hamed's fights. This included buying out SKY-TV, the
British version of HBO. That contract was becoming a programming
problem for HBO because it demanded several fights in prime time in
England, five hours ahead of the US. Hamed will still fight in
England twice in his new deal but at times conducive to US
television . . . America's only gold medalist from the 1996
Olympics, David Reid, tries to win his first world title March 6 on
``Boxing After Dark'' against WBC junior middleweight champion
Laurent Boudouani. Boudouani trained in the Alps, believing the
high altitude would improve his conditioning, so Reid trained in
the Rockies . . . King said Thursday he is still hopeful that an
Evander Holyfield win over Lennox Lewis March 13 will result in a
defense of the WBA heavyweight title against Henry Akinwande in
South Africa this summer, with retiring head of state (and former
boxer) Nelson Mandela the centerpiece of a weeklong celebration . .
. King has gambled his own future making Trinidad-Whitaker and
Holyfield-Lewis knowing that two losses in three weeks would knock
his two top fighters out of world titles. ``It's a gamble but the
worst words a gambler can say are `Oh my, oh my, the deal passed me
by,' '' King cackled. ``I been a gambler all my life.'' . . .
Emanuel Steward reports that Lewis is in his seventh week of
training, the longest stretch of his career. ``His whole career is
based on this one fight,'' said Steward. ``He is hungry, desperate,
and realistic. Everything is on the line.'' If so, that didn't
concern Holyfield's wise veteran trainer, Don Turner. ``How do I
see the fight?'' Turner said. ``Evander hits Lewis and Lewis falls
down. If Lewis fights the fight of his life, he's still no (Mike)
Tyson.'' Steward agreed on the latter point, at least. ``Lewis is
no Tyson,'' Steward said. ``Tyson was never the fighter everyone
thought he was. Evander exposed Tyson. Boxing or toe-to-toe, Lewis
has tremendous punching power and natural strength that Holyfield
has never seen before. Unless you are a consistent fighter you
shouldn't be as cocky as Holyfield is. Lennox has never been an
easy fighter for anyone _ ever. Evander has always been erratic.''
. . . The WBC has ordered light heavyweight champion Roy Jones Jr.
to make a mandatory defense vs. No. 1 contender Graciano
Rocchigiani. It says it will not sanction any other Jones fight and
could strip him of the title if he refuses. Of course, Jones is
again talking of moving up to heavyweight to pursue Holyfield if he
wins next month, which could make it a moot point.
</P>

   Here's a story that never ends, just the names change.
Three-time junior flyweight champion Michael Carbajal is coming out
of retirement Feb. 27 to fight a 10-round match at junior
bantamweight vs. Jose De Jesus. Money's the reason, of course . . .
Not every heavyweight can boast of what Jeremy Williams can.
Williams (34-2, 31 KOs) speaks three languages (English, Spanish,
and Arabic) and holds a degree in theology from the University of
Michigan. According to his promoters at Main Events, Williams
considered becoming an imam, a Muslim minister, before turning pro
and says he wants to become a doctor when his career is ended . . .
Cuban defector Joel Casamayor recently won the interim North
American Boxing Federation super featherweight title, beating Jose
Luis Noyola (22-2-1). Casamayor is 14-0 and ranked third in the
world by the IBF . . . Here's a note that proves pettiness doesn't
exist only in US boxing. WBO light heavyweight champion Dariusz
Michalczewski was named 1998's Fighter of the Year by readers of a
German boxing magazine, BoxSport. When he learned that 168-pound
champion Sven Ottke finished a close second, he refused to accept
the award and his promoter, Universum, refused to run its annual
full-page Christmas ad in the magazine . . . Oba Carr waits in the
wings for De La Hoya, with a tentative May 22 date at the new Las
Vegas casino, Mandalay Bay. That was the deal he had when he agreed
to fight Frankie Randall on the De La Hoya-Quartey undercard, a
deal he still finds remarkable. ``Who would say a person like Oba
would be fighting a guy like Oscar?'' Carr said. ``Who would say
there would be a possibility of even talking about that a year ago,
after leaving Don King, after being in so much debt I didn't even
know what the heck to do with my life but kill myself?'' At 26,
Carr (48-2-1) already has been managed by four men, promoted by
several more, and lost two shots at the welterweight title. He was
stopped by Trinidad and dropped a majority decision to Quartey
after having 2 points deducted for low blows. So how did Carr get
back on his feet? ``I wasn't going to allow my past to contaminate
my present so I couldn't continue to evolve,'' he said. ``It's all
about evolution.'' Who's this guy been reading, Darwin? . . .
Harold Weston, who promotes NABF junior welterweight champion
Reggie Green, says he will offer WBA 140-pound champion Sharmba
Mitchell $200,000 to get in with Green. But he says he will not
agree to give Mitchell's promoter, King, future rights to Green's
fights. ``I feel Reggie is the hidden jewel of professional
boxing,'' Weston said. Green is not yet ranked No. 1 by any
organization, however, so forcing a title fight at this juncture
seems unlikely . . . Former Ring magazine editor Steve Farhood has
been named executive editor of the first boxing magazine in
cyberspace. Former heavyweight Crawford Grimsley has created
BoxingMag.com, which he calls ``the Internet portal for boxing
enthusiasts.'' The site features not only the usual written fare
but also live and archival press conferences and interviews, plus a
weekly interview with legendary trainer Angelo Dundee . . . Taking
a cue from Foxwoods's move to sanction its own fights rather than
being under the jurisdiction of the state of Connecticut, the
Miccousukee Indian Gaming casino has decided to run its own
commission, independent of the state of Florida. A five-man
commission headed by Don Hazelton, former executive director of the
Florida commission, will run the casino's growing boxing program .
. . In case you missed it, Chelsea heavyweight contender John Ruiz
was named Puerto Rico's boxer of the year at an awards ceremony in
Ponce last month. Ruiz, who holds the NABF title and the WBC's No.
1 ranking, is scheduled to fight on the Holyfield-Lewis undercard
at Madison Square Garden. He is the first New England heavyweight
to be ranked No. 1 in the world since Rocky Marciano in 1952 and is
the highest-rated Latino heavyweight in boxing history.

KINGS BEST TEAM YOU'LL NEVER SEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The people commissioner David Stern refers to as the NBA's
``broadcast partners'' have conspired to perpetrate a mass
injustice on most of the non-dish, basketball-watching public.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a late change _ and there should be _ the
Sacramento Kings will not appear on nationwide television this
season. NBC, of course, never even considered them; it'd rather
televise a Lakers shootaround than stoop to do the Kings or the
Bulls. But TNT/TBS omitted Sacramento as well, which is more of a
surprise, because that network tries to show every NBA team,
including the Clippers, at least once.
</P>
<P>
   But with the new season/schedule, the Kings were given the big
doughnut for nationwide exposure, and that is a shame. Though few
NBA fans anticipated they would care, more and more will want to
give Sacramento a look before season's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win, we might start getting looked at a little
differently,'' said coach Rick Adelman. ``But you have to earn
respect in this league from everybody. This is a team which can do
a lot of nice things offensively and has some smart players. We're
not quite the team some people think we are, but we may be. And
because of what we do offensively, we are capable of winning any
night.''
</P>
<P>
   There may not be a more enjoyable team to watch than the
reconfigured Kings. They are among the top-scoring teams in the
league, and if you stayed up last Tuesday to watch them play the
Celtics, you saw an entertaining club with a terrific rookie point
guard _ Jason Williams _ and possibly the NBA's best passing front
line, featuring Chris Webber and Vlade Divac.
</P>
<P>
   Reputations are hard to shed, but this team has been overhauled.
Williams, Webber, and Divac were elsewhere last season. So was
Adelman and his staff. Webber still is, er, adjusting to the scene,
but Williams and Divac appear to be feeling at home already.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like here the most,'' Divac said, ``is that the fans
really support the team. That is very important to the players. It
makes you want to give everything you have. And I like all the
young guys. This is the first time I've felt like one of the old
guys. It's a new experience for me. And it's also a challenge for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The poster boy for the Kings, however, is the flashy Williams,
who is being besieged by the national media. He got booted off the
team at Florida last season, but NBA personnel men knew all about
him. His agent, Bill Pollack, got Dennis Johnson to work with
Williams in Orlando prior to the draft. DJ loved what he saw, and
Williams says he's grateful for the attention and teaching he got
from the old pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked me out hard. He killed me,'' Williams said. ``He got
me in great shape. It was a pleasure to be around him. He got the
best out of me, that's for sure. Without him, I don't think I would
have been drafted seventh, that's for sure. No way.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has been compared to Pete Maravich, but Celtic great
Bob Cousy watched the rookie against Utah and thought he looked a
lot more like another great guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw much more (John) Stockton in him than Maravich,'' Cooz
said. ``Every pass he made was solid, conservative. He's got the
range, he can penetrate, he's solid on his dribble. I love the kid.
I love him without the flair.''
</P>
<P>
   The flair, however, is part of the package. Kings GM Geoff
Petrie noted that Williams is ``a presence'' on the floor, and he's
right. He also knew what he was getting on draft day because the
Kings (a) had done their homework and (b) knew that talent-spotter
extraordinaire Jerry West was slobbering all over him. (If West had
managed to come out of the draft with Williams, we could have ended
the season now and simply given the title to the Lakers.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He was at a position where we had been weak for a very long
time and a position in the NBA that's very, very important,'' said
Petrie. ``After spending a lot of time with him and looking at all
the tape we could, we were as convinced as you can be. On talent,
it wasn't that much of a gamble. He's been terrific for us. All the
things we thought he could do, he's been able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe one of these days people actually will get to see this kid
play without having to buy a ticket or a satellite dish. Then
again, he's probably worth the expense. So, too, is his team.
</P>
<P>

   The schedule is crazy. The players aren't in shape. The coaches
are angry that the schedule is crazy and the players aren't in
shape. There's another contingent going through conditioning woes:
the referees. Under normal circumstances, the 57 league officials
would have attended four days of film work, rules discussions, and
medical tests prior to the exhibition season. Included were two
days for a physical, one component of which is a stress test. There
was no such gathering this year. The referees were on their own to
get in shape and get their own physicals. ``So far, we've had two
lost games due to injuries,'' league operations chief Rod Thorn
said. ``One guy missed a game with a bad back and the other was due
to a groin. But they returned for the next game.'' Thorn said the
real killer for the referees is the schedule. They're no more
accustomed to working four games in five days than the players are
to playing them. Unlike the players, they don't have the
conveniences of team travel. ``The trips are coming fast and
furious,'' Thorn said, ``and there isn't quite as much down time.''
. . . Speaking of conditioning, Rick Pitino is making it clear to
his players that he will never tolerate another offseason like the
one he just endured. He used words like ``flabbergasted'' to
describe how he felt about the shape in which his players reported.
(Antoine Walker was the biggest miscreant.) ``I'm just bitterly
disappointed, and I'll tell you this: It will never happen again,''
he said. Pitino is repeating his ``request'' that all Celtics move
to the Boston area year-round. ``They play for the Boston
Celtics,'' he said. ``This should be their home. And now we have a
place where they can work out. And if they don't want to make it
their home, we'll find another home for them.'' He quickly added
that Walker would be allowed to live in Chicago because of his
daughter. ``But he is going to have to hire a personal trainer,''
Pitino said. ``He can afford one. Michael Jordan went to a golf
tournament and brought his trainer with him; Antoine is going to
have to do the same thing.'' . . . And then there's Bryant ``Big
Country'' Reeves. If you watched him on television last Wednesday,
you may have wondered what the fuss was all about. Well, Reeves is
down to his playing weight of around 292 pounds after showing up
for camp around 320. The Grizzlies put him on an intensive workout
regimen, which featured 10 miles on the exercise bike and 2,000
feet on the vertical climber each day. The Grizzlies are going to
demand that Reeves hire a trainer as well, so that mom's home
cooking back in Gans, Okla., doesn't get the better of him again.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   As we continue to be amazed by Paul Pierce, we can also remind
you that one of the reasons he slid to No. 10 was that two teams
that liked him, Toronto and Sacramento, did not appeal to him. ``He
called us the day he was supposed to be here for a workout and said
he was injured,'' Petrie recalled. ``I thought that was interesting
because I had just seen him the night before playing in Los
Angeles. We knew we passed on a terrific prospect in Paul, but
everyone seems happy with the way things turned out.'' As for
Vancouver, which picked second, coach Brian Hill said, ``We were
going to take him, but we felt we had to address our point guard
situation. We're very happy with Mike (Bibby), but Paul is a great
addition to that team.'' . . . It took 73 minutes to play the 15
minutes of overtime in the Celtics-Grizzlies game. Last Sunday's
game between Indiana and the Lakers featured six timeouts and two
20-second timeouts in the final 26.6 seconds. By the way, there is
an extra timeout this season. It comes in the first stoppage of
play after the 10-minute mark in the second and fourth quarters.
The timeout was there for the past few years for NBC and TNT games.
Now it's there for all games . . . The league and the Players
Association have agreed to extend by one month the date to sign
free agents. Under the old rules, teams could sign free agents
starting July 1. That date will now be Aug. 1, although teams can
contact free agents and talk to them on July 1. The reason for the
delay is to enable an actual salary cap figure to be established.
Previously, teams operated under an assumed cap figure; the real
one didn't come out until the auditing was finished in mid-August.
``This time, we're going to rush the accountants a little harder
and they'll have the figure by the first,'' said union attorney Ron
Klempner. It also will give attorneys in both offices some time for
vacation . . . Not to be negative, but if you heard Dennis Rodman
on ESPN Friday, you'd have to think long and hard about signing
him. Asked about the Lakers, Rodman said, ``I'm not nowhere near
close signing with the Lakers.'' (Is that three or four negatives?)
He also said Miami was a possibility and that Chicago was out . . .
The second week of three games in three nights went a lot better
for the tired teams. Miami, for instance, went 3-0 on successive
nights while the Suns and Rockets each won on the road on the third
night. Houston sneaked by New Jersey with Scottie Pippen playing
the entire second half and all of the overtime. By the way, if
you're still uncertain as to why Pippen was so eager to leave
Chicago, read the cover story in the latest ESPN Magazine. One of
the nuggets unearthed was that Chicago GM Jerry Krause, whom Pippen
detests, demanded that he be able to talk to Pippen after the trade
with Houston was completed. Pippen got on the phone and said all
the right things, then hung up and said, ``That was hard to
swallow.'' He also said that if the Bulls had taken care of him and
Jordan the way Houston took care of him, the two would still be in
Chicago.

FOR CELTICS, REBOUNDERS A PIVOTAL PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rick Pitino hasn't called the Psychic Friends
Hotline yet or taken out an ad with the toll-free number:
1-800-I-NEED-A-REBOUNDER.
</P>
<P>
   But it may come to that, soon, if we are to believe the coach
was speaking out of something other than utter exasperation after
Friday night's wipeout in Portland. Pitino had just seen his club
get demolished inside by Brian Grant &AMP; Co., 106-86, and bludgeoned
on the boards, 52-37. He emerged from the locker room wondering how
he might be able to get blood from a stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to do one of two things,'' he said. ``I can move
Antoine (Walker) to small forward, which gives us a bigger lineup.
Or I can make a trade and bring in someone who rebounds the
basketball. We're getting dominated on the glass.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is not a news bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick has been preaching that for a long time,'' Dana Barros
said. ``It was our biggest problem last year and it's still here.
It's not like it's a new problem or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Pitino was exasperated by the situation,
Barros said, ``I think he's probably beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' sacrificial centers have been a source of concern
all season. They have not had a real post presence at either end
since Pitino has been here _ and before he got here. They're a
finesse team, basically, which gets by making outside shots and
creating havoc on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino indicated he'd likely start addressing the problem by
moving Walker to small forward. Walker probably should be at small
forward, except that position is currently manned by an individual
with seven games of NBA experience who also happens to be their
best player: Paul Pierce. And if Pierce moves to the backcourt,
that takes away minutes from Ron Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   The other option _ a trade _ is something Pitino has said he'd
be extremely reluctant to do if it meant dealing what he frequently
calls ``an asset.'' Translated, that does not mean Eric Riley or
Greg Minor. It means Pierce, Mercer, or Walker or perhaps Kenny
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   He has to find a team that needs what he has _ shooters _ and
has what he needs _ bruisers. The Celtics' rebounding numbers are
not all that bad; they're one of the best offensive rebounding
teams in the league. But Pitino wants rebounds at the other end.
It's not a good sign when an opponent's offensive-rebound total
matches your defensive total. That happened Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of Paul Pierce, we are not physically imposing at a
lot of positions,'' the coach said. ``Our (big men) aren't killers
on the glass. From a physical, rebounding position, all you see is
Paul Pierce. We're going to have to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>

   The Celtics arrived here Saturday morning and worked out in late
afternoon at the MCI Center. The Wizards edged the Bulls, 93-91, on
Friday night at home and don't present an immediate brutality
problem. They don't even have a center. They started Ben Wallace
there on Friday against the similarly pivot-pathetic Bulls . . .
Pitino said he was not overly concerned about the team's slow
starts. The Celtics frequently find themselves in double-digit
deficits in the first half _ that was the case in all three games
out West _ and have yet to lead at the half this season. ``When I
was with the Knicks, we trailed a lot at the half,'' he said. ``But
then we pressed the entire second half.'' The Celtics don't have
that luxury right now . . . Roxbury's Randell Jackson has been
getting some time for the Wizards and actually was put in the
starting lineup for a couple of games last week. The former Madison
Park and Winchendon star went undrafted out of Florida State but
has found a home in Washington. ``He's got a chance,'' said Wizards
coach Bernie Bickerstaff. ``Nothing seems to faze him. He probably
had the best camp of any of our guys. I've got to find a way to get
him minutes.'' Jackson played five minutes Friday.

BLACK CLOUD HOVERS OVER BLACKHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a revoltin' development. The Blackhawks missed the playoffs
last season for the first time since 1969, handed Doug Gilmour an
$18 million promise over the summer when they finished out of the
Brett Hull money chase, and since have established themselves as
the worst thing on double-runners this side of Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Hawks are so bad (16-34-8) that perhaps a bolt of
lightning would be good for what ails 'em. This isn't a team in
need of a makeover. It's in need of a complete overhaul, from front
office to coaching staff to player personnel. They are now on the
fast track to miss the playoffs again, their first back-to-back
flops since 1957 and '58.
</P>
<P>
   They are slow, old, and in severe need of a young star to ignite
them. The closest thing they've got is Tony Amonte, the 28-year-old
former Boston University sniper who jumped out among the league's
top goal scorers early in the season, only to taper off (he still
has a pretty impressive 29 strikes) as the Hawks barreled headlong
into the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks aren't alone in their Original Six malaise. Only
Toronto and Detroit have winning records among the half-dozen of
the game's ancient elite. The Original Six aren't doing much better
than the NHL's six most recent expansion clubs:
</P>
<P>
   (through Friday) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Original Six Latest Six &QC; 
Toronto +11 Ottawa +15
</P>
<P>
   Detroit +8 Florida -1
</P>
<P>
   Boston -2 Anaheim -2
</P>
<P>
   Montreal -4 San Jose -4
</P>
<P>
   NY Rangers -5 Nashville -12
</P>
<P>
   Chicago -18 Tampa Bay -27
</P>
<P>
   Total -10 Total -31
</P>
<P>
   Sure makes you wonder about the prestige and mystique of the
game's old guard, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hawks GM Bob Murray sent the fur flying last week
when he said the club's only two untouchables were Amonte and
netminder Jocelyn Thibault. That could mean both Gilmour and Chris
Chelios are up for grabs as the March 23 trading deadline
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Chelios, amid rumors that he will be shoveled
imminently to Philadelphia for Dainius Zubrus. And why not?
Because, he said, the deal he signed with Chicago (through next
season) included a handshake with owner Bill Wirtz pledging that he
would not trade Chelios. When word broke of that private pact last
week, it appeared that Murray was one of two things: (1) out to
lunch or (2) out to move Chelios, no matter what side deal might
have been promised.
</P>
<P>
   Chelios, on the rumor that he'll be dealt to the Flyers: ``I
don't want to go anywhere. You should tell (Flyers GM) Bobby Clarke
to shut his mouth. Just tell Bobby Clarke to leave me alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the continuing case of Alexei Zhamnov, the skilled
28-year-old center whom the Hawks received upon dumping Jeremy
Roenick in a fire sale _ a blunderous deal that ranks up there with
Montreal dumping Patrick Roy. Rather than be held hostage by
Roenick's contract demands, the Hawks showed JR the door (which led
him to paradise in Phoenix) and willingly inherited Zhamnov's,
shall we say, enigmatic approach to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Benched when the Hawks played Phoenix two weeks ago, Zhamnov
developed a bad back 48 hours later and hasn't been in the lineup
since. When the Hawks visited Ottawa Monday _ a week into his bad
back _ they didn't bother bringing him along for the ride. Is he
hurt? Is he healthy? Does anyone care?
</P>
<P>
   All this has been going on with ex-Hawk Dirk Graham making it up
as he goes along behind the bench. His grit as a player hasn't
translated into either motivational or technical prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour, game as he may be, was a skill acquisition for a team
that was more in need of rank-and-file character players. He's a
Picasso, an aging one at that, on a team with a lot of
paint-by-numbers to be done.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Murray, who took over the 3 1/2-decade
rebuilding program from Bob Pulford in the summer of '97. The Hawks
finished nine games under .500 his first year, and this time around
they could finish 25 or more below break even.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, no powerhouse themselves, will be here Sunday for a
first-hand look at the horrible Hawks. It's a grim picture, and an
especially sad one for the league. Bad management. Bad players.
Another of the Original Six gone from riches to rags.

   Ruslan Salei, the Ducks' tough defenseman, started playing the
game on outside rinks in Minsk. Some days were so cold, he
recalled, that players waited in warm locker rooms between line
changes, braving the cold only in one-minute shifts. He pocketed
about $200 a month, a far cry from his deal in Anaheim that will
bring him $2.25 million over three years. ``It's not fair when I am
making so much money,'' he said, ``driving an expensive car, and
eating in expensive restaurants, and over there people are fighting
for a loaf of bread.'' . . . Phil Housley might never be accused of
playing defense, but he'll bank another $2.5 million behind the
Calgary blue line next season. His contract, originally signed when
he went to the Capitals as a free agent, called for him to make $3
million next season _ at the club's option. The Flames said they
wouldn't bite at that figure, essentially leaving him to become a
free agent again on July 1, at age 35. But for the $2.5 million,
and the opportunity not to uproot his family again, Housley decided
to remain a Flame . . . The Sharks have a new defenseman, Shawn
Heins, who earlier this month unloaded a slap shot that was clocked
at 106 miles per hour _ the fastest one ever recorded (0.8 miles
per hour faster than the missile Al Iafrate launched at the '93
All-Star skills competition). The difference between Canada and the
US: Heins, 6 feet 4 inches and 220 pounds, was featured on Page 1
in Thursday's editions of the Ottawa Citizen the day before he was
to make his NHL debut with the San Jose Sharks. ``I loved the sound
of the tennis ball hitting the door,'' Heins told the Citizen,
recounting his childhood in suburban Ottawa. ``When we missed the
net, mom would hear the thud in the house, and she would yell at us
to stop. The dents in the door are still there.'' . . . A day after
acquiring 6-7 defenseman (and sometimes wing) Chris McAllister from
the Canucks, the Leafs gave up on former first-rounder Jeff Ware
(No. 15 overall in '95) and dished him to the Panthers for right
winger David Nemirovsky (No. 84 in '94). ``The new team policy,''
said a deadpan Mike Smith, the Leafs' associate GM, ``is a trade a
day until the trade deadline.'' . . . Players Association boss Bob
Goodenow last week enumerated the players' lead complaints: (1) bad
ice; (2) seamless glass. Goodenow: ``It's tough enough to stay
healthy and play well, but when you have bad ice conditions and you
have the seamless glass and the injuries that flow from that, it's
a more dangerous environment in which to play.'' . . . Mario
Lemieux acknowledged for the first time last week that he is trying
to round up investors to buy the Penguins and keep them in
Pittsburgh. He'll need a minimum $40 million just to get in the
game. It's a growing belief around the league that Mario Magnifique
won't see the bundle of deferred dough he's owed unless he is part
of a new Penguin ownership package. That's another way of saying
his deal wasn't protected against franchise insolvency, and with
the Penguins now under bankruptcy protection, he could be faced
with settling for pennies on the dollar _ or perhaps less. Roger
Marino, current co-owner, took some heat weeks ago when he began to
look at out-of-town suitors. But don't be surprised to see Lemieux,
if it's the only way he can salvage what he's owed, ultimately go
on the same shopping tour. Get that green carpet ready, Hartford .
. . Uh-oh. The Habs finally are healthy. Witness their 6-3 pasting
of the Rangers Wednesday night. ``They looked like the '79
Canadiens,'' reported eyewitness Gord Kluzak to the Montreal
Gazette. For those who have chosen to forget, those would be the
52-17-11 and Cup-winning Canadiens, who clobbered the Rangers in a
five-game final.

   Stefan Patrik, who figures to be the top choice in the amateur
draft, June 26 at the FleetCenter, was cleared to return to the
Long Beach Ice Dogs (IHL) this weekend, after missing nearly three
months because of a concussion. He had 23 points in 20 games before
getting dinged . . . The NHL last week requested that the AHL adopt
a four-on-four format, each club playing a man down, for overtime.
The read here: just another gimmick, akin to the shootout. The
Lords of the Boards should be more concerned about what goes on for
the 60 minutes of regulation play. Call penalties. Call more
penalty shots. Make 'em play the puck. Don't allow the team killing
a penalty to ice it. The point of the exercise should be to win in
regulation, not to keep conjuring OT schemes . . . The deal that
didn't get done: Theo Fleury to Los Angeles for Pavel Rosa (RW) and
Yanic Perreault (27). Word is, Fleury wouldn't accept $30 million
over five years to leave Calgary for Los Angeles . . . Bobby Orr
worked the bench at the Prospects Game _ the showcase for the top
amateurs available in the June draft _ in Calgary Tuesday night,
opposed again by ex-Bruins coach Don Cherry on the other bench.
Orr, who works as an agent with Jay Fee at Woolf and Associates
here in Boston, heard the familiar questions about possible
conflict of interest (i.e. an agent wearing a coach's hat, possibly
recruiting clients, influencing ice time). Cherry hurried to his
defense: ``When he walks into the room, it's like God's just walked
in.'' Orr offered a more subtle, ``I won't be passing out business
cards.'' . . . The last goal scored at Maple Leaf Gardens came off
the stick of Chicago tough guy Bob Probert (of all the gin joints
in all the world, he had to walk in . . .). He wasn't sure what
he'd do with the puck, but Gilmour, an ex-Leaf, offered him $100
(Canadian funds). The Hockey Hall of Fame would like to have it,
but as of Friday the Hall still had no confirmation that Probert
would hand over the prized biscuit. Hands off, Home Shopping
Network.

UCLA FACES KEY TEST AGAINST SYRACUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA and Syracuse meet today in Pauley Pavilion in
a nonconference game that, for the Bruins at least, carries as much
weight as a conference game.
</P>
<P>
   They won't win the Pac-10 and they won't get a top seed in the
NCAA Tournament. But defeating Syracuse _ a top-25 team with a
victory over Connecticut _ could be the difference between, say, a
No.4 seed and a No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a high-level conference game against Stanford,
Arizona or Washington,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``It's on
national TV, with recruiting. There are a lot of factors that make
this special.''
</P>
<P>
   The list starts with seeding. The Bruins and Orangemen, who have
never met, have similar resumes. Both have 18 wins overall and nine
wins in league play. UCLA is ranked 16th, with a victory over
Arizona. Syracuse is 21st, with a victory over Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game can matter, in talking with selection committee
members,'' Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said. ``When they start to
seed, they say, `Look at this win, look at that win.' When they get
in that room, they look at the schedule and see who you beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like an NCAA Tournament game. This is who we could
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, for both teams, avoid playing.
</P>
<P>
   Road winners: Surprisingly, Syracuse has played better on the
road (6-2) than in the Carrier Dome (9-6). Like UCLA, the Orangemen
have no senior starters and have battled inconsistency: Five days
after winning at Connecticut, they lost at home to Villanova.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no answer,'' Boeheim said. ``You'd figure with a young
team, it'd be the other way around. Maybe our players think they're
supposed to win at home and they try a little too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In a zone? In recent years, the Orangemen have played one of the
best zone defenses in the nation _ a 2-3 alignment that covers the
court, denies passing lanes and intimidates in the post.
</P>
<P>
   Boeheim estimated the Orangemen have played 40 percent zone this
year because their perimeter quickness often makes man-to-man a
better option. But don't be surprised if the 2-3 makes an
appearance today. The Bruins have struggled against zones all
season and they haven't faced one like Syracuse's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only zone I've seen better is Temple's,'' Boeheim said.
</P>
<P>
   Homecoming: Syracuse has two Los Angeles natives, starting point
guard Jason Hart and reserve guard Tony Bland.
</P>
<P>
   Bland, a freshman, was a teammate of UCLA redshirt Billy Knight
at Westchester High. Hart, a junior who played at Inglewood High,
leads Syracuse in scoring (13.8 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get him less excited,'' Boeheim said. ``Jason is
an emotional player.''
</P>
<P>
   Board work: UCLA's rebounding has slipped in recent weeks
because of the injury to forward Jerome Moiso and ineffective play
of center Dan Gadzuric.
</P>
<P>
   Outrebounded in five or their last six games, the Bruins face
one of their biggest, most physical opponents of the season today.
Syracuse's frontline measures 6-9, 6-8 and 6-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to be effective in the tournament, we have to have
collective rebounding,'' Lavin said.

GENE SISKEL, 53, MOVIE REVIEWER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gene Siskel, the slighter, more cerebral half of the popular
Siskel &AMP; Ebert team of dueling movie reviewers, died on Saturday at
a hospital near his home in Chicago, two weeks after leaving the
long-running syndicated television program for further recuperation
from brain surgery last May.
</P>
<P>
   He was 53 and with his portly partner, Roger Ebert, had made
their signature thumbs up _ or down _ verdicts a powerful influence
over a movie's success or failure.
</P>
<P>
   Until Siskel, the movie reviewer for The Chicago Tribune, and
Ebert, the critic for The Chicago Sun-Times, were paired for a
local public television program, ``Opening Soon at a Theater Near
You,'' in 1969, film critics, for all the intellectual pretensions
of some and the safe sure judgments of others, had little sway over
a movie's fate.
</P>
<P>
   That was partly because most reviewers had largely local
followings and partly because huge Hollywood advertising and
promotion campaigns could override even negative national reviews.
</P>
<P>
   But the crackling on-air chemistry between Siskel and Ebert,
their sometimes spirited, even caustic, disagreements and,
ultimately, their opinions that consistently reflected broad public
tastes, quickly made them such powerful persuaders that movie ads
routinely included their thumbs up endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   It was a reflection of their personal popular appeal that when
their program went into national syndication in 1982, as ``At the
Movies,'' the title was soon changed to ``At the Movies with Siskel
&AMP; Ebert,'' and then simply to ``Siskel &AMP; Ebert.''
</P>
<P>
   Siskel, a native of Chicago who was brought up by an aunt and
uncle in a rollicking household that included two siblings and
three cousins, did not grow up dreaming of becoming a movie critic.
</P>
<P>
   Intending to be a trial lawyer, he majored in philosophy at
Yale, but two years after his graduation in 1967, a letter of
recommendation from a Yale mentor and teacher, the author John
Hersey, secured him a job at The Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months after starting as a neighborhood reporter he was
promoted to film critic.
</P>
<P>
   Once he and Ebert became television stars, the two men continued
their newspaper reviews and accepted solo sideline work, Siskel as
a reviewer for ``CBS This Morning,'' and for WBBM-TV in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   If viewers sometimes had trouble remembering which of the two
men was which (Ebert has often been known as the fat one; Siskel,
by extension, as the skinny one) no one would have thought they
came from the same mold.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they ultimately agreed that a movie was good or bad,
they were sure to disagree on why, and their sometimes
not-so-good-natured arguments were seen as so entertaining that the
two men became favorite guests on late night television talk shows,
generally taking turns sitting next to the host.
</P>
<P>
   Siskel, who had returned to work shortly after his surgery to
remove a brain tumor last year, took wry note of their rivalry when
he announced his leave earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a hurry to get well,'' he said. ``because I don't want
Roger to get more screen time than I.''
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his wife, Marlene, and two daughters.

COWBOYS NEED SOME STARR POWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I grow up _ with an emphasis on ``when'' _ I want to be
Kenneth Starr, independent counsel. What's not appealing about
unlimited budget, unlimited investigatiive power and a subpoena
hammer that transforms the uncooperative into singing canaries?
</P>
<P>
   But why waste all that on politics? Now that his chores in
Washington are basically done, hopefully Mr. Starr can move on to
more important work.
</P>
<P>
   Ken, we need you in sports. Pronto. Clear it with Janet, and
then report immediately for duty.
</P>
<P>
   Once on board, investigate this:
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones said last week he's planning contract extensions and
fat new raises for quarterback Troy Aikman and cornerback Deion
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   That makes as much sense as the Tarrant County commissioners
voting a hefty salary bump for Sheriff Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Mr. Starr, this smells of a land deal in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman already makes an average of $5 million-plus a season
under an existing contract that has three years remaining. And
those three years will average $8.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' offensive production the last two seasons has
resembled Henry Hyde and the House managers' visit to the Senate.
Lot of talk, no points on the board.
</P>
<P>
   As the offensive leader, Aikman takes the hit for the failure.
If anything, he's overpaid at the moment. This is the ultimate team
player, but the team results haven't been good lately.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Nine-Toed Deion.
</P>
<P>
   Ken, you'll definitely need the grand jury for this witness.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of last season, Nine-Toed took six weeks to
limp his way back into the Cowboys' lineup, but a month after the
season ended, he's playing in the Pro Bowl. Legally, how long is
the statute of limitations on medical fraud?
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas Stadium locker room following the Arizona playoff
loss, Sanders hobbled around like a brave warrior who was on his
last leg, or toe. The beach battle in ``Saving Private Ryan''
wasn't this dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Would Deion ever walk again, much less play football?
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, four weeks later Sanders was frolicking in
Hawaii, having a great time at cornerback in a painless and
meaningless performance. Meaningless, that is, except for putting
Deion back in a football spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   And just think, Mr. Starr, you doubted Betty Currie's testimony.
What the heck you gonna do with a Deion?
</P>
<P>
   Just for the record, Sanders is always the first Cowboy to point
fingers when things go wrong _ he's our local Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Deion was running his filibuster mouth loudly after the Arizona
upset, talking about the ``team stars'' who weren't performing up
to standard or salary. This was aimed at Aikman and the offense.
Nice team player, this Deion.
</P>
<P>
   And Ken, in your cross-examination of Jones, also consider the
January testimony of that distinguished football gentleman from New
York, Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he had elevated the Jets so quickly to Super
Bowl-contender status, Parcells said, ``for one thing, I don't pay
a cornerback $35 million.'' He meant Jerry and he meant Deion.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing, Mr. Starr, will apparently change the mind of Jones
on Deion. When on the field, Sanders is the best at what he does,
be it pass coverage or punt returns. The problem, however, is Deion
staying on the field, for whatever weak excuse. What we have here
is a player who doesn't answer the roll call often enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have played 33 games in the past two seasons.
Sanders has missed nine, plus the second half of two others. In 11
of the past 33 games, exactly one-third, he has declared himself
not physically fit for duty.
</P>
<P>
   But here's a guy who will be asking Jones for $10 million a
season and a $15 million signing bonus. He might get it, too.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious question:
</P>
<P>
   How many players with a much better Sunday attendance record
could the Cowboys sign if Jones would dump this prima donna?
</P>
<P>
   Jerry is making a mistake on Sanders. Get him outta here. And
don't bump Aikman's salary either.
</P>
<P>
   That's my testimony, Mr. Starr, but obviously you have much to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Do note, however, that in the on-going salary cap bind for
Jones, he can continue with his theory of
save-now-and-pay-for-it-later on Sanders and Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   With new contracts for both, Jerry will shave immediate cap
dollars, and then worry later about the consequences. Actually,
that's what this bootleg play is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Winning will not return to Valley Ranch without the proper
quarterback in place. Aikman is the only hope. But winning is not
about an overpaid cornerback who plays when he wants to play. See
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Go get 'em, Ken _ investigate like crazy. And maybe this is a
case you can actually win. Maybe.

   WESTMINSTER, Calif. _The Vietnamese immigrant who has battled
his former countrymen here for weeks about his right to display a
poster of Ho Chi Minh in his video store rehung the picture on
Saturday, but it took dozens of police officers and sheriff's
deputies to protect him and the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Dodging eggs, oranges and curses, the police hustled the
merchant, Truong Van Tran, and his wife, Kim, into the store
shortly before 10 a.m., as hundreds of protesters screamed ``Down
with Communism'' and threatened to break through a thick line of
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters surged forward at least three times, bending the
line but not breaking it. By 10:15, the police had arrested about a
dozen protesters, including a man who took a swing at the officers
and a woman who rammed into the line with a stroller containing two
children.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the store, Tran, 37, climbed a metal ladder and fastened
the poster and the flag of Vietnam to the wall with colored pins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel happy,'' Tran said after he and his wife bowed their
heads in front of the display that has caused so much debate in
this city south of Los Angeles where tens of thousands of
Vietnamese, most of them refugees from South Vietnam, live in a
neighborhood called Little Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   But minutes later, Tran cried when he tried to explain that he
loved his people here and in Vietnam and that he wanted to help
chase away the ghosts of the Vietnam War that still haunt so many.
</P>
<P>
   To begin the healing, Tran said, his fellow immigrants must
learn to accept different views about their homeland without
resorting to intimidation and violence. In the 1980s, people in
Little Saigon were beaten and sometimes killed if they said
anything remotely positive about normalizing relations with
Vietnam. Stores that did business with Vietnam were burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not afraid to do the right,'' Tran said. ``I want to
communicate with the Vietnamese community. I want to help the
Vietnamese community to live in peace.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese immigrants began arriving here in large numbers in
1975 after the fall of Saigon in the last days of the war. The
memories of the bloodshed and their frightening flight from the
Communists whom Ho Chi Min led until his death in 1969 are never
far away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Bill Lewis of the Westminster Police Department said that
during negotiations with Tran and the protesters over the last few
days, some of the protesters threatened to set themselves on fire
if Tran was allowed to hang the poster.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they were going to do what the monks did in Vietnam
in the mid-'60s,'' Lewis said. ``That's the kind of emotion we've
been dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   No one set himself on fire on Saturday, but numerous people
screamed themselves hoarse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who killed my father?'' a woman chanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ho Chi Minh,'' the crowded shouted back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who killed my brother?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ho Chi Minh.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many here lost a loved one during the war, which killed
millions of Vietnamese from both north and south, including members
of Tran's family. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a communist,'' said Tran, who fled southwest Vietnam
and the communist regime for the United States in 1980. ``I do not
think the communists do well in my country. They have to do more to
change. But who helps them to change?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The protests outside of the store, Hi-Tek, began last month
after Tran put up the poster and the flag and then sent a fax to a
Vietnamese group, daring it to take down the display. Tran said he
was trying to engage the group in debate.
</P>
<P>
   His former countrymen showed up by the hundreds to demand that
the picture of ``Ho, the mass murderer'' be taken down. Tran
refused. But after five days of increasingly tense protests, an
Orange County Superior Court judge ordered the display removed
pending a hearing. Last week, the judge said Tran had the First
Amendment right to hang the items. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the ruling, more than 600 protesters gathered in
front of the store, and were met by more than 100 police officers.
Fearing violence, the authorities ordered Tran to stay away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But at 4:30 a.m. Saturday, the police returned to the store and
caught the handful of protesters there off guard, pushing them
behind a barricade.
</P>
<P>
   The police could not get Tran into the shop as quickly as they
had hoped. A locksmith had to be called in to break a chain that
the protesters had used to lock Tran out.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the door was opened and Tran was driven into the
parking lot in a police van, the ranks of the protesters had grown
to about 300, and more arrived throughout the morning. Tran said he
was going to stay in his shop until noon, but the police whisked
him away by 10:30.
</P>
<P>
   Tran has been served with an eviction notice, but he has vowed
to fight it, reopen his store and continue renting videos like the
two on his display counter: ``Ghosts That Still Walk'' and ``Last
Man Standing.''

TV MOVIE RESONATES ESSENCE, IF NOT FACTS, OF ALMA MATER'S SAGA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a proud alumnus of New Orleans' Jesuit High School, Class of
1966, there is a lot not to like about tonight's TNT network movie,
``Passing Glory''.
</P>
<P>
   But I'll get over it.
</P>
<P>
   The message is significant, even if my alma mater has been
reduced in the movie to a gullible, misleading, misguided
stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   The time was February 1965, the same week, as it turns out, that
civil rights activist Malcolm X was shot.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1962, Jesuit had become the first all-white high
school in the city to admit black students. It prompted the Ku Klux
Klan to picket our front sidewalk. A year or so later, we arrived
one morning to find that our campus chapel had been painted with
slurs and hate symbols.
</P>
<P>
   To us, it came with the territory. The Jesuit priests and
scholastics (priests-to-be) at our school had preached a gospel of
social justice from the day we walked through the big oaken doors.
</P>
<P>
   Confront the Klan? A good Jesuit would have tried to debate one
into tiny knots.
</P>
<P>
   Our priests marched to their own drummer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, these were the '60s. We were being prepared for a brave new
world not of separate but equal, but of equality and opportunity
for all. Voices were going to be raised, and the Jesuits were
training us to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why so many of my fellow Jesuit alums are going to
have a hard time with ``Passing Glory''. It is a movie about a
basketball game _ a scrimmage, actually. A game played in ringing
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Until Feb. 26, 1965, athletic teams in Louisiana with both white
and black faces had never appeared together on the same basketball
court. But on that day they did _ in my own high school gym, behind
doors that were locked to keep out the media, the curious and the
police who, it was feared by some, might barge in and try to halt
the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   St. Augustine High School, operated by the Josephite Fathers,
was a Catholic, all-boys high school and a perennial basketball
powerhouse. In 1965, the Purple Knights stormed toward the
Louisiana Interscholastic, Athletic and Literary Organization
(LIALO) playoffs with a 30-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   Jesuit also was a Catholic, all-boys high school and was in the
middle of a three-year run of state basketball championships in the
Louisiana High School Athletic Association (LHSAA). The Blue Jays
were 26-1, the lone loss coming early in the season to a team from
Pensacola, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But the bylaws of the white-only LHSAA prohibited its teams from
playing black-only LIALO teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were preparing for a state championship and were concerned
about doing anything that might jeopardize that,'' said the Rev. J.
Donald Pearce, who was Jesuit's athletic director. ``We didn't know
what the LHSAA might do.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Aug principal at the time, the Rev. Robert Grant, pushed
for a game that might eventually pave the way for his school's
acceptance into the LHSAA. Jesuit administration offered, instead,
a scrimmage _ five quarters, no media coverage, with only family
members allowed inside a locked gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, with Hollywood embellishment, the game takes on
grandiose, Rosa Parks-sized proportions. One of the St. Aug
players, Harold Sylvester, wrote the screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   The network's publicity packet for the movie blares, ``Fr.
Joseph Verrett ignites the sparks of the civil rights movement in
New Orleans ... to forever change the established social order.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not really. The script conveniently ignores that black
students had been attending Jesuit for three years. Indeed, it
takes Hollywood liberties with a lot of things about my alma mater
in the movie (red uniforms?) _ reducing us, in a way, to
stool-pigeon stereotypes. African-Americans have been accusing TV
and movies of doing the same thing to them for years.
</P>
<P>
   When we feel that we have to exaggerate history to make our
point, don't we start to sound like our fathers did when they told
tall tales of five-mile uphill walks to school in the snow?
</P>
<P>
   But Sylvester's testament to the times is worth absorbing. In
1965, there were barriers to topple. They fell almost daily _ but
still too slow for some.
</P>
<P>
   Today's high school students will find the St. Aug-Jesuit saga
hard to believe. As Sylvester said by telephone, ``For them, to
think that people as close to them as their parents went through
this is tough to come to terms with.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems ludicrous that these two high-profile teams could meet
and still maintain the veil of silence. Yet they did. More than a
week passed, when finally a St. Augustine source leaked news of the
game to a columnist for the local Catholic weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The Purple Knights had ``won,'' 81-59. Their best player, Isiah
King, had scored 26 points. There was no mention about the
scrimmage or the five quarters or the most disturbing thing, to us,
about the historic meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, two Jesuit starters, Ronnie Britsch and Joe Williamson,
had not played. Britsch said last week that his father wouldn't let
him, because he didn't want his son, now a New Orleans dentist, to
jeopardize a college scholarship. Williamson said he wasn't allowed
to play because he was sick. Between them, the two starting guards
averaged 35 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Jesuit's star player is a fictitious Mike Malone.
In one compelling scene, neck reddening, Malone's father tries to
pull his son off the floor in the middle of the game. Two Jesuit
parents shout at the elder Malone to get off the floor and let the
kids play.
</P>
<P>
   Two more basketball seasons passed before a federal judge
finally forced the LHSAA to change its antediluvian rules and allow
schools like St. Augustine to join its ranks. The LIALO soon
disbanded. Voices were raised _ and people listened.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, that 1965 Jesuit team rolled through its state
playoffs, scoring more than 100 points twice in its final two
games. One week after the scrimmage, St. Augustine lost in the
first round of the LIALO playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Today, St. Aug and Jesuit continue to fight for first place in
the same basketball district.
</P>
<P>
   In its own silent way, my alma mater helped pave a way for that.
The Jesuit fathers who taught us in the '60s would surely approve.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody finally let the kids play. Even if Hollywood hadn't
noticed, there were good reasons to be proud of that.

STOCK DEALS RELY ON STAYING UP TO SPEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ Mary Curtin is not exactly the kind of
person you'd imagine as a day trader.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the tennis instructor and mother of two preteens
doesn't fit the profile of the average trader: She's not single,
and she's not a 25- to 35-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   None of that matters to Curtin, who hopes to start trading soon.
Right now, she's busy learning about it and working on a computer
model to help her trade better. The resident of Simi Valley
northwest of Los Angeles hopes to eventually make a part-time
career of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two children and I want to be there after school for
them,'' said Curtin, adding that it's not very lucrative for her to
rely on tennis for additional income since the prime time for
lessons is the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Her interest exemplifies the rising popularity of day trading to
all sectors of the population, be they homemaker or professor.
There are about 4,000 active day traders today, up from a little
over 1,000 in 1996, said Jim Lee, president of the Electronic
Traders Association in Washington, the industry's trade group. He's
also president of day trading firm Momentum Securities Management
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the rise in popularity so startling is that until
very recently, only the most savvy and experienced investors
attempted it. After all, day trading is a form of extremely
short-term investing. A day trader buys stock and sells everything
during the trading day. The trader doesn't hold positions
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is not to buy stocks whose long-term outlook is bright.
It's to buy stocks that are expected to go up within the next few
minutes or hours.
</P>
<P>
   The typical day trader is an unmarried male between the ages of
25 and 35, Lee said. He is highly educated _ 97 percent have
college degrees. Almost all had previous professional careers and
they are financially secure. The average annual income is $121,140
and their net worth is $648,271, according to a sampling of clients
at Momentum Securities.
</P>
<P>
   How hot is day trading among the masses now? There have been two
best-selling books on the subject in recent months _ ``The
Electronic Day Trader'' by Marc Friedfertig and George West, and
``How to Get Started in Electronic Day Trading'' by David S.
Nassar.
</P>
<P>
   Friedfertig and West are working on a follow-up book called
``Electronic Day Traders' Secrets.'' Nassar is also hard at work on
his own follow-up day trading workbook that will include
instructional videos.
</P>
<P>
   There are workshops and classes as well. Tradingschool.com, a
Glendora-based trading academy, sold out its $2,000 advanced
trading class in January in one day. Company President Robert Deel,
who's also a money manager and day trader, teaches the three-day
workshop.
</P>
<P>
   What sparked all this interest in day trading? Nassar says
advances in technology, a roaring bull market especially in the
technology sector and dissatisfaction with mutual fund or broker
performance have all contributed.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading really took off after the October 1987 crash, when
investors couldn't get through to their brokers to sell shares
because of jammed phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The information crunch convinced Nasdaq to launch the Small
Order Execution System, which gives small investors limited access
to trading information normally available only to major brokerage
marketmakers. Traders can see the market's buy and sell, or bid and
ask, prices.
</P>
<P>
   Bid is the price at which marketmakers will buy the stock from
an investor. Ask or offer is the price at which they will sell it
to you. Marketmakers profit from the difference or ``spread''
between what they bought it for and how much they sold it at.
</P>
<P>
   With SOES (pronounced like ``sows''), a trader can see the bid
and ask prices. If traders use a high-speed phone line to enter
orders, they can execute orders at the bid or ask. In contrast,
investors who call or e-mail their order to their broker have to
wait for the order to be processed. In the space of a few minutes,
the prices could have changed.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of SOES has led to the emergence of Electronic
Communication Networks, such as Instinet and Island. These are
systems that allow even greater access to trading information by
small investors.
</P>
<P>
   With ECNs, traders can get access to so called ``Nasdaq Level
II'' quotes. Not only do you get to see the bid and ask, you can
also put in your own bid and ask and snatch profits away from the
marketmaker. For example, if there's an offer to sell XYZ Corp.
stock at $49.875 and a bid to buy it for $49.50, the trader can
sneak in between the spread. The trader can offer to buy it at
$49.625 and sell it for $49.75.
</P>
<P>
   That yields a profit of 12.5 cents, excluding commission. If the
trader has 2,000 shares riding on it, that's a $250 profit on a few
minutes of work.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds easy? Seems like a license to print money?
</P>
<P>
   But reality is quite different.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   In Momentum's study of its day traders, the company found out
that 56 percent of them lost money in the first three months of
trading. The average loss was almost $21,000. Deel estimates that
as many as 92 percent lose money while Nassar puts the figure at 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But as traders gained knowledge and experience, the success rate
got better. That is, providing that the trader still had enough
money to play.
</P>
<P>
   Most traders lose money because they're not disciplined enough
to follow an investment strategy. With tens of thousands of dollars
riding on a typical trade, many can't take the heat when the stock
starts diving. Instead of cutting their losses quickly, their
emotions tell them to hope and wait for an upturn. But this could
very quickly ruin a day trader.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people don't have the discipline to sell their
trades,'' Nassar said. ``Day traders who don't learn that in the
beginning don't survive.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easier said than done. Even with the knowledge that they
should get out quickly if the situation is turning bad, somehow
many still don't.
</P>
<P>
   Osama Nimer should know. The Thousand Oaks resident has been day
trading for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, it's a lot of work,'' he said. ``Don't step
into it until you know how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   His best one-day gain was $3,000. His worst loss? $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Bui, a computer programmer and budding day trader from
Simi Valley, knows that he's going against incredible odds.
</P>
<P>
   But he's already an aggressive investor. Sometimes he doesn't
sleep well at night because he worries about his investments. By
being a day trader, he figures it will be easier on him since he'll
sell all his positions by day end.
</P>
<P>
   He has studied several strategies and feels prepared to handle
the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to set my own hours, my own pace,'' he said. ``The goal
is to be able to work a couple of hours a day.''

 CLEMENS SKIPS TEXAS FOR BETTER SERIES
SHOT (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By T.R. SULLIVAN
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; P &QR;  &LR; bu:Star-Telegram Staff Writer
 &LR; body: &QL; z10 &QR;  &QL; B &QR; TAMPA, Fla. Q  &QL; z10.8 &QR;  &QL; P &QR; Roger ClemensU agent said the
chance to
win a World Series was the main reason he accepted a trade to the
New York Yankees rather than hold out for a chance to pitch with
the Rangers.  &QL; P &QR; Randy Hendricks said yesterday the Yankees were
three times more likely to
win the World Series than the Rangers and that was more important
than ClemensU desire to pitch in Texas.  &QL; P &QR; Hendricks, arriving with
Clemens yesterday at the Yankees spring training
facility, was reacting to Rangers general manager Doug MelvinUs
comments last week when the Toronto Blue Jays traded the five-time
Cy Young Award winner to New York.  &QL; P &QR; Clemens, who lives outside
Houston, had the right to veto any trade
according to an agreement between Clemens and the Blue Jays. Melvin
said he was misled into believing ClemensU No. 1 goal was to pitch
close to home when he originally demanded a trade from the Blue
Jays last November.  &QL; P &QR; RI think there was some frustration on
DougUs part because he had been
working hard on this for two months,S said Hendricks, who accused
the Rangers of whining. RWe have a good relationship with Doug and
a high regard for him, but heUs taking into consideration just one
part of the equation. HeUs not considering the [World Series] ring
factor.  &QL; P &QR; RRoger wants to win a World Series. ThereUs a
distinction between being
qualified to make the playoffs and being qualified to win the World
Series. The Yankees are the most qualified to win the World Series.
The Yankees have a 60 percent chance of winning the World Series,
the Rangers have a 20 percent chance.S  &QL; P &QR; Melvin, reached at the
RangersU camp in Port Charlotte, said, RThatUs fine,
but say that from the start. Say your No. 1 priority is to go to
New York and if it doesnUt work out, get back to us. We thought he
wanted to be closer to home.S  &QL; P &QR; The Rangers thought they had
Clemens on Wednesday for outfielder Ruben
Mateo and two other players. But Toronto general manager Gord Ash
made one more call to the Yankees and instead traded Clemens to the
defending world champions for pitchers David Wells and Graeme Lloyd
and second baseman Homer Bush.  &QL; P &QR; Clemens, talking before his first
workout with the Yankees, said he had no
idea the Rangers had worked out a deal with the Blue Jays.  &QL; P &QR; RA
week ago I was planning to be [with the Blue Jays],S Clemens said.
RI
didnUt think anything was happening. It was real quiet until Randy
called late in the evening Wednesday.  &QL; P &QR; RHe said a trade was
imminent, said it was the Yankees and asked, is it on
or isnUt it. I said letUs go.S  &QL; P &QR; Asked about his stated desire to
pitch in Texas, Clemens said, RWeUve
talked about that many times. It would have been great. ItUs
hindsight now.  &QL; P &QR; RIUm excited to be here. This is a great
opportunity for me. I have an
opportunity to go out there in Yankee Stadium and be a part of
tradition, the monuments ... itUs exciting. I canUt wait to get out
there.S  &QL; P &QR; Hendricks also said the Rangers should have been willing
to give up Mateo
before Wednesday.  &QL; P &QR; RRuben Mateo was asked for by the Blue Jays
from December through
February,S Hendricks said. RIt was not until this week he was
included. If Roger was that important to them, why was Ruben Mateo
not included before so we could have been presented with a trade in
January?  &QL; P &QR; RThatUs my answer to the Texas RangersU public whining
about Roger.S
 &QL; P &QR; But Melvin said, RRuben Mateo earlier wouldnUt have gotten the
deal done.
We were still talking about Ruben Mateo, plus other players. For
example, Mateo and [Rick] Helling, which we didnUt want to do.S
 &QL; P &QR; Melvin said he has not spoken to Hendricks or his brother Alan
since the
trade was completed but will try to call them tomorrow.

CLEMENS SKIPS TEXAS FOR BETTER SERIES SHOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Roger Clemens' agent said the chance to win a
World Series was the main reason he accepted a trade to the New
York Yankees rather than hold out for a chance to pitch with the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Hendricks said yesterday the Yankees were three times more
likely to win the World Series than the Rangers and that was more
important than Clemens' desire to pitch in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks, arriving with Clemens yesterday at the Yankees spring
training facility, was reacting to Rangers general manager Doug
Melvin's comments last week when the Toronto Blue Jays traded the
five-time Cy Young Award winner to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who lives outside Houston, had the right to veto any
trade according to an agreement between Clemens and the Blue Jays.
Melvin said he was misled into believing Clemens' No. 1 goal was to
pitch close to home when he originally demanded a trade from the
Blue Jays last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was some frustration on Doug's part because he
had been working hard on this for two months,'' said Hendricks, who
accused the Rangers of whining. ``We have a good relationship with
Doug and a high regard for him, but he's taking into consideration
just one part of the equation. He's not considering the \RWorld
Series\S ring factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger wants to win a World Series. There's a distinction
between being qualified to make the playoffs and being qualified to
win the World Series. The Yankees are the most qualified to win the
World Series. The Yankees have a 60 percent chance of winning the
World Series, the Rangers have a 20 percent chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, reached at the Rangers' camp in Port Charlotte, said,
``That's fine, but say that from the start. Say your No. 1 priority
is to go to New York and if it doesn't work out, get back to us. We
thought he wanted to be closer to home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers thought they had Clemens on Wednesday for outfielder
Ruben Mateo and two other players. But Toronto general manager Gord
Ash made one more call to the Yankees and instead traded Clemens to
the defending world champions for pitchers David Wells and Graeme
Lloyd and second baseman Homer Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, talking before his first workout with the Yankees, said
he had no idea the Rangers had worked out a deal with the Blue
Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week ago I was planning to be \Rwith the Blue Jays\S,''
Clemens said. ``I didn't think anything was happening. It was real
quiet until Randy called late in the evening Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said a trade was imminent, said it was the Yankees and
asked, is it on or isn't it. I said let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his stated desire to pitch in Texas, Clemens said,
``We've talked about that many times. It would have been great.
It's hindsight now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to be here. This is a great opportunity for me. I
have an opportunity to go out there in Yankee Stadium and be a part
of tradition, the monuments ... it's exciting. I can't wait to get
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks also said the Rangers should have been willing to give
up Mateo before Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruben Mateo was asked for by the Blue Jays from December
through February,'' Hendricks said. ``It was not until this week he
was included. If Roger was that important to them, why was Ruben
Mateo not included before so we could have been presented with a
trade in January?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my answer to the Texas Rangers' public whining about
Roger.''
</P>
<P>
   But Melvin said, ``Ruben Mateo earlier wouldn't have gotten the
deal done. We were still talking about Ruben Mateo, plus other
players. For example, Mateo and \RRick\S Helling, which we didn't
want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said he has not spoken to Hendricks or his brother Alan
since the trade was completed but will try to call them tomorrow.

GRITTY ASU EFFORT GIVES EVANS 100TH WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - When Rob Evans spoke of his team being committed
Saturday, he wasn't referring to a place with straitjackets and
barred windows.
</P>
<P>
   Although the team's sloppy loss to Oregon on Thursday probably
had the Arizona State coach pondering such options, its effort
Saturday in an 87-66 victory over Oregon State gave him hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell early on we were committed to winning this
basketball game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Evans picked up his 100th victory and the Sun Devils kept their
very, very slim hopes for a spot in the NCAA Tournament alive with
a convincing win in front of 5,002 at Wells Fargo Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ASU (14-12 overall) takes over fifth place in the Pac-10 with a
6-8 record. The Sun Devils would need to win their remaining four
to have a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ASU dominated Saturday with its best defensive effort of the
season and one of its best overall performances. It forced a
season-high 24 turnovers with the help of 12 steals. The offense
fed off the intensity and got 23 points from Bobby Lazor, who
became the first two-year player in school history to score 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're just thinking, `Win one, win one, win one,
win one,' '' center Mike Batiste said. ``That's the only way we can
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils shot 52.5 percent from the field, their best
effort in 11 games and only the fourth time this season they've
surpassed 50 percent. They are 4-0 when they do.
</P>
<P>
   Evans was concerned coming into the game. The Sun Devils were
coming off a 76-75 loss to the Ducks in which they started off the
game 3 for 21 from the field. They were much sharper Saturday,
trailing just once early and leading by 10 less than seven minutes
into the game.
</P>
<P>
   `You know your own kids,'' Evans said. ``You just have a feel
for it. And I could see the seriousness as we were leaving the
locker room. There was no kidding around.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most complete games they've played on the
defensive end of the floor and executing on the offensive end.''
</P>
<P>
   The win avenged an 81-51 loss to the Beavers in Corvallis on
Jan. 21. The day after that game, Oregon State guard Deaundra
Tanner told a local paper he tried to defend House like he was ``a
girlfriend,'' suggesting he tried to stick as close to the guard as
he could.
</P>
<P>
   But House and his teammates took the comment as derogatory, and
used it as fuel in Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you go into somebody's house and they disrespect you,
you keep it in the back of your mind,'' Batiste said. ``You want to
get back at them.''
</P>
<P>
   They did and then some. The Beavers (12-12, 6-9) fall to 0-8 on
the road (vs. 6-1 at home) and are one game away from being the
first team in league history to lose all its road games and still
have a winning record at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a product of the (Sun Devils') energy and
aggressiveness,'' Oregon State Coach Eddie Payne said. ``They were
embarrassed in two ways: last Thursday night and the last time we
played them. They were ready to play today. They got us back on our
heels, and we weren't ready to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans insists he didn't talk to his team about revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a bone in my body that tries to get back at
anybody,'' he said. ``I've had so many things done to me in life,
that if I tried to get revenge on everybody, I'd waste a whole lot
of valuable time. Plus, we've lost 12 ballgames. So we'd have to
have a lot of revenge on people.''
</P>
<P>
   House finished with 16 points, seven assists and three rebounds.
Batiste had 15 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jason Heide led Oregon State with 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we still have a chance (for the NCAA Tournament),''
House said. ``We're in fifth place alone and they could take five
teams. I don't even want to talk about the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play every game like it's our last.'' &QL; 
Notes &QL; 
House's seven assists equaled his season high.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers' 24 turnovers were a season high.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils made 11 of 21 (52.4 percent) three-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams struggled from the free-throw line. ASU made 12 of 23
(52.2 percent). Oregon State hit 11 of 19 (57.9 percent). &QL;

IT WILL TAKE TIME TO LEARN THE EVANS' WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - A little late, but they finally get it. Finally
they understand why the new coach is in their face all the time,
waking them up to take drug tests, bringing them back for night
practices, demanding the kind of effort that they've never given
before.
</P>
<P>
   When you fly all over the court, when you play Doberman defense,
when you focus for 40 minutes, you thrash inferior basketball
teams. Like Oregon State. A team that, incredibly, beat Arizona
State by 30 earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   On a Saturday afternoon where empty seats stuck out like
tombstones, you realize just how far this program has fallen, just
how dysfunctional it has become. Since 1991, they've had a total of
six players stick around for four years. And in the past five
years, only four have played over 100 games, one being the immortal
Hedake Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The point-shaving scandal has drifted away, but what remains is
the reason the Sun Devils have likely blown their chance at an NCAA
berth: Softness. Low expectations. A toleration of failure that has
permeated the walls of Wells Fargo Arena.
</P>
<P>
   People have begun to wonder why ASU can't execute in the waning
moments of close games. It's not the play-calling. It's not really
a lack of talent, either. It's just a bunch of kids who don't win
because they're not winners. Because they're not consumed with the
idea. Because losing has always been acceptable in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Evans, the new coach who is terrorizing the old malaise,
knows what he's fighting. Other people's recruits. The permanent
stain of bad coaching. A party school that attracts kids for
reasons other than discipline and total commitment and banners that
hang from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all said and done, we're going to win some
championships,'' Evans sighed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the rebuilding hit rock bottom. Mike Batiste blew off
an academic session and had to run five miles at 5 a.m. on
successive days, including the morning of a game, just to avoid
suspension. And on Thursday, with an NCAA berth still attainable,
the Sun Devils offered an unforgivable effort in a loss to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Awvee Storey _ a transfer from Illinois who is
sitting out the season _ bolted into the locker room and blasted
his new teammates for their laziness. That night, Evans didn't
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   So. What's it like to run five miles at 5 a.m.?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to know,'' Batiste said. ``It's not so much the
running, but it's the time. It's dark. It's cold. You're in your
sweats.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's what I like about Coach Evans. There's no room for
mistakes in his program. Just look at the way we practice. You're
beat down. You're tired. And he's going to be up in your face,
getting you to compete. And he's going to stay in your face until
he gets it.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Saturday, they never competed like Evans did. Like Evans
wants. At least not for 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some rebellion, of course, because old habits die
hard. Because this team got tired of working as hard as Evans makes
them. Because they never had to before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the first time in my life that I've played defense so
competitively and aggressively,'' Batiste said. ``I wish he was
here when I was a freshman. I wish I had four years being taught
defense and discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he does, maybe he doesn't. But in a couple of years, Evans
will have his kind of kids here. One is Tanner Shell, who scored 27
points for Mountain View on Friday, playing with torn ligaments in
his ankle. Another is Chris Osborne, a kid from Los Angeles who got
so mad following a cheap shot that he punched the opponent in the .
. . uh, groin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tone kids down,'' Evans said. ``But you can't tone
them up.''
</P>
<P>
   No, you can't. And that's the reason why ASU can always play
them close, always flirt with the tournament. And the reason why,
in the end, they don't beat Arizona or UCLA. Why they always break
your heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Baron Davis wants a basket, you don't stop him, no matter
who he has to go through, if he has to slit your throat to do it,''
Evans said. ``Same thing with Jason Terry. You need those kind of
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Evans will get them. If he got them to sign with Ole
Miss, he'll get them to sign here. In two years, the Sun Devils
will be worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to take this program to another level,'' Batiste
said. ``Don't be surprised when it happens. He's going to get some
ballplayers up in here. He's going to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, all of the evidence will be gone. The Frieder factor. The
laziness. The nonchalance about losing and the indifference towards
winning. Everything that makes an underachieving program attract
5,000 fans for a weekend matinee.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Sun Devils met Evans' vision. A victory so
complete and thorough that it made you smile with hope. And made
you angry about the timing.
</P>
<P>
   A little late. But they finally get it. &QL;

ARIZONA WINS BATTLE WITH OREGON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Thanks to another game-winning shot by Jason Terry,
Arizona had just held off the Oregon Ducks, who were more foul than
fowl, in a physical battle Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But thoughts immediately turned to UA's trip to the Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-ranked Wildcats on Saturday will visit Pac-10 leader
Stanford, where they could move into a share of the lead. First, UA
faces California on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anyone talking about Stanford,'' UA Coach Lute
Olson said. ``Cal has had big wins over North Carolina and UCLA,
and I know how fired-up they will be for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can be thinking, or talking, about Stanford.''
</P>
<P>
   No problem for UA freshman power forward Michael Wright, who had
difficulty talking about anything after the Wildcats outlasted the
Ducks, 92-86, at McKale Center, giving UA (20-4, 11-3) its 12th
straight 20-win season. Wright suffered a deep cut inside his lip
when he was hit by the elbow of Ducks forward A.D. Smith. The wound
required two stitches.
</P>
<P>
   After emerging from the training room, Wright said that Oregon's
big men ``have 25 fouls to give and they give them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They just try to foul, but you've got to stay focused and play
through it,'' Wright said. ``You just work harder to get the
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I was coming up the floor and Flo Hartenstein just
put his chest into me. They were trying their best to body me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks also tried to body up UA center A.J. Bramlett, who
came away with a small cut on his nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their inside guys are all super-physical,'' Bramlett said.
``They all bang. That's what they're there for, just to beat you
up. Michael was telling me at halftime, `Man, they're beating me
up,' but you can't get frustrated. You have to stay with it. If you
stay aggressive, you keep getting the calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon, with a deep supply of big men, isn't afraid to use its
fouls in an attempt to intimidate, frustrate and pound a foe into
submission. It had some success, outrebounding UA, the Pac-10
rebounding leader, 43-37.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks were called for 32 fouls, giving Arizona 40 free
throws. UA made 31, including 8 of 8 by Richard Jefferson, 7 of 8
by Terry and 7 of 9 by Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Olson was irked that even more were not called.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding of the rule is that when the defender puts
both hands in your back, that's a foul,'' Olson said. ``That's the
same as the defender putting his knee in the back of the crotch.
You can't do that. I was concerned that somebody was going to get
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ducks guard Terik Brown said the Wildcats weren't choirboys,
either. They just got away with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to play as hard as we could, but when there are no
fouls being called on the home team on their floor, it makes it
hard,'' Brown said. ``Then it's hard for us to be aggressive when
every time you know you're going to get a foul called on you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Arizona had enough finesse to get through the
hack-a-thon. With the score tied at 84, Terry, the Pac-10 scoring
leader and a candidate for National Player of the Year, caught a
cross-court lob from Jefferson in the left corner and swished a
three-point shot with 1:22 left.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Terry grabbed a fumble by Oregon's Alex Scales that led to
two free throws by Jefferson, giving Arizona a five-point edge with
58.1 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practice, we work on catch-and-shoot, that's all I was
thinking about,'' Terry said. ``If the guy was not on me, I was
going to shoot it right away. Earlier, we had run that same set and
they got a guy out on me. This time, they didn't. It was like, yes,
I'm finally open.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry, who scored a career-high 37 points against the Ducks in
Eugene, Ore., last month, scored 32 this time.
</P>
<P>
   When his shot was shaky early, Bramlett (22 points, eight
rebounds) and Wright (19 points, 13 rebounds) took control inside.
Jefferson added 18 points and five assists.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona seemingly was on the verge of a blowout when Bramlett
posted up Ducks center Mike Carson for a basket and a 12-point lead
with just over 15 minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   But Oregon (14-10, 6-9), which had won four straight and was
battling for an NCAA Tournament bid, did not give in. By spreading
the floor and moving the ball crisply, it managed to keep the UA
defense a step behind. The result was a stunning 26-7 spurt, capped
by a 12-0 run that gave Oregon a seven-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're streaky,''Jefferson said. ``They have three-point
shooters so they can get back in a game in a hurry.''

CACTUS LEAGUE EXPECTING BIGGER CROWDS THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - They are the three tenors of spring training: a
singer, a swinger and the master of the dinger, whose presence in
Arizona could help the Cactus League hit a high note in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The additions of Garth Brooks and Mo Vaughn and the return of
slugger Sammy Sosa have some speculating that the league will
surpass 1 million fans for the first time in its 46-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it will happen,'' Cactus League President Jerry
Geiger said. ``A lot of the early activity this year seems to
indicate we're going to have a banner year.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers and catchers for the 10 league teams have reported.
Position players will arrive this week, and games start March 3 and
4.
</P>
<P>
   Poor weather and the addition of the Diamondbacks contributed to
an attendance drop of nearly 10 percent last season. But with
cooler, rainy days less likely this spring, league officials are
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs, who train at Mesa's HoHoKam Park, said ticket
sales are ``way ahead of last year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to see Sammy,'' said Dawn Berry, HoHoKam Park
ticket manager. ``Even people who don't know who he is. I get calls
saying, `I was told to buy tickets by so-and-so to see that guy who
broke the record.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Berry said ``our phones went crazy'' in January when a snowstorm
hit the Midwest. Tickets are available for all games, although
those against popular opponents, including the Diamondbacks, are
going fast.
</P>
<P>
   Geiger said he believes baseball's strong finish, particularly
the home run derby between Sosa and St. Louis first baseman Mark
McGwire, will lure fans. The Cubs' wild card playoff berth also
left Chicago faithful hungry for more.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres, who train at Peoria Stadium, invited
country music star Brooks to spring training. Whatever the
motivation, it surely will put a few more fans in the seats.
</P>
<P>
   The league gained Vaughn, one of the game's most feared
sluggers. The former Boston first baseman, who has a career .304
average, signed as a free agent with the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The league lost volatile Albert Belle, who left the Chicago
White Sox for the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   And it returns the American and National leagues' rookies of the
year, Oakland outfielder Ben Grieve and Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood.
</P>
<P>
   It may gain at least one more team. The Los Angeles Dodgers are
involved in serious discussions with Fort McDowell Indian Community
officials, who have proposed a $20 million training facility. A
decision is expected by April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're impressed by our discussions,'' said Bob Wymbs, Dodgers
special projects director. `But it's a serious subject and we're
still in the evaluating stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribe in November proposed the Fort McDowell Four Peaks
Sports Complex, a 12,000-seat stadium with six practice fields, to
lure the Dodgers from Vero Beach, Fla., where they have trained
since 1948. The tribe believes it could have the practice fields
ready for spring training next year.
</P>
<P>
   Vero Beach residents have put up a fight, and city and county
officials have stepped in to help. But they are concerned because
geographically, the move makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   All four Dodgers rivals in the National League West _ the
Diamondbacks, Padres, Colorado Rockies and San Francisco Giants _
train in Arizona, as do the American League's three West Coast
teams: the Angels, A's and Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Cactus League traditionally deals with far
fewer rainouts than the Grapefruit League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quite honestly think (delaying their decision) bodes well
for us,'' Geiger said. ``There are so many economics working in our
favor. It's not to say they couldn't stay in Florida, but I think
we have some very significant advantages that are going to be very
difficult for Florida to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers already have a strong fan base in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a definitive word on the Dodgers, spring training
should provide the state with a significant economic boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can break 1 million people,'' Geiger said, ``we're
looking at $110 million, $115 million in direct spending coming
from outside the state. That's nothing to lose sight of.''
</P>
<P>
   About 58 percent of the fans at least season's games were from
outside the state, according to a study by the Behavior Research
Center. They averaged 5.4 nights during their stay and spent a
median of $200 per day.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strong statement about how far the league has come from
seven years ago, when it nearly folded after the Cleveland Indians
defected to Florida. It revived itself with $71.5 million in county
funds from a surcharge on rental cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is parallel to the feeling of a spring training
baseball game in Arizona,'' Geiger said. ``Nothing. This is going
to be a great year.'' &QL;

TRYBA PLAYS THROUGH THE BIG NAMES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN STREGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. _ On a historic venue that carries Ben
Hogan's imprint and accordingly is a fitting setting for a Tiger
Woods-David Duval duel, a PGA Tour journeyman intruded.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Tryba flirted with a 59 Saturday, then settled for a Riviera
Country Club-record 10-under-par 61 to open a two-stroke lead at 13
under par entering the final round of the Nissan Open.
</P>
<P>
   The Woods-Duval scenario was not erased, precisely, but the
prospects dimmed in the aftermath of a day rife with low scoring.
Woods, bidding to win for the second week in a row, shot a 65 and
is part of a three-way tie for second at 11 under with Davis Love
3d (68) and Ernie Els (68). Duval, meanwhile, shot a 67 and is tied
for fifth, four behind Tryba.
</P>
<P>
   Riviera is known as Hogan's Alley, a stretch of historic road on
the golf map that previously had not demonstrated such generosity.
Tryba came to the difficult par-4 18th hole needing a birdie to
shoot 59. Instead, his second shot went over the green, leading to
a bogey that still enabled him to eclipse the record of 62 set by
Fred Couples, Larry Mize and Kenny Perry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard he had a chance to shoot 59 I thought, `That's
almost unbelievable,''' Els said. ``I don't know what these guys
have been doing in the off season. Riviera is one of the classic,
tough courses. I don't think you'll ever see 61 here again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tryba has won just once in seven-plus years on the PGA Tour and
is better known for his quantity of golf than his quality. In each
of the last six years, he has played 32 or more events.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of his making a run at history Saturday was
further diminished by a lack of sleep on Friday night. ``I was
really tired,'' he said. ``I was worried about what I was going to
do out there, but when I made a birdie at 6 I started to wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned in a four-under-par 31 on the front nine. He eagled
the 11th hole, then birdied five of the next six holes, moving to
the 18th tee and a possible 59.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was thinking about 59 on the 18th tee. ``I had no
idea what the course record was,'' he said, ``but I knew that
shooting 59 at Riviera would make history.''
</P>
<P>
   He drove it in the fairway at 18, then chose an 8-iron for his
second from 168 yards out. The ball hit near the pin and skidded
over the green, effectively ending his bid, but failing to dampen
his spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Tryba said that he had been telling Ben Bates, his playing
partner, ``that I felt like I was playing a J.C. Goosie event down
in Florida,'' referring to the mini-tour. ``The courses are so easy
down there you've got to shoot seven-under every round to win.''
</P>
<P>
   An equally imposing challenge awaits Tryba in the final round,
when he must fend off challenges from those on this gilded leader
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best players in the world are right there,'' Els said. ``I
think Ted Tryba's going to have an uneasy night tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is perhaps the most serious challenger. He won the Buick
Invitational last week by shooting 62 and 65 on the weekend, and he
already has matched the 65 here. His putter, a nemesis of sorts in
the last year, has become an ally again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the ball probably the best I've hit it all week,'' Woods
said. ``I left a few shots out there, though. I missed four golden
opportunities today, putts from 15 feet and in. But I made some
great par putts, too.'' &QL;

HULL REUNION PROVES TO BE JOYOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the longest time, it was rumored that they had one of the
most strained father-son relationships in professional sports. But
Hall of Famer  &UR; Bobby Hull and his Hall of Fame-to-be son,  &UR; Brett,
apparently have patched up whatever differences they may have had.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby came to Dallas last week to watch Brett play in person for
the first time this season. He hung around the locker room, joked
around with his son and was mobbed during and after the game by
autograph hounds.
</P>
<P>
   Brett, who is as colorful and as outspoken as his father,
reportedly had tried to distance himself from his dad, especially
after Bobby was accused in August of making racially insensitive
remarks concerning  &UR; Adolf Hitler, which the elder Hull still
emphatically denies.
</P>
<P>
   But the two were all smiles at Reunion Arena on Monday during
their personal reunion of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even seen him on TV,'' said Bobby, who resides in
Chicago. ``All they show up there are Blackhawk games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every guy loves to have his father watch him play,'' Brett
blushed. ``But with me, my dad's a Hall of Famer. I told him this
might be the only arena where he could get in the stands (without
being noticed). Obviously not.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a fun night for the Hulls, the only father and son
in NHL history to have scored 500 goals and 1,000 points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``He realizes the game is different,'' Brett said. ``He said,
`They didn't pay me enough to listen to the coach in my day. But
since you get paid so much, I guess you need to listen to the
coach.' '' &QL; 
Team Turmoil &QL; 
The soap opera continues in Chicago, where it gets stranger by the
day with the dysfunctional Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the latest episodes involves Coach  &UR; Dirk Graham and
leading scorer  &UR; Tony Amonte, who got into an obscenity-laced
shouting match the other day during practice.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Graham contended it was a ``setup'' aimed at a
``Chicago'' ``Sun-Times'' beat writer for a story suggesting that
Amonte should be traded if his talents aren't going to be fully
utilized by the first-year head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing between Tony and I,'' Graham said, insisting
it was all a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Amonte's reaction was puzzling, however: ``If that's what he
said, then that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it for a moment. Amonte is angry that Graham
removed him off the power play's first unit, replacing him with
underachieving
 &UR; Eric Daze. And Graham's comments in explaining the move prove that
where there is smoke, there usually is fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last four, five games, I don't think the entire first unit
has done the job,'' he said. ``Tony Amonte and the rest of the
first unit should be on the second unit. Same with  &UR; (Chris)
Chelios. My responsibility is not to Tony Amonte to see he gets 30
or 40 goals. My responsibility is to this team.'' &QL; 
Playoff suggestion &QL; 
Edmonton Oilers General Manager  &UR; Glen Sather has an idea about
reformatting the NHL postseason. Instead of 16 teams making the
playoffs (eight from each conference), Sather would increase it to
20 teams and give the two conference regular season champions
first-round byes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe make the first round a best-of-five again, too,'' Sather
said. ``The league's expanded, but we haven't expanded the playoff
picture. I think it would help Canadian teams, and there's only six
of us. Right now, three of them (Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal)
are out, and we're just hanging on.
</P>
<P>
   ``And second, hockey goes to a different level in the playoffs.
How many bad playoff games do you see in Round 1? Hardly any. Lots
of upsets. I don't think it is (a lousy idea).''
</P>
<P>
   But it'll never fly. First of all, if the No. 1 seeds each
receive a bye in Sather's proposed 20-team format, it would create
an unbalanced playoff tree of nine remaining teams in each
conference. Second, owners won't go back to the five-game series
because they'd lose potential revenue. And last, who wants to see
more sub-.500 hockey teams in the playoffs, anyway? &QL; 
Looking back &QL; 
Who got the better end of the  &UR; Petr Nedved-Alexei Kovalev deal
between the Pittsburgh Penguins and New York Rangers earlier this
season?
</P>
<P>
   Entering the weekend, Nedved had 11 goals, 29 points and was a
minus-7 for New York. In two fewer games, Kovalev had 15 goals, 31
points and was a plus 7 for the Penguins. He also had a 10-game
point-scoring streak during Pittsburgh's recent 10-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nedved has cooled down quite a bit, and Alexei has gone better
lately,'' Rangers General Manager  &UR; Neil Smith said, ``but I think
it's been a good deal for both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Except the Rangers probably won't make the playoffs. &QL; 
Whiteout scoop &QL; 
The Coyotes haven't announced it yet, but team officials are
planning a major promotion involving the team's popular
``Whiteout'' tradition in which fans all show up to home playoff
games dressed in white.
</P>
<P>
   Details are sketchy, but part of the promotion will involve
giving the Whiteout exposure, apparently at a pre-playoff function
or two in March. Said a team official: ``It's going to be huge.
It's going to take the whole Whiteout concept up many, many
notches.''
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned. &QL; 
Souvenir pucks &QL; 
There was somewhat of a fiasco over who owns the rights to the last
puck ever scored at Maple Leaf Gardens and the last puck used in
the game between Toronto and Chicago last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Maple Leafs defenseman  &UR; Jason Smith had the game-ending puck
taken out of his hands by an official with the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Someone from the Leafs then snatched it back, saying it belongs in
the team's new arena.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's  &UR; Bob Probert, who scored the last goal in the old
building, said the Hall of Fame wants the puck, but he'd like to
keep it for obvious reasons. He kiddingly wondered how much it
might fetch at an auction, not that it ever would bring as much as
 &UR; Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball, which went for about $3 million
to Ahwatukee resident  &UR; Todd MacFarlane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you a hundred bucks right now, Canadian,'' teammate
 &UR; Doug Gilmour told Probert with a laugh. &QL;

JOHNSON OK WITH BACKUP BACKSTOPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Paul LoDuca has 14 major-league at-bats.
Angel Pena batted 13 times for the Dodgers last season, which is
the depth of his major-league career. They are also the
front-runners to back up Todd Hundley at catcher this season.
</P>
<P>
   And if injury were to saddle Hundley for a prolonged period of
time, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he isn't worried about an
inexperienced replacement handling one of the most talented
pitching staffs in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we could have traded (Charles) Johnson if we
didn't have Angel,'' Johnson said. ``You have to have a backup
plan, which is Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca, 26, is considered the favorite for the backup role, but
the 24-year-old Pena is considered the Dodgers' top prospect. Also
in camp is Encino native Tim Laker, who played in 29 games for
Tampa Bay and Pittsburgh last season, but there's no secret as to
what the Dodgers are thinking long-term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have to be prepared and I want them to know if
something does happen, I can play every day,'' said LoDuca, in his
seventh season in the Dodgers organization. ``But I understand the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the ideal situation would be to send Pena to
Triple-A Albuquerque so he could catch every day, but unforeseen
circumstances could keep him with the Dodgers for the start of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Testing the ankle: Before Dodgers shortstop Jose Vizcaino
worries about whether he'll beat out Mark Grudzielanek for the
starting job, or whether he'll be traded before the season begins,
he had to satisfy his mind that his ankle was fine.
</P>
<P>
   He accomplished that the last few days and now feels as if his
ankle injury, which caused him to miss the final three months of
last season, is healed and healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taking ground balls in L.A. The only thing I wasn't
doing was running straight ahead,'' Vizcaino said. ``When I was
hurt last year I couldn't run straight without it hurting. The last
few days, I ran straight and there wasn't a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been widely speculated that general manager Kevin Malone
will deal either Vizcaino or Grudzielanek before the Dodgers break
camp. Grudzielanek is considered the leader to remain with the
club. However, Vizcaino, who had surgery on his ankle Oct. 2 to
remove scar tissue and a loose body near the deltoid ligament, said
he expects to get a fair shake in the shortstop battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a legitimate shot,'' said Vizcaino, who batted
.262 last season and is considered a defensive shortstop. ``I just
have to prove that I'm healthy. That's what I have to show. They
know I can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and pepper: Right-handed pitcher Luke Prokopec, a
long shot to make the opening day roster, arrived in camp Saturday
after straightening out visa problems in his native Australia. It
leaves closer Jeff Shaw, awaiting the birth of his third child in
Washington Court House, Ohio, as the lone pitcher or catcher not in
camp. At the earliest, Shaw is expected on Wednesday. . . . Dodgers
bullpen catcher Travis Barbary and his wife, Raquel, had their
second son, Colt Travis Barbary (5 pounds, 18.5 inches long)
Friday. Dad is expected at Dodgertown in a few days. . . . The
Dodgers will wear their traditional blue caps and white home
uniforms for the first time today after wearing blue tops and white
caps the first few days as part of a major-league promotion.

U.S. TEAM NEEDS KIDD'S ATTRIBUTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks as if Suns guard  &UR; Jason Kidd may not be included among
the first nine players selected to represent the United States at
the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   At least as of Friday night, the selection committee had not
contacted Kidd, who has said on several occasions that he hopes to
represent the United States as a Dream Team member someday.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little hard to believe he has been overlooked every time.
True, the international rules require a lot of shooters, and that
always has been the knock against Kidd. But let's face it, a team
loaded with NBA players is not going to be short on scoring and
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The team is going to need players who are willing to distribute
the ball, and few are better than Kidd in that regard. He wasn't
chosen for the World Championships team that boycotted that
tournament last summer in Greece because of the NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears likely that many of those 12 players will be
among the nine selected for the team that will compete this summer
in Puerto Rico to qualify for the Olympics and, assuming that team
finishes among the top two in qualifying, the team that will
compete at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that players of that caliber obviously are
under consideration,'' said  &UR; Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner
and president of USA Basketball. ``It's really a difficult decision
because it's different when you only have nine to pick. Sometimes,
players are picked based on one particular skill. It doesn't mean
they're a better player than somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The three point guards on the World Championships team were
 &UR; Gary
 &UR; Payton of the Seattle SuperSonics,  &UR; Terrell Brandon of the
Milwaukee Bucks and and  &UR; Tim Hardaway of the Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to argue with Payton or Hardaway, who have paid their
dues and deserve to represent the United States. But both are
scoring point guards first, and so is Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   Three players will be added to the team before the Olympics. If
Kidd isn't among the first nine, hopefully the selection committee
will see that Kidd is an entertaining player to watch, and a guy
other players love to be on the court with.
</P>
<P>
   And he'll give them the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There definitely will be three more players picked after we go
qualify, and they'll be NBA players,'' Granik said. ``We usually
end up with at least one player who is injured or can't play for
some reason. That means we'll have at least three or four spots. If
a player hasn't been picked yet and they're one of the top-caliber
players in the league, they're going to have a chance to make the
Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   Suns forward  &UR; Tom Gugliotta already has been asked to represent
the United States and has told USA Basketball that he'll give the
two-year commitment to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unbelievable honor,'' said Gugliotta, who worked out
in preparation for the World Championships after missing the second
half of last season because of an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   If Kidd joins Gugliotta, the Suns could have three players in
the Olympics. Center  &UR; Luc Longley has a contract clause that allows
him to compete for the host Australians, who automatically
qualify. &QL; 
Pistol perfect &QL; 
Boston Coach  &UR; Rick Pitino is the lastest to see a little of a
basketball legend in Sacramento rookie guard  &UR; Jason Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take at look at their starting five and their front line of
 &UR; Corliss Williamson, Vlade Divac and  &UR; Chris Webber _ it's as good as
anybody in basketball,'' Pitino said. ``And then you take the
backcourt with  &UR; Pete Maravich and the 6-9 shooting guard  &UR; (Predrag
 &UR; Stojakovic), and you've got yourself a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino isn't the first to draw comparisons between Williams and
Maravich, the late Hall of Fame guard. Pitino had Williams in one
of his camps while coaching at Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   And Williams has heard these Maravich parallels because of his
ballhandling, long-range shooting and flair on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know much about Pete Maravich,'' he said. ``I've only
seen a couple of tapes on him, but I'm glad people compare me to
him because he was such a great player.'' &QL; 
Horrors &QL; 
The Charlotte Hornets lost two centers to free agency, they once
gave up on signing  &UR; Alonzo Mourning, and they may lose  &UR; Glen Rice
next because owner  &UR; George Shinn is too cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Coach  &UR; Dave Cowens has ticked off the front office so much
that he'll probably be gone, too. In the past couple of years,
Cowens has been lauded as one of the league's best new coaches for
the job he has done with the Hornets under tough circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   And he wants a contract extension before agreeing to return for
next season. But he probably isn't going to get one after going
public to say he feels underappreciated by the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the plan?'' Cowens said of the Hornets' problems. ``Do
we have a plan? With all the stuff that's going on, I don't know
what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Management is furious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team is already wrecked with injuries,'' General Manager
 &UR; Bob
 &UR; Bass said. ``For your head coach to make statements like this, he's
actually damaged the team further.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many hits can this team take? He's the leader of the team
saying something like that. It's very unfortunate to me. I was
shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Cowens' future, Bass was evasive: ``He's our coach
of record right now.'' &QL; 
Family feud &QL; 
 &UR; Shaquille O'Neal and  &UR; Kobe Bryant of the Lakers got into a shoving
exchange after a hard foul during informal workouts, but both
players insist that no hard feelings have carried over to the
season.

<P>
   ``It wasn't a big deal. That's just competitiveness coming
out,'' O'Neal said. ``We're always going to be good friends. It was
just a hard foul, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Bryant both said that Bryant was slammed to the floor
by O'Neal on a drive to the basket, and Bryant got up to angrily
protest the foul, shoved O'Neal and got shoved back a few times.
</P>
<P>
   No punches landed, and the two were quickly separated.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I guarantee you this, I'll bet you nobody else on another
team will do that to Kobe,'' O'Neal said, ``Especially while I'm
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said: ``When you have two young, enormously high-profile
players together, when you have a team that hasn't yet hit its
stride, when you have a giant hunger for news about the Lakers in a
league famous for intrateam feuds, this stuff is bound to be
stirred up.'' &QL;

STILL CAN'T FEEL NBA'S POWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Set aside your anger for just a moment, non-believers, and
embrace the remote control.
</P>
<P>
   Feel the power of David Stern stinging your fingers and bruising
your soul? No? Good, that means you're not insane. OK, power up the
TV and pray that the almighty - your local cable outlet - will
allow these doubts to be washed clean by making the Classic Sports
Network available.
</P>
<P>
   On the Classic Sports Network, there will be visions of
basketball players with tragic hair and shorts that may be judged
pornographic in certain states and Texas. Verily, ignore those. But
check out the defense. Ah, don't see any? Right, most of the guys
you'll see on the Classic Sports Network couldn't guard a lawn
jockey.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to today's NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The custodians of hoop purity - the same citizens who screamed
bloody murder when Jerry West abandoned his crew cut - are howling
about an allegedly disturbing trend.
</P>
<P>
   That trend is insufficient scoring. We're still waiting for
reports from league-sanctioned groupies at our major precincts, but
it's true - scoring IS down. The evidence: In the first two weeks
of the current NBA season, the Sacramento Kings rank as the only
squad averaging more than the magical 100 points per game. Last
season, four teams finished the season above the century mark. The
season before, it was eight. The four seasons prior to that reveal
a back-tracking trend of 13, 16, 20 and, finally (in the 1992-'93
season), 25 teams averaging triple digits.
</P>
<P>
   Should the league pardon Paul Westhead?
</P>
<P>
   No, the league should consider the lead culprit for what is
perceived to be offensive offense: Defense. Most teams actually
play it now.
</P>
<P>
   Just last season, Miami coach Pat Riley - the madman who cooked
up ``Showtime'' - was asked if defense in today's NBA is superior
to the brand played in the '80s. Riley's answer was shocking.
Riley's answer was ... yes.
</P>
<P>
   A second opinion was offered by Clippers vice president of
basketball operations Elgin Baylor, who had to walk 12 miles - each
way - through the snow to achieve the status of old school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense,'' Baylor said, ``gets better every year.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution? Who needs a solution? Basketball with defense is
goooood. In fact, basketball snobs who preach about the superiority
of the college game typically insert the overriding tactic of
defense into debates on why the NBA is too gruesome to behold.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the Chicago Bulls win six championships in eight years?
Michael Jordan. OK, Michael Jordan and defense, at which Jordan
excelled.
</P>
<P>
   So, quit whining about the quality of NBA offense; you're the
same baby who refuses to watch the All-Star Game - because nobody
plays defense.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're disillusioned about poor free-throw shooting, feel
free to keep howling.
</P>
<P>
   Tom's rule of thumb
</P>
<P>
   When Tom Gugliotta was liberated from the Minnesota Timberwolves
by the Phoenix Suns, the All-Star forward reportedly took the
opportunity to compare point guards.
</P>
<P>
   Googs issued a comprehensive thumbs-down to former teammate and
alleged ballhog Stephon Marbury. But new teammate Jason Kidd was
judged as just dandy, the kind of point guard who creates joy from
a simple fast break.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of marriage in Phoenix, Gugliotta's scoring
average (20 points per game) and shooting percentage (50 percent)
are the same as they were with mean ol' Marbury in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Our days are numbered
</P>
<P>
   Remember how Grant Hill and Tim Duncan became targets for
vigorous fouling by union members who didn't think the young stars
were completely down with the lockout cause?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it could be coincidental, but Hill's free-throw attempts
per game are up to 12 from 8; Duncan's have risen by 5.8 to 8. In
the meantime, Hill is walking toward the light of superstardom by
improving his mid-range jumper. Subsequently, his field-percentage
has elevated from 47 to 53 percent. ...
</P>
<P>
   The aforementioned Kidd is threatening to justify his years of
advance hype by improving his shooting accuracy. Kidd, whose career
field-goal percentage is 39 percent, is making 46 percent of his
shots so far this season. ...
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 NBA Draft's first round has provided the league with
seven players who are starting as rookies. That includes ex-Arizona
star Michael Dickerson, selected by Houston at No. 14. ...
</P>
<P>
   The league's worst field-goal shooting team is (ta-da) the
Chicago Bulls, who check in at less than 40 percent. Nothing
against Tex Winter and his lovely triangle offense, but now hear
this: YOU CAN'T WIN IN THE NBA WITHOUT STAR PLAYERS. ...
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   Three former UCLA Bruins just happened to get injured Friday,
which also is the same day teams were required to trim their active
rosters from 14 to 12. The wounded (all first-year ex-Bruins) are
Toby Bailey
</P>
<P>
   (Suns), J.R. Henderson
</P>
<P>
   (Grizzlies) and Jelani McCoy
</P>
<P>
   (Sonics). The injury bug also has infected former Long Beach
State standout Lucious Harris,
</P>
<P>
   who was placed on the injured list by the Nets. ... A
double-feature coming to a drive-in theater near the Forum:
``Around The Worm In 80 Days'' and ``West's Side Of The Story.''
... A scientific survey of five NBA scouts reveals that Long Beach
City College star Schea Cotton
</P>
<P>
   should forget pro hoops for a year or two and play college ball
when his thigh bruise finally heals. ... Before Friday's 11-board
effort, Piston followers thought the translation of ``Bison Dele''
was ``Doesn't Rebound.'' The former Brian Williams
</P>
<P>
   was managing just six rebounds per game. ... Now that Marv
Albert
</P>
<P>
   is employed by Ted Turner,
</P>
<P>
   we have decided TNT can be defined as ``Teeth 'N' Toupee.''

BIG, CLUMSY KID GROWS UP _ AND HOW  
 TAIT IS IMPRESSIVE AT NFL COMBINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ His baby fat is gone. John Tait is no longer a
stumbling fool.
</P>
<P>
   Those kids in the Tempe Pop Warner League won't believe that he
has grown up to a chiseled 6 feet 6, 310 pounds. He can bench press
470 pounds and squat 660, run the 40-yard dash in 4.9 seconds and
has only 12 percent body fat.
</P>
<P>
   Tait, the Brigham Young University junior who is considered the
best offensive line prospect in this year's NFL draft, had a strong
showing Friday at the league's scouting combine.
</P>
<P>
   He bench pressed 225 pounds 26 times and wowed NFL scouts during
his interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's big, strong, athletic and we had an impressive meeting
with him,'' New Orleans Saints General Manager Bill Kuharich said.
</P>
<P>
   Tait didn't even get riled when he was asked stupid questions by
teams, including this one: ``If you were an animal, would you be a
cat or dog?'''
</P>
<P>
   Another club asked Tait, a Tempe McClintock High School
graduate, to define success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not usually big on BYU (offensive linemen), but he really
came off well,'' an NFL executive said. ``What a prospect. What a
nice young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Tait is the same guy who says he was terrible at the Pop Warner
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a big, clumsy kid who got beat up in practice,'' he
said. ``I was always big, so I had to play against kids two years
older. I wanted to quit, but my dad wouldn't let me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was even involved in a protest because me and another kid
weren't playing. Each us was supposed to play five plays. We didn't
play.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Tait reached high school, the clumsiness was gone.
Arizona State, Colorado, Texas, UCLA and BYU wanted him, but he
chose the Cougars because he was impressed with offensive line
coach Roger French.
</P>
<P>
   After a redshirt freshman year, Tait was gone. He went on a
Mormon mission for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people go to place like China,'' he said. ``I went to
Knoxville, Tenn., where there was barbecue and pinto beans. I was
one of those guys on bicycles wearing badges. Whenever people there
saw me, the first thing they asked, because of my size, was if I
played football. Football is a religion there. It was a great
icebreaker. We ended up talking about the Vols.''
</P>
<P>
   Tait weighed 270 pounds when he left on his mission. When he
returned to BYU in 1996, he had put on 20 pounds. It wasn't because
of his cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``My cooking was horrible,'' he said. ``Toast was my speciality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an intense learning experience, two years of being on
your own. Your focus was totally on serving other people. But some
people when they come back from their mission are not nearly as
good as players or don't have that desire. I had to relearn how to
play. But none of that desire was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Tait struggled his first few practices after returning. He felt
awkward and uncoordinated. But by the end of spring workouts in
1996, he won the starting job at left offensive tackle that he
never relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   He was a first-team All-Western Athletic Conference selection
his sophomore and junior years. Late last season, he decided he was
going to turn pro with one year of eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people said, `Stay for the Outland (Trophy),' '' said
Tait, 24. ``I'm not big on that stuff. I was getting good reports
back from the NFL and thought I was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN draft expert Mel Kiper predicts Tait will be the first
lineman chosen and will go 10th overall in the April 17 draft.
``Sports'' ``Illustrated'' has him going 12th.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who need offensive linemen, surely will consider
him with the eighth pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a long way from being out of football three years
ago,'' said Tait, who is 40 credits short of graduating from BYU
with an English degree.
</P>
<P>
   Tait, who is represented by Phoenix agents Eric Metz, Ethan Lock
and Vance Malinovic, knows he will hear a lot of draft rumors
during the next two months. He might even hear some at home.
</P>
<P>
   He has moved in with his parents in Tempe, and his father, Alan,
a Tempe insurance man, has become a draftnik.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a hobby for him,'' Tait said. ``He looks up
draft boards on the Internet. He likes mock drafts. He likes to
look at all the angles. He has become a pretty good evaluator of
talent. He'll say, `So and so doesn't have good feet.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to enjoy the whole thing, and I'll play anywhere.
They're writing checks. I'm strapping it on.'' &QL;

SWANN THRILLED BY PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals defensive tackle  &UR; Eric Swann thinks he is way ahead of
schedule in recovering from knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels good,'' Swann's agent,  &UR; Steve Zucker, said at the NFL
scouting combine in Indianapolis. ``He thinks he can play
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Swann's condition has been the subject of much speculation since
he elected to go to Vail, Colo., in December to have controversial
knee surgery performed by Dr.  &UR; Richard Steadman.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, Swann had arthroscopic knee surgery done by
Cardinals doctors but decided to have further surgery because he
still felt pain in the knee.
</P>
<P>
   He wound up missing the final 11 games, and with him out of the
lineup, the team's run defense slipped to 20th in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopefully optimistic,'' Cardinals Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin said
when told of Zucker's update on Swann's condition. ``He's a big
part of this football team. We missed him when he wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't just the plays he makes. The attention the other team
places on him allows other guys (on defense) to make plays.'' &QL; 
Procrastinating &QL; 
For the first time, Cardinals officials are acknowledging that if
starting outside linebacker  &UR; Jamir Miller leaves in free agency,
the team will have a hard time replacing him in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The thought has been that if Miller, an unrestricted free agent,
goes elsewhere, the Cardinals will use one of their two first-round
picks on an outside linebacker to fill that hole.
</P>
<P>
   But the best outside linebacker prospect,  &UR; Jevon Kearse of
Florida, is actually an undersized end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The War Room'' draft publication describes Kearse as
``somewhat of a tweener much in the mold of a  &UR; Simeon Rice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals still can find ways to bring back Miller if they
do some creative financing. Other teams do it. Jacksonville
restructured several contracts to add free agents
 &UR; Carnell Lake, Gary Walker and  &UR; Kyle Brady.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom have the Cardinals re-structured contracts because it
requires extending deals and giving new signing bonuses. The
Cardinals aren't a cash-happy team with a wealth of resources.
After all, they spent more than $33 million on bonuses for
quarterback  &UR; Jake Plummer, defensive end  &UR; Andre Wadsworth and Swann
in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Cardinals lose the 25-year-old Miller, they will
catch a lot of public grief for not getting his deal done a year
ago and then putting the franchise tag on wide receiver  &UR; Rob Moore
instead of Miller, who was their leading tackler last season.
</P>
<P>
   All of the criticism will be directed at  &UR; Bill Bidwill Jr., team
vice president who makes the financial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches and players want Miller back. Team executives  &UR; Rod
 &UR; Graves and  &UR; Bob Ferguson have made no secret of their wishes to
re-sign him. Owner  &UR; Bill Bidwill would like to have Miller back if
the team can fit him under the cap. But Bidwill Jr. has failed to
pull the trigger. He's still waiting to see what Miller's price tag
is and whether the team can afford him. &QL; 
Mock draft &QL; 
``The War Room'' has the Cardinals taking North Carolina State wide
receiver  &UR; Torry Holt with the eighth pick overall and mammoth
offensive tackle  &UR; Lonnie Shelton of Eastern Michigan at No. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals would love that scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, 6 feet, 190 pounds, is the best receiver in the draft and
would fill their speed need. He runs the 40-yard dash in 4.4
seconds and is an outstanding return specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, 6-5, 324 pounds, is a terrific athlete with good genes.
He is the son of former NBA forward  &UR; Lonnie Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have the best upside of any offensive lineman in the
draft,'' the ``War Room'' writes. &QL; 
Mighty mite &QL; 
Without a place-kicker on their roster, the Cardinals could take
one in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The best kicker is Kansas State's  &UR; Martin Gramatica, who could
go as high as the third round.
</P>
<P>
   He kicked a 65-yard field goal against Northern Illinois last
season and has kicked a 75-yarder in pregame warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Gramatica, a 5-8, 160-pound native of Argentina, didn't play
football until his senior year of high school near Fort Myers, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a soccer player who didn't know anything about
football,'' Gramatica said. ``Sometimes I would kick an extra point
or field goal and forget about the kickoff. It happened in two or
three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know how to tackle. As kickers, all you can do
is dive at their legs.'' &QL; 
Serious business &QL; 
How badly do the Denver Broncos want to become the first NFL team
to win three consecutive crowns?
</P>
<P>
   Owner  &UR; Pat Bowlen said they spent $22.8 million on free agent
cornerback  &UR; Dale Carter, formerly of Kansas City, because ``as you
can see, we're very serious about a three-peat.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos linebacker  &UR; Bill Romanowski called Carter the most
complete cornerback in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who can cover anybody and knock the
you-know-what out of you,'' Romanowski said. '`He's got a little
nasty in him, and I like to see that.'' &QL; 
Rappin' with Ricky &QL; 
The agent for Heisman Trophy winner  &UR; Ricky Williams is rapper
 &UR; Percy &UR; ``Master P'' Miller, who shares a rap label with  &UR; Silkk the
Shocker,
 &UR; C-Murder, Snoop Doggy Dogg and  &UR; Mystikal.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the Texas running back who is expected to be one of
the first two players picked in the draft, said he has no plans to
become a rap star. He already has a hobby, baseball, and he plans
to report to the Texas Rangers' spring training site in Port
Charlotte, Fla., on March 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play as much baseball as I can without interfering
with football,'' said Williams, an eighth-round pick of the the
Philadelphia Phillies in 1995 who has played four summers in the
minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is Number 1. It's been that way for the past four
years.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the team that drafts him ``will get all of me. You get
paid to play 16 games, and I'm going to be there the whole football
season.'' &QL;

DEAL WITH PIRATES NEEDS SELIG'S OK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ From the ``Your Check is in the Mail Dept.'' comes the
trade between the Diamondbacks and Pittsburgh Pirates that is
supposed to send outfielder  &UR; Bernard Gilkey and cash to Pittsburgh
for infielder-outfielder  &UR; Tony Womack and outfielder  &UR; Al Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which has more or less been set for a week, is
contingent upon how much deferred money in Gilkey's contract the
commissioner's office is willing to allow the Diamondbacks to pick
up. The figure could run as high as $6 million. The transaction was
still under review Saturday, despite calls to Commissioner  &UR; Bud
Selig from
 &UR; Jerry Colangelo, Diamondbacks managing general partner, &UR; and Pirates
owner  &UR; Kevin McClatchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd certainly like to get something done before the players
head to Florida and Arizona to their original teams,'' Diamondbacks
General Manager  &UR; Joe Garagiola Jr. said, ``and then have to turn
around and go back the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the two clubs' equipment managers exchanged uniform
sizes for the players involved. &QL; 
Them's fightin' words &QL; 
Three days into the spring, and the Diamondbacks already have
bulletin board material for motivation.
</P>
<P>
   A quote from Los Angeles Dodgers General Manager  &UR; Kevin Malone
regarding his team's lofty expectations found its way into the
Arizona clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks spent $118.9 million on free agents over the
winter, including $52.4 million over four years for left-hander
 &UR; Randy
 &UR; Johnson. But the Dodgers surpassed that with $142 million,
including a three-year, $17 million contract reconstruction for
closer  &UR; Jeff Shaw; &UR; a three-year, $12.4 million deal for former
Diamondbacks center fielder  &UR; Devon White; and the jaw-dropping,
seven-year, $105 million contract for right-hander  &UR; Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's crystal ball says the Dodgers will reach the World
Series against the defending champion New York Yankees, who
acquired right-hander  &UR; Roger Clemens in a trade with the Toronto
Blue Jays on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll need Roger when they play us in the Fall Classic in
October,'' Malone said. ``It'll be fun. It will be nice to see
Kevin Brown and Roger Clemens matched up in October.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks might as well pack their bags and go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy smoke,'' was Garagiola reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't bragging if you can back it up,'' said Manager  &UR; Buck
 &UR; Showalter, a tinge of sarcasm in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks will be the first to find out whether the
Dodgers can back up Malone's words. The clubs square off in the
season opener April 5 at Dodger Stadium, when Johnson is expected
to duel Brown, and again a week later in Arizona's home opener at
Bank One Ballpark. &QL; 
Eye to eye &QL; 
When the time comes for Showalter to remove the 6-foot-10 Johnson
or 6-6 right-hander  &UR; Andy Benes from games this season, he has some
special instructions for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them they'll have to stand at the bottom of the hill
and I'll stand at the top. Otherwise, I'll look kind of dwarfy,''
the 5-10 Showalter said. &QL; 
Say aaahhh &QL; 
Pitchers and catchers will have physicals today beginning at 6:30
a.m., but Showalter and his coaching staff will go first at 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad thing about it is we can't drink any coffee before
coming in,'' Showalter said. &QL; 
Heads up &QL; 
The Diamondbacks and the other 29 major league clubs are wearing
special spring training caps as a marketing ploy by Major League
Baseball Properties to sell more types of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's caps, which will be worn all spring, are black with a
purple bill and a snake holding a baseball in its mouth. The logo
was part of the club's inaugural patch, although there is no
reference now to the inaugural season. &QL;

PAIN NEVER EASES FOR RED SOX FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big news of the week, at least on the field, centered around
the New York Yankees' acquisition of five-time Cy Young Award
winner
 &UR; Roger Clemens in a trade with Toronto that looks awfully tilted in
favor of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The talk around New England is that the Yankees have once again
shoved a dagger in the backs of Red Sox fans. The fact that a
Boston icon such as Clemens can possibly put on the dreaded Yankee
pinstripes has folks in Beantown wondering whether they're little
more than the butt of jokes for New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The trade that netted Toronto pitchers  &UR; David Wells and  &UR; Graeme
Lloyd and infielder  &UR; Homer Bush has Red Sox fans feeling as if all
the old wounds from past Boston failures have been opened again.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' move from the Blue Jays to the dreaded Yankees has fans
all over New England recalling the single biggest gaffe in Boston's
storied history, the trade that sent  &UR; Babe Ruth to the Yankees for
cash in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, every Red Sox fan, young and old, has been programmed
to know that Boston has not won a World Series since the Ruth
transaction. But now this? Clemens pitching for the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   This latest move may push many Red Sox fans over the edge. How
much longer can Bostonians remain the punching bag for the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   Even though he had nothing to do with the trade, Boston General
Manager  &UR; Dan Duquette may lose his job over this move. Duquette is
still blamed as the single reason Clemens decided to leave Boston
two years ago when he signed with Toronto as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, one other bit of potential irony to look for this summer: If
he has the chance, Yankees Manager  &UR; Joe Torre might start Clemens
in the All-Star Game. This year's site? Boston's Fenway Park. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who was the last switch-hitter to win the American League Most
Valuable Player award? Answer later. &QL; 
Fun quotes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cincinnati Reds reversed a 32-year-old policy to ban
facial hair last week, several Reds players came up with some
beauties last week. Here's a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder  &UR; Dmitri Young: ``Some people are real ugly without
facial hair, and I'm one of them. We can hide behind beards and
mustaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman  &UR; Pokey Reese: ``See what one man can do? A lot of
things might change around here. Maybe earrings are next.'' (The
one man was  &UR; Greg Vaughn, who pleaded through the Cincinnati media
to change the rule).
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Danny Graves: ``No beard for me. It would take me 10
years to grow one, and all you'd see are some wild hairs. Maybe
when I reach puberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Infielder  &UR; Jeff Branson: ``I'm not growing a beard. I'm at the
stage where I want to look younger, not older.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher  &UR; Eddie Taubensee: ``Oh, boy: New uniforms, facial hair .
. . we've got a whole new good look. I wore a goatee every winter,
and my wife says I look meaner and tougher with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager  &UR; Jack McKeon, who wore a full mustache when he managed
in Kansas City and Oakland: ``No, I'm not going to grow one. This
just makes my job easier, one thing less to worry about, although I
only had to say anything to players about not shaving three or four
times last year. All I care about is what they do on the field.'' &QL; 
Out of touch? &QL; 
Kansas City outfielder  &UR; Johnny Damon lost his arbitration hearing
last week and will have to settle for $2.1 million in 1999 instead
of the $3.2 million he was seeking after batting .277 last season.
</P>
<P>
   The loss did not sit right with Damon, who is represented by
 &UR; Scott
 &UR; Boras, known throughout the game as someone who gets the highest
possible salary for his clients. It's a safe bet that Damon will
remember this loss, although his thinking seems a bit off for those
of us who live in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a better player than $2.1 million,'' Damon said.
``I'm going to get ready for another big year, and I'll see them
back at arbitration next year and the following year, and then I'll
get to set my price as a free agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras couldn't have said it better. &QL; 
Bad blood on I-5 &QL; 
Count San Diego General Manager  &UR; Kevin Towers as a non-believer in
the revamped and more expensive Dodgers. Towers last week predicted
that Los Angeles, which will have a major league-record payroll
somewhere near $90 million, will not win the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because a team like the Dodgers spends more money, it
doesn't mean they're going to be a better club,'' Towers said. ``It
just means that the Padres and the Giants need to be a little
wiser. I'll say right now, and I'll go on record with it, that
either the Giants or the Padres will finish in front of the
Dodgers.'' &QL; 
Problems with Pudge &QL; 
The Texas Rangers once again will attempt to get perennial All-Star
catcher  &UR; Ivan Rodriguez to help Rangers pitchers prepare the day of
games.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's pre-game routine does not include going over
opposing hitters, which was said to have angered new Diamondbacks
starter  &UR; Todd
 &UR; Stottlemyre, who started 10 games for Texas last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't something that just developed,'' said Manager
 &UR; Johnny
 &UR; Oates, a former catcher. ``It's something that's been ongoing.
We're trying to incorporate it more. It's something we'll continue
to work with him on, so he can get better at it.'' &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
Oakland Athletics pitcher  &UR; Vida Blue in 1971. Yes, it was a bit of
a trick question. But it is true. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; The fleecing of the smaller markets continues: Say what you want
about the New York Yankees' addition of five-time Cy Young Award
winner  &UR; Roger Clemens, but it seems Toronto should have, and could
have, received more than the three players the Blue Jays got from
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A preview of the lead story on Wednesday nights
 &UR; sports shows: St. Louis first baseman  &UR; Mark McGwire, whose life
will forever be changed after last season, is scheduled to report
to spring training Wednesday, the first day of full workouts for
that club. It should be quite a circus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Barbaro Garbey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Expensive, but worth it?: Texas, which paid Montreal $100,000
for outfielder  &UR; Ricky Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner, learned
last week that the running back/outfielder will report to the
Rangers' spring training camp. Williams, who likely will be the
first or second player picked in the NFL draft, will report March 9
with other position players.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Sesame Street White Sox?: Take away  &UR; Frank Thomas (eight
years and 63 days) and  &UR; Ray Durham (five years), and  &UR; Greg Norton
(1 year, 82 days) is next on the list for the White Sox among
non-pitchers in terms of major league service time. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Philadelphia's projected starters after ace  &UR; Curt Schilling
combined for 16 big league victories last season. In an unrelated
note, the Phillies also have relaxed their policy on players'
wearing earrings. The ban continues on the field but no longer
applies to the clubhouse or travel.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati reliever  &UR; Stan Belinda, who was diagnosed with
multiple sclerosis in August, is in camp and has been cleared to
play. Belinda injects himself once a day with an FDA-approved drug
that decreases the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' everyday lineup, if it remains intact, will have five
players in a row who had at least 90 RBIs last season:  &UR; Rusty
 &UR; Greer,  &UR; Juan Gonzalez,  &UR; Rafael Palmeiro,  &UR; Ivan Rodriguez and  &UR; Todd
Ziele. Only three other clubs this decade could say the same thing:
Toronto in 1993, and Baltimore and Seattle in 1997. By the way, all
those clubs made the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Marlins Manager  &UR; John Boles made it official last week
in declaring that former ace  &UR; Alex Fernandez, who missed all of
last season while rehabilitating a rotator cuff injury, has been
selected as the opening day pitcher April 5 against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sammy Sosa, the reigning NL Most Valuable Player, continued his
whirlwind off-season pace last week by accepting an ESPN award on
Monday and then jetting off to Las Vegas for a promotional stop
before going to Los Angeles on Saturday to shoot a McDonald's
commercial. He is scheduled to get back to baseball this week in
Mesa. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
Now that Cleveland has watched the Yankees add  &UR; Roger Clemens, the
Indians have decided to send scouts to watch Oakland's
 &UR; Kenny &UR; Rogers and Kansas City's  &UR; Kevin Appier throughout the spring
for possible trades. Hot prospect  &UR; Richie Sexson could be the bait
used to make a trade. Also, the Indians have signed  &UR; Orel Hershiser
to a minor league deal.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is talking to the agents who represent pitchers  &UR; Jamie
Moyer and  &UR; Jeff Fassero and first baseman  &UR; David Segui, who can
become free agents after this season. Each may receive a two-year
extension with an option for a third season.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh made a three-year offer worth $16.5 million recently
to all-everything first baseman  &UR; Kevin Young. But Young may be
seeking something closer to a five-year deal for $30 million, a
figure he surely will receive if he becomes a free agent after this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is very willing to listen to offers for second baseman
 &UR; Jeff Frye and/or outfielder  &UR; Troy O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   With a burgeoning payroll that is nearing $90 million, Los
Angeles may try to trim some of that by trading the shortstop that
does not win the starting battle between  &UR; Mark
 &UR; Grudzielanek and  &UR; Jose Vizcaino.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego, which still hopes to trade reliever  &UR; Randy
 &UR; Myers, has had interest from the Chicago White Sox and Seattle. &QL;

D-BACKS TRY TO DESIGN WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Somewhere out there, in a drawer with the second sock
that nobody can ever seem to find, is the answer to the
Diamondbacks' baseball puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   During the team's inaugural season in 1998, there were plenty of
pieces, but only a few seemed to fit. The rest were discarded after
a 65-97 finish.
</P>
<P>
   A new season lies just ahead, and Managing General Partner Jerry
Colangelo has brought home a box full of new pieces, most through
free agency (price tag: $118.9 million) and a few through trades.
</P>
<P>
   Forming a complete picture is the task of Manager Buck
Showalter. He is optimistic about coming closer, yet knows the
remaining pieces won't be available at least for another few years.
</P>
<P>
   That won't, however, stop the process from moving forward. It
began Feb. 17 when pitchers and catchers reported to Tucson
Electric Park and continues Tuesday with the arrival of the
position players.
</P>
<P>
   When he turns the box upside down and allows the pieces to fall
on the table, just what does Showalter have?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, a vastly improved pitching staff with three new
starters _ Randy Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre and Armando Reynoso. A
new key middle reliever _ Greg Swindell. Two new starting
outfielders _ center fielder Steve Finley and left fielder Luis
Gonzalez _ with the possibility of a third _ Tony Womack, coming
aboard via a trade.
</P>
<P>
   With the new players and anticipated improvement of two key
players from last season _ third baseman Matt Williams and Jay
Bell, who is moving from shortstop to second base _ the
expectations have increased considerably. Could the team be good
enough to challenge for a wild-card playoff spot?
</P>
<P>
   Showalter doesn't seem to be worried about added pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody has more expectations than I do,'' he
said. ``Our goal is to get better every year. We want to become
competitive and then stay there. If anybody has a problem with
being in that situation, then they'd better be on their way.''
</P>
<P>
   His primary objectives over the next six weeks are finding a
reliable batting order, solidify the right-handed portion of the
bullpen, increase the on-base percentage and cut down on
strikeouts. The latter area was particuarly frustrating last
season, when Arizona led all of baseball with 1,239.
</P>
<P>
   Depth has improved, both in the outfield and infield. Greg
Colbrunn, another free-agent signee, will be a factor as well as
another strong effort from versatile Andy Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Finley appeared the man most likely to lead off as camp opened,
but likely would drop to No. 2 if Womack joined. If Womack stayed
with Pittsburgh or went elsewhere, Gonzalez likely would bat
second, followed by first baseman Travis Lee, Williams, right
fielder Bernard Gilkey, Bell, catcher Kelly Stinnett and shortstop
Tony Batista.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several times last season when I wanted to give our
starters (position players) a day or two off, but the drop-off (in
talent) was so significant, I couldn't. That wouldn't have been
fair to the fans,'' Showalter said. ``That shouldn't be as much of
a problem this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who is one of baseball's biggest intimidators, has been
under the spotlight since he signed a four-year, $52.4 million
free-agent contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy makes everybody around him better,'' Showalter said.
``It's tough to put together a big inning against him. He's always
three pitches away from getting out of an inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who was a combined 19-10 for Seattle and Houston last
season and led the majors with 329 strikeouts, downplays that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're considered the ace, what does that make the other
four guys in the rotation?'' Johnson said. ``Everybody is No. 1 on
their particular day.''
</P>
<P>
   If the starters and middle men can get to the eighth and ninth
innings with the lead, right-hander Gregg Olson will be called upon
to keep things on course and earn the save, which is what he did on
30 occasions last season to revive his career.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Oly' has got great moxie. He's got a big heart,'' Showalter
said. ``He understands how to evaluate hitters' strengths and
weaknesses and make adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell is making the adjustment from short to second and Williams
will attempt to put a season full of nagging injuries behind him.
He has been a frequent visitor to the weight room at Bank One
Ballpark during the off-season. He appears more muscular and even
has added a small barbed-wire tattoo around a bicep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matty doesn't pay a lot of lip service, but you can tell he's
quietly on a mission,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee looks to have redistributed some of his weight and muscle
and is anxious to improve on last year's finish of .269, 23 home
runs and 71 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bored of being bored,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Batista doesn't have the shortstop job locked up, he
probably rates an edge over young Danny Klassen because of a .273
average and 18 home runs in just 293 at-bats last season. &QL;

DEPTH HAS MALONE BULLISH ON BULLPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he wasn't
sure whether he'd bring 10 or 11 pitchers west when the season
begins. He'll decide late in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   That he has viable options is news in Dodgertown. The bullpen
isn't set, but for the first time in a while it should be solid
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an area we knew we had to address and I think we
did,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``When you look
at it, we're going to have a few guys who can close games.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile offseason moves were the trade for catcher Todd
Hundley and the free-agent signing of Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time in a few years the Dodgers have a
legitimate, top-line closer in Jeff Shaw, whom Malone signed to a
three-year, $14.1 million contract to keep him in Los Angeles. In
the past two seasons, he's saved 90 games, including 48 last season
in time split between Cincinnati and L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel very, very confident when you know he's the closer
coming in,'' Dodgers second baseman Eric Young said. ``We've got
the other guys that are set-up guys, and I think the makeup,
overall, is very good. I think they did a good job of mixing not
only ability but personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Dodgers bullpen went 24-22. Its 3.88 ERA ranked
eighth in the National League, below each of the three division
winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone was confident in the guys we had... but I
think when Shaw comes in and gets 25 saves (with the Dodgers), I
think it always eases you when someone like him is on the mound,''
Dodgers starter Darren Dreifort said. ``We started the season last
year and everything seemed in place, and we lost half our team and
half our coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw brings a presence to the bullpen, but its stabilization
isn't about blockbuster moves but rather the discreet acquisitions.
It's about trading Bobby Bonilla to acquire right-hander Mel Rojas
in hopes he regains the form he had with the Montreal Expos, when
he was the best set-up man in baseball. It's acquiring the
hard-throwing Alan Mills from the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Antonio Osuna appears healthy after having a bone
spur removed from his right elbow in September, and there's also
the situation involving Dave Mlicki. He could be traded during the
spring, moved into the rotation or shifted into the bullpen to add
depth.
</P>
<P>
   Malone also covered the left-hander angle, or so he hopes. He
brought in Greg Cadaret to be the situational left-hander who can
turn around a lineup during the middle of the game or get one out
late in the game. And Malone is also keeping an eye on southpaw
Chris Haney, a nonroster invitee to camp who's been impressive in
the early going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mills is a Mike Jackson waiting to happen. Mills is getting
really close,'' Malone said. ``Haney's got a chance. He's a
big-time sleeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll have a quality bullpen.''

LOAIZA FACING MAKE-OR-BREAK SPRING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Rangers general manager Doug Melvin
summoned right-hander Esteban Loaiza into his fourth-floor office
at The Ballpark in Arlington during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The message: Realize your potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitchers with good arms generally fall into one of two
classes,'' Melvin said yesterday morning underneath a bright sun
illuminating the Rangers' Charlotte County Stadium spring training
complex. ``They either rise to the occasion or ... .''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin did not complete the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' Jan. 26 acquisition of veteran right-hander Mike
Morgan, though, completes Melvin's thought sufficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza must produce this spring or risk being banished to the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason why he shouldn't be able to do what Rick
Helling and Aaron Sele did and take advantage of being on a good
ballclub,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Helling emerged as the Rangers' first 20-game winner since
right-hander Kevin Brown went 21-11 during 1992, and Sele's 19
victories matched that of Red Sox right-hander Pedro Martinez and
trailed only the 20 posted by Helling and right-handers Roger
Clemens and David Cone among American League pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do that, too,'' Loaiza said confidently.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin extended the challenge to his pitcher this winter, and
Loaiza remembers their conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that he wanted me to be the Jose Lima of last
year,'' Loaiza recalled. ``I can do that. I'm with a good team that
wins a lot of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima went 16-8 with a 3.70 earned-run average during 33 starts
for the Houston Astros during 1998. Twenty-five of those resulted
in a quality start, defined as an appearance of six or more innings
with three or fewer earned runs surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen plenty from Esteban to know that he can be a very
successful major-league pitcher,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates
said. ``It's our job _ physically, mentally and emotionally _ to
get him to that level three out of every five starts. If we do
that, he'll be a very successful pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza and Lima share similarities in age and major-league
experience. Loaiza celebrated his 27th birthday Dec. 31, and Lima
turned 26 on Sept. 30. Each enters this season with three years and
52 days of major-league service time.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, though, experienced his breakthrough season during 1998.
Loaiza went 9-11 with a 5.16 ERA during 35 appearances, which
included 28 starts, with the Rangers and Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good arms sometimes develop a little later, but he's at that
age,'' Melvin said. ``He's got good enough stuff, and now he has
the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin acknowledges that Loaiza possesses ``a better arm than
Lima.'' That explains why the Rangers parted with minor-league
second baseman Warren Morris, whom Melvin says will emerge as a
successful major-league hitter, and right-hander Todd Van Poppel to
acquire Loaiza in their July 17 trade with the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers assistant general manager Dan O'Brien describes Loaiza's
fastball and slider as above-average pitches, and Oates calls the
pitcher's sinker ``way above average.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza demonstrated as much during his first start with the
Rangers, and catcher Ivan Rodriguez's response relayed that to
Oates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Pudge coming back to the duguout with his mouth
open,'' Oates recalled. ``That was the best stuff he had caught all
year with our rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have great stuff,'' Loaiza said. ``I've looked at the
videos. I've talked to other players, and they say the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuff,'' though, does not make a pitcher. Command, Oates said,
does.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin introduced Challenge No. 2 for Loaiza by acquiring
Morgan, a 39-year-old veteran with nearly 17 years of major-league
experience, to compete for what likely will be the final berth in
the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting to see how he responds to that,''
Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The time is now.

   ``I really believe there is a thing such as a late bloomer,''
Oates said. ``There are guys _ for whatever reason _ boom! Who's to
say _ with the stuff he has _ that it won't happen to him?''

 Showalter eager to get show going for Year 2  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

   TUCSON - He was home for most of three months, enjoying the
off-season with his family. But on Christmas Day, shortly after the
gifts under the tree were exchanged, and the colorful packages
opened, he began to grow restless.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks his wife noticed the change. She
recognized that distant day-dreamy look. At the family dinner table
Angela could see in her husband's eyes that he was somewhere else,
far from hearth and home. Hello? Yoo hoo. Earth to Buck. One night
Mrs. Showalter wondered why she had gone to the trouble to cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might as well have ordered pizza,'' Buck Showalter said,
smiling as he quoted his wife. His mind, he confessed, had been 100
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Time slowed. The days dragged. The Diamondbacks manager mentally
paced the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season's almost here,'' Greg Schulte, the team's radio
play-by-play announcer greeted Showalter one day last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season ``is'' here,'' Showalter replied.
</P>
<P>
   He waited until he could wait no longer. On Feb. 12 the manager
grabbed his suitcase. ``I had it packed for two weeks.'' He
described the two-hour trip to Tucson as one of the most
pleasurable drives he can remember.
</P>
<P>
   Only the equipment men were on the scene when he arrived. Buck
beat the pitchers and catchers to camp by five days.
</P>
<P>
   Buck unlocked his office at Tucson Electric Park. He sat in his
desk chair. He smiled a smile the public rarely sees. He was back
on the job, at home away from home, happy and comfortable in the
familiar surroundings, doing what he loves.
</P>
<P>
   His small office adjoins a meeting room. Directly across the
hall is the laundry and training camp kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen countertop is almost as well stocked with breakfast
cereal, each canister is labeled _ Raisin Bran, Frosted Flakes,
Honey Bunches of Oats and Frosted Mini-Wheats _ as the Diamondbacks
are loaded with quality starting pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Ten steps away is the carpeted clubhouse. Showalter walked along
the row of empty seats. He read the new nametags above the
cubicles. Randy Johnson. Todd Stottlemyre. Steve Finley. Armando
Reynoso. Greg Colbrunn. Luis Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   When Gregg Olson arrived, and surveyed the neighborhood, the
right-handed closer said aloud what his manager may have been
thinking over the winter months when the organization invested
almost $120 million on free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be pretty good,'' Olson said. ``Just because the
name of the team is `Diamondbacks' doesn't mean we're an expansion
team anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring training is heralded as a rebirth. Baseball is a
butterfly emerging from its cocoon. Hope springs eternal for every
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is upbeat,'' Showalter said. Optimism. That's what
the manager likes most about spring training. At spring training
``everything is a best-case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks should be a lot better. For the money spent
they ``better'' be. Upgraded pitching. A new improved outfield. A
more experienced Travis Lee. Optimists say this team could contend
for the division title.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter can't wait to start anew. What manager wouldn't get
excited when one corner of his clubhouse is occupied by Andy Benes,
Omar Daal, Johnson and Stottlemyre. In only their second season,
the Diamondbacks have assembled one of the best starting rotations
in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have pressure on us to win, but it's a good pressure,''
Stottlemyre said. ``I'd rather have that kind of pressure than
people saying `Maybe you can win ``next'' year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So forgive Showalter for his preoccupation at the family dinner
table. His mind was on batting orders, lineups, the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Now spring is here, and not a day too soon. Buck swings a bat in
the clubhouse. Huddles with coaches. Zips around the complex in his
golf cart. Blows big pink bubbles with his chewing gum. Showalter
can't hide his eagerness. He feels most at home in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   At his first media gathering, Showalter watched as one, two,
three TV stations positioned their microphones on the conference
table in front of him. Mikes and tape recorders in place, the
signal everyone was ready, Buck folded his arms. Looked around the
room. Waited. Smiled as the silence grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's that woman (at presidential press conferences) who
always asks the first question?'' Showalter asked playfully,
referring to White House press corps veteran Helen Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   I thought for a second about asking Buck whether losing 97 games
last season is worse punishment than impeachment, but that was
then, and this is now. &QL;

BELL MAKING SURE CHANGE 2ND TO NONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ The imprint of a circle in Jay Bell's back pocket isn't
a can of dip. It's a compass.
</P>
<P>
   He will need it, at least for a while, as he adjusts to his move
from shortstop to second base for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not since his early days with the Cleveland Indians organization
in the mid-1980s, and before that as a high school sophomore in
Florida, has Bell been at second for an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play a position for so long that everything just becomes a
natural movement,'' he said. ``You don't really have to think, you
just go . . . most of the time, you end up in the right place at
the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell probably feels as if he's trying to drive in England. He's
on the opposite side of the car on the opposite side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   He had a two-week indoctrination period in the final 15 games of
last season. The true test will come this week, when he begins
working with infield defensive coach Brian Butterfield and primary
shortstop candidates Tony Batista and Danny Klassen.
</P>
<P>
   Will double plays bring double trouble?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily moving across the bag (at second)
differently, more or less away from the play, it's not being able
to see the (base) runner,'' Bell said. ``At shortstop, you usually
can see him all the way. But at second, you kind of have to get a
feel, a sense, of how close the man is.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bell signed a five-year, $34 million free-agent contract
before the club's inaugural season, some around baseball were
stunned. Critics said his range at short was average, and so was
his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who was 32 at the time, was sluggish at times, perhaps not
getting to the ball as quickly as he could have. Yet on similar
plays on other occasions, he would track it down, set himself and
make a crisp throw for the out.
</P>
<P>
   Bell also was struggling at the plate. He began the season
batting second and hit .249 there, striking out more than his
share. A lot of those, he said, came with two outs and with the
team struggling on offense as a whole, ``you try to get something
going by hitting the ball out, overswinging rather than staying
within yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, Bell kept his frustration to himself. Once in
a while, it snuck onto his sleeve. After all, he was only human.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter had a closed-door meeting with Bell to
clear the air, reaffirm Bell's purpose and talk about the future.
</P>
<P>
   The skipper had been toying with the idea of moving Bell. With
his pride at stake, part of Bell wanted to remain where he was.
Another part was open to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood the thought process behind it,'' Bell said. ``It
was good that Buck showed appreciation for me as a player by asking
me about it rather than just going ahead and doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what position you play, you can't really go out and
make excuses. You have to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my goal, and the goal of the organization, to compete
for a championship, and if we can accomplish that within the next
four years that I'm here by me being at second, then that's what I
will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be good for the club and good for Jay,'' he said. ``If
we can do it from the start of the spring, having him and Brian
(Butterfield) work together, they'll find a way to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The club's pursuit of Pittsburgh second baseman Tony Womack
would have no bearing on Bell's switch. Womack would play right
field and only in an emergency play second.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Bell likely will remain in the No. 6 spot in the
order, where he hit during most of the second half of 1998 (.284,
with nine of his 20 home runs).
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of more veterans to aid the cause, particularly
in the pitching department, should enable the offense to relax,
Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   As for 1999, he wants to show leadership as he did last season
with third baseman Matt Williams. Bell attributes a large part of
his inner strength to his faith in God. A trip to Israel shortly
before training camp began and seeing many of the areas described
in the Bible helped Bell gain perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Character means a lot. It's how they deal with other people.
Do they care about their teammates?'' Bell said. ``Despite our
struggles last year, I wouldn't trade it for anything. It may have
been the most enjoyable season I've had. It may be a clichea, but I
think there was chemistry between the older and younger guys. There
was enthusiasm and I think we can have that same thing again this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Having that compass in his back pocket certainly can't hurt,
either. &QL;

KANSAS DEFENSE WAKES UP, STOPS OKLAHOMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ After Texas Tech's Rayford Young scored 32
points against Kansas in less than nine minutes, the Jayhawks spent
the entire two hours of their next practice working on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was embarrassed after that game,'' Kansas coach Roy
Williams, who recorded his 300th victory, said. ``I told the guys
before the game to be in a frenzy on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Oklahoma needed more than 33 minutes to score its
33rd point against the Jayhawks. The Sooners (19-8, 9-5) were
limited to 26.5 percent from the field yesterday as Kansas (18-8,
10-4) moved into a second-place tie in the Big 12 Conference with a
60-50 victory yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think a team could shoot 26 percent,'' said
Oklahoma's Eric Martin, who contributed to his own disbelief by
making 2-of-14 shots and missing all eight of his 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The game set a Lloyd Noble Center attendance record of 13,219.
The Sooners did their best to send all of the customers home with
their very own missed field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas' defense pushed Oklahoma away from the basket. The
Sooners, the Big 12's best 3-point shooting team, attempted a
season-high 32, but made just seven. In the first half, when OU
shot just 16.1 percent, the Sooners were 1-of-16 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can beat anybody if we shoot just 40 percent,'' Oklahoma
coach Kelvin Sampson, whose team had a six-game winning streak end.
``We couldn't throw it in the ocean if we were standing on the
shore.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Oklahoma's poor shooting, Kansas struggled to a 20-14
halftime lead. That's because after the Jayhawks hit eight of their
first 11 shots, they matched OU's inaccuracy. Over the final 11:02
of the first half, the teams combined for 4-of-28 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The game's lone offensive force was Kansas sophomore center Eric
Chenowith. He was scoreless in his previous game, but against the
Sooners he made his first seven shots, scored 24 points and had 12
rebounds and three blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas built a 33-20 lead four minutes into the second half by
hitting five consecutive shots, including two 3-pointers by Ryan
Robertson. The Jayhawks led 44-28 with 8:19 remaining, but the
Sooners found enough offense to close to within 45-39 at 2:55.
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks shot 39 percent, were outrebounded 47-43, yet still
had control of the game. And, in a week's time, Kansas has moved
from a tie for fifth into a tie for second in the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crazy game,'' said Williams, whose 300th victory in his
11th season is an NCAA record. There are four coaches that won 300
in 13 seasons. ``Last Saturday, we were the worst defensive team
I've ever coached. Today, we stuck to 'em like Velcro.''

LONGHORNS DECIDE TO GO OUTSIDE FOR WIN OVER AGGIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ After an afternoon of frustration
trying to free its inside strength, Texas finally trapped Texas A&AMP;M
in the Aggies' own defensive net.
</P>
<P>
   UT guards Kris Clack and Will Clay struck for three consecutive
3-point shots against an Aggies defense wrapped around Chris Mihm
and Gabe Muoneke, and that kindled a 13-0 second-half run that
ignited the Longhorns to a 63-54 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns' victory _ before the largest crowd to ever watch
an A&AMP;M home basketball game _ assured them of at least a
mathematical tie for the regular-season Big 12 championship.
</P>
<P>
   At 12-2, the Longhorns (17-10) are poised to clinch an outright
title and the accompanying No. 1 seed in the Big 12 tournament with
a victory Wednesday night at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a huge win for us,'' said Mihm, who was held to nine
points but had 17 rebounds. ``The way it works out now, we could be
tied as co-champs. But we want to be champs by ourselves. We still
have two games to play, and we're going to come in excited and
ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second game against the Aggies (11-13, 4-10) this
season, Texas pulled away late for an easier-than-it-looked victory
against A&AMP;M. Under new coach Melvin Watkins, the Aggies have gone a
long way toward re-establishing a basketball rivalry with the
Longhorns, despite losing their 12th consecutive game to UT.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I walked off the court today I told \RUT coach Rick
Barnes\S I love this series, and it will be special some day,''
Watkins promised. ``They've got a head start, but we'll get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   As in their 71-59 loss in Austin, the Aggies were in the game
until midway through the second half _ when Clack and Clay took
advantage of room to shoot, burning A&AMP;M's paint-clogging strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Clack tied the game at 40 with 9:47 to play with a 3-pointer
from the deep right corner after a pass from Mihm. Mihm then
rejected two layup attempts at the other end. Clay then followed
with a shot from almost the identical spot on the baseline at 9:08.
</P>
<P>
   A missed A&AMP;M jumper later, Clack again burned the Aggies. This
time, it was from the outside left quadrant _ and the game had
suddenly turned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were sagging all day, not letting us get the ball inside
to Mihm or Gabe,'' said Clack, who scored a game-high 22 points.
``\RMihm\S kicked it back out, and I was wide open and knocked it
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I hit the first one, they left me open again. So I
decided to shoot it again. Once you get a run going, you feel like
you can hit anything you put up.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay completed the run with a 12-foot jumper and two free throws
to give Texas a 50-40 lead at 7:10. A&AMP;M got no closer than eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those shots hurt us bad one after the other,'' said Aggie
Shanne Jones. ``We couldn't bounce back from that. With two
all-conference players inside, if they are hitting their outside
shots, they're the best team in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas is on the verge of proving just that.

Williams tooting his horn
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INDIANAPOLIS _ Running back Ricky Williams, the Heisman Trophy
winner from the University of Texas, did not make the kind of
impression he wanted on the NFL at the annual scouting combine for
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, teams that interviewed Williams were impressed with
his personality, but he didn't participate in the drills. Many top
prospects don't. But he weighed 244 pounds, which is 19 pounds more
than his playing weight.
</P>
<P>
   What worries teams the most is Williams' insistence on playing
baseball even though he hasn't had much success.
</P>
<P>
   Until the combine, there had been speculation Williams was going
to give up baseball to concentrate on the NFL. Not only did
Williams say he was going to play baseball for the Texas Rangers,
he went so far as to say that, because he is going to spring
training, he might not have time to work out for teams like every
other prospect who will be available in the April 17-18 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough with baseball to get some time to work
out,'' said Williams, who reports to the Rangers' spring-training
camp March 9. ``All the teams think I should, but if I'm already
slotted at No. 1 or No. 2, I don't see how it's going to help me to
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   With answers like that, some NFL teams might be less willing to
give extra draft choices to try to trade up with Philadelphia,
which has the second pick. And the cash-strapped Eagles might be
reluctant to draft him and have to compete with Rangers owner Tom
Hicks, one of the wealthiest and most influential University of
Texas exes, for Williams' services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some teams say I should (work out for them), so I haven't
decided yet,'' Williams said. ``I really want to play both sports.
As for baseball, I want to play and have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   The main question for Williams from general managers, coaches
and scouts?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're asking me if I'm going to play baseball,'' he said.
``Obviously, it's been that football is first, and baseball is more
than a hobby. Baseball is literally torture for me. It's so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   It was mentioned to Williams it didn't seem fair for a team to
make him one of the first two picks in the draft and have to share
him with baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are getting all of me,'' he said. ``You get paid to play
16 games, and I'm going to be there the whole football season.''
</P>
<P>
   And the offseason?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be there for minicamp,'' he said. ``Like I said, football
comes first, and if I have to take a weekend off for baseball to go
to minicamp, I'm going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Williams came to the combine was to show the teams
interested in him what kind of person he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say (the combine) is good or bad, but I think all the
teams deserve a chance to get to know me and see what I have to
offer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' goal is to be the first pick in the draft, but
Cleveland is expected to select Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important to me,'' he said about being the
first pick. ``Not to sound cocky or anything, but there's not
really a downside to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a good person. I'm good off the field. I do (good) things
on the field. I've been productive for four years. I'm extremely
versatile. And I'm ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time Williams was interviewed by the media, he hadn't met
with the Browns. He was interviewed by them later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be on my knees like this,'' he said, putting his hands
together as if praying. ``I'll be begging.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Couch had been in Cleveland to accept the Cleveland
Touchdown Club award as the 1998 college player of the year. In his
acceptance speech, Couch talked about how much he wants to play for
the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, honestly, if you have to campaign like that to be
taken, well, hopefully, my playing and how I carry myself speaks
volumes for me,'' Williams said. ``Hopefully, the Browns will see
that and take me with the first pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important. It's always an honor to be taken No.
1.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch and Williams are expected to be the first two players
selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I hear,'' Williams said. ``Usually in the draft,
there are between one and five (great) players, then the talent
level drops off. This year, they're saying it's only the top two
picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say I'm the best, but there's no one out
there better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports Williams will try to use baseball to
keep Philadelphia from using the second pick on him because the
Eagles are terrible, they need a new stadium and the artificial
surface at Veterans Stadium is the worst in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry about that,'' Williams said. ``Once I'm drafted,
that's the way it's going to be, and I'll make the best of it,
regardless of where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Williams changed agents. He dropped the Boston-based
firm of Woolf and Associates for No Limit Sports, which is owned by
Percy Miller, the rap and film impresario who is known as Master P.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy with my other agent,'' Williams said. ``It was
the company. Everybody in the organization wanted something
different for me. You'd think if you had the No. 1 or 2 pick that
you would do the little things to make sure you keep him. They
didn't do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom didn't really like (them) too much, and that sort of
pushed me over the limit and made my life a lot harder. It wasn't
worth it, upsetting my mom and straining our relationship, so I
decided to choose a new agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who grew up in New Orleans and attended the University
of Houston, has gotten into the sports agent business. Miller,
whose company made $56 million last year, impressed Williams. His
contract will be negotiated by one of Miller's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a rapper or an actor,'' Williams said. ``I just want
to play football and baseball. I wouldn't do it (act or rap) even
if (Master P) asked me to.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams took some time to mention one of his heroes, former
Chicago Bears running back Walter Payton, who is awaiting a liver
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I met him twice,'' Williams said. ``I made a point
every chance I could to get a VCR, and I'd pop in a Walter Payton
tape and watch him. The way he ran _ his feet never stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant a lot to me, and now this unfortunate disease _ it
really pains me. He was a great person off the field as well as on
the field. Everyone who says anything about Walter Payton says
nothing but good stuff, and that's how I want it to be with me.''
</P>
<P>
   As a senior, Williams was under a lot of pressure to win the
Heisman Trophy, resurrect the University of Texas program and
become the career rushing leader in Division I. That pressure made
him a better player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live for the challenge,'' he said. ``I'm a competitor, and I
love challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I think about it, nothing has been that hard for me.
The way I look at it, I'm so confident that if anything (bad)
happens, I keep looking. The little obstacles I clear without even
trying. I try to stay positive, and little things don't get me
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams got a chuckle out of one question. He was asked who is
the greatest running back in UT history?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an easy one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Campbell?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope.''

Clemens gets pinstripes, tradition and title chance
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TAMPA, Fla. _ Roger Clemens smiled for the cameras, modeled his
Yankee pinstripes and spoke of feeling right at home with the World
Series champions.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in Texas may have been one of Clemens' aims, but the New
York Yankees offered something he could not pass up: tradition and
the chance for a World Series ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just real exciting to walk in and be a part of the
tradition,'' Clemens said at a packed news conference Saturday
morning, officially introducing him as a New York Yankee. It was
televised live in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees wasted little time in introducing baseball's only
five-time Cy Young Award winner, who arrived carrying a poem his
sister, Janet Johnson, wrote for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's from a sister to a brother,'' Clemens said, declining to
read it aloud. ``It's really neat. It's about pinstripes, and the
tradition, and Yankee Stadium. She knows how I carry that in my
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' agent, Houston-based Randy Hendricks, emphasized his
client's desire to return to the World Series for the first time
since 1986, when he was with the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were the most qualified to fulfill that objective,
Hendricks said.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens turned down a chance to play for the Yankees two years
ago, instead signing with Toronto. The Blue Jays granted his
request for a trade on Thursday, acquiring pitchers David Wells and
Graeme Lloyd and second baseman Homer Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a juggernaut of almost un-parallel proportions,''
Hendricks said of the Yankees. ``Roger's quest is for that ring
more than anything. That is the overriding consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing closer to home was one, winning a World Series was
another. In a perfect world you might do both. But you can't find a
better opportunity than New York I know how much he lusts after
that ring. It's like a big missing piece of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks said the chances of that happening with the Astros or
Rangers were slim in comparison to the Yankees, who have won the
World Series twice in the last three seasons. He suggested the
Yankees were a ``60 percent probability to win a World Series,''
compared to 20 percent for the Rangers and 10 percent for the
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros and Rangers were led to believe, as late as
Wednesday, that a deal that would bring Clemens to them was close.
</P>
<P>
   After pursuing a deal for three months, Rangers general manager
Doug Melvin was particularly frustrated and fuming, accusing
Clemens' agents of misrepresenting their client's interest in
playing closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees have a reputation as one of sport's most
storied franchises, Clemens has developed a reputation for himself.
He went 20-6 last season and led the American League in wins,
strikeouts and ERA for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in a way it's his destiny,'' Hendricks said. ``He has
earned the right to be a part of a legendary team. I hope it's a
great long-term relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens got in 15 minutes of throwing to catcher Joe Girardi
after meeting with reporters, then signed autographs for a
half-hour. He wants no special treatment and said he will continue
to do his job as he always has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (manager) Joe (Torre) I'm trying as best I can to slide
in the side door,'' Clemens said. ``This is a great machine.
They've got some great players here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they had never formally met, Yankees lefthander Andy
Pettitte shares several similarities with Clemens: both are from
the Houston area, attended San Jacinto College and have the same
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up he was an idol of mine, along with Nolan Ryan,''
Pettitte said. ``With the career he's had the only thing missing is
a World Series title. This is a great opportunity for him to come
here and get the chance.''

CAVALIERS BEAT NETS, 89-84  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Fans, commentators and players alike have been
riding Shawn Kemp since the Cavaliers star arrived for training
camp bloated and out of shape. But the husky power forward wiped
the smirk off of every face in New Jersey Saturday night by scoring
24 points to lead the Cavaliers to an 89-84 victory over the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to leap as high as usual while still carrying about 15
pounds of extra weight, Kemp, who also grabbed a game-high 11
rebounds, did his damage with toughness and craftiness. At his best
in a critical fourth quarter, he scored 9 points and forced
turnovers by Sam Cassell and Keith Van Horn in the final period to
drop the Nets to their fifth loss in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Now 2-6, the increasingly disappointing Nets head into Sunday's
game against Indiana trying to avoid falling out of the playoff
race before it starts. Cleveland, gaining its fifth straight
victory, improved to 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that shocked everyone but the Nets' coaches and
players, John Calipari started Sam Cassell, the colorful point
guard who had missed the last six games with a sprained right
ankle. Though obviously nowhere near his best, Cassell responded
with 18 points and 5 assists in 23 foul-plagued minutes. Jayson
Williams, on the other hand, had one of his most disappointing
games in a long time, with 2 points and 4 rebounds in 29 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When Cassell fouled out with 3 minutes 24 seconds left to play,
the Nets struggled momentarily, allowing Cleveland to go on an 8-2
spurt that turned the Cavaliers' 2-point deficit into an 84-80 lead
two minutes later. Looking for help, Calipari turned to the ailing
Kendall Gill, who did not play the first 47 minutes because of a
sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   But a cold Gill could not deliver, and with 19 seconds
remaining, he tossed an entry pass wide that forced Van Horn to
step out of bounds to catch it. The turnover sealed the Nets' fate
30 seconds after Van Horn (21 points) had provided hope by hitting
a 22-footer to pull the Nets to within 84-82.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kittles added 19 points for the Nets, and Derek Anderson
scored 19 for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The game was close through the first three quarters, as neither
team led by more than 6 points and the lead changed hands 14 times.
The Nets, behind 8 third-quarter points from Cassell, led by 62-61
entering the fourth, and then surged ahead by 72-65 with 7:34 left
behind two baskets, including a 3-pointer, by the reserve point
guard Eric Murdock.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to start Cassell came just moments before tip-off
and caught the Cavaliers off guard. Despite moving gingerly and in
slow motion, he made his first five shots _ four of them jumpers _
and gave out two assists in leading the Nets to an 18-12 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell's presence enlivened the Nets' offense, and they moved
the ball crisply for the first time in what seemed like ages.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets could not shake the Cavaliers, though, and Cleveland
grabbed its first lead at 27-26 on a running jumper by Johnny
Newman. With Van Horn taking control for the Nets and Kemp for the
Cavaliers, the clubs exchanged the lead for the rest of the half.
Van Horn had 15 first-half points, while Kemp had 11.
</P>
<P>
   While Cassell's return sparked the Nets, the club's excitement
was dulled by the sprained left ankle Gill sustained in the second
quarter of Thursday's loss to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   More bad news came when Rony Seikaly said he was ailing at the
morning shoot-around. Seikaly, who missed the first four games with
a sprained left ankle, complained that the plantar fascia in his
right foot was sore. That is the same foot that keep Seikaly out of
all but nine Nets games after joining the club in midseason last
year.
</P>
<P>
   With the Nets refusing to verify Seikaly's diagnosis, Calipari
ignored the center's report and put him in at the start of the
second quarter. After a three-minute stint that included two missed
field goals and a noticeable limp, Seikaly returned five minutes
before the half after Williams and Cleveland center Vitaly
Potapenko began roughhousing inside.
</P>
<P>
   The bumping seemed to take Williams out of his game, and he
grabbed just 1 rebound to go with 3 points in the first half. Both
Williams and Potapenko were playing with noses broken by the
flailing elbows of Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo.

With trade talk over, Elarton takes aim at Astros' rotation
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how much the
Astros value Scott Elarton.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays repeatedly asked for the young righthander
to be included in a deal for Roger Clemens _ The Rocket himself _
and each time Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker told them to
blast off.
</P>
<P>
   It was nothing personal toward the Blue Jays; the Seattle
Mariners got the same response when they tried to entice the Astros
into making Elarton a part of the Randy Johnson trade last July.
</P>
<P>
   By way of simple deduction, one must conclude the Astros believe
Elarton has a chance to be a special pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Elarton is a very fine person and he handled it (the
trade speculation) with a lot of maturity,'' said Randy Hendricks,
one of Clemens' agents. ``The Astros' management determined at this
time that Scott Elarton was more valuable than Roger Clemens; only
time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton, 22, has a long way to go to catch up to Clemens'
credentials. Clemens is a future Hall of Famer and the only pitcher
to win five Cy Young awards. Nevertheless, the Astros have a great
deal of confidence in Elarton's potential. And they have no
intention of holding him up to Clemens' standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the disadvantages of being a high-profile prospect is
that the expectations are often exaggerated,'' Hunsicker said.
``It's tough to live up to those expectations. But Scott has an
advantage because what he did last year should reinforce the
confidence that he has in himself that he can compete at this
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, in fact, he is in the rotation this year, he still has to
prove himself as a starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly think a lot of Scott, but until he establishes
himself in the major leagues, he's still a prospect. Scott is a
very talented young pitcher who has a chance to be a solid major
leaguer for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton got his first taste of the majors when he was promoted
from Class AAA New Orleans last June. He made two starts and then
became a key member of the bullpen, going 2-1 with a 2.42 ERA and
two saves in 26 games.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he will be given every opportunity to win a spot in
the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year gave me an opportunity to get used to the big-league
experience, and I definitely know I can pitch in the big leagues
now,'' Elarton said. ``I don't have any doubts about whether I can
perform at this level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching out of the bullpen was like second nature to me after
the first couple of times, but I definitely don't want to be in the
bullpen again. I want to be the fifth starter, but if they don't
think that's what's best for the team, hopefully they would put me
back into the bullpen (instead of sending him to the minors). I'm
flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner can relate to Elarton because both were first-round
draft picks and highly touted starting-pitcher prospects. The
Astros converted Wagner into a closer _ a role some believe Elarton
would flourish in.
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros' crystal ball portrays Elarton as the anchor of
their starting rotation in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Scott's going to have any problems with the
expectations because his maturity level overshadows his talent,''
Wagner said. ``At 22 years old, if you could bottle his maturity,
you'd be rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion _ which doesn't count for much _ trading Elarton
would have been the worst thing we could have done. He has a chance
to be a franchise-type player, and I just don't think you can trade
away someone like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is how Hunsicker and Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. saw
things when the Mariners and Blue Jays came calling. McLane
repeatedly said the Astros would work aggressively toward acquiring
Clemens but that they would not part with Elarton or outfielder
Richard Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   Before learning of McLane's statements during the offseason,
there were times Elarton wasn't sure where he would be reporting to
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the owner says you're not going to be traded, I kind of
felt like I didn't have anything to worry about anymore,'' Elarton
said. ``I think it just shows that they have a lot of confidence in
me. I'm not going to put any more pressure on me than I normally
would.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I want to be. I like Houston, I like the fans,
and I don't want to go anywhere for a while.''

   &UR; 1998 recap: 74-88 (fourth place, AL West).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: Art Howe (fourth season).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key piece to the puzzle: It's usually not fair to pin high
hopes on a rookie, but if the A's are going to surprise anyone in
1999, third baseman Eric Chavez must have a big first season. He
was selected minor league Player of the Year last season by
``Baseball America.'' He is a natural hitter who has worked hard on
improving his defense. The former first-round draft pick is
de)finitely someone to watch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New pieces: SS Domingo Cedeno, RHP Doug Jones, OF Tony

Henderson, IF Dave Magadan, LHP Mike Mohler, OF Bip Roberts, 3B Ed
Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Players to watch: Miguel Tejada struggled at times during his
first full season in the bigs. Now that he will come to camp as the
everyday shortstop, more will be expected from Tejada, who likens
himself to a young Barry Larkin. . . . Jay Witasick, a former
reliever, started making the conversion to starter last year. Now
he comes to camp with a golden chance to snag one of the spots in
the rotation. . . . Another starter with a great chance to stick is
last year's first-round pick, Mark Mulder. It would take an
exceptional camp, but by all accounts, Mulder has the tools and
head to step right into a big-league rotation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Three questions: Will Kenny Rogers, staff ace last year, still
be there Aug. 1, the day after the trading deadline? Rogers is in
the final year of a contract and easily represents the kind of
front-line starter who will receive attention if the A's are out of
the race by then. . . . . Who starts in left field, where veterans
Tony Phillips and Tim Raines will vie for playing time? . . . Who
will own the club next season? Co-owners Steve Schott and Ken
Hofmann put the club up for sale last fall. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; 1998 recap: 77-85 (fourth place, NL West).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: Jim Leyland (first season).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key piece to the puzzle: Darryl Kile was a tremendous
disappointment last season, posting a 13-17 record with a bloated
5.20 ERA. He did manage to salvage some respect with a late-season
surge, but the damage had been done. As ace of the staff, Kile
needs to jump out of the gate quickly if Colorado is to contend.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New pieces: LHP Brian Bohanon, IF Lenny Harris.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lost pieces: RHP Roger Bailey, IF Jason Bates, RHP John Burke,
LHP Mike Munoz, RHP Mark Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Players to watch: SS Neifi Perez played in every game last year
and managed to hit .274. The problem is his on-base percentage was
only .313. If he is going to be leadoff hitter, Perez will need to
do much better than that. . . . Pitcher Pedro Astacio was expected
to make the leap from middle of the pack starter to elite status
last season. Instead, Astacio took a few steps backward. He needs
to build his confidence and return to being a key No. 2 starter. .
. . Finally, there's Dante Bichette. The outfielder enjoyed another
fine offensive season (.331, 22 home runs, 122 RBIs), but there was
a sense he still didn't play up to his level. Bichette tended to
miss easy plays in left field.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Three questions: During their six-year existence, the Rockies
never have had a bonafide closer. Will someone finally emerge this
season? . . . Former MVP Larry Walker may have led the league in
hitting last season, but will he be able to return to being one of
the top run-producers in the game (his RBI total dropped from 130
to 67)? . . . Can second baseman Mike Lansing, a virtual bust last
season, especially on defense, rebound and have the kind of season
he enjoyed when there was no pressure to do so in Montreal? &QL; 
Anaheim ANGELS

<P>
   &UR; Stadium (capacity): Tempe Diablo Stadium (9,785).

<P>
   &UR; Workout times: 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 recap: 85-77 (second place, AL West).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: Terry Collins (third season).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key piece to the puzzle: There was one reason the Angels again
managed to crawl to the finish line last season and it began and
ended with pitching. Ken Hill, who was injured much of last season,
will be relied on as the ace. He has the best stuff of anyone inthe
rotation but must stay healthy. If he does, the Angels should earn
their first post-season spot since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New pieces: RHP Tim Belcher, LHP Mike Magnante, RHP Mark
Petkovsek, IF Luis Rivera, IF Andy Stankiweicz, 1B Mo Vaughn.

<P>
   &UR; Players to watch: There are few players in the game as exciting
as Darin Erstad. The Angels stumbled when he was hurt late in the
season. Even though he returned, he was not 100 percent and it
showed. Erstad is a throwback-type of player and worth watching at
all times, even in spring games. . . . He's nearing the end of his
career, but Chuck Finley is still something to watch. Arguably the
second-best left-hander ever to pitch in the Los Angeles area
(behind Sandy Koufax), Finley continually puts out solid efforts. .
. . The club would love youngsters Troy Glaus and Tod Greene to
emerge as every day starters at third base and DH, respectively.
They have backup plans just in case, but with Dave Hollins coming
off rotator surgery, there is also a big question at third base.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Three questions: Can Jim Edmonds co-habitate with some of his
teammates, especially the ones who questioned how seriously he
takes winning and losing? . . . If there is no trade, how will the
foursome of Erstad, Edmonds, Garrett Anderson and Tim Salmon
co-exist knowing one of them will have to rotate as the designated
hitter most every night? . . . How will Mo Vaughn react when he
gets a first-hand look at how laid-back the fans are? Remember,
he's coming from Boston, where fans live and die with the Red Sox. &QL;

   &UR; 1998 recap: 76-85 (third place, AL West).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: Lou Piniella (seventh season).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key piece to the puzzle: Jose Mesa saved 85 games in 1995 and
'96. He has saved 17 the past two years. Seattle is counting on
Cleveland's former closer to resurrect his career in the Northwest.
It's a big gamble. If it works, though, the Mariners should be in a
position to contend. If it fails, Seattle will be looking at using
a hodge-podge of relievers to close.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Players to watch: With two of the top players in the game in
Ken Griffey and Alex Rodriguez, Seattle boasts as great a one-two
punch as there is. Watching these two is always special, the kind
of thing to tell the grandkids one day. . . . Young pitchers Ryan
Anderson and Freddie Garcia, acquired in the Randy Johnson deal
with Houston, promise to be big-league pitchers for years to come.
The club would love to have them spend one more year in the minors,
but if they have fantastic springs, the kids could force the club's
hand. . . . There is no finer defensive first baseman than David
Segui. He's so good in the field that he's the first option to play
outfield if Jay Buhner is not ready to start the season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Three questions: A bullpen that resembled a train wreck most of
last season will try to right itself with questionable additions
such as Mesa and Leiter. Are those really the answers to the
bullpen woes? . . . Amazingly, the Mariners were 48-60 while Randy
Johnson was there and 28-25 after he was traded to Houston. Still,
there is no denying how dominant a pitcher he can be. Can the other
starters pick up that slack? . . . Exactly how sound is Buhner's
right throwing arm? He underwent reconstructive surgery last season
and was not expected to return before the end of May. Now he says
he will be ready to start the season, but in left field, not his
customary spot in right. If he's in left, it will be a big boost.
If not, how will the Mariners handle their defense? &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: Bruce Bochy (fifth season).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key piece to the puzzle: George Arias takes over at third base
for the departed Ken Caminiti. Filling the shoes of the former MVP
will be difficult enough, but if the Padres expect Arias to also
fill the clubhouse role Caminiti held, they're crazy. No one can be
to a club what Caminiti was to the Padres the past few years. It's
just not fair. The Padres will need someone to step up, and there
appears to be no clear-cut contender for this role.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Players to watch: Fans have been hearing about the highly
touted Matt Clement for a few years. It seems 1999 will be his
introduction. He figures to land a spot in the rotation and, if
everything we've heard about him is true, he should be here for
good. . . . If Quilvio Veras is unable to start the season because
of his shoulder surgery, then rookie Damian Jackson will be
expected to start at second base. . . . Andy Ashby was walking
around shell-shocked after his World Series experience, when the
Yankees tattooed him good in Game 2 in the Bronx. He must show he's
got a stronger will this season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Three questions: Exactly who will fill the gap for lost
starters Brown and Hamilton, who combined to win 31 games last
season, or 32 percent of the team's victories? . . . Can Dave
Smith, the former All-Star reliever with Houston, have as
successful a season at pitching coach as Dave Stewart, now an
assistant general manager in Toronto, had last season? . . . How
long before reliever Randy Myers and his hefty salary are traded? &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: Dusty Baker (seventh season).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key piece to the puzzle: Shawn Estes is the undisputed ace of
the staff, at least based on his 19 victories from two years ago.
The problem is he slid last season (mostly because of injuries) and
managed just seven wins. If the Giants are to surprise for a third
straight season, Estes will have to have a big season again. With
Orel Hershiser out of the picture, this is Estes' staff now.

Dunston, RHP Orel Hershiser, RHP C Brian Johnson, Jose Mesa, LHP

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Players to watch: Ellis Burks is coming off knee surgery and
will be expected to take over fulltime duties in right field. He
was one of the biggest run-producers around during most of his
years with Colorado. The Giants are counting on Burks being able to
do the same in the middle of their lineup. . . . Ever so quietly,
Jeff Kent has emerged as one of the top RBI players in the game. He
has 249 combined RBIs the past two years, an amazing fact
considering he plays in the shadow of Barry Bonds. . . . There will
be no other veteran shortstops in camp this time around, meaning
the job is all Rich Aurilia's.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Three questions: Baker has pulled magic out of his hat two
consecutive seasons as his club has managed to play better than
clubs which, on paper, appeared better built. Is there yet another
season of magic in Baker's cap? . . . There is every reason in the
world to believe Bonds, who turns 35 this year, has not lost a
thing. He remains one of the top players in the game and his
numbers last season indicate the downside of his career has not
begun. Still, one of these years it will start to happen. It's only
natural, right? Is 1999 the time? . . . Will anyone shed any tears
as the Giants prepare for their final season at decrepit and
windswept Candlestick Park? This is it before the club moves to
PacBell Park. &QL;

winners).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: Jim Riggleman (fifth season).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key piece to the puzzle: Strange, but this one belongs to the
Tribune Co., which controls the purse strings. This is definitely a
large-market and large-revenue club that acts more like a
mid-market club. The Cubs are perennial money makers yet ownership
will not allow the baseball people to act like the Braves or
Yankees. If they ever did, watch out. This club could be dangerous
on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New pieces: RHP Jon Lieber, C Benito Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lost pieces: OF Brant Brown, RHP Mike Morgan, C Scott Servais.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Players to watch: Once again, the one to watch in Mesa will be
Sammy Sosa, whose 66 home runs last season is the second-highest
total in the history of the game. Sosa had a jam-packed off-season,
flying to all parts of the globe, and the wonder is whether he will
be exhausted by the time camp opens. . . . Benito Santiago, former
Rookie of the Year and All-Star, is back again to try his hand.
After missing almost all of last season because of a car accident,
Santiago is down to his last chance in ball. If he fails this one,
his once-promising career may very well be over at the tender age
of 33. . . . Lance Johnson used to be one of the top leadoff
hitters in the game. Now he's a mere shadow of that. The wonder
around camp is whether Johnson even cares? If he doesn't it's a
shame. If he does, it's time to show it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Three questions: Will the Cubs be able to make it through the
season without needing Medicaid? This will be one of the oldest
clubs in the league. Every regular is at least 30, with Gary Gaetti
at the top at 40. . . . How will the Cubs manage to eke out a
playoff spot when everyone else in the division, except for
Milwaukee, has improved? The Cubs appear too willing to rely on
magic this season and it could haunt them by the All-Star break. .
. . The most scrutinized elbow in Chicago will belong to Kerry
Wood. How will his elbow, which became tender last season, hold up
for an entire season? &QL;

   &UR; 1998 recap: 80-82 (second place, AL Central).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: Jerry Manuel (second season).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key piece to the puzzle: His teammates can't help but look up
to him. Even so, Frank Thomas seems uninterested in assuming a
leadership role. But With Robin Ventura and Albert Belle gone, the
need for Thomas to step to the front of the class and take over has
never been greater. Is he simply a player capable of amassing great
stats, or is he a great player?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New pieces: OF John Cangelosi, OF Darrin Jackson, IF Paul

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lost pieces: LHP Jim Abbott, OF Albert Belle, IF Wil Cordero,
3B Robin Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who to watch: Greg Norton will have first crack at taking over
for Ventura at third base. His hands will be full as his teammates
look for someone to fill those huge shoes. . . . What has happened
to Jaime Navarro? Once considered one of the top up-and-coming
pitchers in the league, Navarro has become an embarrassment. His
6.36 ERA earned a demotion to the bullpen last summer. Many eyes
will be on this strong right-hander, who was supposed to fill the
void left when Alex Fernandez departed. . . . Second-year Manager
Jerry Manuel earned high praise from peers last season. He will be
faced with an even greater challenge this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Three questions: The question of the spring will be finding
someone to replace Ventura. But Ventura, who left for the Mets via
free agency, was so much more than just a third baseman. He was the
only player willing to stand up and be the leader of this group. .
. . Unlike the club that plays on the north side of town, the White
Sox have the opposite age problem. This will be one of the youngest
clubs in the league. Will they have problems finding suitable
babysitters? . . . Now that the Mike Cameron era has failed,
Chicago must find a center fielder from a group that includes
rookies Brian Simmons, Chris Singleton and Tyrone Pendergrass. In
addition, Darrin Jackson might make his way into this battle. Is
there a center fielder among that group? &QL;

   &UR; 1998 recap: 74-88 (fifth place, NL Central).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: Phil Garner (eighth season).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key piece to the puzzle: Center fielder Marquis Grissom was
supposed to bring an added dimension last season. All he did was
play well below his standards. If Milwaukee is to surprise anyone
in the Central, Grissom will need to become the catalyst he was on
World Series clubs in Atlanta and Cleveland.

<P>
   &UR; Lost pieces: IF Bob Hamelin, 1B John Jaha, C Mike Matheny, RHP
Jose Mercedes, OF Marc Newfield.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Players to watch: The club tried all winter to trade All-Star
second baseman Fernando Vina, a consummate professional. The bigger
question is whether Vina sticks around through spring training or
the Brewers manage to finally trade him. . . . Injury-prone Dave
Nilsson returns to his original position behind the plate. All eyes
will be on the Australian to see if he can handle the rigorous
chores. . . . Former reliever Bill Campbell takes over as pitching
coach. It will be his duty to try to coax a bunch that had the
13th-worst club ERA in the league last year into a turnaround.
Milwaukee's two complete games was the lowest total in NL history.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Three questions: Once again, Milwaukee is trying to put
together some semblance of a rotation. At the start of camp, the
rotation looks like this (honest): Scott Karl, Steve Woodard, Bill
Pulsipher and Rafael Roque. They combined for zero complete games
last year. . . . Is the newly acquired Berry capable of playing
first base on an every-day basis? He platooned at third base in
Houston the past few years but the Brewers are looking for some
right-handed power and Berry, they believe, is the answer. . . .
Will new Commissioner Bud Selig honestly be able to keep his hands
out of the daily operation of his former club? Many owners will be
watching this one closely. &QL;

   &UR; Three questions: Will Canseco manage to stay interested on a

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: John Boles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key piece to the puzzle: Cliff Floyd became the first Marlin in

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: Terry Francona.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key piece to the puzzle: Ron Gant had a spectacular season in

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: Bobby Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key piece to the puzzle: The Mets made one heck of a financial
commitment to Mike Piazza. Will he carry New York to its first

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: Larry Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key piece to the puzzle: Ken Caminiti was always thought to be

<P>
   &UR; Three questions: Can Dierker guide this club to a third

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: Tony La Russa.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key piece to the puzzle: Pitching coach Dave Duncan will be

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: Jack McKeon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key piece to the puzzle: The fans of Cincinnati. If they show
up in healthy doses, GM Jim Bowden will be able to make moves to
keep the club in the mix.

<P>
   &UR; Manager: Gene Lamont.

<P>
   &UR; Manager: Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key piece to the puzzle: Mike Piazza is gone and Todd Hundley
will be expected to be the big bopper in the middle of the lineup.
If he isn't, the Dodgers have problems.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New pieces: LHP Pedro Borbon Jr., RHP Kevin Brown, LHP Greg

THE TWO-BIT THEFT OF A PRICELESS LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her obituary in the Feb. 15 ``Arizona Republic'' reported that
Adele Coffield, 87, of Phoenix, a retired school teacher, passed
away Feb. 12. Survivors include two daughters and a brother.
Services were held at Westminster Presbyterian Church on 19th
Avenue. In keeping with newspaper policy, cause of death was not
listed.
</P>
<P>
   It should have been.
</P>
<P>
   It would have read: Purse snatching.
</P>
<P>
   One Thursday afternoon in early July 1997, Adele Coffield parked
her new Dodge Stratus in the lot of the Smitty's store at 35th
Avenue and Bethany Home Road. It was just before 4 p.m., and Mrs.
Coffield, as was her habit, planned to eat dinner at the in-store
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   She'd done this most days since the death of her husband, Carl,
in 1993. The couple had moved to Arizona in the mid-'60s, after
selling the family dairy farm outside of Wheeling, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   They knew Arizona well. &QL; 
SHE CAME HERE TO LIVE
</P>
<P>
   Adele's own parents had retired here when Adele's children were
young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every summer, my mother and us kids would catch the train in
Pittsburgh and come out here,'' says Adele's daughter, Karen
Hahacek. ``I can't remember a time we didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Adele earned a master's degree in education at Arizona State
during those summer visits. She taught second and fourth grades in
West Virginia and taught for 10 more years in Phoenix. Carl went to
work for a plant nursery here. Their son, Al, became a collector
and expert on Model A automobiles. Another daughter, Ann, earned an
education degree from Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our father died in 1993, our mother decided she would
stay in the same house,'' Ann said. ``She was very independent. She
had church and friends. She drove.''
</P>
<P>
   She did crossword puzzles in ink. She quilted, and she was
famous for her lemon meringue pies. She bought a new car and drove
it to church and to Smitty's every day for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   That July afternoon in 1997 she had just stepped out of the car
when a man she didn't know approached her and asked if she had the
time. Before she could check her watch the man grabbed Mrs.
Coffield's shoulder bag and tried to tear it away. She was a small
woman, but determined. She didn't let go easily.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, he tore the purse away from her, leaving
Adele on the ground with a broken right arm and a broken shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   SHE BLED ON THE INSIDE
</P>
<P>
   There was internal bleeding in the arm, which concerned doctors.
Mrs. Coffield was taking blood thinning drugs for a heart
condition. In order to stop the hemorrhaging in her arm, physicians
took her off that medication.
</P>
<P>
   About a week later, she had a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It paralyzed her on the right side,'' said her daughter, Ann.
``She never really recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Adele managed to learn to eat with her left hand, but she
couldn't speak. Her daughters tried to get her to type out her
thoughts, but the stroke left Adele unable to spell even her own
name.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who'd done crosswords in ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got depressed sometimes,'' Ann said, ``but for the most
part she hung in there and did the best she could. She was
strong-willed. And very kind. Very good.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time she passed away of complications from the stroke,
Mrs. Coffield was said officially to have died of ``natural
causes.'' But she didn't.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of unnatural death that only happens in big
cities, where good and gracious people, like her, are so necessary
and so vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   And whose passing too often goes ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The purse snatcher was never caught. About a week after the
attack, a couple returning home from vacation found Mrs. Coffield's
belongings in their back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother never carried any cash,'' Ann Kilbourn said. ``She
wrote checks or used ATM and credit cards. All she kept in her
purse was 25 cents, in case she needed to make a telephone call.''
</P>
<P>
   The purse was undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   Inside it were Adele's car keys and her wallet, her checkbook,
bank card and credit cards. As far as anyone could tell, the only
thing missing was the quarter. &QL;

Dierker may mull unorthodox move
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ The Roger Clemens ordeal is over, the pitching
staff is virtually set and the everyday players soon will be in
town, ready to slide right into their well-secured positions in the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   These are indeed wonderful spring days for Astros manager Larry
Dierker. He's got sunshine all day, cool breezes all night, a most
formidable team at his fingertips and even tickets to today's
Rockets-Orlando Magic game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to get my basketball fix,'' Dierker said. ``With the
(NBA) lockout, I didn't get to see much basketball before I got
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is good. And here in Astros camp, it seems the toughest
decisions Dierker will have to make this spring are the stuff of
managers' dreams: Wedge or putter? Spinnerbait or topwater?
Pretzels or peanuts?
</P>
<P>
   ``No question I feel a lot better about this team right now than
I did at this point last year,'' Dierker said. ``We're pretty
set.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty much. But even in these early days of spring training,
when the batters in practice are imaginary and the games
make-believe, there is an interesting decision on the horizon
Dierker and the Astros might make.
</P>
<P>
   It is a decision that goes against every basic big-league
principle, a choice most managers avoid at all costs and one that
few teams have tried.
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros are considering it: Outside of closer Billy
Wagner, a completely righthanded bullpen?
</P>
<P>
   Understand, there is little chance Dierker will begin the 1999
season with all righthanded long relief in the bullpen, but the
likes of Scott Elarton, Jose Cabrera, Dean Crow, Chris Holt and
Brian Powell _ all righties _ are making Dierker and the Astros
weigh its advantages and disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   Trever Miller, who is out of options and would have to be waived
if he is not on the big-league lineup on opening day, is penciled
in as the opening-day lefty reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had his moments out of the pen a year ago and finished a
respectable 2-0 with a 3.04 ERA. But Miller was not the
overwhelming force against lefties a year ago that the Astros hoped
he would be. And righthanders Doug Henry and Jay Powell performed
better against lefthanded batters than they did against
righthanders a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The move to go righthanded in the pen would be risky. Basically,
except for his closer, Dierker would have no secrets or cards in
the hole against opposing managers, an option every late-inning
critical moment demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a good thing to have a lefty out there,'' Dierker
said. ``I don't think it's going to happen, but it's a
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The performances by several impressive righthanders this spring
and into the early part of the season might make it even more of a
possibility. Elarton, whose talent and potential were enough for
the Astros to pull out of trade talks for Clemens, figures to only
improve. He must be considered a top prospect for the fifth
starter.
</P>
<P>
   But Holt, coming off surgery to repair a frayed rotator cuff
that made him miss the 1998 season, has been strong throughout
workouts and has showed no ill effects in the elbow. Saturday's
pitching drills proved to be the biggest step yet in Holt's
establishing himself as a candidate to start.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of hard throwing, the Astros expected Holt to
tire or lose pop in his pitches Saturday. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm particularly pleased with him,'' Dierker said. ``He's
showing all his pitches and throwing hard.''
</P>
<P>
   As things look now, Elarton or Holt will earn the fifth
starter's spot behind Shane Reynolds, Mike Hampton, Sean Bergman
and Jose Lima. If Holt earns the job, Elarton then likely would go
back to the pen and join Henry, Jay Powell, Wagner, Xavier
Hernandez and Miller.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a full complement of 11 pitchers and the Astros like
what they have seen in several others, particularly Crow and Brian
Powell, the relievers acquired from Detroit in the Brad Ausmus
trade. They also like Cabrera, who made the opening-day roster a
year ago before injuries sent him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important not to overreact to what you see in spring
training,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Dierker also often has said the opening-day lineup
isn't what matters most. It's all about getting players set on the
roster when September rolls around and division titles are won.
Between now and then, the Astros likely will be asking themselves
the question about which they are wondering:
</P>
<P>
   Is it better to have a lefty reliever in the pen simply for the
sake of having one? Or is it better to have all righthanders if
those are your best guns, the players who give the team the best
chance of winning?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have tough decisions, I suppose,'' Dierker said.
``I'm sure it's something that will work itself out.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be the big righthander's call.

<P>
   The purse snatcher was never caught. About a week after the
attack, a couple returning home from vacation found Mrs. Coffield's
belongings in their back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother never carried any cash,'' Ann Kilbourn said. ``She
wrote checks or used ATM and credit cards. All she kept in her
purse was 25 cents, in case she needed to make a telephone call.''
</P>
<P>
   The purse was undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   Inside it were Adele's car keys and her wallet, her checkbook,
bank card and credit cards. As far as anyone could tell, the only
thing missing was the quarter. &QL;

UT goes outside to get the best of A&AMP;M
<TEXT>

   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
COLLEGE STATION _ Texas A&AMP;M did everything it could to keep Chris
Mihm and Nnadubem ``Gabe'' Muoneke from controlling the game in the
paint for Texas, something the two big men for the Longhorns have
done most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy was working well until Kris Clack and William Clay
burned the Aggies with 3-point jumpers in the second half that
changed the flow of the game and enabled Texas to claim a 63-54
victory Saturday at Reed Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The 9,424 spectators _ the largest crowd to watch an A&AMP;M
basketball game _ saw the Longhorns clinch at least a tie for the
Big 12 championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas victory at Oklahoma on Saturday means Texas (17-10
overall and 12-2 in the Big 12) can sew up the regular-season title
with a win at Baylor on Wednesday. The Longhorns are 15-3 since
starting the season 2-7 under new coach Rick Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long way from where we were Dec. 18th,'' Barnes said.
``I've really enjoyed watching these guys grow. I trust them and I
believe in them. I don't think there was one time today when I
yelled because I was upset about something. These guys have become
a basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies (11-13, 4-10) looked like a good basketball team most
of the day. Their sagging defense inside helped earn a 40-37 lead
with 10:04 to go.
</P>
<P>
   But the momentum of the game shifted when the Longhorns made
three consecutive 3-point baskets _ two by Clack and one by Clay _
to take a 46-40 lead with 8:39 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were very big shots, but good teams step up and do what
they did,'' A&AMP;M coach Melvin Watkins said. ``I was really pleased
with our defensive effort, but you have to hit some shots. In a
rivalry like this, you have to step up and make a play. They did,
we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Clack, the game's top scorer with 22 points, started the
long-range barrage when he sank a trey from the right baseline.
Then Clay made one from almost the same spot before Clack added
another 3 from the left wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were playing a sagging defense all night and didn't let
us get it inside to Gabe or Mihm like we wanted to,'' Clack said.
``But we did it in the second half, they kicked it out and we
knocked down the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Mihm's three assists came in that one-minute sequence
when he tossed the ball outside after he was triple-teamed down
low.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was huge,'' Mihm said. ``It was the dagger. We had been
trading buckets, but after those 3s, I think (A&AMP;M) might have run a
couple plays too quickly and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas went on a 13-0 run and took a 50-40 lead with 7:10 to play
after two free throws by Clay, a Bryan High product who was playing
in front of family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 45 tickets for this one,'' Clay said. ``I've been
thinking about this game all year. I couldn't wait for it to get
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay came off the bench and scored seven of his eight points
during the 13-0 run that decided the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just playing your role,'' Clay said. ``In this offense,
you never know when your time will come. They sagged on Mihm all
day, then started trying to deny Clack, so it was my time to be
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive is a good way to describe Saturday's game, which at
times looked more like rugby than basketball. Texas shot 35.7
percent (15-of-42), but the Longhorns held the Aggies to 29.6
percent (16-of-54).
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams really went at each other defensively,'' Barnes
said. ``There were no easy baskets on either side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies surrounded Mihm and Muoneke whenever either player
touched the ball, holding Muoneke to 11 points and Mihm to nine.
</P>
<P>
   But both players still managed to do the job on the boards. Mihm
equaled his career-high with 17 rebounds. Muoneke added nine
boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I barely had room to move down there,'' Mihm said. ``It was
tough, but we knew it was coming. I told Gabe they were going to
try to beat on us, but we're used to it. I told him to keep his
head and we would wear them down eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies did a nice job of fronting Mihm with Joe White or
Paul Jacobs, then collapsed down low whenever Mihm of Muoneke got
their hands on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``At halftime, we said we had to get the ball inside no matter
how good a job they were doing on us down low,'' Barnes said. ``We
had to work the ball from the inside out.''
</P>
<P>
   But the aggressive inside defense caused A&AMP;M's Shanne Jones and
Aaron Jack to get in foul trouble. Jones sat on the bench for seven
crucial minutes of the second half when he had four fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stopping the big guys was our main focus,'' Jones said. ``They
both are great players. But me and A.J. (Jack) got in foul trouble
and that hurt us. We had some silly fouls inside that killed us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Late in the first half of a difficult struggle with
Nevada-Las Vegas yesterday, SMU coach Rhonda Rompola scanned the
bench and announced the Mustangs needed a spark.
</P>
<P>
   Obediently, Anika Calvert promptly banged in two 3-point shots
to even the score, and SMU (14-10, 9-3 Western Athletic Conference)
was launched on a 27-4 run that eventually grew into a 74-62
victory against the Rebels (15-9, 6-6).
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it began,'' UNLV coach Regina Miller said, ``we just
couldn't stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory preserved SMU's grip on second place in the Mountain
Division heading into the final week of the season, along with an
opportunity to earn a first-round bye in the WAC tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this means we're peaking at the right time,'' said
Rompola, whose team has won seven of its past eight games, with the
only loss coming to Colorado State on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Once Calvert sparked the Mustangs, this one came easy. The
Mustangs shot 48 percent, forced 26 turnovers and held a commanding
lead throughout the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But after missing 13 of their first 17 shots, they trailed 16-10
when Calvert hit her first shot with seven minutes left in the
half. Her second one pulled the Rebels out of their zone, and
Karlin Kennedy and Claudia Brassard combined for 14 points in the
next five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like we were just taking turns,'' said Brassard, who
finished with 13 points in the final regular-season home game of
her SMU career. ``When they came out of the zone, everything opened
up inside for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Calvert _ who hit four 3-pointers _ each finished
with 20 points, offsetting a 25-point, 11-rebound performance by
UNLV freshman Linda Froehlich.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came into the game all pumped up, because they beat us
earlier out there,'' Calvert said. ``I guess I just kind of got
caught up in the hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Rompola figured the team might have been a little too pumped in
the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes that works against you, and I think we were a little
to tight at the start of the game,'' she said, ``but Anika relaxed
us. Winning two at home this way gives us some good momentum,''
Rompola added, referring to an 82-44 victory against Air Force on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:49 remaining, the Rebels briefly cut a 20-point deficit
in half with a flurry of 3-pointers against the Mustangs reserves,
but it was too late.

ISLES BEAT DEVILS, 3-2  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ One day after the Devils were humbled by
the defending Stanley Cup champion Red Wings in Detroit, they came
home and were embarrassed by the struggling Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Despite getting Dave Andreychuk back from injury, the Devils
blew a third-period lead and were beaten by 3-2 Saturday night
before 19,040 at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who outshot the Islanders by 26-19, took a 2-1 lead
into the third period but allowed the visiting team to carry the
play. The result was two goals, the second of which was scored in
spectacular fashion by Bryan Smolinski on the power play at 17
minutes 1 second.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski controlled the puck near center ice, and skated
through three Devils, turning defenseman Scott Niedermayer around
en route to the net. Smolinski scored with a high wrist shot that
went over goalie Martin Brodeur's glove.
</P>
<P>
   Zigmund Palffy, the Islanders' crafty wing, tied the game at 2-2
at 7:40 of the third period. Standing behind the net, Palffy threw
the puck in front. It ricocheted off a Devil and dribbled under
Brodeur and into the net.
</P>
<P>
   The only good news for the Devils was that Andreychuk returned
after missing 21 games with a broken right ankle. Having him back
in the lineup figures to help the Devils, whose offense has been
inconsistent over the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's game featured a goal for each team in the
opening two minutes, setting the pace for a fast-paced first
period.
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Elias scored for the Devils and Barry Richter tallied for
the Islanders. On the Devils' second shift, Elias scored just one
minute into the game. Elias was entangled with Islanders defenseman
Rich Pilon in front of the net when the Devils' forward received a
pass from Jason Arnott, who was in the corner. Elias controlled the
puck and chipped it over Tommy Salo's blocker pad.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Continental Arena fans could settle back into their
seats, Richter, an Islanders defenseman, ripped a long shot past
Brodeur 55 seconds later. Richter's shot, which bounced at least
once before entering the net, appeared to fool Brodeur, who managed
only to wave his stick at the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Sykora snapped the tie with a weak snap shot from the top
of the left circle at 9:11 to give the Devils a 2-1 lead. That type
of goal, called a green sector shot by Stefan Lunner, the
Islanders' goalie coach, supports Mike Milbury's decision to trade
for goalie Felix Potvin. While Potvin _ who pulled a groin muscle
and has been out for a week _ has not played well since he was
obtained from Toronto in a Jan. 9 trade, he is seen as an upgrade
over Salo. Especially when Salo allows two goals in the first
period.
</P>
<P>
   In the scoreless second period, both teams had prime scoring
chances. The best belonged to the Islanders, who not only saw
Trevor Linden clank a shot off the post, but watched as Palffy,
alone in front of the net, found Brodeur's chest protector late in
the period. The Islanders took over in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a good welcome back for Andreychuk, whose return had
not been decided until Saturday afternoon. He had been expected to
play on Friday at Detroit, but the coaching staff did not think he
was in game shape, so he had been sent back to New Jersey to
practice on his own at South Mountain Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Without Andreychuk in the lineup, the Devils had gone 10-9-2.
Andreychuk, who played on a line with Randy McKay and Bobby Holik,
had not played since breaking his right ankle on Jan. 5 against San
Jose. He had surgery three days later, sending him to the sideline
with an ankle injury for the second time in three years. The big
left wing had fractured his left ankle in the final game of the
1996-97 season and missed all but one of the Devils' playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to jump right back in,'' Andreychuk said before
Saturday night's game. ``I'm going to have to play my way back into
the lineup. There are going to be some situations where I'll have
to be cautious. You can practice all you want, but you can't
simulate game conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main objective right now is not to be a liability out
there,'' he added. ``I have to get my timing and positioning
back.''

COPPERHEADS REFUEL JETS THAT PATROL NO-FLY ZONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere along the Turkish border, 26,000 feet above ground,
Copperheads from Arizona are fueling the military campaign against
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Gulf War ended eight years ago, Air National Guard mem
bers with the 161st Refueling Wing have been helping patrol the
skies of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred men and women, mostly from the Valley, leave
behind families and civilian jobs to serve three-week tours. They
are not just pilots and navigators, but mainte nance crews,
intelligence officers and others.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Day 1, Phoenix to Spain
</P>
<P>
   They arrive at Sky Harbor Inter national Airport before dawn,
dressed in cammies, passing through the security gate to
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three men and women from Arizona, about to travel 7,000
miles _ halfway around the world _ to play sky cop in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Before gear is loaded on the plane, a videotape on emergency
procedures is shown.
</P>
<P>
   Crash instructions seem absurd. The KC-135, after all, carries
up to 110,000 pounds of fuel, and would probably blow sky-high in a
crash.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what happened three weeks earlier, when an Air
National Guard tanker from Wash ington state went down along the
German-Dutch border, killing every one aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Crew and passengers line up for chemical suits and gas masks.
They get another briefing on the terrorist threat in Spain _ their
first stop _ and in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   And then a final word: ``Have a safe trip,'' the briefing
officer says.
</P>
<P>
   They board the KC-135 shortly after dawn. It resembles a Boeing
707 passenger jet. On its nose: a phoenix bird rising from scorched
earth. Bart Simpson looks on, declaring, ``Awesome, dude.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it's a cold, dark tunnel with four small windows and a
couple of dim lights. The jet engines roar so loud that, during
flight, crew and passengers wear headsets or plugs to protect their
ears.
</P>
<P>
   Luggage is on the floor; passen gers sit on fold-out canvas
seats along padded walls.
</P>
<P>
   The KC-135 taxis to the runway, hesitates, then rises as Phoenix
shrinks into the past. Next stop, McGwire Air Force Base in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Guard members shout conversa tion over the jet roar, mouth to
ear. Some pace. Others sit near portals to read by the wan light.
</P>
<P>
   Master Sgt. Steve Hanson, a Peoria firefighter, is a 10-year
veteran of the Guard, with experi ence in Operation Southern Watch
out of the United Arab Emirates. He flew refueling missions over
Bosnia from a base in Italy. He's been on hundreds of training
flights out of Sky Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is tension. As the plane levels off, Hanson jokes
about his teenage kids back at their Gilbert home, and how much
they'll miss him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like, `Yeah, Dad, go so we won't have you bothering
us, telling us what to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mention of his wife draws more dark humor: ``Sure, she worries.
But if anything happens, she's better off with me dead than alive.
She'd be able to pay off the house (with insurance money) and get a
better looking guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson and his crewmates knew for weeks their turn was coming.
They watched the news _ saw that Saddam Hussein had begun taking
potshots at coalition fighters.
</P>
<P>
   In late December, Iraqi forces launched missiles and fired
anti-air craft bursts at coalition jets in the no-fly zone. The
incidents, sporadic and spastic, signaled a change in Iraq's game
plan.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 8, after U.S. jets were targeted by anti-aircraft radar,
a high-ranking Marine Corp officer warned of more to come from
Saddam: ``He's dangerous now. He could become more dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard members begin to relax somewhere over mid-America. A few
crawl into sleeping bags on the floor or atop baggage. One sits
beneath a light, reading The History of the World.
</P>
<P>
   The Guard seems different from other military units, less rigid.
Officers address one another by first name. There is no saluting,
no ``yes sir'' and ``no sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been flying with some of these guys for 25 years,''
explains Col. Joe Smith, the Guard's public affairs officer.
``We're a big fam ily.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech Sgt. Bill Sommers of La veen, an internal auditor for
Arizona Public Service Co., is the prototype. He's been with the
Air National Guard 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the volunteers, Sommers wipes out all of his
vacation time on Guard missions and training exercises.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sense of time or distance in the flying tunnel. It
stops for food and fuel in New Jersey, then takes off across the
Atlantic for Rotta, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gillooly, the navigator, spends most of his life as a
Phoenix cop flying helicopters. This morn ing, he was with his
daughter, Bryanna. Now he's en route to the Iraqi border to police
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Gillooly uses computers, global position systems and charts to
keep the old plane on course, flying at 560 knots into night. He
jots down a a calculation, then grins: ``This is the same way
Magellan did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson eyeballs a sextant in the cockpit ceiling, trying to pick
up stars for a celestial reading as turbulence rocks the plane. &QL; 
 &UR; Day 2, Spanish nights
</P>
<P>
   The flight was uneventful, except for a generator gauge that
went bonkers. Now, for a 24-hour layover in Rotta, a beachfront
resort.
</P>
<P>
   The Guard members know this is their last liberty before
marathon shifts at Incirlik. They march in small groups down narrow
Spanish streets to the ocean. Signs announce that Christopher
Columbus em barked on his new world adventures from this spot.
</P>
<P>
   After snapshots and lunch, they converge on an Irish pub for
another brand of refueling. At Taberna Irlandesa, all fears are
drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some flyers grouse about ``this piddly-ass war.''
</P>
<P>
   Most hate playing sky cop. They spit out the word ``politics''
and wonder aloud why they cannot shoot except in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a low-satisfaction factor,'' one pilot complains. ``We've
turned into a police force.''
</P>
<P>
   They say the Air Force and National Guard have been cut by
one-third, yet they carry the nation's biggest military burden.
Some have been shipped into the no-fly zones and Bosnia more than a
dozen times since 1991. If sky supremacy is the key to modern
warfare, they ask, why are flyers and support crews taxed to
breaking?
</P>
<P>
   Some talk of quitting _ of signing up with airlines for more
money, more time with wives and kids. &QL; 
 &UR; Day 3, Welcome to Turkey
</P>
<P>
   The Mediterranean glitters below, with giant snow-capped
mountains rising from its shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead is Adana, a second-world metropolis of dirt streets and
glitter ing mosques. Two serpentine rivers wind through the
countryside, a geometry of orchards and field crops.
</P>
<P>
   Dead ahead, the runway at Incir lik Air Base rises to greet a
stratotanker from the Grand Canyon State.
</P>
<P>
   Copperheads are shuttled away for briefings and work. AWACS
command ships are lined up on the Tarmack. Concrete and earthen bun
kers house the fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 Air Force personnel are based here, along with
Marine Corp flyers, a U.S. Army detach ment and British and Turkish
forces. As an F-15 Eagle roars skyward, Lt. Col. Joe Smith explains
why report ers were invited on this trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has a right to know,'' he says, ``This is an
incredible thing. We're killing peo ple every day. . . . And
stopping someone else from killing people.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour begins moments later at the office of Brigadier Gen.
Savas Sanliturk, co-commander of Opera tion Northern Watch. Just
outside, a Turkish lieutenant hands out a hand-printed list of
three questions and says, ``This is what you will ask.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a bowl on the coffee table containing a bouquet of ciga
rette packs. It is a formal event, polite conversation in a
military maelstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi forces have just fired on U.S. warplanes in the no-fly
zone. Tariq Aziz, Saddam's deputy prime minister, is in Ankara
telling the Turks to stop supporting coalition forces. Kurdish
rebels are about to riot in European capitals. The Turkish
Parliament, recently dissolved, is jockeying for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Sanliturk speaks of Asia Minor's history, of bonds with America.
</P>
<P>
   The general emphasizes that U.S. and British fighters only fire
if they are attacked. Someone serves Turk ish tea in petite
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: Patriot missiles. These were installed just weeks
earlier in case of a Scud attack. The Iraqi border is 340 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   The van then heads for a confab with U.S. fighter pilots. They
don't want their names used, just in case they get shot down and
captured.
</P>
<P>
   They say Iraq's anti-aircraft arse nal is pathetic. But they are
not cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes intensely personal when you see Triple A (flak)
going off around your aircraft,'' says a pilot who's seen nine
tours in the no-fly zone since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the van to a munitions depot. Sgt. Leon Mitchell shows
off the latest toy. It's an AGM-130 computer-guided missile with
enough bang to blow up anything within 4,000 feet. There is a
message on the nose: ``Hi, mom.'' &QL; 
 &UR; Days 4 &AMP; 5, Off to Cappadocia
</P>
<P>
   Military personnel at Incirlik usu ally work seven days a week.
When they take a couple of days off, it's classified information.
Iraq's not supposed to know when the fighters are grounded.
</P>
<P>
   This day, more than 140 active Air Force personnel and National
Guard members pile into buses. They head 200 miles north of
Incirlik, through high sierras to a land called Cappadocia.
</P>
<P>
   Here, geology and Mother Nature conspired to create bizarre rock
formations _ a mixture of Sedona and Wilderness of the Rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Here also, there are amazing subterranean cities and ancient
churches sculpted into hillsides of porous, volcanic tufa. One
commu nity, started by the Hittites nearly 4,000 years ago, once
housed 10,000 people. It contains eight levels and descends more
than 200 feet underground _ a bee hive carved in rock.
</P>
<P>
   Saints Paul and Peter wandered these hills. One small valley con
tains more than 250 cave churches with ornate religious murals
painted by monks.
</P>
<P>
   A tour guide points out that Turkey is a historical link between
Asia and Europe, a land criss crossed for military and religious
conquest. The Romans, Greeks, Persians, Hittites, Assyrians, Turks
and crusaders _ all left their mark.
</P>
<P>
   And now American military per sonnel tour the ruins, haggling
for Turkish rugs and pottery along the way. &QL; 
 &UR; Day 6, the mission
</P>
<P>
   The KC-135 has been dubbed ``Ice 1'' for this mission. Arizona
crew members were up at 4, getting briefed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at dawn, they taxi away from the tarmac and head to the
southeast corner of Turkey, escorted by two fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   AWACS airborne command ships are aloft already. The team will be
joined by more fighters and recon naissance planes. In three hours,
they have fueled eight F-16s and F-15s while flying circles on the
edge of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Below is a wasteland of mountain and snow. Aaron Vangelisti of
Scottsdale, the Ice 1 pilot, prepares to head back to Incirlik when
Iraqi anti-aircraft guns open fire, fol lowed by a pair of
surface-to-air missile launchings.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members can see the smoke trails. After a few hairy
moments, it is obvious that the Iraqi gunners have missed again.
Fighter jets move in, blasting away at targets. As Ice 1 turns
back, two more Arizona stratotankers take its place.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the base, Ice 1's crew finishes a debriefing and heads
into The Alley, an off-base shopping area, for a dinner of Turkish
bread, hummus, goat cheese, lamb and beer.
</P>
<P>
   The day's events weigh heavy. One Copperhead says fighter pilots
were so geeked up they came in for refueling ``with their hair on
fire.'' Another says he's never seen so much flak thrown skyward. A
third describes post-flight debriefing ses sions as hell.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, Saddam vows to attack the Turkish air base at
Incirlik. &QL; 
 &UR; Days 6 &AMP; 7, Homeward bound
</P>
<P>
   Anti-terrorism security is elevated at Incirlik. Even The Alley
is off limits.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven Copperheads, done with their three-week tour, climb
aboard a KC-135 for the long ride to Arizona, bearing Turkish
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   They sleep across the Mediterra nean. There is an overnight stop
in Moron, Spain, but few have the energy to party. They just want
to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Garrett is returning to his wife, son and daughter. The
tech sergeant from Avondale seems pained that most of this trip has
been spent on the ground; he made only three sorties.
</P>
<P>
   He struggles to explain the attrac tion, deciding that it's
something akin to the lure of moth to flame.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to do it. It's for real. . . . Heck, maybe so one day
I can look back and tell my grandkids, `Hey, I was there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They cross the Atlantic to New Jersey, coming to life only when
the plane begins its approach to Sky Harbor. They talk about wives
and boyfriends and dogs and cats. Some one sings the chorus line to
Bruce Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, Staff Sgt. Bryan Parker of Gilbert hugs his three
boys as his wife, Lisa, looks on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never afraid,'' she says. ``I sit back and hold my
breath. When you're dealing with someone like Saddam, you never
know what's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys said their prayers every night: `Please, just get
Daddy home.' ''

STARS SHOOTING TO GET COLORADO'S ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Messages don't come in bottles in the NHL _ unless they're
broken over an opponent's head.
</P>
<P>
   Notes in hockey generally are passed with the butt end of a
stick, a well-placed elbow or a puck slipped squarely between a
goalie's legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think messages can be sent during the regular season,''
Stars center Mike Modano said. ``I think we've done that with
Detroit this year and we'd like to do it with a few more teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Avalanche would be a good start today, when the
Avalanche visits Reunion Arena for the second Sunday in the past 14
days. The Avalanche took a 3-0 victory against the Stars the last
time the teams met, sending a message to the Stars and to the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy came up with 27 saves
in a game in which his team was outshot, 27-12. That dropped at
least one little hint that the Stars should be worried if they have
to face him in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Stars can whisper in a few Avalanche ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychological edges are very important in the business of
winning, and we have chances to earn those edges every day,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``I mean, can we beat this team if we
haven't beat them before? Can we beat them four times? things like
that become very important.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars and Avalanche have never played a playoff series. The
Stars and Edmonton Oilers have played two postseason series in the
past two seasons. When the Stars played the Oilers on Monday,
messages were sent all over the ice in a fight-filled game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at games like the Edmonton game and those are playoff
type games,'' Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``I think you learn
a lot about your team in games like that and you can also send
little messages that maybe people around the league will see.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Colorado, for example, the Stars have shut down Peter
Forsberg and Joe Sakic for the past three seasons. If they continue
that trend in the regular season, it can only help if the two teams
meet in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the media the way it is, that'll be something that's
dragged out and talked about and I think that can get into their
heads,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``It's definitely something that could
help us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also can be hurt by messages. Goalie Ed Belfour
struggled in the 3-0 loss to the Avalanche at a time when media
outlets across the country were questioning if he is the weak link
in the Stars' run for the Stanley Cup. So does Belfour try to send
his own message today?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what anybody says in the paper and I don't care
about sending messages to anybody,'' Belfour said defiantly,
perhaps sending a message to his critics. ``I come out and try to
win every game I play, I'm a competitive person and I like to win.
If I don't play well one game out of every 10, there's nothing I
can do about that. I just forget it and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, teams can't forget. The Avalanche and Red
Wings have sent messages since developing the league's most vicious
playoff rivalry. The Stars sent messages to the Red Wings earlier
in the season when they twice won at Joe Louis Arena, breaking a
slump that had reached 1-17-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those games in Detroit were big confidence boosters,''
Hitchcock said. ``I think we knew we could win there, but it makes
a difference to actually go in there and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hitchcock said the Stars have gained just as much
knowledge when they've been sent a message. The Stars lost, 5-2,
against the New Jersey Devils on Nov. 25 and lost, 2-0, against the
Phoenix Coyotes on Nov. 11. In both situations, the Stars needed a
wakeup call, Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's great about games with the top teams is you know you're
going to learn something no matter what happens,'' Hitchcock said.
``After this game, we'll know a little bit more about them, but
we'll also know a little more about ourselves.''

VENUS, KOURNIKOVA TO PASS CLOSE TO THIS AREA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For fans of professional tennis living in North Texas, the IGA
Superthrift Tennis Classic is as good as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, it's as close as it gets, even if ``close''
is decidedly relative.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong WTA Tour event, featuring some of the best women's
tennis players in the world, begins play Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that's a lot closer than Leipzig, or Bogota, two of the
other stops on the globetrotting WTA Tour that touches down in
several towns in California, the Southeast and the Northeast during
the year, but not Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The long drive across the border could be well worth the trip
this year. The Oklahoma City tournament, which started in 1986,
features the No. 5 player in the world, Venus Williams of the
United States, and No. 12, Russian Anna Kournikova. Also in the
field of 30 are No. 13 Amanda Coetzer of South Africa and two
Americans in the top 30, No. 25 Lisa Raymond and No. 28 Chanda
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   As the top two seeds this week, Williams and Kournikova receive
first-round byes, meaning they're not expected to see action until
midweek. Quarterfinal action is scheduled for Friday, the
semifinals for Saturday and the finals for next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' return will be special. She won her first professional
singles title at Oklahoma City last year, defeating Joanette Kruger
in the finals after beating then-defending IGA champion Lindsay
Davenport in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Williams went on to win The Lipton Championships and the Grand
Slam Cup later in the year, moving from the rank of potential star
to star.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty exciting since it was my first title,''
Williams said from Hanover, Germany, last week. ``It was our first
title, too,'' she added, referring to her IGA doubles championship,
won with her sister, Serena, last year.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams is skipping the IGA this year, as is Davenport,
now the world's No. 2 player behind Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said last week she was battling a lingering cold and
was preparing for the upcoming Evert Cup in California and the
Lipton in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had planned to take this whole month off.'' Davenport said.
``The last two years I played in Oklahoma City, and last year I was
pretty tired when I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the presence of Williams and Kournikova, the IGA
won't lack star power, or, possibly, controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Williams drew undesired attention at the Australian Open in
Melbourne in January when the beads she wears in her hair fell out
during a loss to Davenport, causing her to be penalized and leading
to a conflict with the umpire.
</P>
<P>
   Williams downplayed the incident and said she will keep her
hairstyle and composure.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova, who hasn't won a WTA tour singles championship but
did, with Hingis, win the doubles title in Australia, has drawn
attention for her model-like looks as well as for her game.
</P>
<P>
   She was a finalist at the Lipton last year, defeating four top
10 players in four days, after vaulting to prominence in 1997 when
she was a semifinalist at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the Australian Open doubles final to Kournikova and
Hingis, Natasha Zvereva said of Kournikova: ``That's her first
Grand Slam, and I'm sure she's going to have more to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova has had some problems this year, however, with her
serve. At the Australian, in a match she still won, she whacked 31
double faults.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been happening for a while. I'm kind of used to it,'' she
said. ``I'm also kind of frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Offering $180,000 in prize money, the IGA is a Tier III event on
the WTA Tour, the category in which events offering at least
$170,000 but less than $500,000 are ranked.
</P>
<P>
   There are 12 Tier III tournaments on the tour as well as 15 Tier
II events (offering $500,000 to less than $1 million) and nine Tier
I events (more than $1 million). There also are 17 Tier IV events,
which offer at least $110,000 but less than $170,000.
</P>
<P>
   The IGA Superthrift Tennis Classic is being held at The Greens
Country Club. Ticket information can be obtained by calling (405)
297-3000 or (405) 752-7687.

ELS SURVIVES BAD SPELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Through nine holes of the Nissan Open on Saturday,
Ernie Els and Ted Tryba both seemed hellbent on playing through
history. Els made the turn at Riviera Country Club in 5-under par,
one better than Tryba had some 90 minutes earlier.
</P>
<P>
   To scoreboard watchers, it looked less like a PGA Tour event
than a limbo dance. How low could Els and Tryba go?
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, it appeared to be no contest, Tryba
nimbly notching a course-record 10-under-par 61 to Els' strained
68. Ahh, but looks, how they can deceive. If not for one poor putt
and two bad swings, Els might have made up those seven strokes in a
flurry.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for nine-and-a-half holes it looked like nothing could
stop Els except possibly the 19th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going great guns,'' said the South African, who birdied
the first, third, sixth, eighth and ninth holes to go to 13 under
par through 45.
</P>
<P>
   Els was striding toward his ball on the 10th fairway, with not a
care in the world, when someone told him Tryba was one birdie on 18
away from a phenomenal 59.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, Els had every reason to believe the bar had been
set impossibly low. Els' subconscious, which had been steering the
golfer to that point, seemed unsettled by the news. That's as good
an explanation as any for why Els proceeded to pull a putt that
looked to all his gallery to be a gimme, especially since he had
drained putts easily twice as long for birdies on three of the
previous four holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was unconscious out there for a while,'' Els said. ``I was
hitting it very close for 10 holes. I felt like I really had
something special going. Then I just lost my momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Riviera. She's famous for hypnotizing golfers only to
snap them back to reality really fast. The course is a fickle
temptress, but Els had no one to blame but himself for giving back
three strokes to par on the next three holes.
</P>
<P>
   Two bad swings was all it took. The first was his third shot to
the par-5 11th. Els' second shot landed in a divot, but that was no
excuse for his lackadaisical 80-yard approach, which set up his
bogey-6.
</P>
<P>
   After parring No. 12, Els oscillated on whether to go with his
driver or his 3-wood on the 13th tee. He settled on the more lofted
3-wood, though you never would have guessed it by the
swing-for-the-fences cut he took at the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad swing,'' said Els, who was playing in the final
threesome along with Bob Estes, the second-round leader, and Alan
Bratton.
</P>
<P>
   Then laughing, Els added, ``I should have taken a mulligan
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't kidding about the swing. If there had been a fence in
the foul territory in left, Els surely would have cleared it. As it
was, the ball hit a tree and cowered in a ditch, out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   An agitated Els then went to Plan B, his driver, and smacked it
long and straight. He nearly salvaged a bogey, but his 30-foot putt
slid inches past the hole.
</P>
<P>
   You've never heard such loud applause for a double bogey (well,
outside of Ryder Cup anyway). The fans were firmly behind Els all
day, never more so than at that particular moment when he had the
glazed look of a survivor of a single-car crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big shock,'' Els said of his six. ``There I was, one
shot out of the lead and all of the sudden it's looking like I'm
playing myself out of the tournament. Some strange things go
through your mind after that.''
</P>
<P>
   A logjam at the par-3 14th gave Els more than five minutes to
seethe and suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to think about it slipping away because it
becomes a mind game then,'' Els said. ``You start trying to play
the shot instead of letting it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Els has hit purer 5-irons than his tee shot on 14.
The ball settled on the fringe of the green, above the pin. Els
took out his flatstick and nearly holed the difficult putt. That
tap-in along with the three pars that followed helped Els regain
his equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   His flair caught up with him on the 18th green. With fans
ringing the green and blanketing the hill and holding their
collective breath, Els sank an 18-foot birdie putt to creep back
into contention. At 11-under par, he is tied for second with Tiger
Woods and Davis Love III, two shots behind Tryba.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of his finish was not lost on Els, who pumped
his fist as though he had won something. Which in a way, he had.
The putt earned him a reprieve and probably a more restful sleep
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real pleased with that birdie,'' Els said. ``I think it's
going to be a wonderful day (today).''
</P>
<P>
   The third-round leader has held on to win each of the past three
weeks on the PGA Tour. But don't be fooled. Sitting in a dentist's
chair for root-canal surgery is more relaxing than sitting atop the
leaderboard as holes are running out.
</P>
<P>
   Els was the bulls-eye briefly during his front nine and look how
boldly Tryba took aim at him. Today, the roles will be reversed and
that's fine with Els.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're leading,'' Els explained, ``it's a different
situation. You won't see the leaders shooting 61.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, in today's final threesome a 68 will be just
great. &QL;

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ a wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 7: The first day of proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Very formal. Very impressive. No one is in sport coats. We're
all in blue suits.
</P>
<P>
   We take the oath, then we sign the book. We go down in a
procession....
</P>
<P>
   We keep the pen that we use to sign the book. But it doesn't say
`United States Senate.' It says ``Untied'' States Senate. Everybody
gets to snickering. They say: ``I hope we don't get untied. I hope
we can tie this up.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm in the second row from the back. It is quite a panorama.
From my seat you see the chief justice. You see all the galleries,
which are packed. You see the whole Senate sitting there. You see
the House managers and the White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The camera angle on television is terrible. I say to Trent
(Lott, the majority leader), `This does not do justice to these
proceedings.... Every time you walk in, there you get sort of a
jolt of how serious this is. On television, it just looks bland and
rather undistinguished.'
</P>
<P>
   The media literally just surrounds you as you get off the
elevators, on the steps, on the subway. We're talking about scores
of reporters. I just made a decision that I would be taking an oath
as an impartial juror, it's not right to be a talking head on
television.
</P>
<P>
   I came up with a formula: If a senator cannot speak inside the
chamber, there is a natural law that they speak 10 times as much on
television. The formula for that is X-denied equals CNN 10X.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 8: On the verge of a partisan split, both parties meet in
the Old Senate Chamber.
</P>
<P>
   We have the process showdown at the Old Senate Chamber. This is
the first step toward comity. I sit at the desk of (former
President James Knox) Polk, not because of history but because it's
in the back and off to the right, and you can see all the senators
and can leave if you want to.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Gramm gets up and says let's vote on process now and put
off a vote on whether to have witnesses until later on.
</P>
<P>
   Of all people, Ted Kennedy gets up and says: ``It looks to me
it's possible we can get to first base and then second base. I
don't know if we'll ever get home, but we ought to give it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   And nobody can believe it's Gramm and Kennedy working together.
It's just incredible.
</P>
<P>
   Trent jumps up and says, `I think we got a deal.' (Minority
Leader) Tom Daschle said we can work on witnesses down the road,
and I couldn't believe he said that because the White House didn't
want that.
</P>
<P>
   So we avoided a partisan split on process.
</P>
<P>
   I then became convinced of the value of closed sessions where we
talk to one another, rather than at one another in the press. We
never could have done that in an open session.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 10: With opening arguments still a few days off, senators
continue to debate whether witnesses should be called.
</P>
<P>
   I found that the early-in-the-morning thing is the best course
of action for me. That means you're getting up at 6 and getting
home at 8 or 9 o'clock at night....
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time during the mornings you're supposed to be two
places at the same time over half the time.
</P>
<P>
   I'd wake up and think: ``I've got to do some research. Let me
think, there was that asterisk on misleading a witness. Is that the
same thing as threatening a witness and obstruction of justice?
That's Section 1503, OK, I've got to read that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 14: The House managers begin making their case.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, we had a conference. Leadership is worried about
leaks (to the media).... I got to my feet and said, look, ``You're
not going to stop leaks. You're just not going to stop that, so
don't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   I think they just finally got over it.
</P>
<P>
   (House manager) Asa Hutchinson's brother, Tim, is a senator from
Arkansas and sits right behind me. Tim was more nervous about
everything than Asa was. He wanted his brother to do a good job.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 15: More prosecution statements.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sitting in the Senate looking at my Democratic
colleagues.... All of a sudden I thought, ``What would I do if the
defendant were Ronald Reagan, and this were Iran-contra? What if it
were Ford? Would I have the same feeling about this?''
</P>
<P>
   ...If I were a friend of Bill, what would I do? I sort of
wrestled with that. You raise up your hand and say I'm impartial,
but is it possible really to divorce yourself from that?''
</P>
<P>
   (House Manager) George Gekas spoke today. He didn't use notes.
His mother was an immigrant. She took the test for citizenship and
George was trying to coach her on her test. And he said, ``Mom,
what are the three branches of government?''
</P>
<P>
   And his mother said, ``There's the executive, the legislative
and there's the (sic) `judish.' '' And then Gekas said my mother
knew that the `judish' was the one thing different from the old
country and why she came to America.
</P>
<P>
   That got me....
</P>
<P>
   Tom Harkin (Iowa Democrat) interrupts the proceedings to insist
we are the `triers of fact,' not `jurors.' I think, `OK, fine.' But
that night, Franki (Roberts' wife) and I went out to dinner late at
a neighborhood restaurant and there's a longtime acquaintance, and
he is just a raging Democrat.... He's leaning over the table, and
he's red-faced. He says this is the most important thing in this
trial: Are you a trier or a juror?
</P>
<P>
   I said, `Well, I'm both.' I said, `Hey, we're going to eat
dinner here. I'll talk to you about it.'
</P>
<P>
   We just decided we wouldn't be going out to dinner after that.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 16: House managers finish their opening arguments.
</P>
<P>
   They generally do a good job. There's no question that they
tended to get to go on a little long....I try to take copious
notes. I always do this, more especially when it gets a little
tedious. There are times I write down: `This is boring. I wonder
when the next break is coming?' MORE

CLEMENS THRILLED TO BE A YANKEE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update and rewrite thruout)   By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ By the time Brian Cashman arrived at Tampa
International Airport to pick up the newest Yankee Saturday
morning, Roger Clemens was already at the baggage carousel, waiting
patiently and anonymously to collect his luggage. The pitcher had
already rented a car when the general manager found him. Clemens,
who signed only one autograph, was clearly eager to become a
Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   After Clemens arrived at Legends Field and was escorted into
Manager Joe Torre's office, the two chatted for about 10 minutes
concerning team rules and expectations. Torre said he gave Clemens
his usual spiel about being on time, about working hard, about not
having facial hair and not wearing jewelry during games. Mostly,
Torre simply stared at Clemens. The pitcher looked huge to the
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the chance to see the wall-to-wall man I've admired for
a long time,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   So did the rest of the Yankees, finally. When Clemens pulled on
the blue workout jersey with No. 12 on the back and walked to one
of the fields to simply play catch with the pitching coach, Mel
Stottlemyre, reporters followed him. When Clemens lined up to throw
in the right-field bullpen, dozens of fans stood shoulder to
shoulder to stare at him. Hardly anyone made a sound. It felt like
a tennis match, not a spring workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of strange seeing him in a Yankee uniform,'' Joe
Girardi said. ``It's a good kind of strange.''
</P>
<P>
   The delivery was familiar, the thud in Girardi's glove sounded
powerful, and the expression on his face was typically intense.
Clemens, who has been throwing for over a month, uncorked 59
pitches and was obviously ahead of the pace of most pitchers. The
6-foot-4-inch, 230-pound right-hander tossed two types of
fastballs, sliders, forkballs, and change-ups; most pitchers spend
the first week throwing only fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to have him out there,'' Stottlemyre said.
``I'm the pitching coach and I'll work with him every five days.
But I'm a baseball fan, too, and I get a thrill out of watching
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre, who watched Clemens with Stottlemyre from behind the
mound, pinched himself and admitted it was an exciting day for what
was supposed to be a routine day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He commands that respect and that attention,'' Torre said.
``As much as you like to say he's one player on the team, which he
will be for our purposes, he still perks your ears up a little. He
can't be anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   After Clemens graduated from high school in 1980, he was
anonymous to Torre on one day at Shea Stadium. Torre was managing
the Mets and Clemens worked out for them, but was not signed.
Clemens remembers Torre was unimpressed. Torre did not recall the
tryout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather plead ignorance than insanity,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, was emphatic
in stressing that Clemens would not be given special treatment.
Clemens' four sons had a locker at the Skydome when he was with the
Toronto Blue Jays, and he played on the field with them before some
games. Those privileges will not be extended to Clemens at Yankee
Stadium, at least not to that degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be a problem,'' Torre said. ``We don't allow
kids into the clubhouse before the game. They can come out early
before the game if they want.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clemens was asked if it was possible for a player of his
status to blend in, he said, ``Everything I've done, the team is
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was even more insistent while meeting with Torre. After
Torre finished going over the regulations, Clemens said: ``You
didn't have to read it. Just tell me where to be.''
</P>
<P>
   While the 36-year-old Clemens is also known for following his
own diligent routine as a pitcher, Stottlemyre said Clemens told
him that he would do ``whatever the Yankees want'' in addition to
his extra running. Although the Yankees had difficulty persuading
Hideki Irabu to alter the routine he had used in Japan, Stottlemyre
stressed that there should be no conflict with Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``His routine has been very successful,'' Stottlemyre said. ``It
will be a smooth transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman, who drove from the airport with Clemens, listened to
him gush about how excited he was to be with the Yankees and also
heard how Koby, the pitcher's 12-year-old son, had two hits in a
game on Friday. Before the trade, Clemens planned to stay in Katy,
Texas, until Sunday night to watch Koby play. But once the Yankees
summoned Clemens, he made his flight arrangements, rented a car,
scooped up his luggage, danced around a few questions, threw and,
of course, ran. It was his first day with the Yankees, but there
was a new ace in camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' pitcher David Cone said. ``He's the ace of the
league. You could make an All-Star team from around the league and
he'd be the ace of that staff.''

PEPPERDINE UPSET BY PORTLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU _ This certainly wasn't what Pepperdine seniors Jelani
Gardner and Marc McDowell wanted in their last men's basketball
game at home.
</P>
<P>
   But there it was, a 59-53 loss to West Coast Conference doormat
Portland in the last game of the regular season at Firestone
Fieldhouse on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no reason to allow what happened tonight,''
Pepperdine coach Lorenzo Romar said after the Waves dropped to
18-11, 9-5 in the WCC. ``We were our own worst enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine enters the WCC tournament as the No.2 seed. The Waves
will most likely play San Francisco, which beat Pepperdine in the
teams' last meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves lost three of their last four conference games. Forget
an NCAA Tournament at-large berth; that idea is history. An NIT
invitation is more likely unless the Waves win the conference
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all or nothing now,'' Gardner said. ``I think everybody
realizes that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of what Pepperdine did against the Pilots (9-17, 3-11) was
bad _ 18 turnovers, 42 percent (21 of 50) shooting that included
just three 3-pointers in 20 attempts and a porous defense that
allowed Portland to shoot 55.3 percent (21 of 38).
</P>
<P>
   Portland wisely went to a zone defense in the second half as the
Waves clanked shot after shot and fumbled away the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, who had a team-high 13 points, refused to acknowledge
the team let down after beating WCC regular-season champion Gonzaga
on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's an excuse,'' he said. ``To be an NCAA
Tournament team, you have to bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   Romar tried everything to combat the Waves' ineffectiveness,
trying several lineup combinations. With one exception, when the
Waves took a 52-47 lead with 4 minutes, 20 seconds left, Romar's
revolving door at the check-in table didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose some rhythm with guys shuffling in and out,'' Romar
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, who didn't start Friday for the first time in 55 games
at Pepperdine, started on senior night. But he played only 26
minutes, less than the four other starters and reserve Ross Varner,
who was in for 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like I was out for a long time,'' Gardner said,
``but the team did play well when I was out.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland came in on a six-game losing streak and hadn't won
since Jan. 28, when they beat seventh-place USF.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pilots came out with a swagger, taking an 18-8 lead with
10:47 left in the first half. Nothing came easy for the cold Waves,
who didn't break into double figures until Gardner's 10-footer
bounced around the rim and in with 8:44 left.
</P>
<P>
   Portland went ahead for good on Travis Andrews' 3-pointer that
made it 53-52 with 2:20 left. Andrews had a game-high 18.

SENATOR'S DIARY PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It was 3 a.m. in Kansas City when Sen. Pat
Roberts was dropped off at his hotel. He was not a happy camper.
</P>
<P>
   The Dec. 30 entry in Roberts' journal shows he had just flown in
from San Antonio, where Kansas State, his alma mater, had played
the worst game of its season in the Alamo Bowl. In just four hours
Roberts was to fly back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm standing there, and it's 13 degrees and snowing,'' Roberts
jotted down, ``and I've got to go back for this impeachment
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yuck. What a bummer.''
</P>
<P>
   What a bummer, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   He had only begun his journal a few days earlier. With history
about to be made, the former journalist began recording
observations and thoughts from his unique vantage point as a
senator-juror in the court that would decide President Clinton's
fate.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually casting his vote in a doomed effort to convict
Clinton on both articles of impeachment, the 62-year-old Kansan did
not go into the trial without his own perceptions about the
president's trustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   The views of Roberts, one of four Republicans elected to the
U.S. Senate from Kansas and Missouri, coincide with many in his
party who frown on much of what the president has done.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts had come to suspect that the White House had used
foreign policy to deflect attention from legal problems and had
boosted favored programs to cement the loyalty of key Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were the kind of things that were sort of bubbling in my
mind as this thing began,'' Roberts said in an interview, offering
context to his private observations of this momentous period. From
the floor of the Senate to its behind-closed-doors sessions, the
observations in Sen. Pat Roberts' journal provide an inside look at
this century's only impeachment trial of a U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   His notes reflect the partisanship, and also the personality, of
one of the region's leading Republicans who struggled at times with
boredom, a bad cold and the swirling emotions of this moment in
history.
</P>
<P>
   The journal was compiled in Roberts' Senate office during breaks
in an often hectic schedule. He later read his entries _ which have
been edited for brevity _ to Steve Kraske, political correspondent
for The Star.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 19: The first entry actually comes well before the trial,
on the day the House passed the two articles of impeachment for
perjury and obstruction of justice. Roberts, who was working in his
Senate office that day, walked over to observe the chamber where he
had served 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The day of infamy.
</P>
<P>
   I had not originally intended on going over to the House. But I
thought this is historic, and I have many good friends over there.
</P>
<P>
   It was emotional chaos. Tears. What's to become of us? What is
going on? We were imploding. This was after Bob Livingston had
announced his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Livingston comes off the floor and sees me, and says,
``Well, Roberts, you won't have me to kick around any more.'' I
give him a big bear hug and I say, ``Bob, we love you. Persevere.''
</P>
<P>
   I mean, there wasn't a dry eye in the place. On both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Gephardt was saying very quietly, ``We need to recess for
15 minutes. I need to change my speech.'' They did not recess. He
got up and spoke from the heart and had tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I only stayed for that first vote, and I left. I was
heartsick....
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 6: The Republicans hold their first impeachment conference
as a party.
</P>
<P>
   We have to figure out process first. We have to prevent the
Senate from self-destructing; everybody feels this way.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, we thought maybe the White House would work with the
House managers to shorten the trial. And that was a nonstarter.
They never got back to us.
</P>
<P>
   We agree that we cannot go past February. We agree that we must
stick together or the whole thing would fall apart, and we must
vote on the articles. Everything else is up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   There are constant meetings both official and unofficial with
Republicans and Democrats and people who knew each other from
committees or were friends who would go off into little huddles.
Both Republicans and Democrats, so that atmosphere was different
than the House.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, we were moving on our legislative agenda much
faster than normal, and we have work to do....
</P>
<P>
   Almost every senator spoke. One Western senator said: ``This is
a hung jury. This is not a trial. This is political. We must do our
constitutional responsibilities, we must protect the rule of law.
But let's face reality. The president will be acquitted. So
whatever we do here, let's keep that in the back of our mind and
see if we can expedite this.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought that made a lot of sense.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Burns, my good buddy from Montana, had the most emotional
speech of the day. He said, `What do you think the movie ``Private
Ryan'' is all about? What do you think our veterans died for? What
makes this country special is not elections...the difference in
this country is...no man is above the law. No man is different than
anybody else....'
</P>
<P>
   You could've heard a pin drop....
</P>
<P>
   Some people might think that's a bit much... (but) that made a
big impression on me. It was like a wake-up call. MORE

 By SCOTT VEALE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; AMERICA IN BLACK AND WHITE: ONE NATION, INDIVISIBLE &LR;  By Stephan
Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster,
$18. Two social scientists argue in language that alternates
between combative and generous that it was World War II and not
civil rights laws and government intervention that led to better
prospects for black America. In 1997 the New York Times reviewer
Nicholas Lemann was not fully persuaded but praised the
``eloquence, toughness and conviction'' of their proposals to
improve race relations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NIGHT TRAIN &LR;  By Martin Amis. Vintage International, $11. The
tough-talking detective Mike Hoolihan is a ``big blond old broad''
assigned to investigate the apparent suicide of the daughter of her
commanding officer, a father figure to both women who saved
Hoolihan from her alcoholism. Last year the reviewer Patrick
McGrath called this ``a police procedural that elegantly defers to
the conventions of the genre while at the same time sinking its
probes deep into the question of human motivation.'' He added that
``this brilliant, painful short novel is ... so profoundly
inflected with grief that it achieves in the end a sort of
melancholy grandeur.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE COMMANDING HEIGHTS: THE BATTLE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND THE
MARKETPLACE THAT IS REMAKING THE MODERN WORLD &LR;  By Daniel Yergin and
Joseph Stanislaw. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15. This ambitious
study charts an extraordinary revolution in progress: the shift in
the balance of power from big government to market forces, and the
effects of that change on global politics, economics and culture.
The result is ``a colorful and even suspenseful story of how the
world has been transformed over the last half century,'' Jeffrey E.
Garten wrote in the Times Book Review in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OPENING AMERICA'S MARKET: U.S. FOREIGN TRADE POLICY SINCE 1776 &LR; 
By Alfred E. Eckes Jr. University of North Carolina, $19.95. A
former trade official in the Bush and Reagan administrations traces
the history of U.S. trade policy to help readers sort through the
arguments of both free-traders and protectionists. In 1995 Michael
Lind called this ``a dispassionate, informed and accessible
account.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A LOVER'S ALMANAC &LR;  By Maureen Howard. Penguin, $12.95. Modeled
on the ``Old Farmer's Almanac,'' this novel strives to demystify
the millennium by following a couple of Generation X'ers and an
extended cast of lively minor characters into the year 2000. It's a
strange brew, but it's also ``rich propaganda'' and ``the product
of obsessive craft,'' Lorna Sage wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIFE WITH A STAR &LR;  By Jiri Weil. Northwestern University,
$15.95. The little-known but influential Czech author, who died in
1959, tells the tale of a lonely former bank clerk struggling to
survive in an unnamed city against the tyranny of an unnamed enemy:
It happens that the man is Jewish, the city is Prague and his
tormentors are the Nazis, but the story gains power through its
universality. In 1989 the reviewer Anne Tyler admired this
``stripped, stark, uninflected novel.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued another of Weil's books,
 &UR; MENDELSSOHN IS ON THE ROOF &LR;  ($15.95), in which a Nazi officer
orders the removal of a statue of the Jewish composer from the roof
of Prague's concert hall, with disastrous results. ``This brilliant
novel ... is dominated by a powerful authorial presence,'' Larry
Wolff wrote in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DREAMING OF HITLER: PASSIONS &AMP; PROVOCATIONS &LR;  By Daphne Merkin.
Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13. These strikingly personal essays and
musings take on such hot-button topics as adultery, the thrill of
shoplifting and the author's fondness for sexual spanking. ``Her
tone is a curious blend of girlishness and old-fashioned literary
starchiness,'' Kate Jennings wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DESSA ROSE &LR;  By Sherley Anne Williams. Quill/Morrow, $12. This
novel reshapes two incidents from the antebellum South _ one
involving a pregnant black woman sentenced to death for leading a
slave uprising, the other a lone white woman who gives sanctuary to
fugitive slaves on her farm _ so that the women meet and form an
unlikely bond. The result is an ``emotionally affecting and totally
unforgettable'' book, David Bradley wrote in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JUBILEE &LR;  By Margaret Walker. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $8.95.
This is the story of Vyry, the strong-willed child of a white
plantation owner and his black mistress, who comes of age during
the Civil War years. ```Jubilee' chronicles the triumph of a free
spirit over many kinds of bondages,'' Wilma Dykeman wrote in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A MARCH TO MADNESS: THE VIEW FROM THE FLOOR IN THE ATLANTIC
COAST CONFERENCE &LR;  By John Feinstein. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.
This account of the 1996-97 college basketball season unfolds
through the eyes of the nine coaches in the Atlantic Coast
Conference. ``Using his near-unlimited access, Feinstein is able to
describe the highs and lows each coach experiences,'' David Davis
wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NIGHT BEAT: A SHADOW HISTORY OF ROCK &AMP; ROLL &LR;  By Mikal Gilmore.
Anchor/Doubleday, $15.95. A journalist explores the dark side of
rock 'n' roll _ the danger, excess and nihilism that infuse the
work of musicians as varied as Elvis Presley and Kurt Cobain. Last
year the reviewer Michael E. Ross admired these ``witty, accessible
and moving essays.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ way it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 2 The Senate begins viewing Monica Lewinsky's videotaped
deposition. With acquittal looming, both sides look for a way to
officially rebuke Clinton for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   The effort for findings of fact against the president, as
opposed to censure, is gaining a little steam. The plan, which I
support, is to try to get at least five Democrats to support it.
Censure to me sets a very bad precedent.
</P>
<P>
   I listen to Monica's deposition. Three and a half hours. Thank
the Lord for fast forward.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 23rd time she has been deposed. She is very poised.
She is a very hostile witness to the House managers. I do not see
the need for Monica on the floor of the Senate and will vote
accordingly....
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 4: A majority of the Senate, including Roberts, votes
against having Lewinsky testify in person.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between Monica and Vernon Jordan is telling. The
president calls during the actual meeting. Jordan does not tell
Monica. Later at the White House that night, Vernon Jordan meets
with the president following his Christmas party, goes to his
private quarters, then says he believes the president in regards to
the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Sure.
</P>
<P>
   All the way through this, it strikes me that it's not what the
president says, it's what the president does not say that is
important. He is the ultimate chess player, the marionette
master....You can see he is really the only one who knows
everything....
</P>
<P>
   When does he ever own up?
</P>
<P>
   Of all the tapes, the Sidney Blumenthal tape is the most
telling. But the House managers ask only for Monica (to testify on
the floor). Calling her and not the others is strange.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal comes right out and says the president lied, and this
went on for five or six months.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 8: Both sides present closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ...I believe good things have happened in closed session.
Members talk to one another. It's like a retreat, as opposed to us
being at one another in the media. And why should the media cover
jury deliberations to begin with?
</P>
<P>
   (House Manager) Steve Buyer of Indiana made a very good point.
He said there are 182 people serving time for perjury last year,
144 for obstruction of justice. What do you tell them?
</P>
<P>
   (Clinton attorney) Charles Ruff is an outstanding lawyer. He
made a very good defense for the president. He said we could not
get into the president's head in regard to intent.... If you're
coaching Betty Currie, maybe you're coaching her because you know
that Betty Currie talks with the first lady, and maybe that was the
reason he did it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shot.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, I have read and outlined Volume 3, Part II, Pages
450 to 625 of the president's grand jury testimony, and I outlined
them in yellow. There are seven times you can say the president was
misleading or untruthful. In Dodge City language, it was lying....
</P>
<P>
   During a break, I...take a short walk to the front of the
Capitol....I got to thinking about it, and I think, the president's
conduct cannot be a different standard for those he can send to war
or those he appoints to dispense justice. This is not right....
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 9: Senators begin their speeches behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   I'd say 90 percent of the senators were in attendance listening
to those 15-minute speeches for 2 days.
</P>
<P>
   And it is here, our third step, where the Senate came
together....
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people gave their personal background, their history,
why they came to the Senate and their affection for their fellow
senators. About halfway, more and more said here are my prepared
remarks and I'm going to hand them in. I just want to share
something else with you. And it got very emotional. There was an
understanding of tolerance and respect. Some were brought to tears.
It was quite a session.
</P>
<P>
   That could not have happened in open session. And it led, I
think, to a sort of a rebirth of the Senate at the end, why you saw
so many people with their arms around people. It was the best of
times, the worst of times.
</P>
<P>
   And then finally it got down to Trent and to Tom Daschle. There
were tears of joy, that we had come together as a Senate. We had
differences, but it was fair. We did the best we could. Both gave a
lot of credit to each other in language that I'm sure will be
sealed, unless they want to make it public....
</P>
<P>
   The outcome is not going to satisfy some with very strong
feelings on both sides. And there's going to be talk of
retribution. It's going to be interesting to see if this has
changed the dynamic of the Senate and how long it will last....
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 12: The Senate renders its verdict, denying the president's
critics even a simple majority for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``guilty'' did not come from my lips with any sense of
accomplishment. It was a sad day for the president. It was a sad
day for the Congress. It was a sad day for the United States....
</P>
<P>
   I found it necessary to take a little breath before I said
``guilty'' each time. You've been through this thing now for 18
days, and there was a lot of emotion in there.
</P>
<P>
   Then I leave and walk out and...do the obligatory 30 seconds on
television and there's (my wife) Franki and the Love Notes, a
Northern Virginia choral group all decked out in hearts, as a
surprise for me for Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   They sang, ``Let Me Call You Sweetheart,'' and I'm thinking,
``Welcome back to the real world.'' Thanks, honey.

WEB CAMERAS LET SURFERS PEEK INTO EVERYDAY LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN SIDENER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a high-tech peephole into Pirkko Essen's kitchen near
Stockholm, Sweden. Fire up your computer and you can see her
teenage children staring longingly at the devil's food cake she
baked Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, spy holes expose nearly every nook of Alex
van Es' home, including a view of who's ringing his doorbell.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, you can get a pretty good view into the Chandler
computer room of Steve and Connie Fannon.
</P>
<P>
   In an intriguing phenomenon sweeping the Internet, people such
as these are broadcasting fragments of their lives into cyberspace
using digital cameras that cost as little as $59.
</P>
<P>
   This swarm of Web cameras, or Web cams, offers live images of
Rottweilers, ferrets, fish tanks, sushi bars, hair curlers and
computer rooms. Lots of computer rooms.
</P>
<P>
   And in an equally perplexing practice on the other side of the
peephole, thousands of computer users are spending hours watching
fully clothed strangers sitting in their living rooms or at their
keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the Web cam world seems fueled by a blend of ego
gratification and performance art. But supporters say it's
simplistic to dismiss it as nothing more than exhibitionism,
voyeurism and street theater.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a face personalizes the cold electronic communication of
the Internet, they say. Others say this is a toddling step toward
the science-fiction future we've been reading about for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more personal, more interactive,'' says Sharon Rothe,
owner operator of the Early-Morning-Coffee Cam and the Curler Cam.
``It's not just a Web page anymore. People can see my face. I can
wave to them and say, `Hi'.''
</P>
<P>
   There are already serious applications in the wings. A fledgling
Tucson firm hopes to market virtual quality time with children by
bringing live video from day care centers to working parents.
</P>
<P>
   This whole Web cam thing began with the Trojan Room Coffee
Machine, set up in the Cambridge University computer lab in 1991.
It soon was followed by Netscape's Fish Cam, which offers live
video of a fish tank.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish Cam spawned other fish cams, dog cams and ant-farm
cams. Then Web cams branched out beyond the critters. One site from
an auto body repair shop shows the live restoration of a vintage
Corvette. A California student who lives across the street from his
high school has constant live video of the school grounds during
daylight hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Club in Tucson offers nightly video of the music
acts on its stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Web cam craze has prompted satirical sites, such as several
litter-box cams, a cam cam that shows a purported live shot of
another Web cam and the Continental Drift Cam, which, broadcasting
from the Four Corners area, allegedly offers live video of the
movement of the Earth's tectonic plates.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web cam owners say that the video draws a striking number
of visitors to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rothe, a New Hampshire resident, went online with her Web cam
``on a whim.'' Then in an equally frivolous gesture, she launched
The Curler Cam, putting her hair up in rollers live on the Internet
each morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since last fall, I've had 6,000 hits (visitors) on my page,''
Rothe said. ``I did it as a joke. But when I stopped, I got a lot
of e-mail from people saying, `Where's the Curler Cam?' ''
</P>
<P>
   She revived the Curler Cam.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Fuhrman of Avondale doesn't have a curler cam or any
other bells and whistles. The 63-year-old's Web cam just shows him
working at his computer. Still, his camera draws a lot of visitors.
He's had about 7,700 hits in the 18 months that the camera has been
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had people from as far away as China, Turkey and
England nag me about my smoking, as if the smoke was bothering
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I receive comments on what I am wearing, drinking, etc. It
really surprises me as to the number of people who look in daily or
many times.''
</P>
<P>
   While 6,000 or 7,000 hits may sound like a lot, it pales in
comparison with the traffic that clicks through the Essen's site,
one of the most popular cams on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are used to having it here as a member of the kitchen,''
Pirkko says via e-mail. ``I am the only one who is thinking some
days, `to open, or not to open.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Essens are not immune from Web surfers looking for sexual
content. They are frequently asked whether they are naked in their
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm, we are always dressed in our kitchen, with or without
the camera,'' Pirkko says.
</P>
<P>
   For computer whiz and fish tank enthusiast Jeffery Green of
Boston, the lure of combining the two technologies was
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it would be neat to have people be able to look
at my fish,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Green's Reef Cam included ``the robot cam,'' which
allowed people to move the camera left and right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also had a camera that was actually in the tank, the sub
cam,'' Green wrote via e-mail. ``My friends have always thought it
was kind of cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Web cam owners run the demographic gamut, from middle-age
Japanese women to young urban American couples to Western ranchers,
though probably the largest number are young, Anglo males.
</P>
<P>
   Many owners tout the lack of purpose behind their Web cams,
calling them useless, goofy and pointless.
</P>
<P>
   But some others have specific objectives, such as the site
posted by 18-year-old Travis Kroh, who attends MacArthur High in
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I originally just wanted to keep in touch with my friends
after I moved (from Wahpeton, N.D.), but I get e-mail from all over
the place.''
</P>
<P>
   A common refrain from Web cam owners is that this technology
allows them to go where no one has been before.
</P>
<P>
   One such pioneering site is the one run by van Es in the
Netherlands. Van Es has several devices wired into the gamepad port
on his computer, including his doorbell, his refrigerator and his
phone. Even his trash can, bathroom and cat's eating area are wired
in, though not all areas have Web cams.
</P>
<P>
   If you take a look at his site, you can see images of anyone who
has rung his doorbell or opened his refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   You can see the numbers of anyone who phones his house or a
photo of his cat each time she eats. A bar scanner tracks anything
he throws in his trash.
</P>
<P>
   Van Es is serious about the electronic fishbowl technology he is
developing and hopes to market it. ``This is the future,'' he
declares on his Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Another person who is serious about making Web cams useful is
Steve Lacy of Tucson. Lacy has developed and is beginning to market
a system using Web cams to allow parents to peek into their
children's day care center from work.
</P>
<P>
   Called Window2Care, the system would be installed without cost
to the day care center. Parents would pay an estimated $19.95 a
month for access to the Web site where the video is displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The system uses passwords to keep prying strangers from viewing
the children. Lacy initially plans to market the service in the
Tucson area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives parents peace of mind,'' he said. ``It adds
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents also feel a little bit guilty about leaving their kids
in day care. This gives them a chance to check in. If they can
watch them play, it gives them the feeling that they didn't leave
them all day. At the end of the day, they can say, `I saw you
playing with little Johnny.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fannon installs high-speed video conferencing equipment as
part of his job as network administrator for a small company with
offices in Tucson and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He has a simpler Web cam in the computer room of his Chandler
home for friends and relatives to check in and see how he and his
family are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Watching video conferences connect far-flung offices at work
leads Fannon to believe that Web cams are more than a high-tech
toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get to the point where we all have cable modems or
something faster, this is going to be extremely valuable,'' he
said. ``We're talking about a Jetsons scenario.'' &QL;

FOSSILS FOUND IN FLORIDA REVEAL DIFFERENT KIND OF SABERTOOTH CAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE CARROLL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Amateur fossil hunters stumbled upon a new kind of
sabertooth cat years ago while hunting for fossils of wild pigs in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, they didn't know what they had.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until recently that University of Kansas
paleontologist Larry Martin figured it out. What the amateurs had
found was a third category of sabertooth cat _ one that was the
``biggest, meanest in the world at that time,'' Martin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a while to realize that this was a different kind
of cat,'' said Martin, curator of vertebrate paleontology at KU's
Museum of Natural History and one of the world's authorities on
sabertooth cats. ``I was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   The find, detailed in the February issue of Discover magazine,
certainly is one of the most intriguing in decades, said
Christopher Shaw, collection manager for the George C. Page Museum
at the Rancho La Brea in Los Angeles. ``It's a very important
specimen,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the discovery, scientists thought there were two kinds of
sabertooths in North America _ dirk-tooth and scimitar-tooth.
Dirk-tooths, which include the genus Smilodon, had narrow upper
canine teeth that were up to 7 inches long. They had short legs and
were built like bears.
</P>
<P>
   Scimitar-tooths, which include the genus Homotherium, had
shorter, broader upper canines. They were long-legged and built
like cheetahs.
</P>
<P>
   The new sabertooth cat combines some of the deadliest features
of the others. It had two short, broad upper canines and short
legs. Its sabers cut parallel slits into its prey, and its serrated
incisors acted like a rotor, cutting a deep groove, allowing a big
strip of meat to roll out.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time it was living, this thing kicked Smilodon anywhere
it wanted to,'' Martin said. ``It's possible that Smilodon didn't
become dominant until the Florida cat became extinct, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin learned about the Florida discovery two years ago when
John Babiarz of Mesa, Ariz., invited him to look at his sabertooth
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Babiarz bought the Florida fossil from the amateurs who found
it. He didn't realize it was a new category of sabertooth; indeed,
it took Martin a while to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't believe the skeleton he had with it actually went
with the skull,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   When he realized they went together, he said, paleontologists
had to characterize a whole new group of sabertooth cats.
</P>
<P>
   The amateur hunters in north-central Florida found two complete
fossils of the new cat, which could be called ``xenosmilus.''
Martin said the fossils probably were found at least 10 years ago.
They were discovered at a site known as Hog Heaven because dozens
of fossils of wild hogs had been found there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of like a little cave,'' Martin said. ``It had
been occupied by these animals (sabertooths) sometime back in the
Ice Age about a million years ago.... This was probably a den and
the (sabertooths) were catching things and bringing them in, and
the main thing they brought in were some wild pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabertooths lived throughout the world. They inhabited North
America for more than 40 million years before becoming extinct
about 11,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Martin says he does not know how long the new variety of cat
lived. Since only two fossils have been found, he said, possibly it
was not around as long as the two other kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, the California expert, said he did not know whether the
Florida cat was the biggest, baddest cat around during its time.
Paleontologists need to look at more fossils to determine whether
that's true.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he had seen a cast of the Florida cat but would like
to look at the fossil. Babiarz still has the fossil he bought; the
other one is in a museum in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   KU has a cast of the cat's skull and all its bones. KU
paleontologists plan to put them together for display.

BURNS COMES IN FROM THE COLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Someone asked Bob Burns how he felt after he
strolled off the 18th green Saturday at Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruddy, cruddy,'' Burns replied.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting response, considering the former Cal State
Northridge All-American golfer had just shot a 69, his third
straight subpar round at the Nissan Open.
</P>
<P>
   Burns wasn't referring to his play, though. He's been bothered
all week by a cold that no amount of decongestants has helped,
especially after finishing his round Friday in the chilly evening
winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt worse than yesterday,'' Burns said, in between
sniffles.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the way Burns is playing, perhaps he should try and
stay stuffy. He is 8-under-par in his last 45 holes at Riviera, and
5-under for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   That's eight strokes off the lead, which is disastrous if your
name is Tiger Woods, but pretty respectable for Burns.
</P>
<P>
   When you are three years removed from losing your PGA Tour
exemption, eight strokes back sounds just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate being back out here because I was playing for
pennies and table scraps on the Nike Tour,'' Burns said. ``I worked
pretty hard to get back here.''
</P>
<P>
   The road back has been longer than Burns expected. After getting
booted off the tour in 1995, he missed earning his '96 tour card by
a single stroke during the PGA qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
   So he joined the Nike Tour and struggled to make $31,353 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty tough,'' Burns said. ``I wrote that year off a
while ago. (But) it's an important part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns took 1997 off to regroup, and rebounded by being the No.1
player on the Nike Tour in 1998 with two tournament victories and
$178,664 in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case it seemed like a fluke, Burns has made $37,800 in
four tournaments this year, and should have another decent payday
at Riviera this weekend. At this pace, he should be able to keep
his PGA card for next season.
</P>
<P>
   But Burns said he doesn't let his precarious status on the tour
affect his play, nor does he worry about losing his exemption
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel scared to tee it up. I come out to play,'' Burns
said. ``I've been out here before.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what Burns shoots today, this Nissan Open already
became special Friday, when he hit a hole-in-one at the 155-yard
16th hole. For a moment at No.16 on Saturday, he thought he might
duplicate the feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 7-iron I hit went right at the hole,'' Burns said. ``I
thought, `Go ahead, two for two.'''
</P>
<P>
   Burns settled for a par. His 69 came with four birdies and two
bogeys, although it looked like he might do better after being
5-under on the front nine. Burns played the back nine even.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played pretty solidly Friday and today,'' Burns said. ``I
felt I shot the highest I could have shot. I just can't get my
putter to come around.''
</P>

   Although Burns is staying this weekend with his parents in
Granada Hills, he lives in Knoxville, Tenn., with his wife Hilary.
The slower pace is more to Burns' liking and in his spare time, he
helps his wife breed dogs.

<P>
   ``I like the wide open space. I wouldn't mind 100 acres
surrounded by forest with no people around,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he might be able to afford it.

DEVELOP THE SAVING HABIT: PAY YOURSELF FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Do you ever feel as though your working life is a
treadmill to oblivion because the proceeds from your paycheck seem
to belong to everyone but you?
</P>
<P>
   Those trapped in the nightmare of living from paycheck to
paycheck know the frustration of sharing their income with everyone
except themselves. Sometimes there's a smidgen left to finance some
fun, sometimes not. If not, well, there's always the credit card,
but putting it on the cuff speeds up the treadmill by expanding the
claim on future paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a younger worker trapped in this situation, your
future is bleak unless you do something about it. Before you know
it, you wake up an older worker facing retirement with nothing to
sustain your post-working life except Social Security benefits and,
if you're lucky, a modest pension.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the question for those whose working life is an exercise
in futility is how to escape the trap. The solution, fortunately,
is as easily said as done: Pay yourself first.
</P>
<P>
   The pay-yourself-first concept in this sense doesn't mean
setting aside mad money to blow on a good time. Rather, this
pay-yourself-first plan is designed to ensure that you get as much
long-term reward from your work as those to whom you write checks
each month. They're using your money to make money, so why
shouldn't you do the same?
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of embracing the pay-yourself-first concept is
building an asset base that gets your moneymaking some money. A job
with a regular paycheck is the foundation stone of financial
security, but progress toward financial independence can be
accelerated significantly by putting your money to work as well.
</P>
<P>
   If your resources are relatively meager, your starting point
might be as basic as putting a set amount from each paycheck into a
savings account until you accumulate enough to get into a mutual
fund or purchase a certificate of deposit with a higher interest
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The higher your income, of course, the more latitude you have.
You might think about getting into a mutual fund immediately and
initiating a systematic plan to make a substantial deposit once or
twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky enough to work for a company offering a 401(k)
plan, you're already far ahead of the game. Not only does the
company help ensure discipline by withholding your savings at the
source, but many employers sweeten your pot with a profit-sharing
contribution that partly matches yours.
</P>
<P>
   Don't despair, though, if no company saving-and-investment plan
is available. Look into the options available for establishing
individual retirement accounts, tax-advantaged and otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Paying yourself first is about developing the saving habit.
</P>
<P>
   Many people don't save because they don't think they can afford
to put anything aside. In truth, they can't afford not to put
something aside for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not in the saving habit, your challenge is to convince
yourself that you have as much right to your money as anyone else.
Try it. You'll like it.

HOW THINGS WERE: RELIVING FRAGMENTS OF ONE'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Sometimes the feeling of how things were comes back
with a force that nearly takes the breath.
</P>
<P>
   Out driving on some errand yesterday, I passed the sledding hill
where our daughters and their friends, when all of them were small,
used to spend snowy winter afternoons and evenings.
</P>
<P>
   We parents were there, too, huddled close to the barrels that
held the warming fires, and once in a great while sharing a ride to
the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   All those children are grown to men and women now, and we're
20-some years older. I've often passed along that street in the
intervening years, without ever being much affected by memories of
the times we had there.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday was different. Everything came back with a rush:
the bite of frosty air, the smell of burning wood, the excited
cries of those scores of young voices. And it was more than just
remembering. There was the sense, brief but very powerful, of
actually living in that time again.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone, I suppose, there must be places like that _ places
where, in a surprising instant, the past comes completely,
convincingly alive. And while it lasts, you are younger, and
everything around you is as it was.
</P>
<P>
   In an older neighborhood of the city is the street on which I
spent all but the first few of my boyhood years. The houses, mostly
modest bungalows, look a good deal more worn now. But otherwise the
street is little changed.
</P>
<P>
   Standing a bit down the hill from my own house, I am a boy
again, and with me _ all around me _ are the other boys of the
block. We're hurrying to finish some rowdy game, because the light
is going and any moment now our mothers will be appearing on the
porches to call us in for supper.
</P>
<P>
   Another such place for me is the press room of the newspaper, a
great sunken hall below the level of the street, full of enormous
machines.
</P>
<P>
   When the presses are running, there's a world of noise and
activity, and it's exciting then, as you'd expect. A few days after
I first came to work here, in my early 20s and just out of school,
I ventured down there at some off hour _ a Sunday morning, it must
have been.
</P>
<P>
   The place was utterly silent. Not another soul was there. And
yet there was a feeling of keen expectation, as if at any instant
those giant presses might roar to life and give even a beginner's
words the possibility of reaching hearts.
</P>
<P>
   I still go down there sometimes, when nobody's about, to feel
again exactly how it was to be just starting, and to be reminded of
what hope it was that bound me for a lifetime to this work.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from where we now live, only 20 blocks or so to the
south, is the first real house of our married life. Occasionally I
turn there, brake the car, and sit a moment, wrapped in the sense
of beginning.
</P>
<P>
   We are young, both of us. And the girls are in the nursery
upstairs. Parents are alive, and so are all the friends who made
those years so rich. I'm full of the elation of a grand adventure
only just started.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are other places in this world I care about,
some of them a lot. But none with quite the same power those have
to scroll the years backward and let me live fine moments another
time.
</P>
<P>
   One can spend all or nearly all one's years in a single place,
as I've chosen to do, and be thought provincial. Or, propelled by
accident, obligation, or restless ambition, one can be endlessly
starting over among strangers.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that either way is necessarily better than the other.
But how is it possible to travel so fast, so far, without leaving
those earlier pieces of yourself irretrievably behind?

PENNSYLVANIA EXPLOSION KILLS FIVE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER TOWNSHIP, Pa. _ When he felt an explosion so big that it
shook pictures off his wall and shattered windows in neighboring
houses, Rich Wheeler thought a plane from a nearby airport had
crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like someone just grabbed the building and shook it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the explosion Wheeler heard about 8:15 p.m. had destroyed a
chemical factory just across the road and up a small hill. Hours
later, rescue workers pulled five dead men from its remains, among
them a father and son.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the men who died worked at Concept Sciences Inc. They
were Anthony Mondello Sr., 55, of Pen Argyl, Pa.; his son Paul
Mondello, 25, of Easton; Paul Wanamaker, 43, of Northampton; and
Rubin Soto, 52, of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth man, Terry Bowers, 48, of Allentown, worked for a
different company in the same building.
</P>
<P>
   The four men, who were working the second shift of the day, were
pronounced dead at the scene. Six other workers were injured, two
critically, in the explosion, and two security officers and six
firefighters who reported to the scene were also injured.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities began investigating n Saturday the explosion at
Concept Sciences, which they said had begun operating in the
building only a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Mark Schweiker, who toured the site, said the ``working
theory'' was that there was an improper mixing of chemicals inside
the building. But Maj. Robert Werts of the Pennsylvania State
Police said, ``It could take days, weeks,'' to pinpoint the cause
of the blast. State and local investigators were scheduled to meet
with officials from the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The company manufactures hydroxylamine which can be used for
cleaning computer chips or etching integrated circuits. Officials
said about one hundred companies in the Lehigh Valley in Eastern
Pennsylvania work with the same chemical. There was no answer to
telephone calls to a nearby Concept Sciences office on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Much as they would do in a plane crash, investigators were
attempting to collect debris from the explosion, but their work was
being slowed because of the presence of potentially hazardous
chemicals. Workers wore protective clothing and had to pass through
several decontamination processes after leaving the factory, which
officials referred to as a ``hot zone.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, hundreds of fire and rescue workers arrived at
the scene of the explosion. But first they had to make sure the
building was structurally safe and test for hazardous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Thorough searching for victims did not begin until midnight,
Marko Bourne, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Emergency Management
Agency, said Saturday, ``At 4 a.m., it was realized this was not a
rescue _ this was a recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Little remains of the building which sits in a hollow surrounded
by marsh, a highway, and other factories and warehouses. The walls
were blown outward and the roof collapsed. The building looked as
if the center was demolished. The steel framework was bent down and
inward. A 25-foot concrete wall had apparently crumbled in the
blast, leaving a crater four feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion shook houses as far as 13 miles away and sent a
large cloud over the area, local residents said.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler, who lives across the street from the factory said his
well water was so cloudy that it looked ``like someone had put
Alka-Seltzer in it.'' He and a neighbor were drinking bottled
water, he said adding, ``That's what we're worried about _ what was
in there?''
</P>
<P>
   But Bourne said that workers had been taking air, water, and
ground samples and found no contamination.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least four growing industrial parks in the Lehigh
Valley's softly rolling hills, where former blue-collar towns,
farmland, suburbs and service industries coexist.
</P>
<P>
   This area was the home of Bethlehem Steel, but the steel
operation finally closed for good last year. Other major
manufacturers like Mack Trucks that once provided secure jobs and
decent pay checks have left or closed, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the laid-off workers from those jobs have been hired for
factory or service work in the industrial park, which helps pay at
least some of the bills. There have been other explosions at
chemical factories in this area, but none, the authorities said,
where they remember such a high toll in human life.
