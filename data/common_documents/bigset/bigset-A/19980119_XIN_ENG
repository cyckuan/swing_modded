<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Adopts Position on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Cabinet approved
Sunday the position to be adopted by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu when he meets U.S. President Bill Clinton, without
making a real decision on further Israeli redeployment in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The weekly Cabinet session was devoted to preparing for the
pending visit to Washington Tuesday by Netanyahu. It approved the
stand proposed by the hawkish National Infrastructure Minister
Ariel Sharon, that the government would only consider carrying
out further redeployment which will not harm Israeli national
interests after Netanyahu's return from Washington.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cabinet reiterated that the implementation of
the redeployment depends on the Palestinian National Authority's
(PNA) fulfillment of obligations listed by Israel. Those
obligations include fighting terrorism and terror infrastructure,
revising the Palestinian Charter, restricting police forces and
extraditing terror suspects.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said the cabinet decision would
give an opportunity to Netanyahu to have serious discussions with
Clinton on Israel's national interests and aspects.
</P>
<P>
Before the Cabinet session, Netanyahu held separate talks with
Sharon and the more dovish Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai to
coordinate their positions. Netanyahu said the adopted decision
was both acceptable to Mordechai and Sharon.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Netanyahu told foreign diplomats here that he would
travel to Washington with "necessary flexibility and firmness."
In the previous Cabinet meetings, Netanyahu said he would present
Clinton only principles rather than specific percentage of the
further redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The hardline leader is posed to defy any pressure from
Washington for a speedy and credible pullback in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The United States is urging Israel and the PNA to take real
actions in order to save the peace process. In addition to the
meeting with Netanyahu, Clinton is also to meet with PNA
President Yasser Arafat on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Due to the hardline position taken by Israel's rightwing
government, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright played
down Saturday any dramatic breakthrough in Clinton's talks with
Netanyahu and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side reacted swiftly to the Israeli Cabinet
decision to delay any action on the further redeployment. Senior
PNA negotiator Saeb Erekat urged the U.S. government to stand firm
on Israel to demand for accurate implementation of the signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Israel of playing "game of stalling" in order to
avoid any real implementation of the signed agreements, Erekat
warned that the Palestinians are losing their patience with
Israel and the situation could be out of control if the deadlock
in the peace process continued.
</P>
<P>
"It's time for President Clinton to tell Mr. Netanyahu that
(it's) enough, our patience has run out and we want to save the
peace process," he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Hopeful of Peaceful Solution to UN-Iraq Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The British government remains
hopeful of a peaceful solution to the worsening U.N.-Iraq crisis
over arms inspection, but refuses to rule out the use of force as
the last resort.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview today, British Defense
Secretary George Robertson said that he hoped a diplomatic
solution to the latest crisis could be found.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are likely to hear a lot of noise but hopefully a
diplomatic solution will be found," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
However, the defense secretary refused to rule out the
possibility of using force, saying, "Diplomacy in the past has
only worked when backed up by force."
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Gulf region is becoming more and more
tense following Baghdad's announcement Monday that it would bar a
U.N. arms inspection team headed by an American.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the most staunch American ally during the Gulf War in
1991, has sent one of its aircraft carriers, HMS Invincible, to
the Gulf region.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa's Transport Network Enough for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE January 18 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa's transport
system is adequate and able to meet traffic demand under the
drought weather, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
has said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of Drought Update, a UNDP
magazine, released here today, the adequacy of the region's
transport system was however depending on sufficient operational
coordination arrangements and transit facilitation measures being
put in place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, a close monitoring of the regional transport
system performance is required to commence immediately," the
magazine said, quoting a world food program report on drought
contingency planning.
</P>
<P>
It said the region could draw lessons from the considerable
investments it has made over the years in developing its
transport infrastructure, human and institutional capacity
building and the commendable movement of food in the 1992 drought
in responding to future challenges.
</P>
<P>
There had been predictions that southern Africa would be hit
by an El-Nino induced drought this year but some countries like
Zimbabwe have recently had above normal rains.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the magazine urged the Zimbabwean government to
speed up the formulation of its drought preparedness plan which
it hoped would be ready for discussion by all stakeholders this
year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tourism to Grow This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tourism sector is
this year projected to earn over five billion Zimbabwean Dollars
(300 million U.S. Dollars) as the country steps up an aggressive
international marketing campaign to lure visitors.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwean News Agency today,
Zimbabwean Tourism Authority (ZTZ) Chief Executive Joseph
Chigwedere said over 1.8 million tourists were expected to visit
the country in 1998, up from last year's estimated arrivals of
1.6 million which earned the country 3.4 billion Zimbabwean
Dollars (200 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
"There is a greater growth in revenue generation than in
tourist arrivals," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This goes well with our main focus, which is to target fewer,
but high spending holiday makers who also stay longer in the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "this appears to be a favorable year for tourism
because the threats of an El-Nino induced drought, seems to be
fading and the country is enjoying a good image overseas, because
of its peace and security."
</P>
<P>
He added that the fall of the Zimbabwean Dollar against most
major currencies, late last year, would also lure more overseas
tourists because of favorable exchange rates for them.

<HEADLINE> 7 Iraqis, 1 Egyptian Killed in Amman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian police said Sunday that
seven Iraqis, including the charge d'affaires of the Iraqi Embassy
to Amman and his wife, and an Egyptian, were stabbed to death
Saturday night here.
</P>
<P>
The other five Iraqis murdered were businessmen living in Amman
and the Egyptian was believed to be the bodyguard of the diplomat,
police said.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, identified as Hikmet Al-Hijo, had been serving at
the embassy for three years.
</P>
<P>
The official Radio Jordan quoted a victim as saying the
violence were carried out by four or five men speaking with Iraqi
accent.
</P>
<P>
The assassinations took place at a large villa of Iraqi
millionaire Sami George in west Amman, where all the victims were
attending a dinner, a police source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources told Xinhua that some government
officials believe that the murder was committed by Iraqi
opposition movements and say that the Jordanian-Iraqi relations
will face high tension in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi opposition movements are believed to have been operating
in Jordan with financial support from the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency for a long time, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest Iraqi opposition movements, Al Wefaq, has an
office here.
</P>
<P>
The opposition movements had established a weekly poper called
"Tareek Al Mostakbel" (Way to the Future) before it was closed for
violating Jordan's press law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the movements still run a radio station here.
</P>
<P>
Some other Jordanian government officials believe that
Saturday's killers were just burglars or robbers.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 250,000 Iraqis living in Jordan. Most
of them do not have long-time or permanent residence.
</P>
<P>
Last week two Iraqis were charged here with attempted murder
and nine others with complicity in the assassination attempt on
Rahim Taher, commercial councillor at the Iraqi Embassy on January
3.
</P>
<P>
They shot at the diplomat while he was starting his car in
front of his residence. The bullet missed him, but hit his car.
</P>
<P>
Most of the suspects were confirmed to be from one family. They
confessed that they wanted to kill the diplomat because of "family
and financial disputes."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday the Iraqi Foreign Ministry issued a statement,
strongly condemning Saturday's assassination and asking the
Jordanian government to begin immediate investigation.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also decided to send two officials to Amman to
help probe into the case.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries deteriorated after Iraq
executed four Jordanians on charges of smuggling car parts into
Iraq on December 8, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jordan recalled its charge d'affaires from Baghdad and expelled
seven Iraqi diplomats in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
However, ties improved a little bit in late December when Iraq
agreed to renew a contract to sell oil to Jordan at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
Jordan used to be siding with Iraq before and during the Gulf
War. But after that, Jordan began to distance itself from Iraq in
order to end international alienation.
</P>
<P>
Normal ties have been maintained over the past years, as Iraq
provided Jordan with free or cut-rates crude oil and Jordan
exports food and medicine to Iraq under the U.N.-Iraqi
oil-for-food deal.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Holocaust Museums Invite Arafat for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- In a goodwill gesture, two
Israeli leading Holocaust museums extended invitations Sunday to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
The two museums are Jerusalem's Yad Vashem, Israel's national
memorial museum on Holocaust, and the Yad Mordechai Holocaust
museum at Kibbutz Yad Mordechai, north to the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The two museums extended the invitation to Arafat following
the decision of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in
Washington to turn down Arafat's request for an official visit
during his upcoming visit to Washington on Thursday. Arafat is
still free to visit the Washington museum if he wishes, but only
in his personal capacity without special security arrangement
provided to VIPs.
</P>
<P>
The Washington museum's refusal came after rightwing members
of the American Jewish community warned against the
invitation. The rightists called Arafat "Hitler Incarnate" who is
not welcomed in the memorial to Hitler's victims.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to American rightist Jews' move, Yad Vashem
extended a formal invitation to Arafat for a visit. The museum
said it would be honored to host Arafat and the Palestinian leader
would gain much from the visit.
</P>
<P>
The Yad Mordechai museum refuted the rightists' claim that
Arafat is a Holocaust denier, saying Jews should talk more about
Holocaust with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The peace group Kibbutz Artzi Movement, which initiated the
invitation to Arafat for visit to Yad Mordechai museum, blasted
extremist American Jews for opposing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"More than 50 years after the Holocaust, while we are in
the midst of a peace process, I think it is our greatest
victory if the Palestinian side understands and recognizes the
great injustice that was done to the Jewish people," movement
head Avshalom Vilan told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear if Arafat will accept the invitations, but
senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinian
leader is seriously considering them.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Optimistic About Cyprus' Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides Sunday expressed optimism about the future of the divided
island, saying that 1998 would be the year to mark the start of a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the international community to act more
decisively toward Ankara to open the road for a solution to the
protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here, Clerides said that after the
presidential elections next month, "a new initiative is expected
to culminate to find a settlement to our national problem and
negotiations for Cyprus accession to the European Union (EU) will
begin."
</P>
<P>
The EU summit in Luxembourg last month decided to include
Cyprus in the countries eligible to start accession negotiations
in March this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Clerides stressed that the fate of the new initiative
and the result of the EU negotiations will depend, to a great
extent, on the strategy to be followed.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Clerides called for "the greatest possible
unity, responsible handling, determination and boldness" among the
Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the fundamental elements of a Cyprus
settlement should include the withdrawal of the Turkish troops
from the island, demilitarization and the deployment of a
multi-national force with a U.N. Security Council mandate.
</P>
<P>
A solution, he said, should safeguard the co-existence of Greek
Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots under the permanent peace on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island as
a bizonal, bicommunal federation through peace talks, but so far
little progress has been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Cargo Planes Ready to Airlift Relief Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Skyplan East Africa
Company is ready to airlift 47 tons of relief food stranded in
Tanzania's Ngorongoro District to its destination with cargo
planes, the Managing Director of the company, Salim Ismail said
in Dar es Salaam today.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said that his company is ready to give an attractive
discount of the transport charges to send the relief food
anxiously awaited by over 50,000 hunger-stricken people.
</P>
<P>
The managing director said his company is busy getting in
touch with the relevant authorities, trying to persuade them to
adopt his idea of airlifting the food.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the company's cargo planes do not need an
airstrip for landing. "The planes can land at any open space," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The relief food is stranded in Ngorongoro because of
torrential rains linked to the El-Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The company's suggestion has been made in response to the
appeal made by the member of Parliament for Ngorongoro, Mathew
ole Timam, who said seven trucks of the Oxfam Food Relief Agency
have been stuck at Ngorongoro over the past ten days.
</P>
<P>
The food was meant for Loliondo and Sele villages where people
are on starvation.
</P>
<P>
"I am so much worried that something has to be done to save
these people from starvation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The food is temporarily sheltered at the Ngorongoro
Conservation Area Authority offices waiting for weather
improvement.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rains have played havoc with Tanzania, extensively
damaging bridges, roads, buses and leaving tens of thousands of
people homeless.
</P>
<P>
Timam also said the world-famous Ngorongoro Crater is flooded,
posing serious threats to both tourists and animals.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambian vice-president
Christon Tembo today expressed concern over the increase in the
the abuse of drugs in his country, Zambia News Agency ZANA
reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception organized here by the Progressive Life
Center of Zambia, a non-government organization, Tembo said drug
abuse by the productive sector of the population will eventually
have negative impacts on overall development of the country.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this is critical to the growth and welfare
of the nation.
</P>
<P>
A Zambian people that is strong mentally, socially and
spiritually is an absolute prerequisite to the flourishing of a
healthy society, said the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has seen more and more crimes related to drug
trafficking and abuse in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
During his speech, Tembo also disclosed that there has been a
high rate of alcohol abuse following the recent retrenchments
which cost tens of thousands of people's jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said that many people who have lost their jobs are turning
to alcohol as a way of solving their personal problems.

<HEADLINE> 20,000 Demonstrate in Paris Against Unemployment, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- About 20,000 people demonstrated
here today against unemployment, which they said is being worsened
by the social and economic policy set by the government for
joining the European single currency euro.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, backed by the Communist Party (PCF) and the
party of Mouvement des Citoyens (MDC), also called for a national
referendum on the euro and a raise of minimum social welfare aid.
</P>
<P>
After participating in the demonstration, PCF National
Secretary Robert Hue urged a "loosening of the stranglehold of the
euro market" upon France to help the 3 million unemployed in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government should loosen the constraint on the
budget imposed by the euro, and adopt a European policy which is
in favor of jobs, social protection and "an alternative use of
money."
</P>
<P>
"European integration has become too often the synonym of
unemployment, of deregulation, of subjecting workers and farmers
to market competition, the synonym of technocracy, of budgetary
constraint, of attacks upon social budgets," said the PCF leader.
</P>
<P>
Both the PCF and the MDC are part of the leftwing government of
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who is under increasing pressure
from the unemployed and his allies in the coalition who urge a
change of his social and economic policy.

Minister Saeed Bin Mustafa on the situation in Algeria, the
Algerian news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting, Mustafa said he expressed strong
denunciation of the terrorist attacks aimed at innocent civilians
at the meeting in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa, who arrived here Saturday evening, pointed out that he

Ali to Zeroual within the framework of bilateral consultations.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian minister underlined the necessity of concerted
efforts at the international level to combat terrorism and to
uproot it wherever it might be and whoever were responsible to it.

He added that he was confident that the Algerian leadership
would find appropriate solutions to put an end to terrorist

affairs.
</P>
<P>
Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf attended the meeting.
</P>

<HEADLINE> PNA: Israeli Cabinet's Decision Will Harm Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Sunday blasted the Israel's decision
of refusing to announce the size of troop redeployment in the
West bank, saying that such a move could harm the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet announced after it's meeting Sunday that it
had decided not to make a final decision on the size of troop
redeployment in the West Bank until Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu comes back from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rodaineh, Information advisor to PNA President Yasser
Arafat, said in Gaza Sunday that such a decision by the Israeli
government will not help move the peace process forward,
according to the Jerusalem Media and Communication Center (JMCC),
a Palestinian news center based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He called on the United States to exert the necessary pressure
on Israel to redeploy its troops in the West Bank as stipulated in
the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
PNA Higher Education Minister Hanna Ashrawi termed the Israeli
decision a blow to the United States, adding that such a decision
reflects the true nature of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PNA officials are not optimistic about
U.S. President Bill Clinton's separate meetings with Netanyahu and
Arafat in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is scheduled to leave Israel for Washington Monday
and his meeting with Clinton in the White House will be held
Tuesday. Clinton will meet with Arafat Thursday in the White House.
</P>
<P>
JMCC quoted PNA Minister of Planning and International
Cooperation Nabil Shaath as saying Sunday that the Washington
talks could not produce positive results because the
U.S. administration is not willing to exert the necessary
pressure on the Israeli government and make it comply with the
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
"The State Department has already informed the PNA to lower
expectations," he said.
</P>
<P>
PNA chief negotiator Saeb Erikat also expressed his doubt
Sunday that the Washington talks will move the peace process
forward because Netanyahu goes to Washington empty-handed.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- French Parliament Speaker Laurent
Fabius today played down the on-going protests by France's
unemployed workers and said all the precedent governments had been
through similar difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"During the first six months (of government), one had the
feeling that the government was going from success to success....
But in one moment, as it is normal, one meets the problems which
the government is faced with," said Fabius in an interview with
the Radio-Television Luxembourg (RTL).
</P>
<P>
Fabius, who was once prime minister under President Francois
Mitterrand, said that an acceptance of the demand to raise the
minimum social welfare aid would force the government to impose
more taxes "to find the financings."
</P>
<P>
He said that although the unemployed have "received a lot of
sympathy," their movement does not make up a "mass" movement for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
"There is no mass demonstration, but this is a problem of the
mass. One should answer it, and the government has started," he
said.

<HEADLINE> US, Saddam Digging Deeper Sanctions Hole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said today that Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's threat to block U.N. weapons inspections could only dig
a "deeper hole" without any prospect of lifting sanctions upon the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Threatening to throw UNSCOM (the U.N. Special Commission) out
does not solve the situation for Saddam Hussein," Albright told
NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
Saddam on Saturday said he would carry out a demand from the
Iraqi parliament to end arms inspections unless sanctions were
lifted. He made the remarks on the occasion of the seventh
anniversary of the Gulf War, in which Iraq was defeated by the
U.S.-led coalition and forced to flee Kuwait it invaded in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Albright said Saddam's remarks "make very clear he is digging
the sanctions hole deeper because he can't get out of it if UNSCOM
is not able to do its work and declare that he in fact has
fulfilled his obligations."
</P>
<P>
Albright did not rule out the use of military force in coping
with Iraq over the latest standoff over the weapons inspections,
but she said it was important to continue pursuing the current
diplomatic course.
</P>
<P>
"While the threat of military force is there -- and there are
those who think we should use it now -- I think it is very
important for us to pursue the course that we are on," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bill Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, told ABC's "This Week" news program that Saddam's remarks
on Saturday were a "very, very provocative speech" and the U.N.
Security Council was fast losing patience with President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
U.N. chief arms inspector Richard Butler is on his way to
Baghdad in an effort to find a diplomatic resolution to the latest
crisis on the weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said the U.N. Security Council was waiting for a
report when Butler returned from his mission. "What Ambassador
Butler's trip brings back will be a very significant threshold,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
John McCain, a Republican Senator, said in an interview with
CBS that military action against Iraq was inevitable unless
something dramatically changed.
</P>
<P>
"The question is not going to be, in my opinion, whether we use
military action but what kind," he said.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Sandy Burger said in the same
interview that he had heard McCain's advice but could not
speculate on what kind of military action might be taken.
</P>
<P>
"We will cross that bridge when we come to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Berger repeated the Clinton administration's statement that
Saddam Hussein was "digging a deeper and deeper hole for himself"
by threatening to end weapons inspections.

PARIS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Former French President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing today expressed support for the European Union
(EU) mission to Algeria which will start Monday.
</P>
<P>
State secretaries from Britain, Luxembourg and Austria, which
are the present, the preceding and the next presidency states of
the EU also called the EU Troika, will fly to Algiers Monday to
discuss with the Algerian government the country's fight against
terrorism and possible EU aid to the victims of the massacres
perpetuated by Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
"I approve this initiative, but one should avoid a trap: we are
not going to be involved in an internal confrontation of Algeria,"
said d'Estaing in an interview with the Europe 1 television
channel.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the EU Troika insist on "the return of a
certain law in the repression" on Islamic militants by the
government.
</P>
<P>
"At the present moment there is neither trial nor justice. What
have become of the men who were arrested? Who are the men they
executed? One should return to the law," said d'Estaing.
</P>
<P>
He also said that besides aiding the victims of violence, the
EU should encourage "the beginning of political dialogue which
exists in Algeria."
</P>
<P>
"There have been even the elections. They are not totally
representative, but they have taken place. There are political
parties, one should encourage the political debates in Algeria,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Records First Budget Surplus Since War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait gained a budget
surplus of 63.2 million Kuwait dinars (208.56 million U.S.
dollars) in the 1996-97 fiscal year ending on June 30, the first
since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the National Assembly Sunday, Kuwaiti Finance
Minister Nasser Abdullah Al-Rudhan said the revenues stood at 4.39
billion dinars (14.49 billion dollars) and expenditures at 3.89
billion dinars (12.84 billion dollars), yielding the surplus after
allocating 439.1 million dinars (1.45 billion dollars) for the
Future Generation Fund.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait puts aside 10 percent of the revenue annually for future
generations in case its oil reserves run out one day.
</P>
<P>
Al-Rudhan attributed the budget surplus to good government
activities, higher-than-expected oil revenues and expenditure
reduction.
</P>
<P>
Half of the budget surplus came from the oil sector thanks to a
rise of a rise of two dollars in world oil price.
</P>
<P>
He said the bettered budget situation also owed to the improved
non-oil revenues, privatization and counter-trade offset programs,
which were carried out in the previous years.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the actual expenditure turned out to be 1.28
billion dinars (4.22 billion dollars) short of the budget.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait saw a recorded budget deficit of about 60 billion
dollars right after the Gulf War due to the payment for the cost
of liberating itself from Iraq's seven-month occupation by
multi-nation forces.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit in the 1995-96 fiscal year was reduced to
around 4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report issued recently by the Shal Office, a
governmental body for statistics, said Kuwait's Gross National
Product in 1997 was anticipated to reach nearly 9.28 billion
dinars (30.62 billion dollars) or 16.8 percent more than that in
1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Monday called upon his countrymen to remain aware
of attempts by foreign powers to colonialize the country.
</P>
<P>
There are foreign powers wanting to colonialize the country
directly or indirect and such attempt could be thwarted if
Malaysians remained aware of it, he said in Langkawi, a resort
island in northern Malaysia, according to the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The people must protect the country's independence and freedom
from such attempts by any foreign countries, Mahathir said at the
breaking of the fast at Masjid Sungai Menghulu in Langkawi Monday
evening, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysians must remain united, work together and
adopt disciplinary approach to enable the country to overcome the
current economic problem resulted from speculative attacks on the
local currency.
</P>
<P>
He called on Malaysians not to resort to actions like strikes
and demonstrations but to remain calm in facing the current
situation.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia would not seek assistance from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) if Malaysians remain united and
thrifty in their spending.
</P>
<P>
The people must help the country by increasing savings and
trust funds through the use of their assets, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our assets could help the country overcome the problem of
shortage of capital due to the depreciation of our currency...if
we don't do it our country would be in a desperate situation and
we might even lose our freedom," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the people must take note of this because if
Malaysia gave in to demand of international financial institutions
it would be subjected to various pressures like those being
experienced by some countries.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Get More Winter Rain due to El-Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is forecast to have
10 to 25 percent above the normal winter rain this year, owing to
El-Nino phenomenon, which has disturbed the global weather system.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), after analyzing the
prevailing global weather conditions, concluded that there is 80
percent chance for the winter rains to be above normal, according
to a report by the official Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Analysis of previous 100 years meteorological data indicates
that during El-Nino years Pakistan summer monsoon rainfall
generally decreases, whereas autumn and winter rainfall
increases," PMD Director General Dr. Qamar uz Zaman was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan normally receives 74.9 millimeter rain during the
winter, January to March, Qamar added.
</P>
<P>
The El-Nino phenomenon causes abnormal warming of surface water
off Peru and Ecuador Coast of South America, at Pacific Ocean,
which affects weather all over the world every four or five years.
</P>
<P>
The current El-Nino, developed in March 1997, is expected to
remain active up to May 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the recent years, there have been El-Ninos in 1976, 1983,
1987 and 1991, but this year's El-Nino is termed as one of the
strongest.

Special Rolled Steel Corp. was wholly acquired by the China

Great Wall has been on a downward spiral in business operations

Realizing that the company with 30,000 workers stood little

<P>
HONG KONG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's top official
reiterated Monday that the Special Administrative Region (SAR)
was able to maintain the peg and saw no reason for changing it.
</P>
<P>
The SAR's Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa told a United States
congressional delegation here Monday: "The linked exchange rate
system provides us with the certainty and stability that are
necessary for our economic development amidst the regional
financial turmoil."
</P>
<P>
He told the American delegation led by Representative Jim Leach
Monday: "We are confident and able to maintain the system and see
no reason for changing it."
</P>
<P>
Tung highlighted Hong Kong's strong economic fundamentals --
huge foreign exchange reserve and fiscal surplus, clear market
rules and regulation, and an efficient open market that responds
quickly to external market changes.
</P>
<P>
There was no need for competitive devaluation of the Hong Kong
dollar as the services sector accounted for 84 percent of the GDP,
Tung told the American visitors.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Asian economies possessed the strengths for
economic recovery -- a high saving rate, flexible and hardworking
labor force, and quick adoption of new technology. "These
strengths remain there and I see no reason why we should suddenly
lose confidence in ourselves," said the chief executive.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 580,000
geographical constituency applications have been received during
the past two-month-old voter registration exercise which ended
here at mid-night on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Half of them are from new electors, increasing the total number
from 2.53 million in 1995 to 2.77 million, which represented a
registration rate of nearly 70 percent of 3.96 million eligible
electors in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Justice Woo Kwok-hing, chairman of the
Electoral Affairs Commission, at a press conference here Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Releasing registration figures for functional constituencies
and the corresponding Election Committee subsectors, Woo said that
he was encouraged to see a sevenfold increase in the number of
applications as compared with the figure on December 30.
</P>
<P>
He noted that more than 25,100 applications for functional
constituencies have been received from 12,700 individuals and
12,400 bodies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that on the basis of information
available, 123,000 individual electors and 3,800 corporate
electors have been informed by notifications that they are
registered if they do not raise objections.
</P>
<P>
Put together, the functional constituency figures amount to
more than half of the potential electors, he said.
</P>
<P>
For the seven Election Committee subsectors without an
equivalent functional constituency, he said 4,200 individuals and
140 bodies have been informed by notifications that they are
registered if they do not raise objections. More than 1,300 new
applications have been received.
</P>
<P>
Altogether more than 480 authorized representatives have been
appointed to vote, he said.
</P>
<P>
Woo expressed the satisfaction with the results of the voter
registration, adding that some functional constituencies such as
labor, tourism, finance, agriculture and fisheries, transport and
insurance had seen especially good response towards the end of the
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Even response from eligible electors in five new functional
constituencies such as sports, performing arts, culture and
publication, import and export has improved significantly, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Woo said that the Registration and Electoral Office is now
working flat out to process the data collected from new applicants
and previously registered electors.
</P>
<P>
The objective is to compile provisional registers of electors
and voters and omissions lists before the middle of next month for
the public to check their registration particulars, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> No Reserved Seat for Britain, says ECB Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- It is not a good idea to
reserve a seat on the executive board of the European Central Bank
(ECB) for Britain, Win Duisenberg, the President of the European
Monetary Institute said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, natural turnover within the board meant Britain could
take a seat at a later date, the Dutchman added.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg, a strong candidate for ECB presidency, said seats
on the board would become open on a regular basis because the
executive posts were of varying lengths.
</P>
<P>
The 1992 Maastricht Treaty calls for the board to be composed
of a president, a vice-president and up to four executive
directors.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg said the president would have a term of eight years
while the vice-president would have four years and the rest
between two and six years.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which has announced that it will not join the planned
single currency for some years to come, still wants a seat
reserved for it on the ECB board.
</P>
<P>
The campaign for such an open seat has so far found little
support given the intense competition for the six seats available.
</P>
<P>
The ECB will be established from the middle of this year. It
will take over monetary policy control from 1999.
</P>
<P>
The euro is scheduled to be launched on January 1, 1999 along
with the establishment of the European Central Bank.

<HEADLINE> Japan Sets GDP Target for at 1.9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government on Monday
set its macro-economic target for real growth in gross domestic
product (GDP) in 1998 fiscal year at 1.9 percent, the Kyodo News
Service reported.
</P>
<P>
At an extraordinary cabinet meeting in the morning, the
government also backed the forecast GDP growth of 2.4 percent in
nominal terms, the report quoted government officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The inflation-adjusted 1.9 percent growth is the same as
projected for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
But Japan's economy actually slowed in fiscal 1997 to an
estimated real growth of 0.1 percent, or possibly even negative
growth.
</P>
<P>
If the Japanese economy does shrink in fiscal 1997, which ends
March 31, it will be the first decline since 1974, when the second
oil-shock crisis hit the country.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Decides to Suspend New Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hyundai Group, South Korea's
largest conglomerate, announced on Monday that it will suspend or
postpone all new business projects as part of a restructuring
program.
</P>
<P>
The group has decided to shelve its long-wished for project to
build a large steel plant. This is because it requires too much
money when the nation is implementing an austerity policy in
return for the International Monetary Fund bailout loan of 57
billion U.S. dollars, said Park Se-yong, president of the group's
planning and coordination office.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai will also introduce outside directorships to all its
subsidiaries to improve transparency in management, Park said.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai now exercises a United States-style board system, in
which non-Hyundai directors account for more than 40 percent of
the total in its affiliates -- Hyundai Corp., Hyundai Information
Technology, Diamond Ad., and Hyundai Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
Along with this, Hyundai will introduce an outside auditor
system for all subsidiaries in an attempt to improve transparency
of corporate accounting.
</P>
<P>
The group will also will spin off some of its subsidiaries
through mergers or sell-offs soon.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the 11th largest economy in the world, has
been in serious financial troubles caused by the collapse of a
group of conglomerates and bad loans from financial institutions.
It witnessed in 1997 the country's per capita down to 9,400
U.S. dollars from the previous year's 10,548 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached with the IMF, the nation has to
completely open its financial market, shut down ailing financial
institutions and legalize mass layoffs.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Former Belgian top cyclist
Eddy Planckaert said in a TV interview that he used to use
performance enhancing EPO (erythropoietin) and alleged the product
was taken widely by professional riders.
</P>
<P>
"If you use it (EPO) and your opponent doesn't, you're 12 to 15
percent better, and this on the top level which means quite
something...but it involves risk to life," Planckaert told Belgian
VRT television.
</P>
<P>
EPO, which stimulates the production of red blood cells which
transport oxygen around the body, was first introduced in the
mid-1980s to treat kidney disease, but is considered one of the
most dangerous drugs.
</P>
<P>
A series of riders, including Italian Claudio Chiappucci,
Ukraine's Vladimir Poulnikov and Frenchman Thierry Laurent, failed
blood tests to EPO last year.
</P>
<P>
Even though a banned rider is not officially accused of doping,
his licence is still suspended for 15 days.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto: Indonesia-IMF Agreement Does Not Constitute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said here Monday that Indonesia's agreement with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding economic reforms aimed at easing the
monetary crisis in the country does not constitute "economic
domination".
</P>
<P>
"There was absolutely no pressure (for Indonesia to enter the
agreement) which may be interpreted as economic domination," State
Minister for Youth and Sports Hayono Isman quoted the president as
saying.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto last Thursday signed a Letter of Intent
which details economic reforms prescribed by the IMF to Indonesia
to solve its monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the agreement was the result of
cooperation between Indonesia and the IMF, Isman said after
meeting with Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Citing as example, the president said the IMF wanted to abolish
the national car program and the N-2130 jet plane project of the
Indonesian Aircraft Industry, but Indonesia refused.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia and the IMF thus agreed that the national car and
N-2130 programs will continue but without any financial facility
from the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Indonesia-IMF agreement, Indonesia will
conduct a wide-ranging economic and financial reform, including
reviewing the 1998/99 state budget draft, curtailing government
financial support for the national car project and scrapping some
agriculture monopolies.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, like some other Southeast Asian countries, has been
badly hit by the monetary crisis since last July. Its currency has
lost more than 200 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the IMF agreed to provide 23 billion U.S. dollars
loans to Indonesia to help overcome the country's monetary crisis.

<HEADLINE> Truce Still in Force in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Recent skirmishes between
Philippine troops and Muslim rebels in southern Mindanao Island
will not affect the general truce agreement for the region signed
last year by the two sides, a senior military officer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Maguindanao province in Mindanao, Army
chief Lt. General Raul Urgello told reporters that the ceasefire
was still in force despite last week's conflicts between the
government troops and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
rebels in the province's Buldon town.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts, the first since the signing of the truce,
occurred on January 16 when MILF rebels and the government troops
exchanged mortar and artillery shells, killing four rebels and one
soldier.
</P>
<P>
Urgello described the incident as "isolated" and will not
generally affect the truce pact as well as the ongoing peace
process entered upon by the government and rebel peace
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
But he did not say whether the latest clash will affect the
next round of exploratory peace talks between the MILF and the
government in February after the end of the Muslim Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government are expected to discuss the
possibility of reaching a general peace agreement and the agenda
for forging such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which accused the government of making provocations
earlier, has so far failed to say whether it will withdraw from
the scheduled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is currently the largest anti-government force in the
Philippines, with an estimated membership of 12,000.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress Fails to Pass Oil Deregulation Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Congress on
Monday failed to reach agreement over the new oil deregulation
bill which is vital for the country's exit from decades of
economic supervision of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
A bicameral meeting of the Senate and the House panels was
divided over the provisions on subsidy to the oil firms, the
predatory pricing and the transition period for the full
deregulation of the oil industry, Energy Secretary Francisco Viray
said.
</P>
<P>
The bicameral conference committee will meet again Tuesday
evening to discuss the three disputed provisions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of these provisions would have sealed the
passage of the new oil deregulation law before the start of the
campaign period of the May presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
The congressional passage of the new oil bill was the last
condition Manila still has to meet for its final graduation from
the supervision of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines was supposed to have exited from the IMF
supervision program by the end of 1997, but was delayed after the
old oil deregulation law was abolished by the Supreme Court last
November.
</P>
<P>
According to Viray, the 5 billion pesos (1.3 billion U.S.
dollars) buffer fund proposed by the Lower House was strongly
opposed by the Senate panel.
</P>
<P>
The buffer fund, also known as the Oil Price Stabilization Fund
(OPSF), is used to minimize the frequent adjustments in domestic
prices of petroleum products as a result of changes in the oil
companies' importation costs and dollar exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
The government subsidy absorbs abrupt changes in crude oil
costs and exchange rates and thus works to stabilize the local
pump prices for most of the socially sensitive oil products.
</P>
<P>
The two houses also disagreed over whether the country's oil
companies have the right to adjust the prices of oil products, and
the length of the transition before the sector's full
liberalization.

</P>
<P>
The directorate, the party's highest policy making body,

HARARE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Companies in southern Africa
should set aside a certain amount of their profits for research
and development if the region is to become internationally
competitive, a Zimbabwean government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira

workshop on strengthening of industrial research and development
capability through networking and collaborative programs.

</P>
<P>
He noted the amount of money allocated to research and
development by both the private sector and the government is very
small.
</P>
<P>
"The research efforts of our region need to be tackled from
the micro and macro levels. At a micro level each company should
constantly research into specific needs to ensure competitiveness
and maintain viability," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the workshop has come at a most opportune time when
the economies of the SADC countries are going through profound
changes brought about by the liberalization and the globalization
processes currently gripping the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that, under the new
international situation, maintaining a sound cooperative
relationship between China and Great Britain is in the practical
and long-term interest of the two sides, and conducive to
promoting cooperation between Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Qian made his remarks here this afternoon in talks with
visiting British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who arrived earlier
this afternoon for a three-day official visit to China as Qian's
guest.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Cook, Qian said he believes that this
visit will help promote progress in various fields of Sino-British
relations.
</P>
<P>
Cook said he is glad to see that the principles of "one
country, two systems" and the "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" have been well-implemented, and that he hopes for a new
starting point in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The British hope to strengthen relations between the two
governments and their people through cultural, educational,
industrial and commercial exchanges, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is convinced that China will play a more important
role in the global arena in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that China has always paid attention to its
relations with Britain, Qian said that after the Hong Kong issue
was settled Sino-British relations have turned to a new page.
</P>
<P>
The new British government formed by the British Labour Party
adopts a positive attitude toward developing bilateral relations,
which is appreciated by China, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Both Qian and Cook expressed satisfaction with the momentum for
recent improvements and development of Sino-British relations in
various fields, and hope that this momentum can be maintained.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union's (EU) executive body, has approved humanitarian
aid of 10 million ECUs (about 12 million U.S. dollars) for the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The present aid package, managed by the European Community
Humanitarian Office (ECHO), gives priority to public health, water
and sanitation and assistance in coping with the effects of the
harsh winter, the Commission said in a press release in Brussels
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The aid, which covers needs over the next six to nine months,
will enable United Nations specialist organizations and
non-governmental organizations to provide emergency health cover
as well as carrying out distribution of winter clothing for
children.
</P>
<P>
The Commission announced a combined aid package worth more than
57 million ECUs (68 million dollars), comprising food aid and
public health-related assistance, in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
ECHO, which was set up in 1992, is a service of the Commission

<HEADLINE> EU Finance Ministers to Discuss EMU, Asia Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Economic and finance ministers
from European Union (EU) member states are gathered here Monday to
discuss their single currency plan and the current economic crisis
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The first Ecofin meeting since Britain took over the EU
presidency in January began Monday morning with a televised debate
on priorities for a series of Ecofin meetings over the next six
months.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are also scheduled to discuss, behind closed
doors, issues concerning the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU),
scheduled to start on January 1, 1999, and a proposal to modify
the way financial services are measured for statistical purposes.
</P>
<P>
Then the ministers will meet to see if the continuing financial
crisis in Asia would have any negative impact on the European
economy, and how to respond to it.
</P>
<P>
The EMU debate was reportedly to begin uncontroversially with a
decision on the technical specifications for the estimated 60
billion euro coins to be circulated from January 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
But the decision cannot go into legal effect until first
countries participating in the single currency are chosen this
May. The decision is being taken now to allow orders to be placed
with coin manufacturers and metals suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are also due to review Italy's budget for 1998.
This is considered crucial to Italy's chance of qualifying for the
EMU.
</P>
<P>
They will also haggle over the question of who will be the
first president of the European Central Bank (ECB).

SHANGHAI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai residents are
experiencing their first real taste of winter because a strong
puff of cold air from the north has brought down unseasonably warm
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
The low today in the city was 5.1 degrees below zero
Centigrade, which occurred at 5 a.m. In the suburbs, the low

<HEADLINE> Anglers Adrift for Nine Days before Rescue at Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Eight people who went fishing
on the Yellow Sea near this east China port city have been rescued
from cold and hunger after drifting for nine days and nights.
</P>
<P>
The anglers were spotted by a rescue team from the navy at 10
a.m. Sunday about 10 nautical miles from Lingshan island south of
Qingdao. They were finally saved five hours later in gale-force
winds and rough seas.
</P>
<P>
The eight friends, all avid fishermen, started out on Jan. 6
aboard Laoyu 1618, taking enough food and fresh water for four
days. Going with them were two other fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
Lu Shuzhai, Wang Wenhai and six others caught more than 70
kilograms of fish in the first three days. The fish were destined
for special dishes for the Spring Festival which falls on January
28.
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing of impending bad weather, they decided to
return. But bad luck struck in the form of engine failure.
</P>
<P>
In dire straits, the anglers began rationing their remaining
food and fresh water. They set quilts and overcoats on fire with
the hope of catching the attention of passing ships.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, it began to snow when their food and fresh water
were gone, helping to quench their thirst until they were
discovered by the navy.
</P>
<P>
The other two boats who went with Laoyu 1618 returned safely to
Qingdao on Jan. 9, and notified authorities of the boat's
disappearance.

<HEADLINE> Chinese PLA Chief of Staff Meets US Defense Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China is fully prepared to work
together with the United States to advance military-to-military
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese General Fu Quanyou, chief of the General Staff of the
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), made the remark here today
while meeting with the US Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two sides should maintain and increase
high-level contacts and appropriately engage in exchanges between
professional organizations in the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
He told Cohen that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's meeting with
US President Bill Clinton last October established a framework for
the further development of bilateral ties and provided good
opportunities for the growth of bilateral military-to-military
relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese general pointed out that the US side should
strictly abide by the principles set out in the three Sino-US
Joint Communiques and properly handle the Taiwan issue, and that
the US should not do anything which will hurt the feelings of the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
As long as the issue will be dealt properly, bilateral ties
will develop in a healthy and stable way, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fu asked Cohen to convey his regards to Henry Shelton,
chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US armed forces, and
an invitation to him for a visit to China later this year.
</P>
<P>
Cohen expressed his gratitude for the hospitality of the
Chinese side. He told Fu that a series of exchange of visits
between military leaders of the two countries have enhanced mutual
understanding and promoted the development of relations between
the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He said that the US hopes to expand contacts and cooperation
between the two armies.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Ability to Forecast Disastrous Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China has made timely and
accurate forecasts for disastrous weather during 1997, according
to a report by the National Meteorological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Central Meteorological Observatory and provincial
observatories made successful medium-range forecasts four-to-seven
days ahead of time for the major rainstorms which occurred in many
places last year, and accurate short-range forecasts were made 24
to 48 hours ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's forecast for the routes, strength and
range of the four typhoon that hit land last year were all
accurate, the report said, adding that the successful forecast for
Typhoon Winnie made it possible for more than 1.4 million local
residents to evacuate before the storm's arrival.
</P>
<P>
China has established a weather monitoring and warning system
in east China's Fujian Province, and two similar systems are under
construction in Beijing and Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The National Meteorological Bureau has decided to continue to
give priority to disaster prevention in its work through various
methods including weather forecasting, climate analysis and
artificial influence of regional climate.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes over 2 Tonnes of Opium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces seized
more than two tonnes of opium and 100 kilograms of heroin
Saturday in the northeastern province of Khorasan, Iran's official
news agency IRNA reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Mohammad Baqerpour, head of the political and
ideological department of local security forces in Nahbandan
region, as saying that the narcotics were captured from a caravan
of 21 camels when it entered the Iranian territory from
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Without giving more details about the drug haul, Baqerpour
said that a large sum of ammunitions were also seized during the
operation.
</P>
<P>
The Nahbandan region, which borders Afghanistan and is very
close to the border line with Pakistan, locates at the eastern
edge of Iran's central desert, where smugglers usually try to
transfer narcotics from the Gold Crescent drug producing center
in the border area between Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Iran seized an average of about 160
tonnes of different narcotics every year and about half of the
drugs were captured in the province of Khorasan due to its
adjacency to the world famous drug producing center.
</P>
<P>
Iran passed a strict anti-drug law in January 1989 stipulating
that any one caught with 30 grams of heroin or five kilograms of
opium will be sentenced to death. However, drug trafficking is
still a serious problem for the Iranian government since the
country is one of the best transits for smuggling drug from the
Gold Crescent to European countries.

<HEADLINE> Fixed-Asset Investments Expected To Lead Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China will enlarge the mouth of
its purse to allow more money to flow into fixed-asset investments
to prevent a drastic slowdown in its economic growth, according to
a high-ranking state economic official.
</P>
<P>
With the growth rate of China's economy slowing to 8.8 percent
last year from 14.2 percent in 1992, the Chinese economy has to
boost fixed-asset investments to avoid further declines this year,
said Zhang Hanya, director of the investment research institute of
the State Planning Commission, in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Already anticipating a decrease in the growth of consumption
and exports, China will not allow the fixed-asset investments to
follow suit this year and will try to keep the sector growing for
a second year at a rate of 12 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China, bent on making fixed-asset investments a
leading force for economic development, is expected to spend 2.9
trillion yuan on fixed-asset expansion this year.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, growth in fixed-asset investments
depends on how willing individual companies are to invest.
</P>
<P>
To fan their enthusiasm for investment, China will continue to
support large- and medium-size state-owned companies by providing
them with more soft loans, turning the loans into investments,
while pushing more such companies to go public, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Besides individual companies, the economist said, the central
government will spend more money on such infrastructure
construction projects as hydro-power generation, water resource
conservation and environmental protection as well as urban public
utilities.
</P>
<P>
While improving its overall economic performance, China has
added the machine-building industry to its urgent rescue plan,
believing that the sector would jump-start the country's
industrial modernization.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China will inject bigger shares of its funding
into the central and western regions, primarily for developing
resources and building infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry and other labor-intensive projects in
China's eastern areas will also be relocated into these regions in
1998, he added.

<HEADLINE> Employment Study Project Wins Top Award from Labor Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A research project on China's
employment issue was awarded today a first prize for labor-related
science and technology by the Ministry of Labor.
</P>
<P>
The project, mainly conducted by the International Labor
Institute and the Employment Department under the ministry, has
focused on how to make full use of China's huge human resources
and ease the increasing pressure on employment.
</P>
<P>
With a population of over 1.2 billion, China has managed to
maintain its urban unemployment rate at around 3 percent. But the
figure is possible to rise with the massive lay-offs expected in
reforms of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China has a huge army of rural surplus laborers,
whose number was estimated at approximately 130 million.
</P>
<P>
Three of today's four other first-prize winners were research
projects on safe production. A study on the causes of miners' lung
diseases was said to have started since the founding of New China
in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Accidents, more than half of which occurred in the mining
sector, claimed over 10,000 lives in China each year.
</P>
<P>
Today's second, third and fourth prizes went to 88 other
projects concerning the advancement of labor science and
technologies.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1986, the Labor Ministry's awards for science and
technology development has been presented for six times. A total
of 487 research projects won the awards, and three of them later
acquired national awards for science and technology advancement.
</P>
<P>
"It indicates that China's research on safe production and
labor sciences has reached a new height," Lin Yongsan, vice
minister of labor, noted at the awarding ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Egypt for Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat arrived here Monday for talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, before going to Washington to
meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-Arafat talks will focus on the ideas the
Palestinian leader is expected to present to Clinton in a bid to
push forward the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo Zuhdi el-Qudra said Sunday that
the talks would also discuss the Israeli plan to keep control over
strategic areas in the West Bank in a final peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
"President Arafat will brief President Mubarak on the dangerous
and negative outcome of the latest Israeli cabinet decisions under
the pretext of protecting the Israeli security interests," he
said, adding the Israeli move threatened to kill the entire peace
drive.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian diplomat also warned of "grave consequences" if
Clinton fails to pressure the hardline Israeli cabinet "to abide
by the international resolutions, halt the feverish settlement
expansion policy and stop violations of the accords signed."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Clinton will hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on how to break the 10-month deadlock in the
peace process caused by Israeli construction of a new Jewish
settlement in the Arab East Jerusalem last March.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. wants Israel to withdraw from more West Bank territory
and freeze Jewish settlements, and the Palestinians to crack down
harder on violence as a prelude to jump-starting talks on a final
settlement.
</P>
<P>
He will also make a stop in Paris Tuesday for talks with French
President Jacques Chirac, Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin en route to Washington.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Arafat is expected to meet Mubarak in Cairo
again and then with British Prime Minister Tony Blair in London.

<HEADLINE> Wet Spell Lingering In Shanghai By Zhu Baihua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Wet weather has been hanging on
over China's largest city Shanghai this winter, playing havoc with
residents' daily life and threatening agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has had an almost unbroken spell wet weather since mid
November. From November 11 to January 13, the city was soaked by a
total rainfall of 319 millimeters, or 4.5 times that of the
normal rainfall during this time of the year.
</P>
<P>
There were six times that the city was plagued by continuous
showers for at least five days in a run.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the city had the least sunshine during the
period in history, only 56 percent of that in a normal year,
according to the city's meteorological station.
</P>
<P>
The average temperature this winter is two or three degrees
higher than usual and there were only six days when the
temperature dropped to below zero centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the wet spell was caused by the absence of strong
southward cold fronts. They suspected El Nino effect plays part of
role.
</P>
<P>
Excessive overcast and rainy days have brought inconvenience to
residents who dry their clothes by pasting them on the stoves or
baking them in micro-wave ovens. Meanwhile, department stores are
complaining about lack-lust sales because people would rather stay
at home.
</P>
<P>
But agricultural sector suffers the most, with vegetable fields
ruined by too much water and crops unseasonably growing, which
would become vulnerable to possible cold weather in spring.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Defense Ministers Hold Talks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China is a positive factor to
promote peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region
and the world as a whole, Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of China's
Central Military Commission, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also state councillor and defense minister, made the
remarks today in talks with visiting U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen, during which they exchanged frank views on
international and regional situations, bilateral relations and
other shared common issues.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that Cohen's visit at the start of this year marks a
good beginning for relations between the two armies and that he
wished the relationship would proceed in a more stable and
practical way in the new year.
</P>
<P>
"The current international situation continues to move towards
relaxation, and world multi-polarization is accelerating," Chi
said, adding that the political, economic and cultural development
of various countries has become more diversified.
</P>
<P>
Relations between big powers have enjoyed strategic
readjustment, and the request for peace, stability, cooperation
and development has become the irreversible mainstream of the
times, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under these new circumstances, Chi went on to say, expansion of
military grouping and strengthening of military alignment will by
no means be conducive to safeguarding peace and security.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that China has made positive efforts to safeguard
world and regional peace and stability for years, and that it has
improved and strengthened its ties with all powers in the region.
</P>
<P>
"China also has good-neighbor relations with its neighboring
countries," he said. China is a positive factor to promote peace,
stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and the world
as a whole, Chi added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, some people continue to spread the so-called
"China Threat" at some international occasions. "It is groundless
to describe the modernization drive of China's army, which is for
the sake of the country's economic construction and of a defensive
nature, as an unstable factor in the region," Chi said.

should also see that this relationship has faced some problems,
among which the most important and sensitive is the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
"We hold the belief that as long as both sides abide by
principles in the three joint communiques between the two nations
and the consensus reached by leaders of the two countries to deal
with the Taiwan issue, the bilateral relationship can proceed in a
healthy and stable manner.
</P>
<P>
"In the past year, the two armies have also undertaken a series
of high-level and professional exchanges of visits, and the
military exchanges have been very active, bringing bilateral
relationship into a new period of development.
</P>
<P>
"For this year, we still take a positive attitude toward the
contacts between the two armies and are ready to make concerted
efforts with the U.S. side to help maintain the momentum in
continuing to advance bilateral ties."
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour talks, Cohen, on behalf of U.S. President
Bill Clinton, extended sympathy for casualties in Zhangbei area in
north China hit by a severe earthquake on Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
The emergency aid provided by the U.S. government for victims
of the disaster is an indication of friendly ties between the two
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also thanked the Chinese government for its assistance to
the United States in seeking the remains of air crew members lost
in World War II.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Chi on U.S. security strategy, Cohen said the
strengthening of the alignment between the U.S. and other nations
is targeting no third nation.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the United States will continue its "engagement
policy" toward China, considering the U.S.-China summit in October
a complete success. The two nations are moving toward a
constructive strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
Although there are differences on such issues as Taiwan and
human rights, Cohen said, both sides have a framework and
dimension in developing bilateral relations. Through joint
efforts, this relationship can be further promoted, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the U.S. government will stick to the "One China"
policy and observe the three joint communiques to enhance ties
between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
On relations between the defense departments and the two
armies, Cohen said the current momentum of the army ties caters to
political relations between the two countries. The U.S. side hopes
to further maintain high-level contacts on the one hand and
continue to undertake military professional exchanges on the
other, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chi thanked the U.S. government for its disaster relief aid to
China's earthquake-hit areas.

<HEADLINE> State Councillor Calls for Scientific Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- State councillor Song Jian
today urged the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) to take the lead
in launching the policy of "revitalizing the country with science
and education".
</P>
<P>
CAS should accelerate the progress of agricultural science and
technology, develop the high-tech industries and improve the basic
studies, said Song, minister in charge of the State Science and
Technology Commission at the CAS '98 Work Conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will build up a new structure for scientific
and technological development in the next few years, which can
co-ordinate with the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, CAS should make harder efforts in structural
readjustment, personnel redistribution and system reforms, he said.
</P>
<P>
The academy should encourage most of its scientific workers to
involve themselves in projects, which are significant to the
development of the national economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
CAS has played a leading role in the scientific and
technological development in China, and has made major
achievements in the high-tech research and development and the
studies of basic sciences since it was founded in 1949, Song said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that CAS will continue its efforts to
promote scientific progress in accordance with principles of the
central government and realize the goals for reform and
development which were set forward by the 15th National Congress
of the Chinese Communist Party.

<HEADLINE> S. African Police Losing Ground to Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- South African police,
battling with manpower and resource shortages, are losing ground
to well-funded and highly sophisticated organized crime
syndicates, The Star newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was indicated by a recently completed police intelligence
report compiled by the police's Pretoria-based Crime Information
Management Center.
</P>
<P>
The report has identified a number of Russian business groups
which are in the process of acquiring legitimate businesses in
South Africa to act as front companies for the stockpiling and
distribution of weapons and ammunition to the strife-torn African
continent.
</P>
<P>
Many of the syndicates have infiltrated state institutions,
especially the police, prisons and courts, the paper quoted the
report as saying.
</P>
<P>
A total of 192 organized crime syndicates, with 1,903 major
suspects, have been identified by police, including at least 32
organizations with international associations.
</P>
<P>
Drugs remain the main concern of syndicates, with 96
identified with this grouping, 83 with a vehicle-related grouping
and 60 associated with commercial crime.
</P>
<P>
Many syndicates have diversified and dabble in other criminal
activities, ranging from drugs and prostitution to extortion,
fire arms smuggling and vehicle crime.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Gauteng province is a haven for organized
crime, where 45 syndicates are operating in 90 areas.

met here today with Gerald M. Levin, chairman of U.S. media giant
Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>

about each other.
</P>

would serve as a bridge between people of the two countries and
present China to the world objectively and truthfully.

<HEADLINE> Reward Paid for Information About Cigarette Smuggling in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Customs and
Excise Department and the Tobacco Institute of Hong Kong renewed
on Monday an Informant Reward Scheme, whereby the institute will
offer up to 500,000 HK dollars (64,000 U.S. dollars) for
information about cigarette smuggling activities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a signing ceremony to renew the scheme, Assistance
Commissioner of Customs and Excise (Administration and Excise)
Chik Wah-wai, appealed to members of the public for more
information on illegal tobacco imports.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the institute has paid almost one
million HK dollars (128,000 U.S. dollars) to individuals who have
reported crimes related to the illegal import of non-duty-paid
tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
The Informant Reward Scheme was introduced in 1994. In 1997,
total reward of 460,000 HK dollars (59,000 U.S. dollars) was paid
out in 15 cases, resulting in the seizure of 27.5 million sticks
of cigarette.
</P>
<P>
Chik said his department is determined to repress all illicit
cigarette activities.
</P>
<P>
"Our Anti-Cigarette Smuggling Task Force will continue to take
stringent enforcement actions against all those engaged in the
import and sale of contraband cigarettes, and especially those
involved in organized syndicates," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chairman for the Tobacco Institute Francois Stettler said, "By
taking a united stance against the cigarette smuggling we aim to
combat the damage it does to the economy and the community as a
whole."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Consults ECOWAS Leaders on ECOMOG's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has opened consultations
with leaders of west African countries on the future role of the
sub-regional peacekeeping role known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The consultations were held between Nigeria's Foreign Minister
Tom Ikimi and leaders of Ghana, Togo, Guinea and Liberia during
the minister's three-day visit to these countries last week, said
a press statement available here today.
</P>
<P>
They are all members of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), which dispatched ECOMOG to Liberia to help end
the country's seven-year-old bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
The visit was made at a time when Liberian President Charles
Taylor had said February 2 this year would be the deadline for
ECOMOG to wind up its operations in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The first contingent of 1,205 Nigerian soldiers serving the
11,000-strong ECOMOG returned from Liberia last month under a
phased pullout plan.
</P>
<P>
Details of the discussions were not made public but the press
statement by Kola Olota, chief press secretary to the foreign
minister, pointed out on Sunday that the consultations were at
the instance of Nigeria's head of state General Sani Abacha, who
is also the current ECOWAS chairman.
</P>
<P>
Relations between President Taylor and former ECOMOG force
commander Maj.-gen. Victor Malu had gone sour over whether ECOMOG
should be involved in the restructuring and training of Liberia's
post-war army.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who reportedly also refused ECOMOG to use Liberia as a
base to launch attacks against the military junta in neighboring
Sierra Leone, made an unscheduled visit to Nigeria late last year
to consult with the ECOWAS chairman over the alleged dispute.
</P>
<P>
Malu was recently recalled from Liberia and replaced by
another Nigerian officer, Maj.-Gen. Timothy Shelpidi, but no
explanation was given for the change of ECOMOG chief.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the ECOWAS leaders on the reassignment of Malu, Ikimi
appealed to them to support the new ECOMOG helmsman, which he
said was crucial in the sub-regional collective resolve to
restore peace in Sierra Leone especially when the peace process
was deadlocked there.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is now also in Sierra Leone to enforce international
sanctions against the junta which seized power in the May 25 last
year coup, ousted the legitimate government led by President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian foreign minister is scheduled to embark on the
second leg of his visit to other ECOWAS member states this week.

<HEADLINE> European Banker Expects Euro to Be World's Major Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Euro, the single currency
to be introduced to European Union member states on January 1,
1999, "can be expected to become a major international currency,"
Willem Duisenberg, president of the European Monetary Institute,
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is "not only because it (the Euro) will be the currency of
a large area but also because it is based on monetary and fiscal
policy driven by the objective of stability," said Duisenberg, the
distinguished speaker of the second Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) Distinguished Lecture.
</P>
<P>
"However, the international role of the Euro will probably
develop gradually," the financial expert said.
</P>
<P>
With "EMU (Economic and Monetary Union): Many Countries, One
Monetary System" being the lecture's theme, Duisenberg elaborated
the process ahead for the transition to the single currency, the
international role for the Euro, and the future challenges facing
the Euro area.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan Akira Nagashima, invited
as the lecture's discussant, gave his point of view of the EMU
from a non-European perspective.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the international monetary system after the Euro,
he thought "it highly likely that the Euro will become an
international key currency with similar status to that of the
U.S. dollar, as long as its stability is maintained."
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of HKMA Joseph Yam chaired the lecture, which
was attended by some 300 local and overseas bankers and financial
experts.
</P>
<P>
The First HKMA Distinguished Lecture was held in December 1996.

<HEADLINE> Two Hamas Bomb Makers Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian court in
Jericho sentenced on Monday to 15 years in prison and hard labor
two Hamas activists suspected of assembling the five bombs used
by suicide bombers in Jerusalem last year.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects, identified as Sharfik Abu Ras, 24 and Jaffer
Assad Samaru, 25, were arrested last Wednesday, two days after the
Palestinian police uncovered an explosives factory in the West
Bank city of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects have confessed to the Palestinian security
forces that they recruited the suicide bombers who carried out
bombing attacks in Jerusalem last year.
</P>
<P>
News of the arrest was immediately forwarded to officials of
the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States here and
Israel's General Security Services, well ahead of being leaked to
the media on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The two were on charge of organizing the July 30 bombing at the
Mahane Yehuda market and the September 4 attack at Ben-Yehuda
pedestrian mall in Jerusalem, in which 25 people were killed and
hundreds wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Militant Resistance Movement, or Hamas, claimed
responsibility for the suicide attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security officials warned Sunday night that more
terrorist attacks against Israel are possible, adding that a
state of alert would remain in force.

<HEADLINE> UN's Chief Arms Inspector Arrives in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Chief arms inspector of the
U.N. Richard Butler arrived here Monday afternoon on a three-day
visit to Iraq in a bid to solve the current crisis over arms
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, will hold talks
with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on the question of
arm inspectors' access to Iraqi presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
Butler paid his last visit to Baghdad five weeks ago, during
which he failed to persuade Iraq into agreeing to grant access to
arms inspectors to presidential sites, which Iraq views as symbols
of national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council issued a presidential statement
after Butler reported results of his Baghdad visit, asking Iraq
to allow arms inspectors to go any where, at any time immediately
and without conditions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq last week barred an arms inspection team headed by
American Scott Ritter from carrying out its work on ground that
the make-up of the team - nine Americans, five Britons, an
Australian and a Russian - lacks balanced participation by the
permanent member states of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the team was withdrawn from Baghdad at the order
of the UNSCOM headquarters in New York and Ritter, accused by the
Iraqis as a U.S. spy, told reporters that question will have to be
left to Butler.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Environment-friendly
liquified petroleum gas (LPG) buses are seen running on the
streets of Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
As one of the busiest commercial cities in south China,
Guangzhou boasts over 800,000 motor vehicles which constitute a
major source of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
As to curb the pollution caused by the increasing vehicles has
become a common concern, local authorities have come out an idea
to introduce 30 LPG-driven buses to its No.12 public bus line, in
addition to a move to ban the use of lead-petrol for cars.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the LPG buses will help reduce the
hydroxide by 72 percent and the monoxide by 97 percent, thus
remarkably alleviating air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Operators of the No.12 bus line expect the cost for running the
LPG buses will remain basically the same as the petrol-driven cars.
</P>
<P>
If proved successful, the city plans to introduce LPG to all of
its public buses and taxis.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes One US Cent Firmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
maintained the near one U.S. cent gain it made offshore Monday,
boosting hopes the currency is on the road to recovery after
hitting its trough.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the local currency was supported by less
pessimistic views on Asian growth, a pickup in some commodity
prices and a refocus on Australia's positive domestic
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
A strengthening in the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar
over the weekend also helped the local currency reach its highest
levels since early December, fueling optimism the local currency
has bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 66.53 U.S. cents, near its
opening level, well up from 65.58 at the close last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citibank chief economist Stephen Koukoulas said the strength of
the U.S. dollar was critical.
</P>
<P>
"One reason why the Australian dollar has jumped recently is
that the U.S. dollar is off its highs against the Japanese yen,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. dollar bounces back, particularly against the yen,
which is what we expect over the next few months, then the
Australian dollar will soften against the U.S. dollar," he said.
</P>
<P>
Koukoulas said there would be bouts of negativity over the next
three months that would see the Australian dollar trade in a broad
62 U.S. cent to 67 U.S. cent range.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 85.83 Japanese yen from 84.02
in Sydney Friday and at 1.2225 German marks, from 1.2021.

<HEADLINE> Future Oil Exploration Faces More Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- India's Minister of State for
Petroleum and Natural Gas T. R. Baalu said Monday that in the new
energy scenario, exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbon
reserves would be more challenging and technology-innovative.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the three-day conference and exposition on
petroleum geophysics here, Baalu urged petroleum geophysicists and
oil industry representatives to identify future business
directions and formulate appropriate strategies in oil exploration
and exploitation.
</P>
<P>
He said that strategic alliance might be necessary with global
players, who had considerable resources, upgraded technology and
expertise, for exploration and development in deep waters. New
forms of non-conventional gas resources like coal-bed methane and
gas hydrates were at the research and development stage in the
country and hence needed directions and expertise.
</P>
<P>
To meet the challenges ahead, the Indian government had made
attractive structural and fiscal changes which were more
responsive and deregulated. A comprehensive approach was called
for to restructure and rationalize import tariff, fiscal
incentives and new depreciation norms for the petroleum sector, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Declares Monetary Policy Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Nigeria has
released its monetary policy guidelines for 1998 to foster price
and foreign exchange stability, stimulate economic growth and
employment as well as strengthen external sector performance.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the specific objectives of the monetary
policy in 1998 include maintenance of inflation rate at single
digit (it now hovers around nine percent), strengthening external
sector performance and ensuring continued exchange rate stability
and zero government borrowing requirement from the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
Others are growth in domestic credit not exceeding 32 percent
and that in credit to the private sector not exceeding 38
percent.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these objectives, the bank said policy initiative
will continue to emphasize the shift from direct to indirect
techniques for monetary control and the removal of administrative
controls on interest rates which came into effect in October 1996
shall remain in force this year.
</P>
<P>
The bank said at the weekend it would intensify its efforts in
1998 to monitor the performance of licensed finance companies
with a view to checking further spread of distress in the
financial sector as well as ensure the overall effectiveness of
the monetary and financial policies.
</P>
<P>
It will also tighten foreign exchange control while allow the
autonomous foreign exchange market to continue to operate freely
for selected commercial banks to obtain foreign exchange through
the weekly auction.
</P>
<P>
The apex bank said that the stance of monetary policy shall
continue to be restructured and would ensure a stable and
competitive exchange rate regime that would complement fiscal
incentives in stimulating private sector activities towards
boosting non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>
It further said that the polices were well formulated to
achieve the set targets against the background that there was
relative macroeconomic stability in the country last year.

<HEADLINE> China's Anti-Piracy Campaign Faces Challenges Before 2000: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China's copyright protection
chiefs said here today that the country's anti-piracy drive still
faces severe situations and that tougher measures should be taken
before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Shen Rengan, deputy director of the State Copyright
Administration (SCA) in a keynote speech to a national copyright
meeting, said that the smuggling of pirated products is still
rampant, and problems are particularly serious on the market of
book, audio and video, and electronic publications.
</P>
<P>
And new copyright problems have been found in high-technology
industries, particularly the information industry, he said, which
will be a headache for China's economy.
</P>
<P>
Yu Youxian, director of the SCA, told attendants at the meeting
that the central government is attaching great importance to
copyright protection, and they must pay the closest attention to
the copyrights of books, periodicals, video and audio products,
theatrical performances, television and radio broadcast,
advertising and computer software.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that in the coming two or three years China will
revised its six-year-old Copyright Law, and establish a national
anti-piracy union and a nationwide information network. Gang
crimes will be particularly targeted, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China will create a number of institutes to
provide services for copyright holders, continue to hold talks
with foreign business people, and train law enforcers with the
help of international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting revealed that China has since last year seized
53 illegal CD production lines, and confiscated millions of
smuggled CDs and VCDs found to be pirated.
</P>
<P>
China is a new comer in the worldwide anti-piracy campaign,
with its first copyright law implemented in 1991, and it joined in
the Berne Convention in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM to Visit Malaysia, PNG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard will visit Malaysia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) next month,
which the Australian Associated Press (AAP) described as
Australia's nearest but most difficult neighbors in a report
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Howard linked the timing of the trip to the Asian economic
crisis which has had a major impact on the Malaysian economy
although it has not had to follow Indonesia, Thailand and Korea in
requesting assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
"Given the difficulties of our friends and neighbors in the
region this is not a time to reduce our association with the
countries of that region," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Rather it's a time to extend the helping hand, to demonstrate,
as we did in relation to the assistance we gave for Thailand and
for Indonesia and also for Korea, the fact that Australia is a
good regional neighbor," he added.
</P>
<P>
Australia promised late last year to join in the IMF assistance
packages to Thailand, Indonesia and Korea.
</P>
<P>
Howard's visit to Malaysia from February 22 to 24 will be the
first by an Australian prime minister since Paul Keating in
January 1996, just weeks before he was thrown out of office.
</P>
<P>
"Although Howard made restoring Australia's fragile
relationship with Malaysia one of his government's foreign policy
priorities, there has been little evidence of any improvement
since the change of government," AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia continues to block Australia's attempt to join the
Asia-Europe Meeting linking East Asia and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the PNG visit also came on the same day
talks began in New Zealand between leaders of all warring factions
on PNG's Bougainville to try to bring a permanent end to the
nine-and-a-half-year war on the island.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is playing a very helpful and very constructive role
in those peace talks, and it will be an opportunity for me to
renew my dialogue with the new Papua New Guinea Prime Minister
(Bill Skate)," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he would visit PNG from February 25 to 26.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer also announced
Monday he will visit Indonesia from January 25 to 27 to "extend
personally the Australian government's support for the Indonesian
government as it implements the measures in the IMF package
announced on January 15."
</P>
<P>
"Australia, as a friend and close neighbor, has significant
bilateral and regional interests in Indonesia overcoming its
current economic difficulties," the foreign minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Economic power house Guangdong
Province has vowed to raise its foreign trade volume by ten percent
in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, this southern Chinese region which adjoins Hongkong
and Macao will try to retain its 1997 high momentum of utilizing
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
To reach the end, the provincial authorities say, measures
should be taken to actively promote the reorganization of the
local foreign trade enterprises so as to boost large-scale
operation and to form a number of conglomerates each exceeding one
billion US dollars in imports and exports volume.
</P>
<P>
As part of the reform measures, more flexibility will be given
to medium- and small-sized foreign enterprises and to encourage
them to cooperate with overseas-funded or private firms.
</P>
<P>
The authorities also advocate more financial, technical and
personnel supports to enterprises producing name brands,
so as to improve the export commodity structure.
</P>
<P>
Diversifying the market is also deemed important, with a plan
stressing the consolidation of the traditional markets of
Hongkong, Macao, the United States, Japan and Western Europe,
expansion of markets in southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, the
Commonwealth of Independent States, and further opening of markets
in the Middle East, Africa, and south America.

<HEADLINE> Lucent Technologies' Investment Exceeds 100 Million Dollars in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The investment of Lucent
Technologies has well exceeded 100 million US dollars in China,
ranking among the largest foreign investors in the country's
telecommunications sector, said Henry Schacht, chairman of Lucent
Technologies, who is on a business trip in China.
</P>
<P>
The visiting chairman said that the company will enhance the
cooperation with China's telecommunications industry, and will
further its technology transfer to Chinese enterprises in the
frontier telecom areas of voice, data and video communications.
</P>
<P>
The huge market potential and an expected lasting stability of
Renminbi, the Chinese currency, will ensure China with a much
safer investment environment than the Southeast Asian nations
which are swept by a financial crisis and far from seeing a
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Separated from AT&AMP;T in 1996, Lucent Technologies became one of

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's MSC Project Progresses Despite Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad has stated that the investment in the country's
Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) had not been daunted by the
current economic crisis as some 4 billion ringgit (1 billion U.S.
dollars) had so far been poured in the MSC project.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference Monday after chairing the fourth
MSC Implementation Council Meeting at Cyberjaya near here,
Mahathir said that a total of 103 companies out of 176 which
applied had been given the MSC status.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that companies operating in information
technology (IT) hubs in other countries were keen to relocate to
the MSC as the incentives it offered were more attractive.
</P>
<P>
He said that these companies were bullish about the corridor's
prospects as they have forecast a ratio of 3:1 on their returns on
investment.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that most of the projects earmarked for
completion next year at the MSC have been brought forward a year
ahead of schedule to the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with progress of the development of
the MSC, saying efforts would not be spared in making it an
attractive, congenial and suitable place for those investing and
living in the MSC.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that during the meeting, where the implementation
of the MSC was reviewed, some decisions were taken whereby the
incentives offered by the MSC would be more attractive compared
with those given by others.
</P>
<P>
The MSC is a designated 50 kilometer by 15 kilometer multimedia
hub, stretching from the Kuala Lumpur city center to the Kuala
Lumpur International Airport in Sepang, dedicated towards the
development of information technology products.

<HEADLINE> New Bacteria Key to Wastewater Treatment Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A microscopic bacteria
discovered by Australian researchers has the potential to
revolutionize wastewater treatment and reduce water pollution
around the world, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the University of Queensland's Cooperative
Research Center (CRC) for Waste Management discovered the
Nitrospira bacteria, which converts the harmful form of nitrogen
in waste water, nitrite, to the less harmful nitrate, the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
CRC Ph.D. student Paul Burrell, who worked on the project, said
most bacteria could then convert the nitrate to harmless nitrogen
gas.
</P>
<P>
CRC project leader Dr. Linda Blackall said the discovery would
force the scientific community to change its thinking about the
biological breakdown of nitrite in water.
</P>
<P>
"In all the textbooks it says that the Nitrobacteria are
involved in converting nitrite to nitrate, but they had it all
wrong," Blackall said.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have discovered that the Nitrospira group of bacteria
is the important one," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Burrell said management techniques currently used by wastewater
treatment plants were consequently based on the wrong type of
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
"Our new discovery will help managers of wastewater treatment
plants to better prevent or fix up problems in water treatment,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the long term, changes in design of wastewater treatment
plants could lead to large savings in operational costs," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The center in Australia's Queensland state has taken out a
patent on the Nitrospira bacterium, which it spent four years
discovering and testing, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Burrell said the discovery could become a major export earner,
but first the center would spend three years researching the ideal
conditions for the bacteria's growth, growing the bacteria on a
larger scale, and proving the benefits of the discovery to
wastewater treatment plants around the world.

<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement will meet
with the mayors of 300 cities and towns, where 70 percent of the
cases of juvenile delinquency in France take place. He said that
the government will deploy in these provinces three fourths of an
estimated 8,250 newly recruited police agents in 1998. The
interior minister also said that juvenile delinquents don't
understand what they are doing and their behavior is the
"consequence of a deep social and morale crisis."
</P>
<P>
-- France's Gaullist Rally for the Republic Saturday presented
the acts of reconstructing the party, as its president Philippe
Seguin kicked off a debate on a statute of the party. While saying
that realism is a powerful weapon for RPR in confronting with the
Socialists, Sequin also accused Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of
"building an imaginary world... which he expects to be compatible
with his dogmatism."
</P>
<P>
Les Echos:
</P>
<P>
-- The movement of the unemployed in France has led to serious
tensions within the left-wing majority. The National Secretary of
the Communist Party Robert Hue renewed on Sunday the demand for an
immediate rise of minimum social welfare aid and called for a
national referendum on the European single currency euro. Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin will speak on television this week to
contain the increasing tension.

<P>
TOKYO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Liabilities of Japanese corporate
bankruptcies in 1997 reached 14.02 trillion yen (about 108.7
billion U.S. dollars), the largest volume in postwar history, a
private research agency said Monday.
</P>

dollars) in 1995, Teikoku Databank said.
</P>
<P>
The cases of bankruptcies with debts of 10 million yen (about
77,519 dollars) or more stood at 16,365 in 1997, up 12.5 percent
over a year before.
</P>
<P>
The number of failed listed companies was as many as 10, the
first double-digit figure in 32 years and the second highest level

Bankruptcies caused by the sluggish economy totaled 10,748,
accounting for 65.7 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
By industrial sector, all industries except manufacturers

<HEADLINE> Israel's Unemployment up in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel's unemployed people
increased by 17.7 percent to 152,753 in 1997 in a sign of
continued slowdown of the country's economy, a report published
Monday by the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In December alone, there were 18 towns whose unemployment rate
rose above 10 percent, three more than the previous month. Those
with the highest unemployment levels are Kuseifa, at 15.32
percent, Ofakim, at 13.9 percent, Abu Rubeia and Kiryat Gat, both
at 13.2 percent, and Sderot, at 13.1 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of women seeking work constituted 51.3 percent
of the unemployed despite a 1 percent decline over November. The
total number of new immigrants seeking work stood at 10,800,
accounting for 7 percent of the jobless population. About 43.9
percent of the total were those under the age of 35, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
The last quarterly figure of the unemployment rate issued by
the Central Bureau of Statistics put the September unemployment
rate at 8.1 percent. But economists suggested that the average
1997 unemployment rate would be slightly higher than the September
figure.
</P>
<P>
The Labor and Social Affairs Ministry blamed the central bank
for the rise in unemployment rate. The ministry said the bank
should lower interest rates to avoid more industrial plants from
closing their gates or relocating business to other labor-cheap
countries like Jordan and Far Eastern countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel's worsening labor situation has increased social
tensions and sparked off protests countrywide. In December,
residents in Ofakim, which suffers from a nearly 14 percent
unemployment rate, clashed violently with police in a protest.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Ezer
Weizman and other political leaders paid visits to Ofakim to
allay the residents' concerns, promising an all-out war against
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
But few expects the unemployment situation to get better soon
with Israeli economy continuing its slowdown, from an averaged
over 6 percent in the decade before 1996 to 4 percent in 1996 and
2 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Loss-Making State Enterprises on Rise in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 19 (Xinhua)-- Vietnam's loss-making stated-owned
enterprises increased from 22 percent in 1996 to more than 30
percent in 1997, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a senior official of Vietnam's Ministry of Finance, the
VNA said that many Vietnamese enterprises have sunk further into
the red and are on the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
They have covered it up, it said.
</P>
<P>
A lack of regulations on financial management of state-owned
enterprises is the main reason, experts say.
</P>
<P>
There have so far been no clear regulations on how state
management is to be conducted and what is the specific role of
state ownership at enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Nor have there been regulations on the organization and
operations of the supervising committee in state-owned enterprises
with no managing board.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment of financial management regulations for these
enterprises has also proven inappropriate. The manager's rights
and responsibilities concerning investment and capital development
are not concretely defined.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vietnam's state financial management agencies have
not strictly controlled the operations of state-owned enterprises,
giving room for financial violations and failure to intervene in
time to address problems.
</P>
<P>
The handling of loss-making enterprises has also been delayed
and operations check on state-owned enterprises is done by many
state agencies which lack good coordination.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 6,000 state-owned enterprises in
Vietnam.

BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of
the Chinese Central Military Commission, met with U.S. Secretary
of Defense William Cohen today at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.
</P>
<P>
Zhang expressed pleasure on the progress of relations between
the two nations and their armed forces over the past year. He also
voiced appreciation for Cohen's active efforts to promote the
relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese president Jiang Zemin's successful state visit to the
United States last October formed a solid foundation for the
establishment of constructive strategic partnership geared to the
21st century, and has provided new opportunities for the
development of ties between the two armed forces, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He noted China is fully prepared to join the United States in
firmly implementing agreements reached during the Sino-US summit.
</P>
<P>
Zhang stressed that the Taiwan issue is the most important and
most sensative issue in Sino-US relations. The advancement of
Sino-US relations requires that the two nations properly handle
the Taiwan issue. Failure to do so will create problems and lead
to setbacks in the bilateral ties, a fact proven by history, said
Zhang.
</P>
<P>
China hopes the United States will handle the Taiwan issue on
the basis of the principles of three Sino-US joint communiques in
order to ensure smooth improvement in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also briefed the US delegation on China's reform, opening
and economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said his visit will help to enhance understanding and
clarify misunderstandings. He noted that the visit reflects the
momentum in the development of relations between the two nations
since President Jiang Zemin visited the United States.
</P>
<P>
Zhang expressed his gratitude and happily accepted Cohen's
invitation to visit the US in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ke, director of the General Logistics Department of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA), attended the meeting. Also present
was US Deputy Secretary of Defense Walter Slocombe.

LUSAKA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Located 25 kilometers northeast
of Lusaka, Kalimba Farm and Kalimba Reptile Park, two in one, now
is raising 6,000 crocodiles and hundreds of Chinese Beijing
ducks, pigs and fishes.
</P>
<P>
There are various sizes and types of snakes, turtles and
chameleons, attracting about 20,000 tourists annually.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director Bill Thomas, a British man who has been in
Zambia for 23 years, started to run in 1985 the 47-hectare farm
and park.
</P>
<P>
There are 23 species of crocodiles introduced from the Mexico,
Cuba and Australia. The crocodile meat is sold at local markets
and the skin is exported to South Africa and some European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the farm is going to import Yangtze crocodiles
from China to make the crocodiles more diversified.
</P>
<P>
Life span of crocodiles can be as long as 120 years and female
crocodiles lay eggs between September and November and a
crocodile can produce 18 to 45 eggs during this period.
</P>
<P>
Meat and fishes are fed to the crocodiles every the other day
and the crocodiles' meat could be on sale after crocodiles get
three years old.
</P>
<P>
Eighty lucky female and 20 male crocodiles are kept specially
for producing their descendants.
</P>
<P>
Fishes and ducks live together in ponds and ducks' wastes
becomes food for the fishes and pigs' wastes is also channeled to
the ponds to feed the fishes, thus reducing the cost.
</P>
<P>
Tourists can angle in the ponds to relax and they will pay for
the fishes they catch.
</P>
<P>
In the park there are also a mini golf course, children play
park and volleyball course.
</P>
<P>
Attracting tourists are also colorful flowers, ever green
carpet grass and trees. The park can earn 50,000 U.S. Dollars in
net profit in a year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. County in California Settles 2000 Computer Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 19 (Xinhua) -- First of the 58 counties in
California, San Jorquin County, has claimed to fulfill a huge task
-- touching the computer glitch that threatens to crash its system
at the start of the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Fixing the so-called "2000 bug" or "millennium bug" took
experts 19,200 hours and cost the county 1.9 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project started in March 1996 and was completed at the end
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
To make sure that computers won't read 2000 as 1900 at the
start of the new millennium, workers in the county went through
3.9 million lines of code, changing date references while dealing
with limited memory capacity in the date fields.
</P>
<P>
San Jorquin's was just a small battle compared with the
enormous task in combating the Year 2000 problem to be taken by
companies, banks and government agencies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The problem stemmed from a shortcut by many software
programmers who, in the 1960's and 1970's, recorded the year using
only the last two digits. So unless millions of lines of computers
code are changed, many systems would think that the year 2000 is
the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
The cost of fixing all the software in the world is estimated
to be 300-600 billion dollars. The state of California will spend
200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey found that at least half of the U.S. large
banks are halfway through the computer reprogramming phase.
</P>
<P>
But it is reported that only 12 percent of American companies
with 2,000 or fewer employees have started Year 2000 solutions,
and one in three big companies have addressed the problem.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that about one-third of U.S. companies and
half of federal government agencies will have failed to erase all
the glitches by New Year's Day, 2000. The reason is that the
software code is voluminous and fixing is hard. Some firms have to
comb as many as 120 million lines of code to find the dates that
need fixing.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Problems Cause Health, Skin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Environmental problems, such as
a depletion of the ozone layer and global warming, are the cause
behind increased health and skin problems, local Daily Star
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, 150 medical physicians and experts from
Arab countries and French-speaking states focused on the issue,
especially on dermatology and skin problems in children, at a
symposium held here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Roland Tomb, head of the dermatology department at Lebanese
Hotel Dieu Hospital and one of the organizers of the symposium,
said skin diseases in children, which were sometimes detected at
birth, could be "quite serious" and needed special attention from
physicians.
</P>
<P>
"Although children can get the same skin diseases as adults,
their treatment varies immensely because their skin is much more
sensitive and requires a completely different type of treatment or
medication," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The type of food we eat, the environment we live in and the
quality of life we lead do affect our skin but not as much as
people think," he maintained.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian physician Oumeish Youssef Oumeish, who has conducted
extensive research on community health development and the
environment, cited environmental hazards such as the increase in
air pollution caused by car and industrial fumes, as well as
global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer, as main
factors affecting public health.
</P>
<P>
He said that research showed that these environmental factors
can cause dermatological problems.
</P>
<P>
"Skin problems have definitely increased over the past decade
because of the environment, leading to an increase in skin
cancer, speeding up the aging process and decreasing immunity,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the major challenges in non-industrial nations
such as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan, involve poverty and that
physicians on the "frontline of health care should be the
consciousness of nations" to advise people of the risks and
prevention of diseases through education and medical research in
the Arab world.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- While urban Guangdong
residents in south China are most fond of traveling in and outside
the country, more and more well-off Guangdong farmers are now
following suit.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted among 1,000 rural families of five
cities in Guangdong shows, between October 1996 and 1997, 2,025
people took part in domestic tours, accounting for 44 percent of
the respondents.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates their spending on traveling totaled
1.3 million yuan (158,300 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the Pearl River Delta area, which is a more developed area
in Guangdong, as high as 95.5 percent local farmers have traveled
elsewhere, respectively 45.3 and 62 percentage points higher than
farmers in the eastern and western and mountainous areas, the
survey says.
</P>
<P>
The farmers in the Delta area spend 914.61 yuan per person on
travel, 220 percent higher than than that of the province's
average level. Their spending is respectively 762.15 yuan and
780.26 yuan higher than that of the eastern,and western, and
mountain areas.
</P>
<P>
Relevant experts believe with the constant rising in living
standard, more and more Guangdong farmers will travel outside
their home county.

WUHAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China's Dongfeng Automobile
Corporation, one of the world top three truck producers, reported
48.49 million yuan in profit in 1997, recovering from a downhill
over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The corporation, also one of the country's three major
automobile producers, was cornered by reduced capital construction
and oversupply of heavy trucks in the market since 1993 when the
State began to exercise macro-economic control.
</P>
<P>
The company didn't wait for change, however, it took measures
to improve the product mix to adapt to market demand, by
developing light trucks and cars. As a result, Dongfeng came to
rank first in the sector for its production and sales last year,
said Li Youquan, deputy Party secretary of the corporation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company paid special attention to upgrading
the quality of its products, and passed the internationally
recognized ISO9000 quality certification. The trade mark
"Dongfeng" was also listed as a name brand by the State.
</P>
<P>
"Our company will produce 350,000 automobiles by the end of the
century, 35 billion yuan in annual sales, two billion yuan in
pre-tax profit, and 100 million US dollars in export," said Ma
Yue, general manager of the enterprise.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif expressed on Monday his confidence that the all-round
friendly cooperation between Pakistan and China will expand
further with the persistent efforts of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was talking to a six-member delegation of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), led by Ma Wenpu, deputy head of the
International Liaison Department of the CPC Central Committee, at
the Prime Minister's Secretariat here in the morning.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his satisfaction with the smooth development
of the bilateral ties between the two countries, saying the
Pakistan-China friendship will be further cemented with the
expansion of their close cooperation particularly in the economic
field.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the visit of the CPC delegation, Sharif said,
"Party to party relationship is essential to consolidating the
bilateral relations between the two friendly neighbors."
</P>
<P>
"I will do all I can do as the prime minister to promote the
already strong relations between Pakistan and China," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Ma described the Pak-China friendship as "time-tested" and
"all-weather" and said such relations will be carried forward for
generations to come.
</P>
<P>
He said China, which is bent on developing its national
economy, badly needs a peaceful international and regional
environment and it thus attaches great importance to forging
friendly and good-neighborly relations with all its neighbors,
especially Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Developing relations with other neighbors will in no way
affect Pakistan-China friendship," Ma emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his appreciation for the various economic
revival packages initiated by the Sharif government, saying they
will lead the country to even more progress.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people and government are eagerly looking forward

<HEADLINE> Trade Embargo on Burundi Urged to Be Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Eastern and Southern
African Business Organization (ESABO) has appealed to east
African regional governments to lift the economic sanctions
against Burundi immediately, Kenya Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued here on Sunday by an ESABO delegation
which just concluded a fact-finding mission in Burundi said that
the sanctions imposed by regional governments had "not served any
useful economic or political purpose".
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the continued imposition may "lead to
breeding of insecurity in the area."
</P>
<P>
Burundi has lost in export earnings, and its economic
development is now retarded, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
There is increased cost of acquisition of goods and services,
making the living standards of the lowest masses poorer, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The delegation's visit to Burundi is a follow up of the
Council of Ministers of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) meeting in Lusaka last year which urged
the private sector to make recommendations on the Burundi issue.
</P>
<P>
Kassim Owango, Chairman of Kenyan National Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, said on Sunday: "We discourage the use of economic
sanctions against members of the COMESA region."
</P>
<P>
Owango who is the delegation's leader blamed the economic
sanctions for the reduction of export earnings of Burundi and the
diversion of business formerly controlled by east African
countries to Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The delegation composing of representatives from Kenya,
Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Rwanda believed that "the
sanctions are doing more harm than good."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, S. Africa Sign Solid Mineral Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and South Africa have
signed an agreement on technical co-operation in solid mineral
exploitation, the "Business Times" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed last week in Nigerian capital Abuja
provides that South Africa will offer training on major areas of
solid mineral development to Nigerian technicians.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Minister of Solid Mineral Development Alhaji Kaloma
Ali remarked that the agreement is needed to formalize increased
co-operation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Co-operation with other countries is necessary to develop
Nigeria's vast reserves of solid minerals, he said, adding that
South Africa is blessed with much expertise and has been in
active solid minerals exploitation for several decades.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has been giving more emphasis on the
development of solid minerals in recent times, in a bid to reduce
the economy's dependence on oil export.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have identified over 30 solid minerals with
commercial reserves, but efforts to attract local and foreign
investment have not been very successful, due to the general
investment environment and inadequate manpower.

Talking to local reporters at the repairing site of the Kambu
bridge, Kimanthi said that the Kenyan government had done
everything possible to repair the bridge which is lifeline to
Kenya and its neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Gets Double Authentication for Quality Transport Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, the largest port of
comprehensive international trade in north China, has been awarded
a certificate of authentication of quality passenger and cargo
transport service system by two authoritative organizations.
</P>
<P>
The certificate was given by China Classification Society and
the Quality Authentication Company of the British Standard
Institute, making Tianjin the first port in China that has ever
won such a double authentication.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, more than 20 enterprises under the
Tianjin Port Administration have got certificates of quality
authentication from international organizations since the port
started to implement international quality standards a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Port now has over 70 berths for passenger and cargo
transport, including 47 deep-water berths of 10,000 dwt (dead
weight tonnages) and eight berths for containers.
</P>
<P>
By December 31, 1997, the port handled 67.89 million tons of
cargo, a rise of 9.7 percent over the previous year. In the past
year, the container transport was 935,000 TEUs at the port, up
13.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of this century, the port will handle 70 million
tons of cargo a year, and the container transport will reach 1.4
million TEUs annually, said local officials.

<HEADLINE> Hewitt Defeated by Vacek in Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 19 (Xinhua) --Australian teenager Lleyton
Hewitt lost the match to Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic but
won admiration as he went down in five sets at the Australian Open
tennis in Melbourne today.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt, who burst to prominence as the Australian hardcourt
champion last week, was beaten 6-2, 6-4, 1-6, 2-6, 6-3 by Vacek in
their first round match today.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt beat Andre Agasi on his way to victory in last week's
contest and backed up with a win over world No.4 Jonas Bjorkman of
Sweden in Sydney last week.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Australian came to the Open as one of the
biggest local drawcards, even though he was unlikely to go beyond
the first round.
</P>
<P>
When he was down 0-2 it appeared the ratings computer which
placed him at 200 and the Czech at No.53 would provide a true
indication of his chances.
</P>
<P>
But Hewitt, who had held serve only four times in the first two
sets, rode out the storm and came within a couple of games of
stealing the match.
</P>
<P>
As Vacek began to play it safe and defend his lead, Hewitt kept
running, attempting to hit a winner of every ball.
</P>
<P>
He breezed through the third set and didn't give Vacek the
sniff of a chance in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
But in the final set, inexperience and fatigue began to show as
an increasingly exasperated Hewitt failed to counter his opponents
final surge.
</P>
<P>
It was only Hewitt's second appearance at the Australian Open,
having been beaten in the first round here last year by Spain's
Sergi Bruguera.
</P>
<P>
"Going into the fifth set I was feeling pretty confident, I
thought I was starting to hit the ball better," Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
"But the turning point came when I was 3-2 down going for game
point and missed two forehands which gave him break point".
</P>
<P>
"At two sets to love down I still thought I was in with a
chance, if I could guts out the third. When I got breaks up in the
third and fourth sets he chucked in the sets".
</P>
<P>
"But he played tough service games at the start of the
fifth. He was holding his serve a lot easier than me and when he
wanted a big point he could always pull out an ace."

<HEADLINE> Central China Province Leads in Freshwater Fish Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Hubei province in central China
recorded a per-capita freshwater fish output of 34 kg in 1997,
ranking first in the country for five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
The province harvested more than two million tons of fish last
year, valued at some 10 billion yuan, accounting for 13 percent of
the total agricultural output value, said Che Guangbiao, director
of the provincial Aquatic Product Administration.
</P>
<P>
Hubei, known as the "province of thousand lakes", with China's
longest Yangtze River running through it, boasts favorable
geographical conditions to develop the freshwater fishery.
</P>
<P>
Name-brand aquatic products have come to account for nearly
half of the province's total output. Soft-shelled turtles, for
example, amounted to 8,000 tons last year and prawns and
crabs nearly 70,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
To boost the sector, the province has set up 30 transregional
shareholding enterprises, as well as an aquatic product group with
800 million yuan in assets.
</P>
<P>
Now, private businesses and foreign investors have joined the
effort to promote the local fishery by spending over two billion
yuan .

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Hike Triggers Violence in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A recent increase in oil prices
triggered violence in the Philippines, with a group of people
police described as terrorists attacking a government building on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police said the suspects first attacked by firing M-16 rifles
the Philcomcen building, where the Energy Regulatory Board is
located on Ortigas Avenue, Pasig City, Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, another suspect threw a grenade which exploded
at the canopy of the building of Petron oil company in Makati
City, Metro Manila, police said.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence reports showed that terrorist elements opposing
the recent price hike of petroleum products were behind the
bombing and strafing.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from oil companies claiming daily losses of
millions of pesos due to the depreciation of the peso, the Energy
Regulatory Board approved on January 16 a rise in prices of oil
products by 53 centavos (1.3 U.S. cents) per liter.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's urban population
will rise by 53 percent to 46 million in seven years, the
Associated Press of Bangladesh (APB) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of urban dwellers, currently 30 million and
representing over one-fourth of the country's total population of
124.3 million, will reach 46 million by the year 2005 and 68
million by the year 2015, APB quoted an urban livelihood study as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"In the absence of commensurate industrialization with little
planned urban or spatial development, this rapid expansion of the
urban population has serious implications for the physical and
socioeconomic conditions of the country's cities," the study
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The study was jointly conducted by the Institute for
Development Policy Analysis and Advocacy of Bangladesh, London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Britain's University

<HEADLINE> IMF Prescribes Wrong Medicine for Thailand: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A Thai business executive has
accused the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of prescribing the
wrong medicine for the country's economic illness and thus
stalling its economy.
</P>
<P>
Chirayudh Vasuratna, vice chairman of the Thai Chamber of
Commerce, said the IMF's tough requirement for the Thai government
to maintain a budget surplus worth 1 percent of gross domestic
product is impossible to achieve and will cause a lot of trouble
for the public sector, according to a Bangkok Post report on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's attempt to attain the IMF-set target
by cutting heavily on the expenditure budget has affected
development works and hurt tax collection target.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF requirements are similar to those applied to
Mexico. But circumstances of the two countries are different.
While Mexico's debts were largely owed by the public sector,
Thailand's debts are incurred mostly by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Chirayudh urged the Thai government to lower interest rates,
cut back budget for overseas assistance and purchase necessary
foreign military equipment through barter deal.

<HEADLINE> Over 100 Bangladeshis Have Transplanted Kidneys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 Bangladeshi
patients suffering from kidney failure have received transplanted
kidneys at the Postgraduate Hospital here since 1988, according to
Professor M. A. Wahab, head of the Urology Department of the
Institute of Postgraduate Medicine Research in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
"All the transplant cases were operated successfully and most
of the patients are living a normal life," Professor Wahab told
reporters recently.
</P>
<P>
About 200 kidney patients came to the out-patient department of
the hospital twice a week, only about three percent of the
patients got treatment at the hospital, he said.
</P>
<P>
With only 22 beds and two operation rooms under the urology
department at the hospital, it was difficult to provide Medicare
facilities to the increasing number of kidney patients, the kidney
surgeon said.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the patients cannot be admitted at the hospital and
become frustrated...either to go abroad or wait for death," said
Professor Wahab.
</P>
<P>
As an immediate measure, he said, the number of beds and
operation rooms should be increased, and it was necessary to set
both urology departments and kidney transplant units at different
medical college hospitals in the country.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, only the Postgraduate Hospital and the Dhaka
Medical College Hospital have urology departments at present, and
the only kidney transplant center was set up at the Postgraduate
Hospital in 1988.
</P>
<P>
A kidney transplant operation at the Postgraduate Hospital
costs about 200,000 taka(4400 U.S. dollars), of which the
government bears the major shares, with the patient paying about
25,000 taka (550 Dollars) for expensive drugs not available in the
hospital, according to the professor.
</P>
<P>
And the patient's family has to arrange the alternative,
transferable kidney from their own sources, he added.
</P>
<P>
Of the various types of kidney ailments in the country,
kidney-stone cases account for about 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> Thai Finance Minister's US Trip to Focus on Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda's trip to the United States this week will focus on
two main issues -- requesting American banks to roll over their
loans and seeking additional loans from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Tarrin will try to enlist the U.S. government's assistance in
convincing American banks to roll over their loans to Thai
borrowers, according to the Bangkok Post On Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand' short-term foreign debt set to mature this years is
about 40 billion dollars. About half will be rolled over from
Japanese creditors. The rest is to US and European creditors.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Japanese creditors, American and European banks have been
reticent about rolling over their loans, with most seeking to
reduce their exposure and calling in obligations.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand must also settle about 9 billion dollars
in swap obligations taken out during last May's defense of the
baht with foreign institutions.
</P>
<P>
Given the current sentiment in US Congress, prospects for
direct aid from the US government is dim. Thailand will hope that
the US government will help swaying support within the IMF to
expand the 17.2 billion dollar standby credit.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin's second task will be to seek additional funding of up
to 12 billion US dollars to support the country's foreign
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's official foreign reserves at the end of 1997 totaled
27 billion dollars. If outstanding obligations are not rolled
over, and no additional funds are found, the pressures on the
balance of payments and the baht would be significant.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the IMF review for the third batch of standby
credits, Thailand will not ask for a relaxation of the condition
to maintain a budget surplus equal to 1 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Tarrin is expected to ask the IMF to reduce the
underlying GDP forecasts, the Bangkok Post quotes an unnamed
government official as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 10,945 children under
five were given oral polio vaccine (OPV) for the second day in the
capital of Yangon in Myanmar's nation-wide movement to mark the
country's third year of the National Immunization Days (NID) which
was launched Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The children given OPV included those in a dozen townships and
some military command headquarters and hospitals, official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of children in other states and divisions
who received OPV are yet to be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The first day of the country's third year of NID was launched
on last December 15 simultaneously with neighboring Nepal, India,
Bhutan, Bangladesh, the Maldives, Thailand and China's Yunnan
province as a regional synchronization strategy.
</P>
<P>
The third year of Myanmar's poliomyelitis eradication
activities targets about 5.7 million under-five children.
</P>

realized.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Bank Issues Swap Facility for Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia, the country's
central bank, has issued a swap facility for exporters in a bid to
boost U.S. dollar liquidity in the market and reduce pressure on
the Indonesian rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Under the new facility issued on Sunday, exporters can exchange
their dollars with rupiah in the banking system with a guarantee
from Bank Indonesia that at any time they can get their dollars
back at an exchange rate agreed with the central bank, the local
press Monday quoted Bank Indonesia Director Boediono as saying in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
The exporters will also be able to use their rupiah under the
swap facility to meet their day-to-day needs for rupiah, or place
them in bank deposits, Boediono added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the central bank is also offering an opportunity
to exporters to invest their rupiah in Bank Indonesia certificates
(SBI) at current SBI rates. "We all know SBI is the safest
security instrument," Boediono noted.
</P>
<P>
The facility had been very much expected by the business
community amid the scarcity of dollars in the market. The 'Love
the Rupiah' campaign is currently among the popular efforts to
encourage people to exchange their dollars for rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has been under pressure since the economic crisis
erupted in July last year and once dropped to 11,000 against the
dollar on January 8.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah continued to be under downward pressure despite
announcement of the government's sweeping reforms last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said it will distribute the U.S. dollars
received from the exporters throughout the market so as to boost
dollar liquidity, which has been very tight in the past few
months.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Battle Against Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A commentary in today's
People's Daily cautioned local governments to avoid resting on
their 1997 achievements in gaining good control over prices and
urged them to remain alert for factors which could possibly
spark a rebound.
</P>
<P>
China's 1997 retail price index (RPI) and consumer price index
(CPI) grew respectively by 0.8 percent and 2.8 percent from the
1996 level. Compared with those for 1996, the growth rates mark
drops of 5.3 and 5.5 percentage points respectively. Meanwhile,
the nation's GDP grew by 8.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This is what we have been expected for many years and it will
provide a sound basis for China's sustained, rapid and healthy
economic growth," the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to control the prices by adhering to the
tight fiscal and monetary policies, it says.
</P>
<P>
Government leaders at various levels should continue to pay
attention to the prices for grain and vegetables so as to
guarantee that the people's life is stable.
</P>
<P>
The commentary urges all local officials to actively publicize
and immplement the Price Law in order to eliminate violations,
prejucial practices and monopolized prices.
</P>
<P>
It calls for strengthened supervisions over the prices and
unremitting efforts to curb excessive charges on farmers
and companies.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says the said measures will help create a good
pricing situation for a stable performance of the socialist market
economy, and will further promote the economic restructuring and
economic development in China.

<P>
PRAGUE, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A new political party called
Unie Svobody, or Liberal Party, was founded in the eastern Czech
city of Litomysl on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party is the de facto right-wing spinoff of the
Civic Democratic Party (CDP) chaired by Vaclav Klaus, the biggest
group in the ruling coalition camp.
</P>
<P>
Key members of the new party include former Interior Minister
Jan Ruml and incumbent Finance Minister Ivan Pilip, who reportedly
don't get along well with the CDP leadership.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the party is the third largest in the parliament
with 30 deputies in the 200-seat lower house. The two bigger ones
are the Czech Social Democratic Party and the CDP.
</P>
<P>
A national congress of the Liberal Party is scheduled for

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria's Budgetary Deficit Down to 3.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian government's
budgetary deficit was down to 3.1 percent of the state budget last
year as a result of lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing here on Sunday, Finance Minister Muravei
Radev said the 1997 deficit was less than half of the government's
initial projection of 6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
A major contributor to the improved balance, Radev said, was
drastic cutbacks on interest rates, from 496 percent at the end of
1996 to 34 percent a year later.
</P>
<P>
But the economy still had a negative annual growth, with gross
domestic product (GDP) down 7.4 percent in 1997, compared to a
10.9 percent decline in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the annual inflation, of 578 percent last year, was
a record high since this East European nation turned to market
economy in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, Bulgaria's foreign reserves were a little
over 2.48 billion U.S. dollars, up from the previous year's 793
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Its public sector external debt totalled 8.8 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' agriculture
grew by 3.03 percent in 1997, dodging a fatal blow what analysts
had expected as a result of the El Nino abnormal weather
phenomenon, local newspaper Business World reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the El Nino, the agriculture sector still grew by 4.86
percent during the last quarter, pushing the aggregate growth to
3.03 percent," Agricultural Secretary Salvador Escudero said in a
report to President Fidel Ramos, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
This was contrary to speculations last year that agriculture
would significantly weigh down the country's overall 1997 growth
rate because the dry spell induced by El Nino would gobble up
portions of production volumes, Escudero said.
</P>
<P>
At the latter part of 1997, some economic managers expressed
fears that the production of rice, the Filipino's staple, would
fall by 30 percent, but the actual output dropped by only 0.13
percent.
</P>
<P>
Gross output value of the sector reached 499.5 billion pesos
(12.5 billion U.S. dollars) at current prices, up by 5.31 percent
from its year-ago level, the newspaper said.

<P>
WELLINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A new round of talks on
peace in Papua New Guinea's Bourgainville island started at
Lincoln University in Christchurch, New Zealand, Monday afternoon
to secure peace on the island.
</P>
<P>
TVNZ reported that the delegates were welcomed by NZ Prime
Minister Jenny Shipley and the meeting was attended by all the
warring factions from PNG.
</P>
<P>
The talks are the most representative gathering which has so
far taken place to resolve the nine-year conflict on
Bourgainville.
</P>
<P>
The participants include PNG Prime Minister Bill Skate, Premier
of the Bougainville Transitional Government Gerard Sinato, and
Bourgainville rebel leaders Joseph Kabui and San Kauona.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Shipley said that she hoped the meeting would be
another important building block in the road to peace.
</P>
<P>
"It has become very apparent over recent months that
Bourgainvileans have an overwhelming desire for peace."
</P>
<P>
Monday's meeting is the third one brokered by New Zealand for
peace in Bourgainville. At the second round meeting, warring
factions on the island signed a peace accord, in which they agreed
on a truce.
</P>
<P>
TVNZ quoted NZ Foreign Minister Don Mckinnon as saying that he
was confident that peace talks would secure a permanent ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Mckinnon, who toured Bourgainville recently, noted that there
had been a de facto ceasefire there form the past seven months and
it was obvious that the majority of the Bourgainville people
wanted peace.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Czech Republic Shrinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Direct foreign investment in the
Czech Republic registered 845 million U.S. dollars in 1997,
suffering a 39.2 percent decrease compared to the previous year.
</P>
<P>
This is the smallest figure in the last three years, according
to a spokesman from the Czech National Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The drastic shrink of direct foreign investment was due to the
unfavourable environment for investment resulting from political
instability such as the change of governments, strife among
political parties, particularly the forthcoming parliamentary
election.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment began to come to the Czech Republic in an
active way since 1990 when the economic situation in the country
got better. The amount in 1995 reached a record of 2.53 billion
U.S. dollars. However, it began to reduce in 1996, which
registered 1.39 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of foreign investment from 1990 to 1997 in the
Czech Republic was 6.88 billion U.S. dollars. It is the third
largest among the central European countries, only after Hungary
and Poland.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent will take further steps
to provide relief materials for quake-stricken ares in north China's
Hebei province, according to Jurgen Weyand, director of the
international organization's disaster relief department.
</P>
<P>
Weyand, head of a inspection group sent by the organization,
made the remarks following a recent fact-finding tour of the affected
areas in Zhangbei and Shangyi counties.
</P>
<P>
The group visited several devastated villages and joined
local officials in discussions of various ways of providing
emergency support.
</P>
<P>
"Local residents have not panicked despite the massive
destruction caused by the disaster. I've visited quake-striken
areas in many countries, but have never before witnessed such
effective resettlement of victims," said Weyand, who has visited
more than 20 quake-stricken regions throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the efficient emergency relief efforts carried
out by the local governments and the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter Scale hit Zhangbei
and Shangyi counties in Hebei Province on January 10,
killing 50 people and destroying over 103,000 houses.

<HEADLINE> Germany Given an Easy Run in Qualifying Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENT, Belgium, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions
Germany was given today an easy run in the year-long qualifying
tournament for the 2000 European Soccer Championship.
</P>
<P>
The Germans, who beat the Czech two goals to one in extra time
in the 1996 European tournament finals, had to be drawn into the
nine-group preliminaries instead of joining co-hosts Belgium and
the Netherlands as automatic qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
Joining Germany, ranked first by the Union of European Football
Associations (UEFA) prior to today's draw, in Group Three were
Turkey, Finland, Northern Ireland and Moldova.
</P>
<P>
German coach Berti Vogts said: "German football fans will be
satisfied with the draw as it is a very interesting group. We
will be meeting our old friends Northern Ireland and Moldova.
Hopefully, these friendship will help us arrange the dates of
fixtures."
</P>
<P>
Spain was also drawn into an easy group together with Austria,
Israel, Cyprus and San Marino in Group Six.
</P>
<P>
England, hosts to the last European championship, and Italy
were drawn into difficult groups, if not groups of death.
</P>
<P>
England plays Bulgaria, Sweden, Poland and Luxembourg in Group
Five while Italy meets Denmark, Switzerland, Wales and Belarus in
Group One.
</P>
<P>
England's coach Glenn Hoddle said at a post-draw press
confernece: "This is a really tough group, probably one of the
most difficult. We know a lot about Poland, because we played
them in the qualifiers for the World Cup, and both Bulgaria and
Sweden are strong established teams, and we know they will give us
tough games."
</P>
<P>
Sweden's coach Tommy Soderberg rated England as the hot
favorites in the group but said that one important thing is that
Sweden knows well about English football in that quite a few
Swedish players are playing in England.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Javier Clemente said: "It is probably not the most
difficult group, but still tough and we will respect our opponents
because Austria is a very good team and Israel showed that they
can play well by beating France recently."
</P>
<P>
The Spanish coach said that nothing is impossible in the sport
of football.
</P>
<P>
An interesting enough group was formed when three of the six
former Yugoslav republics were drawn into Group Eight that
includes Yugoslavia, Croatia, the Republic of Ireland, Macedonia
and Malta.
</P>
<P>
All the 51 UEFA member states are playing in the 2000 European
Soccer Championship. Only 49 teams took part in the draw while
co-hosts Belgium and the Netherlands are automatic qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
The group preliminary will be played on a double round-robin
basis with the nine group winners plus the best runner-up joining
Belgium and the Netherlands in the grand finale.
</P>
<P>
The eight other second-placed teams from the group qualifiers
will pair off for four home-and-away playoffs to decide the last
four berths in the 16-team finals.

<HEADLINE> Electronics Information Set as Pillar Industry in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Electronics information will
replace automobile manufacturing as a pillar industry in south
China's Guangdong province, according to governor Lu Ruihua.
</P>
<P>
The province decided in 1995 to develop the automotive industry
as one of its pillars. The governor said, however, that two years
of practice has shown that the auto industry no longer enjoys
special advantages and development conditions in Guangdong. He
added that the problem of redundant building across the country is
also rising.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Guangdong has turned to electronics information, which
provided more than 63 billion yuan in output value in 1996. This
industry in Guangdong accounted for 20.77 percent of the national
total, ranking first for the six consecutive years in China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July the province, with a population of 70
million, had 12 million telephones. Eighty percent of the families
in major cites have telephones, while every village is accessible
to telephones.
</P>
<P>
The Golden Card Project is also doing well, with six million
cards already issued.

<HEADLINE> Loyalist Group Claims Catholic's Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The pro-British Loyalist
Volunteer Force (LVF) claimed responsibility today for the murder
of a Catholic man in a small Northern Irish town overnight, said
local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Fergal McCusker, 28, was found dead behind a youth club in the
town Maghera early this morning. He had been shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
The LVF made its claim using a recognized codeword in a
telephone call to a television station.
</P>
<P>
It warned today that it will carry out further attacks and said
in a statement to media that "this is not the end."
</P>

The group has now killed four Catholics since its leader, Billy
Wright, was shot dead by republican prisoners in Belfast's Maze
prison on December 27.

It was reported that Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews
condemned the killing, saying those who had perpetrated the act
"must not be allowed to get what they want and destroy the hope of
a peaceful future."

Adam Ingram, the Northern Ireland minister for security, was
also reported as appealing for an end to the killings.

and to isolate those who are determined to take us down the road
to despair."

<HEADLINE> Iraqi President's Business Dealer Believed Among </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi opposition sources told
Xinhua Sunday that the Iraqi millionaire Sami George Thomas killed
in the early morning in west Amman was likely a business dealer of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Thomas, a member of the Assyrian Christian
Minority based in Iraqi capital Baghdad, had been managing
business for Saddam and his eldest son Uday for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was
believed to be involved in conflicts among the Iraqis who
supported Saddam's government.
</P>
<P>
Thomas was killed in his villa by four to five men speaking
with Iraqi accent at 1:15 Sunday morning local time (23:15
Saturday GMT) along with seven others, including Hikmet Al-Hijo,
the charge d'affaires of the Iraqi Embassy here, said a woman who
survived the killings.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources told Xinhua Sunday evening that weapons
have been found in Thomas' villa.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian government officials said earlier Sunday that Iraqi
opposition movements carried out the killings, and predicted that
the Jordanian-Iraqi relations would face tension in the coming
days.
</P>
<P>
The well-informed sources said that Iraq's opposition movements
were believed to have worked in Jordan for a long time with
financial support provided by United States Central Intelligence
Agency.
</P>
<P>
But one of the biggest Iraqi opposition movements based in
Amman, Al Wefaq or Iraqi National Accord (INA), Sunday denied
either the organization or Iraqi exiles was involved in the
killings.
</P>
<P>
An INA spokesperson, who declined to be named, told reporters
that the killing was caused by "internal feud" among the Iraqis in
the Jordanian capital.
</P>
<P>
The official Radio Jordan reported Sunday that an Iraqi
delegation would arrive here soon to investigate the massacre,
while the Jordan-Iraq border had been closed and Iraqis barred
from leaving Jordan.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 250,000 Iraqis living in Jordan, most of
whom do not have long-time or permanent residence.
</P>
<P>
The Jordan-Iraq relations became tense after four Jordanians,
convicted of smuggling car parts were executed last December in
Iraq. Jordan recalled its charge d'affaires from Baghdad and
expelled seven Iraqi diplomats in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Ties improved to some extent in late December when Iraq
renewed the agreement to sell oil to Jordan at a price below the
market rates.

On the eve of the upcoming Qods (Jerusalem) Day, Iran's Islamic
Propagation Organization (IPO) issued a statement calling for

Friday of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan as the Qods Day,
with the aim of calling on world Muslim to liberate Jerusalem, the
holy city for the three religions of Judaism, Islam and
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
The IPO statement said the danger posed by Israel is not
limited to the Palestinian nation, adding that the Israeli
government has been transformed into a threatening political and
military instrument against the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The statement blasted the United States for its support for
Israel, saying that Israel has become the operation base for the
West and a tool for the continuation of a full-swing blitzkrieg
attacks against the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
The IPO and several other Iranian groups have called on the
Iranian people and world Muslims to turn out Friday to condemn the
Israeli occupation of Jerusalem. It is believed that mass rallies
will be held throughout Iran on the occasion of the Qods
Day.

<P>
LONDON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam are to meet Sinn
Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness at 10 Downing
Street Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's official spokesman said today that this
meeting was fixed last week.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman rejected suggestions that the meeting, the second
at No 10, had been hastily arranged to assuage Sinn Fein's
concerns.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Irish republican leaders are unhappy with
a new peace plan for Northern Ireland put forward last week as a
basis for negotiation by the London and Dublin governments and
they are concerned with recent violence against Catholics by
Protestant guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
"It was agreed at the previous meeting that there would be
another meeting in due course. The prime minister uses his
meetings to try to facilitate the talks process," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Adams became the first Irish republican leader to enter the
prime minister's official residence for 76 years when he met Blair
in Downing Street on December 11.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Delegation Arrives in New York for Debt Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 18 (Xinhua)-- A South Korean delegation
returned to New York today to resume meetings with global lenders
for talks aimed at restructuring billions of U.S. dollars of debt.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is headed by You Jong-keun, South Korea's
President-elected Kim Dae-jung's economic advisor and governor of
South Korea's North Cholla Province. He is also a former professor
of economics at Rutgers University in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have some agreement on the overall structure" of a
debt-restructuring plan before the delegation returns to South
Korea at the end of this week, You told reporters upon his
arrival.
</P>
<P>
South Korea ran into problems in its external debt late last
year as a result of the currency crisis. The country has
reportedly some 80 billion U.S. dollars in short-term debt that
comes due in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, senior officials of nearly 20 U.S. leading
banks met in New York with a South Korean delegation to discuss
ways of helping South Korea pay its debt.
</P>
<P>
You said that his delegation had brought here "a set of
proposals" for international lenders, but refused to disclose any
details ahead of this week's meeting with the lenders.
</P>
<P>
Banking sources said that bargaining sessions are expected to
officially resume Wednesday.

Daley is expected to meet with Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and other government
officials during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Turkey agreed last December to buy the Caspian oil and natural
gas from Russia, which angered some U.S. firms involved in oil
exploitation in the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
The United States has long been eager to develop energy trade
with Turkey, which has to import oil and natural gas from abroad
because of its lacking in energy resources.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the issue of human rights is also expected to be
taken up during Daley's talks with Turkish officials.
