	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The risk of being crushed by a mammoth
falling object _ ranging from steel beams to building cranes _ from
construction projects on Bangkok's streets has become so high that
even the city governor is warning how dangerous it is.
	   A furious Gov. Bhichit Rattakul and one of his advisers are
blaming lax bureaucracy and indifferent contractors after the
latest in a series of accidents _ some fatal _ that have made
driving in Thailand's capital a deadly gamble.
	   ``This accident has proved once again that Bangkok is not a safe
place to live,'' the Bangkok Post newspaper quoted Bhichit as
saying after a mobile crane at a road construction site collapsed
during rush hour Tuesday, injuring two passing drivers.
	   Just last week, Bhichit ordered construction halted on the
city's first commuter rail line after a five-ton concrete block
fell from a crane during rush hour.
	   The governor filed a criminal negligence suit against the
construction consortium on behalf of an injured worker who suffered
broken teeth and cuts when a chip of concrete from the block hit
him in the face.
	   In March, a 105-ton steel beam from a crane used in another
elevated rail project fell on a main street, killing a taxi driver
and injuring three other people.
	   The wife of the dead driver sued the project's construction
company, Ital-Thai, for 32 million baht (dlrs 744,000) and the city
banned Ital-Thai for one year from bidding on any new public
projects.
	   Bhichit, who has made improving the city's environment his major
goal, has long been at loggerheads with Ital-Thai, one of
Thailand's biggest construction companies, which is involved with
several major infrastructure projects.
	   He had earlier issued a temporary ban on it bidding on any new
projects, saying the company had ignored several complaints from
city officials about safety problems and noise and dust pollution.
	   This week he also lashed out at central government agencies for
failing to enforce safety practices.
	   ``Government agencies, including the Highway Department and
Telephone Organization of Thailand, must cooperate with the city
and control their contractors,'' said Bhichit.
	   Bhichit's attitude contrasts with the approach taken a couple of
years ago after a driver was killed by falling material from an
elevated expressway. Police advised worried motorists traveling on
the lower road to stick to outside lanes rather than the roadway
directly underneath the upper tier.

Chinese government praises stronger US ties, chides critics 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-China-Clinton
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Thursday gave a glowing report on
warming ties with the United States, but also chided its U.S.
critics for fighting the improvements by ``spreading rumors.''
	   President Clinton's visit next week will ``put new force into
establishing a constructive strategic partnership toward the 21st
century'' between ``two big countries with major influence in the
world,'' the People's Daily, the leading paper of the ruling
Communist Party, said in a front-page commentary.
	   Since President Jiang Zemin visited the United States last fall,
relations have been on a ``track of healthy and stable
development'' with many high-level exchanges and cooperation on
world problems, it said.
	   The unsigned commentary reflects the thinking of top Chinese
leaders, who always approve such articles in People's Daily.
	   Most Americans support good relations with China, but ``a
minority still have Cold War attitudes and the minute there's an
opportunity they spread rumors and make trouble to undermine
relations,'' it said. ``This is against what people desire.''
	   The article did not name any critics or detail their views, but
the mention clearly referred to the storm of opposition in
Washington to Clinton's upcoming China trip. The commentary tried
to put a positive spin on the policy debate.
	   ``More and more officials and ordinary people (in the United
States) recognize that conflict between the United States and China
not only has no benefit for world peace and stability but also
harms America's own interests. They're proposing an all-around
improvement of U.S. relations with China.''
	   In the past half year there have been increasing numbers of
high-level visits, military exchanges, and good cooperation on the
Iraq weapons inspections crisis, nuclear tests by India and
Pakistan and the Asian financial crisis, the commentary said. New
scientific, cultural and educational ties also are flourishing.
	   Good relations with China are in the interest of the United
States, it argued: ``A China that is politically stable,
economically prosperous and has a huge market is a China that the
United States cannot ignore.''

Ruling party opens assembly with attack on speculators

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ruling party opened its
annual convention Thursday by accusing foreign currency speculators
of pushing the nation into a perilous slide toward recession.
	   ``Our economy has been rattled because of attacks from
outsiders. Our currency has slid because of attacks from foreign
currency speculators,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in
an opening speech at the general assembly of the United Malays
National Organization.
	   Nearly 2,000 delegates from around the country have gathered for
the four-day convention of the massive party with some 2.7 million
members.
	   Anwar, who is vice president of the party and also the nation's
finance minister, was in effect giving his support to Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's controversial stance that foreigners
were to blame for Malaysia's economic woes.
	   Anwar, in a traditional Malay shirt and songkok cap, said
Malaysia was facing its ``most critical test'' since independence
from Britain in 1957.
	   Political observers had wondered whether Anwar, often at odds
with Mahathir over the proper path to economic recovery, would
rally behind the prime minister at the convention.
	   ``UMNO must unite as one front under our leadership headed by
our prime minister,'' said Anwar, in a ringing endorsement for
Mahathir. He called on the party delegates to ignore foreign media
reports noting wide leadership differences between him and
Mahathir, who is scheduled to address the assembly Friday.
	   ``If there are foreign media or outsiders who try to create
conflict among our leaders, let us not be influenced,'' he said.
	   Echoing Mahathir, Anwar said foreign currency speculators were
to blame for the more than 35 percent devaluation of the ringgit
since the Asian currency crisis began in Thailand last July.
	   ``Currency speculators should not (be) allowed to act according
to whims to gain profits without taking into consideration the
effects they have on other countries, especially the misery faced
by the people due to their greed,'' he said.
	   Anwar again called on the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund to establish an international system that would monitor the
activities of foreign exchange traders.
	   ``The international community needs to realize the problems we
face and work to introduce reforms so that resources can be better
controlled,'' he said.
	   Anwar conceded Malaysia's own financial system was in need of
repair and greater transparency.
	   Malaysia's economy shrank by 1.8 percent in the first quarter of
1998, compared with 6.9 percent growth last year.
	   Anwar said the government may increase fiscal spending by up to
7 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.8 billion).

Book on Malaysian leader banned on eve of party convention 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Malaysia-Politics
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's deputy prime minister
obtained a court order against a book he alleges was filled with
lies about him.
	   The court injunction against the book, entitled, ``50 Reasons
Why Anwar Cannot Be Prime Minister,'' came on the eve of the annual
general assembly of the ruling United Malays National Organization.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, also the nation's finance
minister, opened the general assembly Thursday with a speech firmly
backing Prime Minister Mahathir.
	   Copies of the book are believed to have been widely circulated
among UMNO delegates, said the national news agency Bernama. The
contents were not immediately known.
	   Anwar ``will not hesitate to take whatsoever legal action as may
be necessary to protect the dignity of his office and his own self
esteem,'' said a statement by his legal firm.
	   Anwar is Mahathir's anointed successor and the most powerful man
in the ruling party after the prime minister.
	   ``Anwar categorically states that the said book contains gross
libel against himself,'' said the statement by the legal firm of
Messrs Faiz and Co.
	   The book is authored by Khalid Jafri, a former editor of a
defunct tabloid newspaper and published by a little-known company,
the Media Pulau Lagenda.
	   Anwar has often been a victim of privately-circulated ``poison
pen'' letters alleging abuse of power and sexual misconduct.
	   Neither the author nor the publisher could be immediately
reached for comment.

Hong Kong's Tung welcomes yen rebound 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Hong Kong chief executive Tung
Chee Hwa said Thursday he was glad to see the Japanese yen has
rebounded overnight and that the key issue for the world economy is
for Japan ``to move forward.''
	   Coordinated intervention by the United States and Japan
overnight gave an immediate lift to the Japanese currency,
resulting in higher demand for many Asian currencies and boosting
flagging currency values and stocks in the region.
	   Asked by reporters if he believed Asia's financial crisis had
stabilized, Tung said Asia had ``gone through a lot'' in the past
18 months, and that he was glad to see the Japanese yen rebound.
	   Tung, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, was speaking to reporters in Wellington, New
Zealand, where he is meeting Prime Minister Jenny Shipley.
	   In Australia, senior world Bank official Jean-Michel Severino
said the intervention by the United States and Japan was a positive
step for the entire region.
	   ``I think it's a very positive step forward. This is exactly the
type of thing that should happen,'' Severino, the bank's vice
president for the East Asia and Pacific region, told reporters.
	   He said that strengthening the yen would make the risk of
regional recession less likely.
	   Severino said steps being taken now to address the crisis would
not have an impact in 1998, but could make a difference for 1999.

ASEAN ministers meet to discuss haze, Southeast Asia fires 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Southeast Asian environment ministers will plan
ways to prevent a recurrence of haze caused by regional fires
caused when they meet in Singapore on Friday.
	   For the most part, heavy rains have subdued the raging forest
fires in Indonesian Borneo. But in the last few days, new hot spots
and haze have been seen in satellite pictures from central Sumatra.
The haze has drifted over Singapore and more is expected.
	   The center of Sumatra island has been getting below normal
levels of rainfall, Woon Shih Lai, director of the Singapore
Meteorological Service, was quoted as saying in Thursday's issue of
The Straits Times newspaper.
	   He said the hot spot pattern was similar to last year, but
without the extra drying effect of the El Nino weather pattern,
there was hope that the fires would go out more quickly.
	   The ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
are expected to focus their discussions on implementing a regional
action plan to prevent a recurrence of the widespread fires and
thick haze that spread throughout the region last year.
	   ASEAN includes Brunei, Burma, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore,
Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand.

China's central bank welcomes efforts to buy Japanese yen 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China welcomes the move taken by the Japanese and
U.S. governments to intervene in currency markets to sell dollars
for yen, the head of the central bank said Thursday.
	   ``We are glad to see that the exchange rate of the Japanese yen
is picking up,'' Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of
China, said according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency.
	   Speaking at an Asian bankers meeting, Dai reaffirmed that China
won't devalue its currency, the yuan.
	   ``It's unnecessary to do that,'' Xinhua quoted him as saying.
	   World currency markets feared a sliding yen would place further
pressure on regional currencies to depreciate and force China to
adjust its own exchange rate to maintain export competitiveness.
	   In recent days, Chinese state-run media lambasted the rising yen
and the Japanese government's inability to strengthen its currency.
	   Some mainland Chinese economists also blamed the United States
and Europe for not doing more to support Japan's currency, saying
Asia was on the verge of entering a new phase of financial crisis.
	   ``The Asian financial situation is very grim,'' the Communist
Party newspaper, the People's Daily, said in a commentary Thursday.
	   The newspaper, which has its published opinions approved by the
Chinese leadership, warned that the sliding yen has become the
``root of instability in the current international economy, which
may lead to a new financial crisis.''
	   It said joint action to support the yen was necessary to prevent
pressure on the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese economies.
	   ``The Japanese government should shoulder international
responsibility, and Western industrialized countries and other
international organizations should coordinate to prevent the global
economy from falling into a new crisis,'' the People's Daily said.

Japan's Parliament goes into recess ahead of July election 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Parliament held its last session Thursday
before going into recess for upper house elections scheduled next
month.
	   One of the last legislative acts of the 142nd Parliament was
Wednesday's passage of a 16.6 trillion yen (dlrs 122 billion)
economic stimulus package, designed to revive Japan's
recession-bound economy.
	   Polls show the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's popularity is
lagging, suggesting opposition parties may provide it with a stiff
challenge in the upcoming elections, set for July 12.
	   The LDP, which maintains a majority in the more powerful lower
house, is nevertheless hoping to regain control of the upper house
as well.
	   Candidates will be vying for 126 seats, half the chamber's total
number.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Au Pair Louise Woodward arrived at Heathrow
Airport early Thursday from Boston with a manslaughter conviction
and a temporary injunction barring her from spending any money she
might earn selling her story about the killing of a baby in her
care.
	   It was the first time she had set foot on her native British
soil since leaving for the United States in July 1996 to work as an
au pair.
	   The British Airways flight 212 touched down at 4:36 a.m. (0336
GMT) and Ms. Woodward was expected to take a connecting flight to
Manchester Airport, where she was scheduled to hold a press
conference with her father, her lawyer and her local member of
Parliament.
	   Ms. Woodward sat at the very front of the first class section of
the jumbo jet, next to British Airways Chairman Sir Colin Marshall,
who confirmed to reporters that the airline had paid for a
Massachusetts state trooper to travel with the Woodwards.
	   Reporters in the first class cabin reported that at the
beginning of the flight Ms. Woodward watched news footage of
herself on the video screen in front of her seat, but that she did
not plug in the headphones.
	   Attempts by reporters to approach the first class cabin to talk
to her were thwarted by flight attendants and reporters said Ms.
Woodward's father, seated behind his daughter, stood up and to
protect her when he thought a reporter getting out of his seat was
going to move toward her.
	   ``Leave my daughter alone,'' he reportedly said to the reporter.
	   She was met by airport officials and police and went through the
normal passport and customs channels, but was taken through a side
entrance before the main arrivals area, where more than 50
photographers, reporters and cameramen were waiting.
	   Ms. Woodward, wearing a black overcoat and looking weary but
composed, was later seen being driven off in a waiting car.

Australia's Downer: Rise of protectionism a global phenomenon 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The rise of Pauline Hanson's
anti-immigration, protectionist One Nation party was part of a
worldwide backlash against the effects of globalization, Australian
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Thursday.
	   ``The Hanson phenomenon in Australia is part of a fairly global
phenomenon where at least a percentage of the population in most
societies feel uncomfortable with the process of globalization,''
Downer said in an interview with CNN.
	   In its first electoral test, One Nation attracted around 23
percent of the vote in a June 13 election in Queensland state,
after campaigning on policies to halt immigration, limit foreign
investment, raise industry protection and drastically cut welfare
spending.
	   Business leaders in Australia and some parts of Asia have
expressed concern that Hanson's isolationist and anti-Asian
immigration views will harm foreign investment.
	   Recent opinion polls have put Hanson's support nationally in
double figures, and Prime Minister John Howard's conservative
coalition government has included direct appeals to One Nation
supporters in its campaign for an upcoming federal election.
	   ``We have to be part of the globalized economy, continue the
process of economic reform in Australia, make sure that we have
competitive markets and that we repudiate protectionism and that we
encourage free flows of foreign investment,'' Downer told CNN's
International Business Asia program.
	   One Nation's success showed governments had to do more to
explain the benefits of foreign investment and trade
liberalization, Downer said.

China issues order regulating state enterprise reform 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's reforms of its struggling state
industrial sector must follow economic rules and try to avoid
harming workers, according to a government order reported by state
news media on Thursday.
	   ``The government should respect the will of enterprises and
avoid forced mergers,'' said the circular issued by the State
Economic and Trade Commission, according to the China Daily.
	   Small state enterprises introducing a shareholding system must
not force their staff to purchase shares, but at the same time
shares should not be concentrated in the hands of a few, it said.
	   The circular also required all companies that have laid off
workers to set up retraining centers.
	   It also said the country is well-prepared to bail out most of
its debt-ridden state enterprises within the three-year deadline
already set by Premier Zhu Rongji, the China Daily reported.
	   The order said the focus would be on textile, coal and defense
industries, singling out defense as an area where transformation to
a market economy should be speeded up.
	   The government has said about 40 percent of state enterprises
are losing money.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Au Pair Louise Woodward arrived at Heathrow
Airport early Thursday from Boston with a manslaughter conviction
and a temporary injunction barring her from spending any money she
might earn selling her story about the killing of a baby in her
care.
	   It was the first time she had set foot on her native British
soil since leaving for the United States in July 1996 to work as an
au pair.
	   The British Airways flight 212 touched down at 4:36 a.m. (0336
GMT). Ms. Woodward was expected to take a connecting flight to
Manchester Airport, where she was scheduled to hold a press
conference with her father, her lawyer and her local member of
Parliament.
	   But officials escorting her changed their plans at the last
minute and decided to drive. A spokeswoman for Manchester Airport,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said Ms. Woodward was
driving to Manchester Airport because she could not get a seat on
the shuttle flight, which was fully-booked.

Ruling party opens assembly with attack on speculators 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with second speech on nepotism, cronyism.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ruling party opened its
annual convention Thursday by accusing foreign currency speculators
of pushing the nation into a perilous slide toward recession.
	   ``Our economy has been rattled because of attacks from
outsiders. Our currency has slid because of attacks from foreign
currency speculators,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in
an opening speech at the general assembly of the United Malays
National Organization.
	   Nearly 2,000 delegates from around the country have gathered for
the four-day convention of the massive party with some 2.7 million
members.
	   Anwar, who is vice president of the party and also the nation's
finance minister, was in effect giving his support to Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's controversial stance that foreigners
were to blame for Malaysia's economic woes.
	   Anwar, in a traditional Malay shirt and songkok cap, said
Malaysia was facing its ``most critical test'' since independence
from Britain in 1957.
	   Political observers had wondered whether Anwar, often at odds
with Mahathir over the proper path to economic recovery, would
rally behind the prime minister at the convention.
	   ``UMNO must unite as one front under our leadership headed by
our prime minister,'' said Anwar, in a ringing endorsement for
Mahathir.
	   He called on the party delegates to ignore foreign media reports
noting wide leadership differences between him and Mahathir, who is
scheduled to address the assembly Friday.
	   But another fault line appeared to deepen, when the UMNO Youth
leader ignored Mahathir's warnings not to raise controversies and
spoke about corruption, nepotism and cronyism, issues that could
embarrass UMNO's leadership.
	   ``Nepotism will bring Malaysia to its knees,'' Ahmad Zahid
Hamidi, head of the UNNO Youth wing, said in his speech. If
nepotism and cronyism continued, he said, ``UMNO's effectiveness
and leadership will no longer provide the people confidence.''
	   It is rare at UMNO meetings for members to criticize the
government leadership directly, but Zahid's statements could be
seen as veiled criticism of Mahathir.
	   Zahid had earlier threatened to release instances of nepotism
and cronyism among UMNO leaders. But he appeared to have diluted
his stand.
	   ``We have no intention to topple the leadership,'' said Zahid.
He described Mokhzani Mahathir, one of the prime minister's sons
and treasurer of UMNO Youth, as ``our bridge to the leadership.''
	   Zahid made no direct reference to a recent deal by the state-run
oil and gas company Petronas to buy the shipping assets of
Konsortium Perkapalan Bhd., effectively bailing out the company
controlled by Mahathir's son, Mirzan.
	   Zahid also declined to discuss Muhammad Taib, formerly one of
five UMNO vice presidents just charged with corruption for failing
to declare assets that included real estate overseas. Two of Taib's
former aides were subsequently charged with misusing their office
to influence a real estate deal.
	   Toeing the Mahathir line, Anwar said foreign currency
speculators were to blame for the more than 35 percent decline in
value of the ringgit since the Asian currency crisis began in
Thailand last July.
	   ``Currency speculators should not be allowed to act according to
whims to gain profits without taking into consideration the effects
they have on other countries, especially the misery faced by the
people due to their greed,'' he said.
	   Anwar, who has previously called on the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund to establish an international system
that would monitor the activities of foreign exchange traders,
repeated his demand.
	   ``The international community needs to realize the problems we
face and work to introduce reforms so that resources can be better
controlled,'' he said.
	   Anwar conceded Malaysia's own financial system was in need of
repair and greater transparency.
	   Malaysia's economy shrank by 1.8 percent in the first quarter of
1998, compared with 6.9 percent growth last year.
	   Anwar said the government may increase fiscal spending by up to
7 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.8 billion).

Vietnamese media reminded to follow right track 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Vietnamese media were cautioned
Thursday against criticizing the communist leadership or backing
capitalist viewpoints in articles against corruption.
	   The People's Army daily newspaper, in an article reflecting
conservative thinking, claimed that some fellow publications had
used freedom to criticize corruption as a cover to attack the
country's rulers and communism.
	   The paper accused the critics of being opportunists and said
that the Vietnamese media's role is to propagate Marxism-Leninism
and explain party and government policies to the people.
	   ``The media must not be indulged to just expose the mistakes of
cadres and organizations,'' the paper said.
	   ``What is dangerous is that some media organizations cover the
scandals without comment and solutions, thus creating suspicion and
lack of confidence of people in the party,'' it said.
	   Vietnam has more than 500 publications, television and radio
stations, all under state control. But control has been relaxed
somewhat over the past decade since the government started opening
up the economy.
	   The media have been encouraged to expose corruption and other
``negative phenomenon,'' but some newspapers have also started to
carry what are seen as too many sensational and crime stories in an
effort to raise readership.

Philippine stocks rise sharply on stronger yen; peso gains 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks soared Thursday,
ending seven days of losses after joint U.S.-Japanese market
intervention reversed the yen's prolonged slide.
	   The peso also rose in morning trading along with other regional
currencies following the yen's rebound.
	   Preliminary data showed the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index rising a whopping 112.41 points, or 6.6 percent, to 1,828.59,
in its heftiest gain in four months.
	   On Wednesday, the index sank 10.37 points in its seventh
straight session of weakness. The string of losses, attributed by
traders to the weakness in Asian currencies sparked by the yen's
fall, shaved a total of 241.58 points, or 12 percent, off the main
index.
	   Traders said the decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve, on behalf
of the Bank of Japan and the U.S. Treasury, to address the yen's
decline by selling U.S. dollars overnight renewed investor
confidence in Asian stock markets.
	   Traders hailed the Fed's move as timely and a great strategy.
	   ``It's not everyday that the Fed intervenes,'' said Ian Kane,
trader for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc.
	   Kane said he expects further upticks in the market during the
next two to three trading days.
	   Beyond that, however, the market may resume its downturn as
inherent problems in the region remain, traders said.
	   ``Enjoy it (the rally) while it lasts,'' said Mitzi de Dios,
trader for ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett Securities Philippines Inc. ``Asia
is still viewed as one region by foreign investors, so we are still
at the mercy of the yen and how the rest of the region performs,''
she said.
	   De Dios said the problem doesn't end with the Fed intervention.
Japan still needs to do something about its economy, which is
saddled with a debilitating recession, she said.
	   ``The recession can't be reversed immediately. What Japan can do
now is to start injecting reforms to prop up its economy,'' she
said.
	   Fears of more bad loans as the peso weakens and the Philippine
economy slows down are also weighing on Manila shares, particularly
bank stocks, Kane said.
	   The latest to signify its plan to seek debt relief is flag
carrier Philippine Airlines, which is burdened with heavy losses
and a dlrs 2 billion debt.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 40.342 pesos at midday,
down from 41.717 pesos on Wednesday.
	   Early transactions saw the dollar reach a low of 39.800 pesos,
but the U.S. currency then moved higher.
	   The cheaper yen was widely seen as threatening the recovery of
still struggling Asian economies by undercutting their products in
world markets.
	   Analysts feared that a continued decline in the yen might spark
a new round of currency devaluations in the rest of Asia, throwing
the region back into financial turmoil.

Ruling party to propose no-contest vote for top posts 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Malaysia-Politics
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ruling party will put
forward a motion of no-contest for the party's two top posts, the
state-run news agency reported Thursday.
	   If the motion were to pass, it could in effect secure the
political positions of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his
deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Bernama reported that delegates to the United Malays National
Organization from the state of Selangor will present the motion at
the meeting Friday. The four-day general assembly opened Thursday.
	   The delegates will argue that a political battle for the party
leadership would further weaken the unstable economy.
	   ``UMNO should show example of limiting political problems in
facing the economic turmoil and to safeguard political stability,''
said Selangor chief minister Abu Hasan Omar.
	   The motion will state that there shouldn't be any contests for
the posts of party president and deputy president during next
year's general assembly. Under the party's constitution, party
polls for the posts can be conducted every two years, and the next
poll is scheduled for 1999.
	   Mahathir is currently the UMNO president, with Anwar also his
deputy in the party. Following tradition, the party president and
deputy would again be voted in as prime minister and deputy after
general elections in 2000, assuming that UMNO won a majority of
seats in Parliament.
	   Part of the coalition that has ruled since independence in 1957,
UMNO has 2.9 million members and no doubt will maintain its
majority in 2000.
	   Mahathir told the Far Eastern Economic Review magazine, which
appeared on newsstands Thursday, that he didn't want a no-contest
motion raised at this year's annual convention.
	   ``I don't want them to pass such a resolution because it means
I'm trying to perpetuate myself,'' said Mahathir. ``If anyone wants
to challenge me, he can ... but I don't think anyone will ... much
to the disappointment of a lot of people.''
	   Some political observers say Mahathir may not want the
no-contest motion raised because it could fail, embarrassing him
and opening up the possibility for challenge.

Philippines posts current account surplus 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Declining imports helped the
Philippines post a current account surplus in the first two months
of this year, a turnaround from the sizable deficit registered a
year earlier, the government said Thursday.
	   The surplus in the current account _ a broad measure of
financial flows from trade, tourism, and other services _ totaled
dlrs 131 million in the two months compared to a deficit of dlrs
437 million in the year earlier period, the central bank said.
	   The surplus represents far better performance than the
government's dlrs 241 million deficit projection for the period
under a two-year, dlrs 1.4 billion standby loan arrangement with
the International Monetary Fund.
	   The country's trade deficit has been declining since October
1997 on a year-on-year basis mainly due to a slowdown in imports
caused by the weak peso.
	   The peso has fallen 34 percent since last July, when the Asian
currency crisis began.
	   While lower trade deficits are generally welcomed, analysts warn
the lower imports are a sign of a slowing economy.

Death toll from cyclone climbs to 1,126 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The official death toll from the June 9
cyclone in western Gujarat state has reached 1,126, the United News
of India agency reported Thursday.
	   Since the storm rushed in from the Arabian Sea and hit land nine
days ago, the toll has been climbing steadily as bodies are pulled
from under debris or float back to shore after having been swept
away by a tidal wave churned by the cyclone.
	   The government was listing another 1,754 people as missing and
feared dead, said the news agency, quoting officials at a cyclone
control room in Gandhinagar, about 750 kilometers (470 miles)
southwest of New Delhi. Aid agencies have said the number of
missing is probably many times that.
	   Most of the missing and dead in Gujarat, the state hardest hit
by the storm, were salt workers, among the poorest and most
vulnerable of Indians.
	   Another nine people were reported killed in the neighboring
state of Rajastan, and 12 were reported dead across the border in
Pakistan.

Hunters pursue bear that mauled jogger to death 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Hunters and border officials were
searching for a bear Thursday that killed a man while he was
jogging in southeastern Finland near the Russian frontier, police
said.
	   A woman sounded the alarm after her 33-year-old husband did not
return home from jogging in the middle of the night in Ruokolahti,
240 kilometers (150 miles) east of Helsinki.
	   Police found tracks of a large bear and a cub leading from the
spot where the man was found mauled to death, said Chief Inspector
Ilkka Poyhia. The bear also attacked the trackers who managed to
escape.
	   ``We are gathering as many men as possible to hunt down the
bear,'' Poyhia said. ``This is a very rare occurrence in Finland,
the first of its kind this century.''
	   Although there are several hundred brown bears in Finland, they
seldom attack humans. Bears are also hunted in season to keep their
numbers down.
	   Police did not name the victim or his wife.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ He comes from a respected family, he's
not afraid to show his emotions and he is widely considered to be
honest.
	   But what would seem like virtues could prove the undoing of
Andres Pastrana, the 44-year-old Conservative Party challenger in
Sunday's two-man runoff for Colombia's presidency.
	   Colombians still recall June 19, 1994, when Pastrana, former
mayor of Bogota, wept on television while admitting defeat in his
first run at the country's highest office.
	   Three days later, Pastrana called a news conference and dropped
a political bombshell that badly wounded the government of the man
who won, Ernesto Samper.
	   That disclosure, in the eyes of many Colombians, only painted
Pastrana a sore loser.
	   Pastrana played a taped phone conversation in which a leading
Cali cartel drug trafficker discussed what turned out to be a dlrs
6 million donation to Samper's campaign, unleashing a political
furor and an investigation that lasted years.
	   After that, Pastrana largely disappeared from public life until
launching his campaign this year.
	   Congress cleared Samper of wrongdoing in 1996, but the
``narco-cassettes'' scandal consumed his administration and
strained ties with the United States, which revoked Samper's visa.
More than a dozen Congress members, a defense minister and an
attorney general were convicted.
	   Pastrana's opponent in Sunday's election, Liberal Party
candidate Horacio Serpa, was interior minister under Samper, whom
he has refused to criticize despite broad popular disenchantment
with the outgoing president.
	   Pastrana harps on the connection, calling Serpa the candidate of
``business as usual.''
	   In Colombia's hierarchy of morals, however, loyalty may have the
edge over honesty.
	   ``What for Serpa scores as a great virtue is the same primitive
morality that makes someone rub people the wrong way for being a
tattletale,'' said political analyst Hernando Gomez Buendia.
	   Pastrana hopes a longing for change will outweigh any
reservations about his character.
	   ``We'll end up voting for the lesser of two evils,'' said
another analyst, Juan Manuel Charry, predicting Pastrana will win.
	   Pastrana must overcome a ruling party political machine that is
getting out the votes despite the baggage of incumbency. Trailing
in pre-election polls, Serpa came back to win more votes than
Pastrana in the May 31 first round of voting.
	   Both candidates are courting the 2.8 million Colombians, nearly
a third of the voters, who chose an independent candidate in round
one.
	   The well-mannered son of the late former President Misael
Pastrana and scion of a well-to-do family, Pastrana has battled
charges that he is the candidate of privilege and out of touch with
poor Colombians.
	   ``Pretty boy, from a gold cradle, that's his image ... and his
disadvantage,'' Gomez said of the photogenic, blue-eyed Pastrana,
who as a long-haired teen-ager walked the streets of Bogota
collecting money for the poor.
	   Serpa, a 55-year-old career public official, stresses his
working-class roots and questions Pastrana's credentials to lead a
country beset by entrenched drug traffickers, a 34-year civil war
with leftist guerrillas, growing paramilitary violence and
spiraling unemployment.
	   Pastrana is backed by business leaders and many prominent
Colombians, including Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel Garcia
Marquez.
	   But many analysts agree that Pastrana, despite his good
intentions and honest profile, is not up to the job.
	   ``He's a light person, in all that implies, for a country that
doesn't necessarily have light problems,'' Gomez said.

South Korea puts 55 companies on liquidation list 
</HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Quickening the pace of its economic
restructuring, South Korea on Thursday announced a list of 55
companies it deems so financially weak they should be liquidated.
	   Although the firms have debts totaling dlrs 12.14 billion, most
are small and analysts viewed the government's action as at best a
first step toward revamping the nation's industries.
	   ``It is a good signal for potential foreign investors because it
shows that South Korea is really determined to reform its
industries,'' said Lee Ji-soon, an economist at Seoul National
University.
	   ``But if you look at the companies, most of them are quite small
and insignificant,`` Lee said. ``I am not sure if it will be enough
to let reluctant foreign investors make a commitment.
	   ``I would call it the first step for future reforms,'' Lee said.
``To earn real trust by foreign investors, South Korea should
continue swift and large-scale reforms of its conglomerates.''
	   The move was the latest in a series of reforms South Korea has
promised to the International Monetary Fund in exchange for a dlrs
58 billion bailout in December.
	   ``This is the beginning of our restructuring efforts. There will
be more follow-up measures, including major deals in which big
companies will swap their subsidiaries to become more
competitive,'' Lee Hun-jae, head of the Financial Supervisory
Commission, told a news conference.
	   Lee's commission, which acts as the government's financial
watchdog, oversaw the compilation of the list by major creditor
banks.
	   ``One of the key functions of the banking sector is to ferret
out unhealthy businesses,'' Lee said. ``But so far, the function
has been absent, resulting in a mass of nonviable companies.''
	   Lee said that creditors banks will force the nonviable companies
to fold at the earliest possible date by halting new loans and
calling in old ones.
	   Lee said that government-controlled commercial banks also would
be asked to withhold loans to major conglomerates unless they swap
key, overlapping industries.
	   He specifically cited automobile manufacturing as one area in
which such a swap is necessary.
	   South Korea's car industry, the world's fifth largest with four
major manufacturers, is in deep trouble with slumping sales at home
and abroad. Samsung's late entry into the car market this year
added to the problem.
	   Local reports said that Samsung, Hyundai and LG are under
government pressure to swap their car, petrochemical and
semiconductor businesses.
	   Bae Chan-byung, head of Commercial Bank of Korea, said that
Thursday's list was made after a month-long survey of 313 heavily
indebted companies.
	   Major companies on the list include the nation's second largest
confectionery, Haitai, which is teetering on the brink of
bankruptcy with at least 1 trillion won (dlrs 715 million) in bank
debts.
	   Also included is Hanil Synthetic Fiber Co., the nation's largest
acrylic fiber maker, whose debts are 1,039 times its assets. Hanil,
with six subsidiaries, is South Korea's 34th largest conglomerate.
	   The nation's top five conglomerates _ Hyundai, Samsung, LG,
Daewoo and SK _ had 20 subsidiaries listed for liquidation, none of
them significant.
	   Banking officials said President Kim Dae-jung approved the list
Wednesday.
	   Kim has been pushing for massive corporate and financial
reforms. He has already shut down 14 merchant banks, and plans to
consolidate other financial institutions as part of his efforts to
regain foreign confidence, which is badly needed to overcome the
country's currency and debt crisis.

Japanese stocks finish sharply higher, dollar tumbles bond prices, details 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar,
AP Photos available
By KOZO MIZOGUCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices finished sharply higher
Thursday, lifted by the yen's dramatic rebound against the U.S.
dollar following Wednesday's joint market intervention by the
United States and Japan.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped 646.16 points, or 4.39
percent, closing the day's trading at 15,361.54 points. On
Wednesday, the Nikkei average shed 5.00 points, or 0.03 percent.
	   The dollar bought 136.38 yen at mid-afternoon, down 5.62 yen
from 142.00 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo but marginally higher than
its late New York rate of 136.37 yen overnight.
	   Traders said fear of more intervention by Japan's central bank
kept the dollar under pressure as investors waited for Saturday's
meeting of Group of Seven finance deputies in Tokyo.
	   A high-level U.S. delegation, including Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, will join other G-7 officials to
discuss economic troubles in Japan and other Asian nations. Summers
was due to arrive later Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto welcomed the effect of the
intervention, telling reporters Thursday morning, ``I'm quite happy
that the market has received (the joint intervention) favorably.''
	   He told President Clinton by telephone Wednesday that his
government would speed efforts to pull Japan out of a deepening
recession.
	   Japan has been under international criticism for not taking
aggressive steps to revive its sinking fortunes. As the world's
second-largest economy, Japan is Asia's dominant presence and is a
vital link in the global economy.
	   The cheaper yen was widely seen as threatening the recovery of
still struggling Asian economies by making their products less
competitive than Japanese exports in world markets.
	   Wednesday's joint intervention, reportedly conducted both in
London and New York foreign exchange markets and estimated at a
combined dlrs 4 billion, helped pushed the dollar down more than 7
percent from eight-year highs hit earlier this week.
	   The United States and Japan agreed to step in to bolster the yen
amid concern a continued fall could spark a new round of currency
devaluations in other Asian nations and escalate the region's
financial turmoil.
	   The dollar had gained 15 yen against the Japanese currency since
the end of April, including 6 yen in the four trading days up to
Monday, when it peaked above 146 yen.
	   Initial reaction Thursday elsewhere in Asia to the intervention
was positive. Hong Kong leader Tung Chee Hwa said in Wellington,
New Zealand, that he was glad to see the yen had rebounded, adding
the key issue for the world economy was for Japan ``to move
forward.''
	   ``We are glad to see that the exchange rate of the Japanese yen
is picking up,'' Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of
China, said according to China's state-run Xinhua News Agency.
	   Responding to recent fears that China could be forced to lower
the value of its own currency, the yuan, in response to the yen's
weakness, Dai reaffirmed that China won't devalue.
	   ``It's unnecessary to do that,'' Xinhua quoted him as saying.
	   On Wall Street overnight, U.S. stocks soared as investors saw
the intervention as a hopeful sign that authorities were acting to
prevent the Asian financial crisis from worsening.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed 162.67 points higher at
8,827.96 on Wednesday, nearly wiping out the rest of Monday's
207-point slide.
	   Stock investors in Tokyo also welcomed the dramatic intervention
as a signal Japan's economic woes may finally have hit bottom.
	   ``The trend of the weakening yen has been checked and a euphoric
mood is prevailing on the market,'' said Yasuo Ueki of Nikko
Securities.
	   Among gainers were shares in banks and trading companies, which
have been sold recently due to those firms' heavy exposure to other
Asian economies.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section leaped 42.00 points, or 3.63 percent, to 1,198.84.
The TOPIX closed up a marginal 0.37 points the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.280 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.240 percent, driving its price down to 111.40 yen from 111.70
yen.

Asian markets rebound, thanks to Japan's stronger yen

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Across East Asia, traders enjoyed something
Thursday they hadn't seen for months: Japan's yen pulling out of
its tailspin with the U.S. dollar, and the region's battered stock
and currency markets recording some big gains.
	   Even China and Hong Kong, two critics of Japan's anemic economy
and the responses of its government, praised Tokyo for intervening
with Washington on behalf of the yen on Wednesday.
	   ``This is exactly the type of thing that should happen,''
Jean-Michel Severino, a senior World Bank official, said, as the
U.S. dollar traded sharply lower against the yen in Tokyo on
Thursday, one day after the United States and Japan jumped into
global currency markets to halt its slide.
	   But others were less optimistic.
	   ``This is definitely not a turning point in the crisis,'' said
Carlton Poon, head of research for Worldsec International Ltd., in
Hong Kong. ``The fundamentals in Asia continue to deteriorate,''
and the markets cannot sustain the gains, he said.
	   A stronger yen could reduce the risk of more East Asian
economies slipping into recession as the one-year anniversary of
the region's financial crisis nears, Severino said.
	   Currency traders estimate that Washington sold dlrs 2 billion to
buy yen and that Tokyo sold a similar amount of dollars.
	   In Tokyo, the dollar bought 136.38 yen in mid-afternoon, down
5.62 yen from 142.00 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo but marginally
higher than its late New York rate of 136.37 yen overnight.
	   Following the lead of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which
posted a 164.17 point gain Wednesday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's
Nikkei Stock Average jumped 646.16 points, 4.39 percent, to close
the day's trading at 15,361.54 points.
	   Shares also were soaring in early trading in Hong Kong, Taiwan,
the Philippines, New Zealand and Australia.
	   In Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia, East Asia's most
troubled economies, the key stock indexes were trading higher by
10.7 percent, 7.1 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively.
	   Across Southeast Asia, currencies opened sharply higher Thursday
as well, following the example of the rallying yen. But the dollar
was recovering slightly as trading progressed.
	   For months, Japan's yen had been sliding against the U.S.
dollar, leading some economists to believe that the East Asian
financial crisis could enter a far more dangerous phase that would
hurt the United States and the rest of the world.
	   On Saturday, Group of Seven finance deputies, including U.S.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, will meet in Tokyo to
discuss the economic problems of Japan and many of its neighbors.
	   In a telephone conversation Wednesday, Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto of Japan told U.S. President Bill Clinton that his
government would speed efforts to pull Japan out of a deepening
recession. But Japan has many other problems, including mountains
of bad loans, rising unemployment, falling consumer spending.
	   The weak yen has made Japanese goods abroad cheaper,
undercutting products from other nations and provoking criticism
that Japan was trying to export its way out of trouble. The
government has unveiled a dlrs 117 billion economic stimulus plan,
but analysts question how much impact it will have.
	   Poon, the official in Hong Kong, said market participants in
Asia are still waiting to see what Japan does beyond the temporary
relief of the currency intervention by Tokyo and Washington.
	   ``Let's hope they can contain the damage in Japan before it gets
to innocent third parties and leads to a global recession,'' Poon
said in an interview.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's deputy prime minister
has obtained a court order against a book he alleges is filled with
lies about him.
	   The court injunction against the book, entitled, ``50 Reasons
Why Anwar Cannot Be Prime Minister,'' came on the eve of the annual
general assembly of the ruling United Malays National Organization.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, also the nation's finance
minister, opened the general assembly Thursday with a speech firmly
backing Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Copies of the book are believed to have been widely circulated
among UMNO delegates, said the national news agency Bernama.
	   Dozens of members of UMNO's youth wing flocked to flip through
one copy circulating at the assembly hall Thursday.
	   ``The first few allegations are really serious,'' said a senior
UMNO council member who asked not to be identified.
	   Journalists were told that police intended to confiscate any
copies of the book found at the assembly hall.
	   Anwar ``will not hesitate to take whatsoever legal action as may
be necessary to protect the dignity of his office and his own self
esteem,'' said a statement from his legal firm.
	   The statement said Anwar was trying to halt further publication
and distribution of the book.
	   Anwar is Mahathir's anointed successor and the most powerful man
in the ruling party after the prime minister.
	   ``Anwar categorically states that the said book contains gross
libel against himself,'' said the statement by the legal firm of
Messrs Faiz and Co.
	   The book is authored by Khalid Jafri, a former editor of a
defunct tabloid newspaper and published by Media Pulau Lagenda.
	   Kairuddin Abu Hassan, an UMNO member who said he co-wrote the
book with Jafri, told reporters that 2,000 copies of the book had
already been distributed.
	   ``I'll keep on distributing until I see the court order in black
and white,'' he said.
	   Anwar has often been a victim of privately-circulated ``poison
pen'' letters alleging abuse of power and sexual misconduct.
	   Another book, published last year, entitled ``Anwar Trapped,''
about alleged sex scandals involving the deputy, was being sold
outside the UMNO assembly hall.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least 14 servicemen were killed and 17 injured
while battling a blaze that engulfed an ammunition storage compound
in the Ural Mountains and set off a series of explosions, a news
agency reported Thursday.
	   Thirteen soldiers and one policeman died, 17 soldiers were
wounded and four were missing, the Interfax news agency said,
citing the Defense Ministry.
	   Firefighting efforts were hampered by the munitions explosions.
Some 240 tons of ammunition and other military equipment were
stored at the compound, including mines, artillery shells and
rockets that belonged to Russian troops withdrawn from East
Germany.
	   An Il-76 airplane from the Emergency Situations Ministry that
can carry 40 tons of water was on standby at the airport in the
regional capital Yekaterinburg, about 1500 kilometers (900 miles)
east of Moscow, but no decision had yet been made to send it into
action, Interfax said.
	   The fire broke out Wednesday afternoon after the military
compound was struck by lightning. By Thursday morning, it had
almost completely destroyed the compound, Interfax said.
	   The blaze has also consumed more than 200 hectares (494 acres)
of forest surrounding the compound, Interfax said.
	   Between 1,500 and 2,500 residents of nearby villages were
evacuated on Wednesday.
	   Blazes at ammunition depots, which are often located in thick
forests, break out frequently in Russia.

India's salt workers: Neglected in life and in death dropped `million.'

<TEXT>
	   BACHAO, India (AP) _ A cyclone swept them into nothingness,
their names unknown and their numbers only a guess. For the
illiterate salt workers of western India, it was a brutally fitting
end to lives of neglect and exploitation.
	   No one may ever know how many salt workers died in the June 9
cyclone because nobody knows for sure how many were there when the
storm struck. Thousands were believed washed into the Arabian Sea.
	   ``No one bothered about these people when they lived, now who
cares once they're dead,'' said Tejabhai Desai of the People
Awareness Group, a local development organization.
	   Women saltworkers sing about their predicament in a Gujarati
folk song: ``Oh mother! Why did you marry me to a salt worker? He
has no sense, if he did he would search for some other work.''
	   Laxmi Bhana married a salt worker, and so became one herself, as
did her two sons and their wives and children. After 35 years,
Bhana's hands are blistered and stiff from raking through sand and
brine; her eyes are failing from gazing into the sun's glare on
mounds of crystal-white salt.
	   Bhana, 57, retired to the family home in Bachao, a village 30
miles (50 kilometers) from the salt pans of Kandla. Last week, her
sons came to tell her that their wives and five children were among
thousands killed when a tidal wave churned by the cyclone hit
Kandla, 330 miles (530 kilometers) northwest of Bombay.
	   Indian officials on Thursday put the official death toll at
1,126 with another 1,754 missing. Aid groups think as many as
14,000 are missing.
	   ``I lost my eyes, my hands and now my family to the sea,'' Bhana
said weeping, slamming salt-encrusted palms against her forehead in
mourning.
	   Before the storm, 20,000 people worked in Kandla's pans,
trapping sea water in the shallow pools, waiting for the moisture
to evaporate then scraping the salt into hills.
	   A week after the storm, there were none in the port town.
	   Whole families scraped salt, but contractors' payrolls listed
the names of only one or two adults _ others weren't counted to
avoid taxes, health claims and child labor laws. Most were migrants
from elsewhere in Gujarat state or as far away as eastern Bihar, a
state so poor that even toiling in the salt pans is a draw for its
residents.
	   ``They find no work in the rural areas so they come here. They
put up their huts and are happy to have found some work,'' Desai
said.
	   Of the 16 million tons of salt India produced last year, 72
percent came from Gujarat. A family could take several days to
collect a ton of salt, for which they would earn about dlrs 3.75.
 &UR; They lived by, pick up 14th graf pvs.

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Hong Kong chief executive Tung
Chee Hwa said Thursday Asia faces economic difficulties ``for a
number of quarters'' to come, but that he expects the region to
rebound ``quite quickly'' once the upturn begins.
	   ``Obviously we are pleased with the rebound of the yen,'' Tung
said, responding to the overnight intervention of the United States
and Japan to boost the ailing Japanese currency.
	   Asian stocks and currencies soared in early trading Thursday,
buoyed by the yen's leap against the dollar after the intervention.
	   Tung also praised the Japanese government's announcement
Wednesday of an economic reform package, which he said was ``a very
serious statement ... outlining the determination with which Japan
is going to tackle reforms.''
	   ``I hope this will be a sustainable effort and the yen should be
stabilized. It will be a good thing for the whole region,'' Tung
told reporters during his only news conference on a two-day visit
to New Zealand.
	   Tung said the stability of the yen is important to Hong Kong,
and ``to every country round the world.
	   ``Let's not underestimate the difficulties that many of the
Asian and (other) communities in this Asia-Pacific region will
face,'' he said. ``It will be difficult for a number of quarters to
come.
	   ``But let's not underestimate our own strengths.''
	   These included very flexible and hardworking labor forces
willing to adopt new ideas, an ``indomitable spirit to succeed,'' a
very high savings rate and a willingness to take on new technology.
	   ``Once our structural weaknesses are adjusted we will be able to
rebound, and rebound rather quickly,'' he said.
	   Tung, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, is in Wellington, where he met Prime
Minister Jenny Shipley and other senior Cabinet ministers.
	   Earlier in the day he welcomed an announcement that New Zealand
had removed visa requirements for travel by Hong Kong residents to
New Zealand.
	   In Australia, meanwhile, senior World Bank official Jean-Michel
Severino said yen intervention was a positive step for the entire
region.
	   ``I think it's a very positive step forward. This is exactly the
type of thing that should happen,'' Severino, the bank's vice
president for the East Asia and Pacific region, told reporters.
	   He said that strengthening the yen would make the risk of
regional recession less likely.

Louise Woodward arrives home mother leaves village home; father calls reporter ``pervert,'' ADDS

By ROBIN ESTRIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Au Pair Louise Woodward arrived back in Britain
early Thursday from Boston with a manslaughter conviction and a
temporary injunction barring her from spending any money from
selling her story about the killing of a baby in her care.
	   The 20-year-old, who left her English village in July 1996 to
work as an au pair, returned home an internationally known figure,
facing a barrage of cameramen as she and her father, Gary Woodward,
were escorted through London's Heathrow airport. Wearing a black
coat, she looked paled and expressionless as she faced the cameras.
	   British Airways paid for a first class ticket on the flight from
Boston for a Massachusetts state trooper to keep away reporters
packing the plane. But plans to fly to Manchester in northern
England were stymied when, airport officials said, the Woodwards
couldn't get seats.
	   They headed to Manchester, 183 miles (293 kms) north of London,
by car, arriving at 8 a.m. (0700 GMT), and scheduled an 8.30 a.m.
(0730 GMT) news conferenc with a lawyer and local member of
Parliament.
	   Susan Woodward left the family's home in Elton, a village 30
miles (50 kms) from Manchester, with a lawyer to meet her daughter
at the airport. Mrs. Woodward, accused by her daughter's fired
lawyer in Boston of skimming a defense fund with a phony
accommodation bill, made no comment as she drove off.
	   BA chairman Sir Colin Marshall, who by coincidence by also on
the BA Flight 212 from Boston, sat next to Ms. Woodward at the very
front.
	   ``I went to say hello before we boarded,'' Marshall said after
the flight touched down at 4:36 a.m. (0336 GMT). He refused to say
if the airline also gave a free ride to the Woodwards.
	   Supporters in Elton, in north England, had yellow ribbons,
banners and welcome-home cakes waiting for her arrival.
	   Residents glad she is coming home also took care to mention the
dead baby, 8-month-old Matthew Eappen, apparently aware of
criticisms of raucous celebrations in the local pub when Louise was
freed from jail in November.
	   Some wondered if she ever would be able to resume a normal life.
	   ``People will always say, `That's Louise Woodward,'' said one
doubtful Elton resident, Thomas Doyle. ``The name is infamous.''
	   Reporters in the first class cabin reported said at the
beginning of the flight Ms. Woodward watched news footage of
herself on the video screen in front of her seat, but did not plug
in the headphones.
	   Woodward, seated behind his daughter, stood up and to protect
her when he thought a reporter was approaching.
	   ``Leave my daughter alone,'' he reportedly said. Sky TV, which
had a reporter in First Class, said he also said, ``You pervert.''
	   Her arrival followed Tuesday's 4-3 ruling by the Massachusetts
high court that a lower court judge acted within his power last
November when he reduced her second-degree murder conviction to
manslaughter and sentenced her to the 279 days she had served since
her arrest.
	   Ms. Woodward had been ordered in November not to leave
Massachusetts while her case was under appeal with the state
Supreme Judicial Court.
	   U.S. officials speeded up the paperwork for her to leave,
returned her passport, and on Wednesday evening she arrived at
Boston's Logan International Airport with a police escort and was
ushered by seven state troopers to a private room before the
flight.
	   Ms. Woodward's 16 months of criminal problems behind her, U.S.
District Judge William Young barred her temporarily from spending
any story sales proceeds and set a trial date of Oct. 5 in a
wrongful death lawsuit against her by the Eappen family.
	   The sales ban could be largely symbolic and legal experts said
any civil judgment would be tough to enforce in Britain.
	   Prosecutors said she killed Matthew by violently shaking him and
slamming his head against a hard surface. Ms. Woodward's attorneys
argued that the baby's brain injuries occurred three weeks before
he was hospitalized on Feb. 4, 1997. He died five days later.

Pope returns this week to face Austria's angry and divided Catholics 
</HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Ten years after a tranquil visit to Austria,
Pope John Paul II will return to a nation of angry and divided
Roman Catholics.
	   The frail, 78-year-old pope leaves Friday on the three-day trip
that will include stops in Salzburg, a center of European culture,
and the capital, Vienna.
	   Since the pope's 1988 visit, Catholics in the Alpine nation have
led a movement demanding the church drop its requirement that
priests be celibate, allow women into the priesthood and give
greater voice to lay Catholics. The ``We are the Church'' movement
gathered a half-million signatures in Austria and spread elsewhere
in Europe and to the United States.
	   The Austrian church also has been rocked by sexual scandal.
Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, accused of sexually molesting young
boys, was forced by the pope in April to relinquish all his duties.
Groer has gone into exile in Germany.
	   Austrian church leaders had been eager to resolve the Groer case
before the pope's visit to avoid potentially embarrassing
demonstrations while John Paul was in the country.
	   ``For the church in Austria, recent years have been times of
great suffering,'' John Paul acknowledged Wednesday, mentioning his
trip during his weekly general audience.
	   ``The pope and the bishop want to help the faithful to overcome
these difficulties,'' John Paul said.
	   Austrian Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn said at a news conference
that the pope's greeting was a positive sign that John Paul wants
``to get the ship moving again.''
	   Schoenborn expressed confidence that the wounds of the church's
crisis will heal, but said scars will remain.
	   John Paul elevated the 53-year-old Schoenborn to cardinal in
February, and the Austrian already had been mentioned as a possible
papal successor.
	   He has taken steps to calm the waters among Catholics, by
Vatican count 77 percent of Austria's eight million people.
	   In an unprecedented act of contrition, Schoenborn apologized and
offered aid to those allegedly molested by his predecessor.
	   The cardinal also invited the leaders of ``We are the Church''
to attend the pope's open-air Mass in Vienna's Heroes' Square on
Sunday. They have accepted, although the group has not ruled out
protests during the visit.
	   The pope is scheduled to beatify three people, including a nun,
Sister Restituta Kafka, who was beheaded by the Nazis in 1943.
Beatification is the last formal step before possible sainthood.
	   John Paul was to return to Rome late Sunday.

Woodward decides on secretive approach 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ Under siege England rugby coach
Clive Woodward unveiled a new policy of secrecy Thursday when he
refused to name a team to play New Zealand on Saturday.
	   Doing away with tradition, Woodward named a 23-man squad and
said he would reveal the starting XV an hour before Saturday's kick
off. Woodward has told the players who will start, but said he
intended keeping his selection policy through to next year's World
Cup.
	   Woodward took the blame for the humiliating record 76-0 loss to
Australia two weeks ago and the tourists have subsequently lost
both games in New Zealand. They face two tests against the world's
strongest test team before a test against 1995 World Cup champion
South Africa.
	   ``This is the way I intend to do things from now on,'' Woodward
said Thursday. ``I learnt a harsh lesson from Australia when I
named the team far too early. I am not trying to be clever or smart
but I caught a very big cold in Australia.''
	   He said reporters would be able to work out the line up because
the team had trained publicly _ a situation he wants to stop.
	   ``Next season, training sessions will be private and if that
means putting up screens around the pitch then that is what we will
do.''
	   Against the All Blacks, British Lions fullback Tim Stimpson is
expected to start on the right wing, opposite Jonah Lomu, while a
new back row of Ben Clarke, Pat Sanderson and Steve Ojomoh is
likely.
	   Other changes from the Brisbane loss are expected with a likely
center combination of Josh Lewsey and Nick Beal, with Matt Perry
reverting to fullback.
	   Six players were dropped from the 22 which lost to Australia:
centers Steve Ravenscroft and Stuart Potter, winger Dominic
Chapman, fly-half Alex King, prop Duncan Bell and flanker Richard
Pool-Jones.
	   Scrum-half Matt Dawson will captain the team after being forced
out of the Australia test because of injury.
	   While many pundits believe New Zealand could break Australia's
points scoring record in Saturday's match, Woodward is expecting an
improved performance.
	   ``It has been a huge challenge since Brisbane but I am confident
we have players who can be very competitive against New Zealand on
Saturday,'' said Woodward. ``I am sure the forwards will have a
considerable physical presence and we will need to be rock solid in
defense.
	   ``There will be no excuses for these players and I do not
believe we will see any repeat of Brisbane.''
	   England squad:
	   Backs: Matt Dawson (captain), Nick Beal, Tom Beim, Scott Benton,
Spencer Brown, Austin Healey, Josh Lewsey, Matt Perry, Tim
Stimpson, Jonny Wilkinson.
	   Forwards: Steve Ojomoh, Gareth Archer, Ben Clarke, Richard
Cockerill, Tony Diprose, Will Green, Phil Greening, Danny Grewcock,
Graham Rowntree, Pat Sanderson, Dave Sims, Ben Sturnham, Phil
Vickery.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A 49-year-old pilot was killed when the KA-50
Black Shark combat helicopter he was flying crashed in northwestern
Russia, according to news agency reports Thursday.
	   The accident occurred Wednesday night near the town of Torzhok,
216 kilometers (135 miles) northwest of Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   The helicopter's main rotor sections were ripped off as the
pilot, Maj. Gen. Boris Vorobyov, was testing the Black Shark at a
very low altitude of 50-70 meters (164-230 feet), the Interfax news
agency said, citing the Defense Ministry.

World Cup: Iran's coach has close U.S. ties 
</HEADLINE>
By ANWAR FARUQI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) - Iran's World Cup coach knows a thing
or two about U.S. soccer. His home is in California, he coached two
U.S. college teams there, and his path has crossed with the present
and previous coaches of the American team.
	   Jalal Talebi will put his knowledge of U.S. soccer to use in the
big game between the United States and Iran in Lyon on Sunday. With
20 years of bad blood between the two countries, that match will be
the most politically charged of the World Cup.
	   ``I will definitely bring what I have learned in the United
States to the match,'' Talebi said. ``I do have a few things up my
sleeve, but I'm not going to say what,'' he added in fluent
English.
	   Talebi, 52, was picked to bring Iran to its first World Cup
appearance in 20 years less than a month ago, when the Iranians
sacked Croatian Tomislav Ivic.
	   In a country where the United States is still denounced as the
``Great Satan'' by its Islamic government, Talebi's U.S. ties
should be suspect. But officials probably turned a blind eye to
Talebi's background because, for the time being, they need his
knowledge.
	   The game with the United States is the one all Iranians want to
win. But Talebi insists it's a game like any other.
	   ``We are playing against the people of the United States, not
the government,'' he said.
	   In the early 1960s, when Iranians were still playing soccer on
dirt grounds and no Iranian had ever played for a foreign club,
Talebi was a young star in demand by several European clubs.
	   ``He was probably the best player in Iran, and the only Iranian
who got offers from clubs in France, Belgium, and Britain,'' said
Amir Yazdjerdi, sports writer of Iran's daily Abrar daily.
	   But Talebi, who became fascinated with soccer at age 7, refused
to leave Iran because he'd fallen in love. He married his wife,
Sira, shortly after turning down the lucrative European offers.
	   Talebi left Iran in 1983 for the United Arab Emirates, where he
coached the national soccer team. But only months later, he decided
to move to the United States.
	   His wife and three sons, Babak, Borzoo and Bardiya, still live
in their Mountainview, California, home. Neither he nor his wife
and sons are U.S. citizens, Talebi said, but have residence
permits.
	   Tens of thousands of Iranians escaped from their country after
the revolution and during the 1980-88 war with Iraq. Talebi insists
his reasons for leaving were not political. He wanted a job in
soccer, and there was no soccer in Iran during the war.
	   Talebi opened a convenience store and a restaurant in
California, but he left both to stick to soccer. In the mid-1980s
he coached at Foothill Junior College and De Anza College in
California, and later worked with Bora Milutinovic, the previous
coach of the U.S. soccer team. He also knows Steve Sampson, the
U.S. team's present coach.
	   More recently, he was coach of the Singapore national team, and
was briefly with the Indonesian team.
	   In a country where every official is closely watched, Talebi
cares little for the strict rules that would get any other Iranian
fired.
	   During news conferences, he shakes hands with women reporters
who come up to him, and looks them in the eye when they talk.
Players and other team officials turn their back or look down when
they talk to women who are not dressed from head-to-foot in the
Islamic fashion.
	   But Talebi apparently doesn't have to play by the rules. For the
time being, his government needs him more than he needs their job.

Gunmen fire on newspaper editor's home 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen fired about 30
shots at the home of a Sri Lankan newspaper editor who has reported
on official corruption, the journalist said Thursday.
	   No one was injured in the attack Wednesday night. Police did not
immediately comment.
	   ``I told the police that I have reasons to believe that very
powerful people are behind the attack as I have been trying to
expose them,'' said Lasantha Wickrematunge, editor-in-chief of the
English language Sunday Leader weekly.
	   The Sunday Leader has reported that the chief executive officer
of Sri Lanka Telecom paid the personal credit card bill of the
Cabinet minister responsible for telecommunications, and questioned
why 51 percent of a state-owned tea company was sold to foreign
investors when Sri Lankan law limits outside ownership to 40
percent.
	   Wickrematunge said he and his wife, Raine, had returned to their
home in Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, after dinner Wednesday. He
heard what sounded like firecrackers, then his servants said they
had seen men firing at his house. The attackers left after firing
about 30 bullets.
	   ``They fired at my two cars and at random at the house,''
Wickrematunge said.
	   Earlier this year, men pointed a gun at the head of another Sri
Lankan journalist who had written about corruption in the military,
saying they wanted to tell him what to write. Two air force
officers are being investigated in that case.

Asian markets rebound, thanks to Japan's stronger yen 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES stock and currency figures; TRIMS
By PRISCILLA CHEUNG
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Across East Asia, traders enjoyed something
Thursday they hadn't seen for months: Japan's yen pulling out of
its tailspin with the U.S. dollar, and the region's battered stock
and currency markets recording some big gains.
	   Even China and Hong Kong, two critics of Japan's anemic economy
and the responses of its government, praised Tokyo for intervening
with Washington on behalf of the yen Wednesday.
	   ``This is exactly the type of thing that should happen,'' said
Jean-Michel Severino, a senior World Bank official, as the U.S.
dollar traded sharply lower against the yen in Tokyo Thursday, one
day after the United States and Japan jumped into global currency
markets to halt the yen's slide.
	   But others were less optimistic.
	   ``This is definitely not a turning point in the crisis,'' said
Carlton Poon, head of research for Worldsec International Ltd., in
Hong Kong. ``The fundamentals in Asia continue to deteriorate,''
and the markets cannot sustain the gains, he said.
	   A stronger yen could reduce the risk of more East Asian
economies slipping into recession as the one-year anniversary of
the region's financial crisis nears, Severino said.
	   Currency traders estimate that Washington sold dlrs 2 billion to
buy yen and that Tokyo sold a similar amount.
	   In Tokyo, the dollar bought 136.38 yen in midafternoon, down
5.62 yen from 142.00 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo but marginally
higher than its late New York rate of 136.37 yen overnight.
	   Following the lead of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which
gained 164.17 points Wednesday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei
Stock Average jumped 646.16 points, or 4.39 percent, closing at
15,361.54 points.
	   Shares also soared on other markets in the region.
	   In South Korea, the key index climbed 7.1 percent, closing at
325.49 points.
	   Taiwan's key Weighted Price Index jumped 4 percent to 7,768.31
points.
	   New Zealand's key NZSE-40 capital index closed up 1.6 percent at
2,031.96 points, and Australia's All Ordinaries Share Index jumped
2.3 percent, closing at 2,031.96 points.
	   In Thailand, the Stock Exchange of Thailand index jumped 10.7
percent in early trading.
	   Indonesia's key JSX Composite Index closed morning trading 3.7
percent higher at 435.010 points, and Malaysia's Composite Index
was 7 percent higher at 482.61 points at midday.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index jumped 7.8 percent
to 8,627.51 points at midday as interbank interest rates eased.
	   After hitting a 9 1/2-year low earlier this week, Singapore's
Straits Times Industrials Index was up 4.3 percent to 1,155.95 at
midday.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 6.6 percent to 1,828.59
at midday, its heftiest gain in four months.
	   Across Southeast Asia, currencies opened sharply higher Thursday
as well, following the rallying yen. But the dollar was recovering
slightly as trading progressed, with traders citing the region's
political uncertainties as reasons to buy the safe-haven U.S.
currency.
	   In midafternoon, the Malaysian ringgit was trading at 3.9300 to
the U.S. dollar, up from 4.0650 late Wednesday.
	   Against Thailand's baht, the U.S. dollar was at 41.60 baht, down
from 43.1250 late Wednesday in Asia.
	   Against Singapore's dollar, the U.S. dollar was at 1.6610, down
from 1.7190 late Wednesday.
	   The U.S. dollar climbed from its early low against the
Indonesian rupiah as rumors circulated of mass anti-government
protests planned for Saturday.
	   The dollar was quoted at 16,050 rupiah in early afternoon, up
from an early morning low of 15,300.
	   For months, Japan's yen had been sliding against the U.S.
dollar, leading some economists to believe that the East Asian
financial crisis could enter a far more dangerous phase that would
hurt the United States and the rest of the world.
	   On Saturday, Group of Seven finance deputies, including U.S.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, will meet in Tokyo to
discuss the economic problems of Japan and many of its neighbors.
	   In a telephone conversation Wednesday, Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto of Japan told U.S. President Bill Clinton that his
government would speed efforts to pull Japan out of a deepening
recession. But Japan has many other problems, including mountains
of bad loans, rising unemployment and falling consumer spending.
	   The weak yen has made Japanese goods abroad cheaper,
undercutting products from other nations and provoking criticism
that Japan was trying to export its way out of trouble.

Fed up with Indonesian protests, activists take to the streets 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ It was a protest against all the
protests.
	   Holding aloft banners, about 70 people rallied outside the
Defense Ministry in Jakarta Thursday to complain about a swell of
demonstrations in recent weeks.
	   ``There are so many protests and we're all fed up. We have to
stop this,'' said Andi Chandra Nam, a protest organizer.
	   Rallies with a range of causes have flourished since
authoritarian President Suharto quit last month, his authority
shaken by riots and student protests. Police say an average of 16
mostly peaceful protests are now held daily in the capital.
	   The anti-protest demonstrators said they support new President
B.J. Habibie's agenda of democratic reform. However, they appealed
to the military to put an end to the public clamor. They did not
suggest how.
	   Their message was lost on several dozen chanting activists
outside the headquarters of the central bank, a block down the
road. They accused Bank Indonesia of giving loans to insolvent
banks while ignoring poor people during Indonesia's year-old
economic crisis.
	   Chandra, who showed up with fellow protesters in a bus, saw no
irony in their demonstration.
	   ``We're not protesting,'' he said. ``We're just asking the
military to take stern measures to return calm to the society.''

Swiss central bank: no negotiations on out-of-court Holocaust settlement 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Switzerland's central bank is resolved to oppose
``vigorously'' any class-action suit filed against it in the United
States, bank vice president Jean-Pierre Roth said Thursday.
	   ``We shall not enter into negotiations concerning an
out-of-court settlement,'' Roth told a news conference in Geneva.
	   Roth conceded that the Swiss National Bank ``misjudged the
political and moral implications of its actions during the war.''
	   In a report released last month, a panel of independent
historians examining Switzerland's wartime past criticized Swiss
officials for following the path of ``the least effort.''
	   It said SNB directors from 1941 were ``increasingly aware that
Jews and other persecuted groups were being robbed.''
	   The report said Nazi Germany sent to Switzerland at least 119.5
kilograms (263.4 pounds) of gold taken from Holocaust victims in
concentration camps.
	   During the war, Switzerland needed increasing amounts of gold in
the face of ever greater demand for the Swiss franc, the only
internationally acceptable currency on the European continent.
	   The panel said it had no evidence that the central bank knew of
the source of the ``victim gold,'' which was shipped in standard
bars.
	   ``We regret most profoundly that the National Bank became
involved in the horrors of the Holocaust in this way by the
confusions of the war,'' Roth said.
	   The memory of the Holocaust imposes a duty of ``solidarity with
all persons still suffering from the aftereffects of the crimes
perpetrated by the National Socialist regime,'' he added.
	   He pointed to the SNB's ``appropriate'' 100 million Swiss franc
(dlrs 69 million) contribution to a fund set up to aid needy
Holocaust survivors.
	   But, Roth said, ``we hold the view that it is not a matter for a
court in the United States to pass judgment on the monetary policy
conducted by the Swiss National Bank, the central bank of a
sovereign state.''
	   ``We therefore deny the jurisdiction of the American courts in
this matter and are resolved to oppose any such action
vigorously,'' Roth continued.
	   Switzerland's three biggest commercial banks, Jewish
organizations and lawyers for class-action claimants are currently
involved in negotiations on a global settlement of claims by
Holocaust victims.

Ruling party opens assembly with attack on speculators 
</HEADLINE>

By ALVIN UNG
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ruling party opened its
annual convention Thursday by accusing foreign currency speculators
of pushing the nation into a perilous slide toward recession.
	   ``Our economy has been rattled because of attacks from
outsiders. Our currency has slid because of attacks from foreign
currency speculators,'' Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in
an opening speech at the general assembly of the United Malays
National Organization.
	   Nearly 2,000 delegates from around the country have gathered for
the four-day convention of the party of some 2.7 million members.
	   Anwar, who is vice president of the party and also the nation's
finance minister, was in effect giving his support to Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's stance that foreigners were to blame
for Malaysia's economic woes.
	   Anwar, in a traditional Malay shirt and songkok cap, said
Malaysia was facing its ``most critical test'' since independence
from Britain in 1957.
	   Political observers had wondered whether Anwar, often at odds
with Mahathir over the proper path to economic recovery, would
rally behind the prime minister at the convention.
	   ``UMNO must unite as one front under our leadership headed by
our prime minister,'' said Anwar, in a ringing endorsement for
Mahathir.
	   He called on the party delegates to ignore foreign media reports
noting wide leadership differences between him and Mahathir, who is
scheduled to address the assembly Friday.
	   But another fault line appeared to deepen when the UMNO youth
leader ignored Mahathir's warnings not to raise controversies and
spoke about corruption, nepotism and cronyism, issues that could
embarrass UMNO's leadership.
	   ``Nepotism will bring Malaysia to its knees,'' Ahmad Zahid
Hamidi, head of the UNNO Youth wing, said in his speech. If
nepotism and cronyism continue, he said, ``UMNO's effectiveness and
leadership will no longer provide the people confidence.''
	   It is rare at UMNO meetings for members to criticize the
government leadership directly, but Zahid's statements could be
seen as veiled criticism of Mahathir.
	   Zahid had earlier threatened to release instances of nepotism
and cronyism among UMNO leaders. But he appeared to have diluted
his stand.
	   ``We have no intention to topple the leadership,'' said Zahid.
He described Mokhzani Mahathir, one of the prime minister's sons
and treasurer of UMNO Youth, as ``our bridge to the leadership.''
	   Zahid made no direct reference to a recent deal by the state-run
oil and gas company Petronas to bail out a company owned by one of
Mahathir's sons.
	   He also declined to mention Muhammad Taib, formerly one of five
UMNO vice presidents, just charged with corruption for failing to
declare assets that included real estate overseas. Two of Taib's
former aides were subsequently charged with misusing their office
to influence a real estate deal.
	   Toeing the Mahathir line, Anwar said foreign currency
speculators were to blame for the more than 35 percent devaluation
of the ringgit since the Asian currency crisis was sparked in
Thailand last July.
	   Anwar, who has previously called on the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund to establish an international system
that would monitor the activities of foreign exchange traders,
repeated his demand.
	   ``The international community needs to realize the problems we
face and work to introduce reforms so that resources can be better
controlled,'' he said.
	   Anwar conceded Malaysia's own financial system was in need of
repair and greater transparency. Its economy shrank by 1.8 percent
in the first quarter of 1998, compared with 6.9 percent growth last
year.
	   Anwar said the government may increase fiscal spending by up to
7 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.8 billion). Malaysian stocks rose sharply
after he spoke, with the benchmark index on the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange up 7 percent.
	   ``The government's doing its bit to preserve the economy,'' said
Joanne Song, an economist at PhileoAllied Securities in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   However, she added that Anwar's announcement was
``overshadowed'' by the U.S. decision to sell dollars to help
Japan's ailing yen, a move that boosted financial markets
throughout Asia.

Tourist numbers to Australia continue to plummet, statistician says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia is still suffering sharp
falls in the number of tourists from Asia, with latest figures
Thursday showing an almost 80 percent slump in visitors from South
Korea.
	   The overall number of visitors from Southeast Asia fell by
almost 20 percent in May from the same month last year, and from
Northeast Asia by more than 11 percent in the same period, the
official Australia Bureau of Statistics reported.
	   In addition to a 78 percent fall in visitor numbers from Korea,
figures for Thailand were down almost 60 percent, from Malaysia
down 36 percent and Indonesia down 23 percent.
	   But there was some good news, with a 2.2 percent rise in the
number of visitors from Japan, Australia's biggest tourist source,
the bureau said.
	   And the number of visitors from Britain and the United States
have both risen.
	   Overall, visitor numbers were about 5,000 lower in May this year
than in May 1997, bureau said.
	   The Australian government has announced marketing campaigns it
hopes will attract more tourists from Europe and the United States.

Report: Selig will become baseball commissioner 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bud Selig will drop the ``interim'' from in
front of his job title and officially take over as baseball
commissioner this year, The New York Times reported Thursday.
	   The announcement could be made by the All-Star Game, scheduled
July 7, the newspaper reported, quoting unidentified sources. One
owner, the newspaper said, predicted the announcement would be made
in 2-4 weeks.
	   Selig, 63, the Milwaukee Brewers owner, has been interim
commissioner for six years.
	   The newspaper quoted one official as saying ``an almost unified
ownership came to him and said you've got to do it; you're the only
one.'' That reportedly swayed Selig, who has said he didn't want
the job.
	   Election requires a 75 percent vote of baseball's 30 owners and,
according to the newspaper, Selig has the backing. Only a few
owners oppose Selig, notably Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White
Sox and The Tribune Co., owner of the Chicago Cubs.
	   Selig was in Houston on Wednesday for a news conference
involving the Astros and wasn't available for comment.
	   Rich Levin, a spokesman for baseball, told USA Today that Selig
``has accepted nothing. There are no meetings scheduled.''
	   Baseball has been without a commissioner since Fay Vincent was
forced out of office by the owners on Sept. 7, 1992. Selig was
named chairman of the executive council two days later.
	   The Times said Selig would likely put his share of the Brewers
into a trust. Selig's daughter runs the day-to-day operation of the
club.

Party youth leader denies questioning policy 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Malaysia-Politics
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The governing party youth leader
said Thursday his campaign to discuss corruption and nepotism at
the party convention was not aimed at challenging government
policy.
	   Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who had threatened to list instances of
corruption among members of the United Malays National Organization
Party, on Thursday refused to give names.
	   But Zahid, who is UMNO youth wing chief, a position seen as a
stepping-stone to more powerful offices, made a weaker and general
criticism of the party's leadership.
	   ``Nepotism will bring Malaysia to its knees,'' he said.
	   Zahid said Malaysia's affirmative action policy favoring Malays
over ethnic Chinese and Indian citizens in jobs and business
opportunities had been misused to favor relatives and friends of
powerful leaders.
	   ``I want to explain that nepotism and cronyism refer to the
practice or act of favoring relatives and friends that has now
exceeded racial and religious limits,'' he said.
	   He demanded new laws be enacted to prevent lucrative government
contracts from being reserved for favorites of the Malay leaders.
	   ``It is here that we demand that the practice of favoritism,
giving priority to family and relatives, be stopped,'' he said.
	   Malaysia's opposition has often accused Mahathir of tweaking
policy to favor his businessmen sons and friends. But rarely has
such criticism come from within the party.
	   Mahathir has repeatedly denied allegations that a government-run
company had bailed out a failing company owned by one of his sons.

Lenin's niece pleads for workers' help 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin's niece has turned
to Russia's workers to try to raise more than dlrs 100,000 to fight
off attempts to evict her from her home, a Moscow newspaper
reported Thursday.
	   In a letter to a steel factory still bearing her famous uncle's
name, Olga Ulyanova wrote that her family could be left homeless in
a dispute with her estranged son-in-law if she can't raise 700,000
rubles (dlrs 112,000), the Moscow Times reported.
	   The V.I. Lenin steel fittings factory in the southern town of
Georgievsk kicked up the appeal to Communist Party top brass and
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.
	   Ulyanova said that her son-in-law was forcing her to buy out his
share of their Moscow apartment, the paper quoted Ulyanova as
saying, citing the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Otherwise, he threatened to kick her and her family out if they
did not pay his share of the apartment expenses, even though he had
not lived in the apartment for four years, Ulyanova said.
	   The V.I. Lenin factory bosses demanded that the Communist Party
``investigate the troubles of the only surviving relative of the
leader of the proletariat, and resolve them honorably,'' the Moscow
Times wrote.
	   A spokeswoman for Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov told
The Associated Press that her office had not received the letter
yet. Zyuganov would not comment on whether he would help Ulyanova,
the spokeswoman said.
	   The Soviet government presented the apartment to Ulyanova in
1988, the Moscow Times said.

	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Au pair Louise Woodward arrived back
in Britain on Thursday, proclaiming her innocence in the death of a
child in her care and saying she hoped the medical community would
take up her case.
	   The 20-year-old au pair was convicted of manslaughter in the
death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen.
	   ``I feel great sorrow for the death of baby Matthew,'' she said.
``But like I've said time and time again, I had nothing to do with
his death.''
	   ``I'm very pleased to be home back on English soil,'' she said.
``And I've really missed the palace. I'd like to thank all the
people who supported me.''

Thai doctors fear one Siamese twin may be sacrificed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai doctors fear they may have to
sacrifice the life of one Siamese twin to save the other in a risky
operation to separate them at the heart, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   Dr. Dusit Sathaporn said the girls' father, Sompume Daensa, who
was described as very poor, has asked that the medical team save at
least one of the girls.
	   The newspaper The Nation cited Dusit as saying that separating
the baby girls could be extremely difficult because the upper
chambers of their hearts share the same wall and they share only
one liver.
	   Dusit, in charge of the case at King Mongkut Hospital in
Bangkok, said that doctors had never successfully separated twins
with connected hearts anywhere, The Nation added.
	   This is his hospital's first such case. Officials were not
immediately available for further comment Thursday.
	   ``We can't predict the chances of the babies' survival, but we
will try our best,'' Dusit was quoted as saying. ``The father asked
us to save only one if we could not save both of them.''
	   The twins were born June 9 in Lop Buri, 115 kilometers (71
miles) north of Bangkok, with a combined birth weight of 5
kilograms (11 pounds) and measuring 45 centimeters (18 inches)
each.
	   They are connected for 12 centimeters (4.8 inches) from above
the chest to the stomach.
	   The babies' hearts beat at nearly double the normal rate and
doctors have to constantly administer medicine to regulate them.
The girls' overworked hearts nearly gave out Monday night.
	   The hospital will assemble a surgical team Friday to assess the
situation and seek advice from other top hospitals. The infants are
currently in intensive care.
	   The Nation said that Sompume was very glad when he learned from
ultrasound results that he was going to have twins, ``but now I am
very sorry for my babies.''
	   Dr. Prawit Tanprasert, director of the hospital, said many
people had donated money for the medical expenses, The Nation
reported.
	   The term Siamese twins was first used with Chang and Eng,
Chinese twins born in 1811 in Thailand, once known as Siam.

Dogged by financial woes, Breedlove cancels '98 speed record attempt 
</HEADLINE>
By SANDRA CHEREB
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   RENO, Nevada (AP) _ Land speed racer Craig Breedlove, still
recovering from the financial crunch of a desert crash two years
ago, said he will not attempt a record run this year in Nevada's
Black Rock Desert.
	   ``The decision basically was made for us,'' Breedlove said
Wednesday from his home in Rio Vista, California. ``We just weren't
able to get enough funding to come up and run.''
	   Breedlove, 61, who over the decades has held five land speed
records, has made it his quest to return the record to the United
States from Britain.
	   The standard has been in British hands since October 1983, when
Richard Noble streaked across the Black Rock Desert 100 miles (160
kilometers) north of Reno at 633.47 mph (1,019.25 kph).
	   Last year, Noble, 51, handed over the keys to Andy Green, his
35-year-old protege from the Royal Air Force. Green topped 700 mph
(1,126 kph) and then, at 763.035 mph (1,227.72), exceeded Mach 1 on
Oct. 15, becoming the first person to officially break the sound
barrier on land.
	   Meanwhile, Breedlove struggled to reach a peak speed of 636 mph
(1,023 kph), barely exceeding Noble's mark of 13 years earlier.
	   In 1996, Breedlove had a series of runs in his Spirit of America
that peaked at 677 mph (1,089 kph) before the desert wind sent his
car careening on its side.
	   The cost of repairing the damage, combined with other mechanical
problems last year, left the team in a financial vise.
	   ``I left the desert last year about dlrs 200,000 in the hole,''
Breedlove said. ``We're still down about dlrs 20,000.''
	   Breedlove said it would take about dlrs 250,000 just to
reassemble his crew and get the car up to snuff, and an equal
amount once they arrive at the playa.
	   He said while sponsors have pledged money once the jet-engined
car reaches the desert, the problem is getting there. And time has
run out.
	   ``We had a cutoff date of June 15,'' he said, adding that it
would take a minimum of 90 days to get the car ready to run.
	   ``We've been just hoping that something would come through and
finally the reality is just there and you have to say, ``Look, it's
not going to happen,''' Breedlove said.
	   ``If next month someone backed in with a dump truck and dumped a
half million dollars in the driveway, it still wouldn't do any good
for this year.''
	   Though disappointed, Breedlove is not giving up and is setting
his sights on 1999.
	   In the meantime, he said he will continue discussions with
sponsors and is working on a marketing and merchandising plan to
raise money.
	   ``As far as the speed of the car, it's absolutely blindingly
fast,'' Breedlove said. ``The car will easily do 800 (1,287 kph),
but we have to get it there.
	   ``I've got my whole life's work in the thing. That's the
disappointing thing. I'm not getting any younger.''

	   Ms. Woodward predicted she eventually would be cleared of
killing Matthew by violently shaking him and slamming his head
against a hard surface.
	   ``I did not hurt Matthew and I did not kill baby Matthew and I
just hope the medical community will take up my case now that all
avenues of appeal are closed,'' she said as she nervously faced a
barrage of cameras, flanked by her parents, her attorney and a
local lawmaker.
	   Ms. Woodward's attorneys have argued that the baby's brain
injuries occurred three weeks before he was hospitalized on Feb. 4,
1997. He died five days later.

	   Ms. Woodward had been ordered in November not to leave

Officials deny Israel carried out nuclear test in Gulf of Aqaba 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Officials denied Thursday that Israel had
carried out a nuclear test in the Gulf of Aqaba, after two Israeli
legislators raised the matter in parliament.
	   Labor lawmaker Rafi Elul said Wednesday that he had heard
``rumors about an Israeli nuclear test'' in the gulf.
	   Democratic Arab Party member Abdul Wahab Darawshe added that he
had information that a neutron bomb test had been carried out on
May 28, causing an earthquake in the region, the Maariv newspaper
said.
	   Darawshe based his claims on a report by Egyptian scientist
Tarik el Nimar that appeared in the Egyptian paper al Bayan, Maariv
said.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Silvan Shalom issued a statement calling
the allegations ``baseless'' and reaffirming Israel's commitment to
the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, Maariv said.
	   Elul did not reveal the source of his information.
	   ``The public has a right to know if Israel is carrying out
nuclear tests which could affect our security,'' Maariv quoted him
as saying. ``If in fact such tests were carried out... this is a
public matter of the first order.''
	   Shai Feldman, head of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies,
said on Israel Radio that it is common after regional earthquakes
for many people, ``especially Egyptians,'' to accuse Israel of
carrying out nuclear tests.
	   ``Time and time again scientific tests have proved these
accusations false,'' he said. ``The factual and logical basis
behind this story is completely fictional.''

North Korean media mostly silent on cattle donation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korean media have covered a rare
visit this week by South Korea's richest man, but mostly kept
silent on his gift of 500 cattle, Seoul officials said Thursday.
	   Chung Ju-yung, 82, founder of the giant Hyundai group, crossed
the border into North Korea with the cattle Tuesday at the truce
village of Panmunjom. Few people are allowed to cross the heavily
guarded border between the two Koreas, still technically at war
after their bloody 1950-53 conflict.
	   The North's overseas news outlet, the Korean Central News
Agency, reported that ``Chung and his party have come with cattle
symbolic of their compatriotic feelings.'' But it did not say how
many cattle were sent.
	   All other North Korean media, meant for domestic consumption,
also reported Chung's eight-day visit but didn't mention the cattle
donation, South Korea's semi-official Naewoe Press said.
	   ``This means that few North Koreans know of Chung's gift of
cattle,'' it said.
	   The cattle were part of a 12 billion won (dlrs 8.5 million) gift
Chung offered in exchange for the visit. He already has shipped
10,000 tons of corn through South Korea's Red Cross.
	   An additional 500 cattle and 40,000 tons of corn are expected to
be sent to North Korea later this month after Chung returns home
from his trip to the reclusive communist country.

Sources: Offer made to restore world championship team AP Basketball Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With an expected lockout just a dozen days away,
a freeze-the-clock proposal that would restore 12 NBA players to
the world championship team is being discussed by the commissioner
and the players' union.
	   The proposal, a moratorium that would resemble a no-strike,
no-lockout pledge, was believed to have been made by the union
after 12 of its members were effectively kicked off the national
team for refusing to commit to playing in the world championships
in Athens, Greece, this summer in the event of a lockout.
	   Seven of the 12 expelled players met by conference call
Wednesday morning as commissioner David Stern, deputy commissioner
Russ Granik, union director Billy Hunter and union president
Patrick Ewing convened at a Manhattan law office for a regularly
scheduled bargaining session.
	   The moratorium was only discussed in broad terms, sources told
the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	   Officials at FIBA, the international federation that runs the
world championships July 27-Aug. 9 and Greek basketball officials
were said to be livid that the NBA's labor situation had robbed the
tournament of its best team.
	   In announcing the removal of the 12 players on Tuesday, USA
Basketball officials said they would field a replacement team
comprised of players from the Continental Basketball Association _
the top minor professional league in the United States _ and
Americans playing professionally overseas.
	   USA Basketball is a separate entity from the NBA, but Granik and
other NBA-affiliated officials have sat on its board since
professional players first started playing men's basketball in the
Olympics in 1992.
	   Players cited that close relationship _ as well as the payment
of USA Basketball licensing revenues to the NBA _ in explaining why
they would refuse to play.
	   Training camp for the team will not open until July 9, and
changes to the 24-man roster are allowed to be made up until 72
hours before the tournament begins.
	   A roster was due to be submitted by the U.S. on Friday, but FIBA
gave USA Basketball an extension until the end of this month.
	   ``This expulsion is premature. It's unfortunate that the league
has taken such a hard line and forced this confrontation,'' said
Bill Duffy, the agent for one of the removed players, Terrell
Brandon of the Milwaukee Bucks. ``All the players can do is react
to the threat of the imposition of a lockout.''
	   After meeting for about three hours, the league and the union
agreed to meet again early next week before Stern departs for the
NBA draft in Vancouver, British Columbia.
	   Little progress has been made toward reaching an agreement to
replace the one that expires at midnight June 30. The NBA has made
two proposals, the players one.
	   The sides are far apart on the issues of a hard salary cap; the
Larry Bird exception, which allows teams to re-sign their own
veteran free agents at any price, a rookie salary scale and a new
drug agreement.
	   A lockout is widely expected to be imposed July 1, shutting down
the league.
	   Without a team of NBA players, the United States would be in
jeopardy of missing the 2000 Olympics.
	   To qualify, the United States must win the world championships
or be among the top four finishers in next year's Americas zone
qualifying tournament.

Police kill pigeon used to smuggle diamonds 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ALEXANDER BAY, South Africa (AP) _ Police shot down a plot to
smuggle diamonds via carrier pigeon, killing the bird as it rested
while transporting the uncut gems.
	   Residents in Alexander Bay, located near the Namibian border and
near several diamond mines, noticed the pigeon Wednesday when it
landed wearing a band of tape around its chest, said police
Superintendent Hendrik Swart.
	   Police shot the bird and found six packets of uncut diamonds
valued at 60,000 rand (dlrs 11,320) taped to its body.
	   ``The bird probably landed because of exhaustion because the
smugglers wound the tape too tight around it,'' Swart said.
	   Swart said it was not known where the pigeon came from.
	   Smugglers have long used carrier pigeons to smuggle diamonds.
Last year, police arrested dozens of people who allegedly used the
birds to smuggle hundreds of uncut diamonds from South Africa's
mines.

U.N. missile experts end search for Iraqi missile warheads 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - A team of U.N. weapons experts left Iraq
Thursday after concluding a month-long search of Iraqi missile
warheads, the top U.N. weapons official in Baghdad said.
	   Nils Carlstrom said 27 arms monitors under German Jean Jano
completed their large-scale excavation at al-Nibai, the site where
Iraq unilaterally destroyed and buried a great number of its
long-range missiles and special warheads.
	   He would not say whether the experts had accounted for all the
missing warheads which Iraq had filled with chemical and biological
agents.
	   The experts, using magnetic and electro-magnetic sensors,
unearthed steel and aluminum canisters Iraqis had filled with toxic
agents. They also dug metal parts belonging to conventional
warheads.
	   The Iraqis say the pieces are enough to reconstruct the 48
special warheads they had before the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait.
	   Calrstrom declined comment on the Iraqi claim.
	   The parts are now assembled in a warehouse in Taji, 20
kilometers (12 miles) north of Baghdad. The United Nations intends
to send another team of experts to analyze the scrap.
	   Work at al-Nibai, 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of Baghdad
began in 1992. The United Nations sent scores of teams to the site
in a bid to prove Iraq's claim that it had destroyed its banned
missiles and warheads.
	   Carlstrom did not say whether more work will be needed at
al-Nibai. He only said: ``We have a lot of work ahead of us in the
coming two months.''
	   Iraq and the United Nations reached an agreement Sunday on a
two-month timetable to bring disarmament activities in the country
to an end. Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler, who ended
his latest Baghdad visit Monday, has said work in the long-range
ballistic missile sphere is about to be completed.
	   He said the dig at al-Nibai will put the warhead issue on the
back burner. But still, he added, Iraq will need to come clean on
missile fuel and domestic production of long-range missiles.
	   U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990
will not be lifted until Baghdad proves it has destroyed all its
illegal weapons.

Louise Woodward proclaims innocence after arriving back in Britain not get fair trial 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
Eds: combines previous, UPDATES with Ms. Woodward saying she did
By ROBIN ESTRIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Au pair Louise Woodward arrived back
in Britain on Thursday, proclaiming her innocence and predicting
her name eventually would be cleared in the death of a child in her
care.
	   The 20-year-old au pair returned to her native country for the
first two in two years, following her manslaughter conviction in
the death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen.
	   ``I feel great sorrow for the death of baby Matthew,'' she said.
``But like I've said time and time again, I had nothing to do with
his death.''
	   ``I'm very pleased to be home back on English soil,'' she said.
``And I've really missed the place. I'd like to thank all the
people who supported me.''
	   A judge has issued a temporary injunction barring Ms. Woodward
from spending any money if she sells her story. But, at a press
conference at the Manchester Airport, she vehemently denied she had
any plans to do so.
	   ``Contrary to any rumors and any speculation that I've heard,
I've not sold my story and, as far as interviews are concerned, I'm
going to be doing an interview with the BBC, for which I'll receive
no payment,'' she said.
	   Ms. Woodward's arrival followed Tuesday's 4-3 ruling by a
Massachusetts high court that a lower court judge acted within his
power last November when he reduced her second-degree murder
conviction to manslaughter and sentenced her to the 279 days she
had served since her arrest.
	   Many of Britain's newspapers, once rabid supporters, began to
turn on Ms. Woodward, with the tabloid Mirror's front-page headline
blaring ``First Class Child Killer,'' a reference to the
first-class British Airways flight that brought her from Boston to
London's Heathrow Airport on Thursday morning.
	   Ms. Woodward said she did not receive a fair trial in the United
States and predicted she eventually would be cleared of killing
Matthew by violently shaking him and slamming his head against a
hard surface.
	   ``I did not hurt Matthew and I did not kill baby Matthew and I
just hope the medical community will take up my case now that all
avenues of appeal are closed,'' she said as she nervously faced a
barrage of cameras, flanked by her parents, her attorney and a
local lawmaker.
	   ``Of course, I am upset I have got a conviction, but it is a
conviction I don't deserve and I think in time the truth will come
out. I think in time I will be cleared,'' she said.
	   Ms. Woodward's attorneys have argued that the baby's brain
injuries occurred three weeks before he was hospitalized on Feb. 4,
1997. He died five days later.
	   Ms. Woodward had been ordered in November not to leave
Massachusetts while her case was under appeal with the state
Supreme Judicial Court. After the high court ruling Tuesday, U.S.
officials speeded up the paperwork for her to leave and returned
her passport.
	   She still faces a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Matthew
Eappen's parents. U.S. District Judge William Young barred her
temporarily from spending any sales proceeds from her story and set
a trial date of Oct. 5 in that suit.
	   The sales ban could be largely symbolic, however, and legal
experts said any civil judgment would be tough to enforce in
Britain.
	   British Airways had paid for a first-class ticket on the flight
from Boston for a Massachusetts state trooper to keep away
reporters packing the plane from Ms. Woodward.
	   Reporters in the first-class cabin said Ms. Woodward watched
news footage of herself on the video screen in front of her seat at
the beginning of her flight, but did not plug in the headphones.
	   At one point, Gary Woodward, seated behind his daughter, stood
up to protect her when he thought a reporter was approaching.
	   ``Leave my daughter alone!'' he reportedly said. Sky TV, which
had a reporter in first class, said he also added, ``You pervert!''
	   Ms. Woodward and her then drove to Manchester, 180 miles (290
kms) north of London, for the news conference.
	   Ms. Woodward was reunited at Manchester Airport with her mother,
Susan. Mrs. Woodward has been accused by her daughter's fired
lawyer in Boston of skimming a defense fund with a phony
accommodation bill.

Britain may not object to Adams visit to Australia, High Commissioner says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Britain may no longer object to
Australia granting a visa to Sinn Fein leader Jerry Adams, British
High Commissioner to Australia Alex Allen said Thursday.
	   Allan told the National Press Club in Canberra that times had
changed since Adams' last attempt to visit Australia, including the
signing of a cease-fire in Ireland.
	   Last year, Australia turned down Adams' visa application because
of criminal convictions related to his membership of the Irish
Republican Army. Adams, head of the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein,
is appealing the decision.
	   ``Circumstances change, and the time when (Adams) was refused a
visa ... was a time when the IRA conducted a bombing campaign in
Northern Ireland, in mainly Britain, in Europe,'' Allan told the
National Press Club.
	   ``Now ... the IRA has a cease-fire. I imagine (the visa) is
something the Australian government would want to consider as and
when a new application is made.''

Serb prison camp boss pleads innocent to war crimes charges

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb accused of running
a squalid detention camp where Muslims and others were tortured and
at least 29 were killed pleaded innocent Thursday to war crimes and
crimes against humanity.
	   At his arraignment before the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal,
Milorad Krnojelac, 57, entered not-guilty pleas to 18 counts of
atrocities. He wore a red and black sweatsuit to the U.N. court and
made no statements.
	   According to his indictment, Krnojelac served as the commander
of the camp in the southeastern Bosnian town of Foca between April
1992 and August 1993.
	   Krnojelac's indictment alleges that he persecuted Muslim and
non-Serb males by subjecting them to ``prolonged and routine
imprisonment and confinement, repeated torture and beatings, (and)
countless killings'' in the prison.
	   Krnojelac faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if
convicted. A trial date was not set Thursday, but judges said the
trial was not expected to begin before mid-September.
	   Krnojelac was arrested Monday in Foca by the NATO-led peace
force and immediately transferred to the tribunal's detention unit
in The Hague.
	   A captain in the former Yugoslav army, Krnojelac is not only
charged on the basis of his personal responsibility, but also for
crimes his subordinates at the camp allegedly committed.
	   The indictment claims that some detainees who were still alive
after the beatings were shot or died of their injuries in solitary
confinement. The beatings and tortures led to at least 29 deaths.
	   The living conditions in the camp, were ``brutal ...
characterized by inhumane treatment, overcrowding, starvation,
forced labor and constant physical and psychological assault,''
according to the indictment.
	   The camp, one of the largest in the former Yugoslavia, housed
more than 760 people at its peak.
	   Most of the detainees were civilians, mainly Muslim men aged 16
to 80. Some were also mentally handicapped, physically disabled and
seriously ill, said the indictment, which was sealed until
Krnojelac's arrest earlier this week.
	   These men were taken to the camp after Foca was seized by Serb
military forces, assisted by paramilitary units.
	   Krnojelac also assisted in the deportation or expulsion of the
majority of Muslim and non-Serb men from the Foca municipality,
according to the charges.
	   The U.N. court has issued 21 public indictments against 60
people, as well as a number of sealed indictments. There are 28
defendants in custody.

Ukraine plans to boost gas production, reduce consumption 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine plans to boost its natural gas
production and bring down gas consumption with the aim of fully
abolishing gas imports, a news agency reported Thursday.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Holubchenko said Ukraine
would bring its gas production to 30 billion cubic meters (1
trillion cubic feet) by 2005 from 18.1 billion cubic meters (633
billion cubic feet) in 1997.
	   At the same time, gas consumption would be reduced by 15 billion
cubic meters (525 billion cubic feet), he said Tuesday at a meeting
in Kiev with representatives of the British Petroleum company,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Holubchenko noted that a gas sector restructuring plan signed by
Ukraine, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in
April would allow the former Soviet republic to produce 40 million
cubic meters (1.4 trillion cubic feet) of gas by 2015.
	   The plan envisages the separation of natural gas production,
transportation and sales from other functions of the state gas
company Ukrgasprom and tender sales of gas, which Holubchenko
called ``one of the serious conditions'' of the restructuring plan.
	   The first two tenders offering 1 billion cubic meters (35
billion cubic feet) of gas would be held at the end of June, with
up to 6 billion cubic meters (210 billion cubic feet) to be sold by
the end of the year. The government plans to sell all its gas
through tenders in 1999, Holubchenko said.
	   In 1997, Ukraine consumed about 80 billion cubic meters (2.8
trillion cubic feet) of gas, of which 32 billion cubic meters (1.12
trillion cubic feet) came as payment for gas transits to Europe,
Interfax said.
	   The country has long sought to diminish its heavy energy
dependence on Russia, fearing that Moscow might use energy exports
as political leverage.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai doctors fear they may have to
sacrifice the life of one Siamese twin girl to save her sister in a
risky operation to separate them at the heart.
	   But Dr. Dusit Staworn said Thursday that ``we still want to save
both of them.''
	   Dusit confirmed newspaper reports that the girls' father,
Sompume Daensa, described as a poor worker in a provincial
hospital, has asked that the medical team save at least one of the
girls.
	   Dusit said the girls' condition was ``not good.'' Separating
them could be extremely difficult because the upper chambers of
their hearts share the same wall and they share only one liver.
	   Dusit, in charge of the case at King Mongkut Hospital in
Bangkok, said that doctors had never successfully separated twins
with connected hearts anywhere, The Nation said.
	   This is his hospital's first such case. Officials said people
were making donations to help pay the expenses.
	   ``We can't predict the chances of the babies' survival, but we
will try our best,'' The Nation quoted Dusit as saying. ``The
father asked us to save only one if we could not save both of
them.''
	   The twins were born June 9 in Lop Buri, 115 kilometers (71
miles) north of Bangkok, with a combined birth weight of 5
kilograms (11 pounds) and measuring 45 centimeters (18 inches)
each.
	   Named Chananthida and Chanyaporn, they are connected for 12
centimeters (4.8 inches) from above the chest to the stomach.
	   The babies' hearts beat at nearly double the normal rate and
doctors have to constantly administer medicine to regulate them.
	   The overworked hearts nearly gave out Monday night and Dusit
said the risk of the girls going into shock was constant.
	   The hospital will assemble a surgical team Friday to assess the
situation and seek advice from other top hospitals. The infants are
currently in intensive care and their poor condition prevents lab
tests and X-rays.
	   Dusit indicated that an operation was not imminent, but said
medical theory holds that Siamese twins should be separated within
two months of birth.
	   The Nation said that Sompume was happy when he learned from
ultrasound results that he was going to have twins, ``but now I am
very sorry for my babies.''
	   Sompume and his wife already have a 5-year-old son.
	   The term Siamese twins was first used with Chang and Eng,
Chinese twins born in 1811 in Thailand, once known as Siam.

Dutch jobless rate drops to 4.2 percent

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Registered unemployment in the
Netherlands dropped to an unadjusted 4.2 percent in the three
months ending May 31, down from 5.6 percent a year ago, the
government said Thursday.
	   The lower rate brings the total number of unemployed people to
an unadjusted 289,000 _ the first time the number of jobless has
dropped below 300,000 since June 1981 _ the Central Bureau for
Statistics said.
	   There were 381,000 people out of work in the same period in
1996, and 318,00 in the three-month period ending April, the agency
said.
	   Adjusted for seasonal influences, the jobless rate fell to 4.3
percent, down from 5.6 percent a year earlier and down from 4.5
percent in the three months which ended at the end of April.
	   The total number of unemployed reached an adjusted 294,000 in
the three months ending May, from 386,000 unemployed a year
earlier.

	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Au pair Louise Woodward arrived back
in Britain on Thursday, proclaiming her innocence and predicting
her name eventually would be cleared in the death of a child in her
care.
	   The 20-year-old au pair returned to her native country for the
first time in two years, following her manslaughter conviction in
the death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen.
	   ``I feel great sorrow for the death of baby Matthew,'' she said.
``But like I've said time and time again, I had nothing to do with
his death.''
	   ``I'm very pleased to be home back on English soil,'' she said.
``And I've really missed the place. I'd like to thank all the
people who supported me.''
	   A judge has issued a temporary injunction barring Ms. Woodward
from spending any money if she sells her story. But, at a press
conference at the Manchester Airport before heading to her nearby
hometown of Elton, she vehemently denied she had any plans to do
so.

Intestinal virus claims seven more lives 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A virus that strikes children has claimed
seven more lives in Taiwan, raising the death toll to 43, a
government official said Thursday.
	   Hsu Kuo-hsiung, a Health Department official, said the latest
deaths included girls aged 9 and 12, indicating the virus was also
attacking older children. All other deaths have been of children 6
or younger.
	   Among those afflicted, he said, 174 other children had developed
serious complications but had recovered or were recovering.
	   Premier Vincent Siew urged health authorities to step up efforts
to contain the spread of the disease, which broke out last month.
	   ``This is a phenomenon that should not have existed in a
(developed) society like ours,'' Siew told a Cabinet meeting.
	   After conducting autopsies on six infected children, health
authorities confirmed early this week the disease was caused by the
enterovirus 71 virus.
	   The virus, which spreads by physical contact, hits Taiwan every
summer, but this year's outbreak has been especially severe. It has
infected mostly toddlers and young children who have not been
exposed to it previously and lack antibodies.
	   The U.S. Center for Disease Control has sent three
epidemiologists to study the virus.
	   Early symptoms of the virus resemble the flu, with fever,
headache or vomiting. Ulcers or blisters in the mouth and a rash on
the hands and feet can also develop. Later, possible deadly
complications can include encephalitis, meningitis and acute
inflammation of the heart muscle.
	   Some nursery schools have been closed in parts of central Taiwan
hit hardest by the virus. Authorities have advised parents to
ensure that their children wash frequently and to avoid taking them
out in public.

Doohan denies retirement rumors

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ World 500cc motorcycle champion Mick
Doohan has rejected a report that he plans to quit racing at the
end of the 1999 grand prix season.
	   An Australian motorsport magazine reported this week that
Doohan, a four-time world champion, had announced his decision to
quit.
	   ``I've never put a time limit on when I'll stop racing,'' Doohan
said Thursday. ``All I've ever said is I'll keep going while I
enjoy it, and right now my motivation is as high as it's ever been.
	   ``I can't race forever, but who's to know when my enthusiasm
will drop or when I won't be competitive enough to win.''
	   Doohan is fourth in the current standings after crashing out on
the opening lap of the Madrid Grand Prix on Sunday.
	   The Honda star said he was already the subject of offers for
next year.
	   ``I've had some offers for next season, which is usual for this
time of the year, but I won't be making up my mind on what I'm
doing for a while yet,'' Doohan said.

Two bombs explode in Karachi; two people shot dead 
</HEADLINE>
By ZAHID HUSSAIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Violence shattered the southern port
city of Karachi for a third straight day Thursday as two bombs
hidden in motorcycles exploded within 30 minutes of each other,
injuring 10 people, police and hospital officials said.
	   The first bomb exploded outside the Karachi Stock Exchange, in
the heart of the city's bustling financial district, injuring five
people, the officials said.
	   The second bomb went off outside the Sindh provincial government
office building, within meters (yards) of the Parliament buildings,
police officials said. Five people were injured in that explosion.
	   On Wednesday, two separate car bombs rattled Karachi residents.
One person was injured.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for any of the four bombings.
	   In separate incidents Thursday, gunmen shot and killed two
people, police officials said.
	   The bomb outside the Karachi Stock Exchange was hidden in a
motorcycle parked outside the nine-story building. At least five
motorcycles lay strewn in a heap of twisted metal, said
eyewitnesses.
	   ''We heard this loud bang and the first think I thought is that
something had happened on the floor (of the exchange),'' said
Muddaser Malik, a stock broker. ''We looked outside and there was a
cloud of smoke.''
	   The bomb outside the government office building also was hidden
in a motorcycle. Policemen at the scene offered few details.
	   In a separate incident Thursday, three policemen were wounded
when gunmen in Karachi's central neighborhood opened fire on their
armor-plated vehicles, police said.
	   One vehicle entered the area to investigate reports of gunshots
being fired. It came under fire and two more police vehicles
arrived to provide assistance, but they too were attacked, said
police officials.
	   No one was arrested and the police left the area.
	   In the last month, nearly 100 people have been killed in
violence in southern Karachi. Most of the deaths were linked to the
bitter feuding between rival factions of an ethnic party.
	   The combatants belong to rival groups of the Mohajir Qami
Movement, which claims to represent Indian Muslims who settled in
Pakistan after 1947, when Pakistan was created as a separate
homeland for Muslims of the Asian subcontinent.
	   Most of the immigrants settled in southern Sindh province and
now dominate the cities there, including the provincial capital of
Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and home to 14 million people.
	   Since Tuesday, 14 people have been killed in Karachi, including
two members of a government-run anti-corruption committee. Dozens
more have been injured.
	   No one has taken responsibility for any of the killings. So far
police officials say they haven't made any arrests.
	   The shooting death of a butcher early Thursday sparked a
demonstration by 500 people in the Korangi neighborhood. They
burned tires and demanded better police protection, according to
eyewitnesses.
	   Nearby a retired policeman was shot dead while he waited at a
bus stop, police said.
	   The government has arrested dozens of militants from both
factions of the Mohajir Qami Movement but it has had little success
in curbing the violence that has wracked this southern port city
for several years.

China speeding up plans to sign pact on political rights 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A week before U.S. President Bill Clinton arrives
in China for a summit, Beijing is speeding preparations to sign a
U.N. treaty on protecting political rights, a government spokesman
said Thursday.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said, however, he did not
know if the review would be finished so that the pact could be
approved during Clinton's June 25-July 3 visit.
	   By signing the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, Beijing would ease domestic pressure on Clinton to severely
criticize China's human rights record during his visit.
	   China indicated earlier this year that it was interested in
signing the pact _ which guarantees such freedoms as free speech
and assembly _ but said time was needed to study provisions that
conflict with Chinese laws.
	   Although China's constitution guarantees freedom of speech,
assembly and religion and other civil liberties, the rights are
severely curtailed by laws and regulations, some of them
unpublished.
	   ``We are now accelerating our preparation work'' for signing the
pact, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu said at a twice-weekly media
briefing.
	   China signed a complementary U.N. treaty, the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, last October
during a visit to the United States by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin. But the Chinese legislature has yet to ratify it.
	   Clinton is the first U.S. president to visit since the Chinese
army violently crushed pro-democracy demonstrations centered on
Tiananmen Square in 1989. In a speech last week in Washington, he
promised to press Chinese leaders for protection of human rights.
	   Republican members of Congress _ angered by China's human rights
violations, plans for Clinton to be welcomed on Tiananmen and
allegations of possible transfers of sensitive satellite technology
to China _ have urged him to call off the visit.

Hiroshima survivor campaigns against nuclear weapons in India 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos planned
By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KHETOLAI, India (AP) _ A Hiroshima survivor took his campaign
against atomic weapons just a few kilometers (miles) from India's
underground nuclear test range Thursday, and appealed to villagers
to join his protest to ``protect your own lives.''
	   Yasuhiko Taketa spoke of seeing a fiery cloud engulf his
hometown in Japan on Aug. 6, 1945. Days later he watched a younger
sister die of radiation poisoning _ one of the 130,000 victims of
the first atomic bomb.
	   His tearful account moved many in his audience of about 300 in
the village square of Khetolai, a dairy farming community of 1,500
people which is 10 kilometers (six miles) from the Pokaran military
test range. Pokaran is 550 kilometers (330 miles) southwest of New
Delhi.
	   India set off a series of nuclear weapons tests at Pokaran last
month, prompting retaliatory tests from neighbor and longtime rival
Pakistan and raising fears of a south Asian nuclear war.
	   When Taketa finished his talk, Indian anti-nuclear campaigners
who had helped organize the visit read a declaration calling on all
countries to stop testing nuclear weapons and destroy their nuclear
arsenals.
	   Shouts of ``Yes! Yes! Yes!'' rang out in the tent where men in
white turbans and women in the flowing, brightly colored skirts and
scarves of India's Rajastan state had gathered to hear Taketa.
	   Adults rushed to sign the declaration while children lined up to
shake Taketa's hand.
	   ``Please stand up and raise your voice against all governments
using atomic weapons,'' Taketa said in Japanese, his comments
translated first into English and then Hindi. ``You must protect
your own lives. The government will not do anything for you.''
	   On Wednesday night, Taketa gave a similar talk before about 500
people at the nearby town of Pokaran, which shares the same name as
the test site. He planned several more appearances in the area and
in Bombay before heading to Pakistan.
	   Taketa's Japan Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is
supported by Japanese labor unions and works closely with survivors
from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Japanese cities on which the
United States dropped atomic bombs at the end of World War II.
	   ``What happened in Hiroshima can happen anywhere,'' said
Khetolai resident Jeevan Lal.
	   Bhera Ram Bishnoi, a local government official, said he
supported his government's declaration that it needed a nuclear
deterrent in the face of the threat it saw from neighbors China and
Pakistan. But he said people in Khetolai had never been comfortable
living so close to the test site first used in 1974. Last month's
tests were the first since the 1974 explosion.
	   ``We are worried about what will happen because of the
radioactivity,'' said Bishnoi. He said villagers feared that 20
cancer deaths since 1974 and recent symptoms such as vomiting
blood, stomach pains and incessant coughs occurred because they
lived so close to the test site.
	   The government has said no radiation leaked during last month's
explosions and dismissed reports of health problems linked to the
tests.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai doctors fear they may have to
sacrifice the life of one Siamese twin girl to save her sister in a
risky operation to separate them at the heart.
	   But Dr. Dusit Staworn said Thursday that ``we still want to save
both of them.''
	   Dusit confirmed newspaper reports that the girls' father,
Sompume Daensa, described as a poor worker in a provincial
hospital, has asked that the medical team save at least one of the
girls.
	   Dusit said the girls' condition was ``not good.'' Separating
them could be extremely difficult because the upper chambers of
their hearts share the same wall and they share only one liver.
	   Dusit, in charge of the case at King Mongkut Hospital in
Bangkok, said that doctors had never successfully separated twins
with connected hearts anywhere, The Nation said.
	   This is his hospital's first such case. Officials said people
were making donations to help pay the expenses.
	   ``We can't predict the chances of the babies' survival, but we
will try our best,'' The Nation quoted Dusit as saying. ``The
father asked us to save only one if we could not save both of
them.''
	   The twins were born June 9 in Lop Buri, 115 kilometers (71
miles) north of Bangkok, with a combined birth weight of 5
kilograms (11 pounds) and measuring 45 centimeters (18 inches)
each.
	   Named Chananthida and Chanyaporn, they are connected for 12
centimeters (4.8 inches) from above the chest to the stomach.
	   The babies' hearts beat at nearly double the normal rate and
doctors have to constantly administer medicine to regulate them.
	   The overworked hearts nearly gave out Monday night and Dusit
said the risk of the girls going into shock was constant.
	   The hospital will assemble a surgical team Friday to assess the
situation and seek advice from other top hospitals. The infants are
currently in intensive care and their poor condition prevents lab
tests and X-rays.
	   Dusit indicated that an operation was not imminent, but said
medical theory holds that Siamese twins should be separated within
two months of birth.
	   The Nation said that Sompume was happy when he learned from
ultrasound results that he was going to have twins, ``but now I am
very sorry for my babies.''
	   Sompume and his wife already have a 5-year-old son.
	   The term Siamese twins was first used with Chang and Eng,
Chinese twins born in 1811 in Thailand, once known as Siam.

<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Au pair Louise Woodward arrived back in
Britain on Thursday, proclaiming her innocence and predicting her
name eventually would be cleared in the death of a child in her
care.
	   The 20-year-old au pair returned to her native country for the
first time in two years, following her manslaughter conviction in
the death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen.
	   ``I feel great sorrow for the death of baby Matthew,'' she said.
``But like I've said time and time again, I had nothing to do with
his death.''
	   ``I'm very pleased to be home back on English soil,'' she said.
``And I've really missed the place. I'd like to thank all the
people who supported me.''
	   A judge has issued a temporary injunction barring Ms. Woodward
from spending any money if she sells her story. But, at a press
conference at the Manchester Airport, she vehemently denied she had
any plans to do so.
	   ``Contrary to any rumors and any speculation that I've heard,
I've not sold my story and, as far as interviews are concerned, I'm
going to be doing an interview with the BBC, for which I'll receive
no payment,'' she said.
	   She then headed home to the nearby village of Elton, where she
was enveloped in a joyous hug at the family's house by her younger
sister, Vicky.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A 70-year-old man has been sentenced to 25 years
in prison for murdering three people, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported Thursday.
	   Alexander Baimakov, described as a hunter who lived in a village
outside the Urals town of Chelyabinsk, about 1500 kilometers (950
miles) east of Moscow, shot and killed three neighbors and wounded
several children and a policeman in June 1997, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Baimakov was ``indignant'' over the sentence, ITAR-Tass said.
	   ``Must I be in jail until I am 95?'' he demanded to know.

Officials deny Israel carried out nuclear test in Gulf of Aqaba 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Officials denied Thursday that Israel had
carried out a nuclear test in the Gulf of Aqaba, after two Israeli
legislators raised the matter in parliament.
	   Labor lawmaker Rafi Elul said Wednesday that he had heard
``rumors about an Israeli nuclear test'' in the gulf.
	   Democratic Arab Party member Abdul Wahab Darawshe added that he
had information that a neutron bomb test had been carried out on
May 28, causing an earthquake in the region, the Maariv newspaper
said.
	   Darawshe based his claims on a report by Egyptian scientist
Tarik el Nimar that appeared in the Egyptian paper al Bayan, Maariv
said.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Silvan Shalom issued a statement calling
the allegations ``baseless'' and reaffirming Israel's commitment to
the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, Maariv said.
	   Elul did not reveal the source of his information.
	   ``The public has a right to know if Israel is carrying out
nuclear tests which could affect our security,'' Maariv quoted him
as saying. ``If in fact such tests were carried out ... this is a
public matter of the first order.''
	   Shai Feldman, head of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies,
said on Israel Radio that it is common after regional earthquakes
for many people, ``especially Egyptians,'' to accuse Israel of
carrying out nuclear tests.
	   ``Time and time again scientific tests have proved these
accusations false,'' he said. ``The factual and logical basis
behind this story is completely fictional.''

Report: Former mine company president interrogated in cyanide spill 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The former president of a Kyrgyz-Canadian mining
venture has been interrogated in connection with a sodium cyanide
spill that has killed four people, a Russian news agency reported
Thursday.
	   A truck carrying 20 tons of highly toxic sodium cyanide powder
crashed into the Barskaan River, which feeds into Lake Issyk Kul,
on May 20. An estimated 1,700 kilograms (3,400 pounds) of sodium
cyanide leaked into the river and some of it reached the lake,
which includes a valuable nature preserve and is home to several
rare species.
	   The cyanide was being delivered to a gold mine operated by
Canada's Cameco company, the world's largest publicly traded
uranium company.
	   Citing the government commission investigating the spill, the
Interfax news agency said that Gerhard Glattes, the former
president of the Kumtor Operating Company, was being interrogated
by the Kyrgyz Security Ministry. It said that the a legal case has
been opened on charges of damaging the environment, which can carry
punishment from 12 to 20 years in prison.

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen fired about 30
shots at the home of a Sri Lankan newspaper editor who has reported
on official corruption, the journalist said Thursday.
	   No one was injured in the attack Wednesday night. The government
ordered an investigation.
	   ``I told the police that I have reasons to believe that very
powerful people are behind the attack as I have been trying to
expose them,'' said Lasantha Wickrematunge, editor-in-chief of the
English language Sunday Leader weekly.
	   The Sunday Leader has reported that the chief executive officer
of Sri Lanka Telecom paid the personal credit card bill of the
Cabinet minister responsible for telecommunications, and questioned
why 51 percent of a state-owned tea company was sold to foreign
investors when Sri Lankan law limits outside ownership to 40
percent.
	   Wickrematunge said he and his wife, Raine, had returned to their
home in Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, after dinner Wednesday. He
heard what sounded like firecrackers, then his servants said they
had seen men firing at his house. The attackers left after firing
about 30 bullets.
	   ``They fired at my two cars and at random at the house,''
Wickrematunge said.
	   Earlier this year, men pointed a gun at the head of another Sri
Lankan journalist who had written about corruption in the military,
saying they wanted to tell him what to write. Two air force
officers are being investigated in that case.

An overnight summary of Caribbean news SURINAME: Government sets aside Israel-size nature preserve 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Coaxed by U.S. conservationists,
Suriname on Wednesday declared one of the world's largest and most
pristine tropical rain forests _ an expanse the size of Israel _ a
nature reserve.
	   The step will help preserve the uninhabited and partly
unexplored Central Suriname Wilderness Nature Reserve, which has
long been the target of Asian logging companies.
	   Suriname's rain forests are home to an abundance of wildlife:
Giant otters, jaguars, black spider monkeys, giant armadillos, and
the endangered harpy eagle can all be found there.
	   The decision to create the 4 million-acre (1.6 million-hectare)
reserve was an about-face for the South American nation. Two years
ago, Suriname refused a proposal from the Inter-American
Development Bank to help finance the country's budget while ways
were found to protect the forest from loggers.
 &UR; TURKS AND CAICOS: Police say yachts witnessed sinking of refugee
boat
	   COCKBURN TOWN, Turks and Caicos (AP) _ Police investigating the
sinking of a boat crowded with Haitian refugees appealed Wednesday
for help from two unidentified yachts that were nearby at the time.
	   Police on the British Turks and Caicos islands said witnesses on
the oceangoing yachts may be able to clear up conflicting accounts
of the sinking and appealed for information about them.
	   The Haitian sloop capsized June 8 about 25 miles (40 kilometers)
from the island of Providenciales, after maritime police fired
shots. A police officer has said that he fired warning shots across
the bow of the boat. Some of the 70 survivors say the shots hit
refugees.
	   Six bodies were recovered, drowned but with no bullet wounds.
Police are investigating survivors' claims that more than 30 others
died.
 &UR; ST. VINCENT: Mitchell sworn in over opponents' objections
	   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP) _ Prime Minister Sir James Mitchell
was sworn in for a fourth term Wednesday over protests by the
opposition that his re-election was rigged.
	   ``I would like to thank Almighty God and the people of St.
Vincent and the Grenadines for giving me and my party a new
mandate,'' said Mitchell, who has led the country's government for
14 years.
	   He was sworn in by Governor General Sir Charles Antrobus, Queen
Elizabeth II's representative in this former British colony.
	   The opposition Unity Labor Party won 27,506 votes in Monday's
parliamentary election to the 23,219 garnered by Mitchell's New
Democratic Party, but the Democrats kept a 8-7 majority in
Parliament by winning more districts.
	   Labor Party leader Vincent Beache accused Mitchell's party of
``fraud, bribery and intimidation.'' On Wednesday he demanded new
elections in six months.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Leader to visit Haiti, confront years of
bitterness
	   DAJABON, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Dominican President Leonel
Fernandez starts a three-day visit to Haiti Thursday _ the first
time a Dominican leader overnights there since a 1936 trip by
dictator Rafael Trujillo.
	   The gap between the two visits underscores nearly 200 years of
bitterness and mistrust between the two peoples marked by invasions
and killings. Dominican fears of being overrun by Haitians, the
fears that led to a massacre of Haitians in 1937, still are very
much alive some 60 years later.
	   Now the two countries that share the Caribbean island of
Hispaniola finally are trying to overcome two centuries of bad
blood.
	   Fernandez and Haitian President Rene Preval, who visited Santo
Domingo in April, will discuss the lax border policing that allows
illegal immigrants and drugs to cross practically at will from
Haiti.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Two charged with violating Cuban embargo
	   MIAMI (AP) _ A Customs Service agent grubbed around in garbage
to collect 9,000 documents against two Venezuelan cousins charged
Wednesday with violating the Cuban trade embargo by buying dlrs 4.8
million worth of cement in Cuba and shipping it to Brazil.
	   Exploration of the garbage recovered outside the Florida homes
of the two women revealed fictitious invoices and paperwork for
letters of credit and bills of lading intended to circumvent the
Trading With the Enemy Act, said agent Peter Liston.
	   Diptsy Molina Tamayo, 39, of Parkland, Florida, and Maritza
Villavicencio, 35, of Miami were arrested Tuesday, the same day
they had tickets to fly with their children to Greece, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Kevin Kozak said at their initial court appearance.
 &UR; SURINAME: Cuba and Suriname sign economic development pact
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Cuba and Suriname agreed Wednesday
to cooperate on economic development projects, signing the latest
in a series of new pacts strengthening Cuba's ties to Caribbean
Basin countries.
	   The agreement, signed by diplomats in Paramaribo, promises the
two countries will cooperate in the areas of health, fishing,
natural resources, commerce, transportation, tourism,
telecommunications and agriculture.
	   The signing followed a three-day visit by a Cuban government
officials to fisheries, hotels, manufacturing plants and Suriname's
bureau of medical drugs.
	   Suriname, a former Dutch colony on the northeast coast of South
America, is one of the poorest countries in the Americas. President
Jules Wijdenbosch has been trying to attract outside investment
despite labor unrest, rising inflation and a growing national debt.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Court says Puerto Rican juror not entitled to
interpreter
	   WEST PALM BEACH, Florida (AP) _ A Puerto Rican juror should not
have been allowed to have an interpreter with him during
deliberations in a drunken driving case, a Florida appeals court
said Wednesday in ordering a new trial.
	   Under current law, only interpreters for deaf jurors are allowed
into a jury room _ an area which has been zealously protected by
the court system, the 4th Florida District Court of Appeal said.
	   The question of non-English speaking jurors arose in the 1996
drunken driving trial of Paul Dilorenzo of Boca Raton, Florida.
	   Augustin Gutierrez, a U.S. citizen who was born in Puerto Rico
and had lived in the United States for 17 years, told the court
during jury selection that his primary language was Spanish.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Colombian president to visit Dominican
Republic
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Colombian President
Ernesto Samper will visit the Dominican Republic late June to
discuss an oil deal, drug trafficking and tourism, foreign
relations officials said Wednesday.
	   The Foreign Relations Secretariat said no date has been set, but
Samper probably would come to Santo Domingo following a June 24
trip to Cuba.
	   Samper and Dominican President Leonel Fernandez will discuss a
proposal to buy Colombian oil for the Dominican Republic's
state-owned refinery and attempts to lure Colombian tourists and
investors to the Caribbean island.
	   They also will discuss anti-drug efforts. In the past year, the
Dominican Republic has become a popular transshipment point for
cocaine carried by speedboat from Colombia to Haiti and then
trucked across the border for shipping to Florida from Santo
Domingo.

Nauru gets new president after no confidence motion 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Nauru President Kinza Clodumar
was ousted in a no confidence motion Thursday, and replaced by his
friend and former leader Bernard Dowiyogo.
	   The leadership change was announced in a statement issued by the
Pacific island nation's consulate in Melbourne, Australia.
	   It said Dowiyogo is the most experienced member of the Nauru
parliament, having been elected in 1973, and the appointment would
be his fifth term as president.
	   Clodumar, president since last year, would take a major role in
the new government, the statement said.
	   Under the Nauru constitution, the president is elected by the
members of parliament.
	   The Pacific republic gained independence in 1968, ending a
U.N.-approved trusteeship role by Australia, Britain and New
Zealand.
	   Nauru is currently seeking full membership in the Commonwealth
and United Nations.

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ African leaders, opening a mission
to restore peace in the Horn of Africa, met Thursday with Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and planned an afternoon session with
Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
	   The countries' border conflict that broke out in early May has
claimed hundreds of lives on three fronts and in air attacks. In a
first sign that the two men may be willing to compromise, they
agreed under U.S.-Italian pressure on Sunday to halt air strikes.
	   Ground fighting has subsided since June 11.
	   The OAU delegation ``has no new initiative of its own, but will
be building on the OAU resolution'' urging the two sides to accept
and implement a four-point U.S.-Rwandan peace proposal, Ethiopian
government spokewoman Selome Tadesse said.
	   The proposal includes a call to Eritrea to redeploy to positions
held prior to the outbreak of hostilities.
	   ``Unfortunately, the Ethiopian side has been very adamant on
that point,'' said Eritrean presidential aide Yemane Gebreab.
	   Unable to resolve that impasse, each side has been crafting
proposals to find common ground, he said.
	   Eritrea will lobby for a cessation of hostilities and
demilitarization of the entire border,Yemane said. The steps would
clear the way for the U.N. Cartographic Section to delimit and
demarcate the border, he said.
	   ``We might fight a few more rounds, but at the end of it, we're
going to have to negotiate,'' Yemane said.
	   The Ethiopians did not discuss their proposals.
	   Burkina Faso President Blaise Campaore, as current OAU chief,
leads the delegation that also includes Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe and OAU
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim.
	   Djibouti President sent Foreign Minister Mohammed Musa Sheahim
in place of President Gouled Atidon, who is unwell.
	   Hundreds of Eritreans have been deported from Ethiopia, arriving
in their homeland on Wednesday after an arduous three-day trip
aboard packed buses.
	   ``The Ethiopian government continues to pursue its witch-hunt of
Eritreans with greater intensity,'' Eritrea said Wednesday.
	   The Ethiopian government said the deportees posed security risks
because they had military training or were raising funds for the
Eritrean war effort.
	   Ethiopia has accused Eritrea of expelling thousands of its
citizens, a charged denied by Eritrea.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
rebels overthrow a 17-year military regime in July 1991. Eritrea

World Cup: Three players suspended for second warnings 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Brazil, Scotland and Morocco will have to play
their final games in the first round with one player off their
rosters.
	   FIFA said Thursday that Cesar Sampaio, Darren Jackson and Said
Chiba of Morocco were automatically suspended for one game after
picking up their second yellow cards of the tournament.
	   They were the first suspended for two warning cards in separate
matches at this World Cup. There have been at least four other
suspensions for red cards, including a two-game ban for Dutch
striker Patrick Kluivert for elbowing Belgium's Lorenzo Staelens.

Role players keyed Red Wings' title run AP Sports Writer

	   DETROIT (AP) _ No one had to coax the Detroit Red Wings to work
hard. For the most part, they just followed their leader.
	   Steve Yzerman, the captain, worked hard on the ice. He worked
even harder off the ice.
	   As a result, the Red Wings swept the Washington Capitals to
clinch their second Stanley Cup, becoming the first team to repeat
as Cup champion since 1992.
	   On Thursday, the champions were scheduled to be honored with a
parade down Woodward Avenue. Upwards of 1 million fans lined the
same parade route a year ago.
	   ``After last season I thought about how much longer I wanted to
play. That was my 15th season in the league and I want to play
20,'' said Yzerman, who was voted MVP of the finals. ``So I would
like to play five more.''
	   That can only be good news for the Red Wings, who desperately
needed his steady leadership this season.
	   When they stepped onto the ice in Traverse City last September
to begin training camp, the Red Wings were already a vastly
different team from the one that won the Cup back in June, ending
42 years of frustration.
	   Star defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov and team massage therapist
Sergei Mnatsakanov remained hospitalized from a June 13 limousine
crash last year that ended both of their careers. Playoff hero Mike
Vernon was traded. Tomas Sandstrom left as a free agent. Vyacheslav
Kozlov and Sergei Fedorov were unsigned.
	   In fact, there were whispers Fedorov might not want to return to
Detroit, that he had grown tired of coach Scotty Bowman and his
iron-fisted ways.
	   Despite those distractions, something good happened at Traverse
City, a four-hour drive north from Detroit.
	   ``We really bonded and were as close as could be,'' defenseman
Joe Kocur said. ``It was a good idea moving camp up there. We could
reconnect with the guys and do things as a team. It brought some
feeling back.''
	   To bring Fedorov back, however, took a six-year, dlrs 38 million
contract _ following a 59-game holdout. Still, it proved to be
worth the time and money as Fedorov, on fresh legs, carried the Red
Wings through the early rounds of the playoffs _ earning a dlrs 12
million bonus.
	   But Bowman, who tied Toe Blake by winning his eighth Cup, is
nothing if not deft amid adversity.
	   He made up for Fedorov's truancy by maneuvering other players
into key roles. Basically, he made role players of everyone on the
team, including star players like Yzerman, Brendan Shanahan and
Nicklas Lidstrom.
	   ``Their superstars played rugged, they played tough,''
Washington forward Brian Bellows said. ``Yzerman, Fedorov, they
play within their system. Everybody does what's expected. I think
they all feel responsible to each other, and that's the
difference.''
	   Bowman's grand plan accomplished two things: the star players
weren't on the ice as much as usual, and the role players weren't
warming the bench as often.
	   In the process, the Red Wings developed great depth, which only
got better when Fedorov finally returned. That depth proved
invaluable in the playoffs as Bowman regularly rolled over four
lines, wearing down formidable opponents in Phoenix, St. Louis and
Dallas before sweeping the upstart Washington Capitals in the Cup
finals.
	   ``Going in, I didn't know if we could really win another Cup,''
Bowman said. ``But I knew that the desire and the motivation was
there, and fortunately we did.''
	   The triumph, of course, was bittersweet. The fate of
Konstantinov and Mnatsakanov was always on the minds of the
players.
	   At Joe Louis Arena, along the back wall of the Red Wings'
dressing room where the defensemen sit, Konstantinov's locker
remained unchanged. His skates hung on hooks and his pads and
uniform were stored inside. A rock with the message ``believe''
painted on the front rested on the top shelf.
	   All season long, Detroit players wore a patch below the right
shoulder of their jerseys. The patch bore the initials of their two
injured friends and the word ``believe'' in both English and
Russian.
	   Konstantinov was at Washington's MCI Center Tuesday night when
the Red Wings retained the Cup. After hoisting the prized chalice
above his head for the second straight year, Yzerman, the captain,
put the big trophy in Konstantinov's lap.
	   ``I think that was outstanding,'' Washington coach Ron Wilson
said. ``That's outstanding what they did. That was a very emotional
professional thing that they did, and you'd only see that in
hockey.''
	   Almost everyone wept at the sight of a smiling Konstantinov,
cradling the Cup and holding a cigar, being wheeled around the ice
at the head of the Red Wings' victory lap. Tears of joy, to be
sure.
	   ``Not too often does a moment in hockey transcend sports, but
that was one of them,'' Shanahan said. ``That was one of the
greatest moments I've ever had as an athlete.''
	   A special moment for what turned out to be a special team.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's three leading automakers said Thursday
their domestic auto production continued to fall in May, reflecting
sluggish domestic demand and declining exports to Asia.
	   Toyota Motor Corp. said domestic production in May fell 20.4
percent from a year earlier to 223,602 vehicles as exports
decreased 3.7 percent to 115,877. Exports of passenger cars rose
2.3 percent, but exports of trucks and buses plunged 23.2 percent.
	   Nissan Motor Co. said domestic output tumbled 22.8 percent to
108,443, while exports declined 10.7 percent to 46,573. The
automaker said exports were hurt by inventory adjustments in North
America. While exports of Nissan's passenger cars tumbled 12.4
percent, exports of its commercial vehicles increased 0.4 percent,
helped by strong demand for its recreational vehicle models in
Europe and the Middle East.
	   Honda Motor Co.'s output dropped 15.3 percent to 89,591, and its
exports dropped 4.8 percent to 40,331. Exports fell for the first
time since August 1996, hurt mainly by a 63 percent plunge in
Asia-bound shipments, said Takeshi Sumita, a Honda spokesman.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Quickening the pace of its economic
restructuring, South Korea on Thursday announced a list of 55
companies it deems so financially weak they should be liquidated.
	   Although the companies have debts totaling dlrs 12.14 billion,
most are small and analysts viewed the government's action as at
best a first step toward revamping the nation's industries.
	   The move was the latest in a series of reforms South Korea has
promised to the International Monetary Fund in exchange for a dlrs
58 billion bailout in December.
	   Lee Hun-jae, head of the Financial Supervisory Commission, said
that government-controlled commercial banks would be asked to
withhold loans to major conglomerates unless they swap key,
overlapping industries.
	   He specifically cited automobile manufacturing as one area in
which such a swap is necessary.
	   South Korea's car industry, the world's fifth largest with four
major manufacturers, is in deep trouble with slumping sales at home
and abroad. Samsung's late entry into the car market this year
added to the problem.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's reforms of its struggling state
industrial sector must follow economic rules and try to avoid
harming workers, according to a government order reported by state
news media on Thursday.
	   ``The government should respect the will of enterprises and
avoid forced mergers,'' said the circular issued by the State
Economic and Trade Commission, the China Daily reported.
	   Small state enterprises introducing a shareholding system must
not force their staff to purchase shares, but at the same time
shares should not be concentrated in the hands of a few, it said.
	   The circular also required all companies that have laid off
workers to set up retraining centers.
	   It also said the country is well prepared to bail out most of
its debt-ridden state enterprises within the three-year deadline
already set by Premier Zhu Rongji, the China Daily reported.
	   The order said the focus would be on textile, coal and defense
industries, singling out defense as an area where transformation to
a market economy should be speeded up.
	   The government has said about 40 percent of state enterprises
are losing money.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Declining imports helped the
Philippines post a current account surplus in the first two months
of this year, a turnaround from the sizable deficit registered a
year earlier, the government said Thursday.
	   The surplus in the current account _ a broad measure of
financial flows from trade, tourism, and other services _ totaled
dlrs 131 million in the two months compared to a deficit of dlrs
437 million in the year earlier period, the central bank said.
	   The surplus represents far better performance than the
government's dlrs 241 million deficit projection for the period
under a two-year, dlrs 1.4 billion standby loan arrangement with
the International Monetary Fund.
	   The country's trade deficit has been declining since October
1997 on a year-on-year basis mainly due to a slowdown in imports
caused by the weak peso.
	   The peso has fallen 34 percent since last July, when the Asian
currency crisis began.
	   While lower trade deficits are generally welcomed, analysts warn
the lower imports are a sign of a slowing economy.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia continues to face a sharp
decline in the number of tourists from Asia, with latest government
figures Thursday showing an almost 80 percent drop in visitors from
South Korea.
	   The number of visitors from Southeast Asia fell by almost 20
percent in May from the same month last year, and from Northeast
Asia by more than 11 percent in the same period, the Australia
Bureau of Statistics reported.
	   In addition to a 78 percent fall in visitor numbers from Korea,
figures for Thailand were down almost 60 percent, from Malaysia
down 36 percent and Indonesia down 23 percent.
	   But the number of visitors from Japan rose 2.2 percent, the
bureau said.
	   The number of British and American visitors also increased, it
said.

Military helps Russia's troubled youth 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boys who have embarked at an early age into lives
of crime, drugs, and poverty are finding new hope from the Russian
military, a Moscow newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The air defense brigade in Naro-Fominsk, in central Russia, has
taken in about a dozen boys from age 11 to 17, all of whom came
from families that cannot raise them properly, the Moscow Times
said.
	   The program started eight months ago when brigade leader Alexei
Valov took to heart a call from Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev: Bring back the World War II tradition of adopting
Russia's homeless kids.
	   Valov set up a makeshift barracks for the boys, who march and
sing songs with their older counterparts. They are trained to shoot
and clean Kalashnikov rifles, and learn other military skills _ as
well as attending regular school.
	   The program has become so well known that parents from all over
Russia call to ask if their sons can join the brigade, the Moscow
Times reported.
	   Brigade leaders say it is not easy to keep the program running.
Top military leaders didn't offer any supporting funds when they
asked commanders to bring in the kids.
	   Still, the cash-strapped soldiers in Naro-Fominsk will try for
as long as possible to look after some of the area's troubled boys,
whom they provide with uniforms and regular meals, as well as
military training and a place to live.

Marseille gets set for its second World Cup weekend 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES thruout with authorities easing alcohol ban; REWRITES
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Authorities, under pressure from cafe owners,
relented Thursday on a weekend alcohol ban meant to put the brakes
on hooligans during Marseille's weekend World Cup soccer match,
agreeing to allow sales of drinks until midnight.
	   Still recovering from three days of violence by hooligans that
culminated around Monday's Britain-Tunisia match, authorities
planned increased security for Saturday's match between the
Netherlands and South Korea.
	   More than 50 people were injured and 80 arrested in clashes last
Saturday, Sunday and Monday between English hooligans and Tunisia
supporters and French that damaged the Old Port district.
	   More than 100 people remained jailed, and officials said about
30 would be kept behind bars until the World Cup ends July 12.
	   In a clear message that hooliganism will not be tolerated at the
World Cup, French courts convicted four German and three English
soccer fans for violence that marred the first week of the
competition.
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement signed an order
Tuesday to expel five English fans and a Tunisian, after serving
two- to three-month jail terms. He threatened more expulsions if
soccer violence recurs.
	   On Wednesday, judges ordered two- and four-month jail terms for
the three English fans, after three others were convicted Monday.
Two Germans received three-month sentences.
	   Two other German fans were convicted for attacking a German
television crew before their country's match against the United
States. They were to be deported, and banned from returning to
France for three months.
	   However, regional Prefect Jean-Paul Proust relented on the
strict alcohol ban announced earlier, under pressure from cafe and
restaurant owners who said the measures were ``anti-economic.''
	   Proust agreed Thursday to allow alcohol to be sold until
midnight, and said cafes and restaurants could remain open until 4
a.m.
	   Carry-out alcoholic drink remain strictly forbidden throughout
the weekend, starting Friday night.
	   Some 2,000 regular police are to be activated for weekend duty.
Their ranks will be bolstered by some 200 police of the
Anti-Criminal Brigade patrolling in groups in the city center, the
prefecture said. Riot police also are to be posted about town.
	   Authorities took other measures to prevent hooliganism at other
matches in the 10 French cities hosting the Cup, especially those
staging England matches.
	   The southwestern city of Toulouse was bracing for England's next
match, with Romania on Monday. About 1,000 English fans were
already reported in France's fourth-largest city, prompting
officials to postpone the music festival until July 11.
	   Officials also considered closing bars early and forgoing large
TV screens like the one on a Marseille beach where ticketless
English fans and local youths fought Monday afternoon.
	   In the northern city of Lens, where England is to play Colombia
on Friday, June 26, officials were boosting police presence and
canceled city events including a music festival.

Serb prison camp boss pleads innocent to war crimes charges

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb accused of running
a squalid detention camp where Muslims and other non-Serbs were
tortured and killed pleaded innocent before an international
tribunal Thursday to war crimes and crimes against humanity.
	   At his arraignment before the U.N. Yugoslav war crimes tribunal,
Milorad Krnojelac, 57, entered not-guilty pleas to 18 counts of
atrocities. He wore a red-and-black sweatsuit and made no
statements.
	   According to his indictment, Krnojelac served as the commander
of the camp in the southeastern Bosnian town of Foca between April
1992 and August 1993.
	   Krnojelac's indictment alleges that he persecuted Muslim and
non-Serb males by subjecting them to ``prolonged and routine
imprisonment and confinement, repeated torture and beatings, (and)
countless killings'' in the prison.
	   Krnojelac faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if
convicted. A trial date was not set Thursday, but judges said the
trial was not expected to begin before mid-September.
	   Krnojelac, a school headmaster, was arrested Monday in Foca by
French and German troops of the NATO-led peace force and
immediately transferred to the tribunal's detention unit in The
Hague.
	   A captain in the former Yugoslav army, Krnojelac is not only
charged on the basis of his personal responsibility, but also for
crimes his subordinates at the camp allegedly committed.
	   The indictment claims that some detainees who were still alive
after the beatings were shot or died of their injuries in solitary
confinement. The beatings and tortures led to at least 29 deaths,
the indictment said.
	   The living conditions in the camp, were ``brutal ...
characterized by inhumane treatment, overcrowding, starvation,
forced labor and constant physical and psychological assault,'' the
indictment said.
	   The camp, one of the largest in the former Yugoslavia, housed
more than 760 people at its peak.
	   Most of the detainees were civilians, mainly Muslim men aged 16
to 80. Some were also mentally handicapped, physically disabled and
seriously ill, said the indictment, which was sealed until
Krnojelac's arrest earlier this week.
	   These men were taken to the camp after Foca was seized by Serb
military forces, assisted by paramilitary units.
	   Krnojelac also assisted in the deportation or expulsion of the
majority of Muslim and non-Serb men from the Foca municipality,
according to the charges.
	   The U.N. court has issued 21 public indictments against 60
people, as well as a number of sealed indictments. There are 28
defendants in custody.

Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index jumps 4.39 percent, dollar plunges other details

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index jumped 4.39
percent Thursday after a surprise coordinated intervention by the
United States and Japan overnight drove the yen sharply higher
against the U.S. dollar.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged 646.16 points, closing
at 15,361.54. On Wednesday, the Nikkei average had shed 5.00
points, or 0.03 percent.
	   Share prices rallied as investors saw the dramatic intervention
as a signal Japan's economic woes may finally have hit bottom,
traders said.
	   Japan and the United States agreed to step in to bolster the yen
amid concern a continued decline could spark a new round of
currency devaluations in other Asian countries and worsen the
region's financial turmoil.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told reporters
Thursday morning, ``I'm quite happy that the market has received
(the joint intervention) favorably.''
	   He told U.S. President Bill Clinton by telephone Wednesday that
the Japanese government would speed efforts, including an early
solution to huge bad debts held by banks, to pull Japan out of a
deepening recession.
	   ``We came to agreement that it is delightful (for the two
nations) to coordinate for a strong yen and the market's
stability,'' Hashimoto told an afternoon news conference.
	   Japan has been under international criticism for not taking
aggressive steps to revamp its moribund economy. As the world's
second-largest economy, Japan is Asia's dominant presence and is a
vital link in the global economy.
	   The weaker yen was widely seen as threatening the recovery of
still struggling Asian economies by making their products less
competitive than Japanese exports in world markets.
	   Trading was heavy, with an estimated 701 million shares changing
hands on the first section, up from Wednesday's 404 million.
Advances overwhelmed declines 1,076 to 131, with 62 issues
unchanged.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 136.88 yen, down 5.12 yen
from 142.00 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New
York rate of 136.37 yen overnight. It ranged between 135.50 yen and
137.27 yen in Thursday's trading.
	   Traders said fear of more intervention by Japan's central bank
kept the dollar under pressure as investors waited for Saturday's
meeting of Group of Seven finance deputies in Tokyo.
	   A high-level U.S. delegation, including Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, will join other G-7 officials to
discuss economic troubles in Japan and other Asian nations. Summers
was due to arrive later Thursday.
	   Wednesday's joint intervention, reportedly conducted in New York
and London and estimated at a combined dlrs 4 billion, helped
pushed the dollar down more than 7 percent from eight-year highs
hit earlier this week.
	   The dollar had gained 15 yen against the Japanese currency since
the end of April, including 6 yen in the four trading days up to
Monday, when it peaked above 146 yen.
	   ``We are glad to see that the exchange rate of the Japanese yen
is picking up,'' Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of
China, was quoted as saying by China's state-run Xinhua News
Agency.
	   Responding to recent fears that China could be forced to lower
the value of its own currency, the yuan, in response to the yen's
weakness, Dai reaffirmed that China won't devalue.
	   Among stock market gainers were shares in banks and trading
companies, which have been sold recently due to their heavy

Port workers' strike hampers cargo, tourist ships 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Dock workers began a planned six-day
strike Thursday that threatens to paralyze Greece's main ports and
severely disrupt cargo and tourist traffic.
	   Port workers are protesting plans to privatize the Salonica and
Piraeus port authorities, part of the Socialist government's
efforts to trim its inflated public sector and qualify for the
European Union's single currency by 2001.
	   The strike is expected to create a severe backlog of cargo to be
unloaded from waiting ships, while tourists traveling on ferries
and cruise ships should also face problems.
	   During the work protest, a skeleton staff will deal only with
cargoes of pharmaceutical, military and perishable goods, union
leaders said.
	   Participation in the strike was running at around 97 percent on
its first day, said Ioannis Georgoulakos, a spokesman for the port
workers union.
	   The government has said it intends to float 49 percent of the
port authorities on the stock exchange next year.

Hong Kong share prices surge on stronger yen, lower interest rates 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong share prices soared Thursday on a
stronger yen and falling interbank interest rates, with the
benchmark index surging 6.4 percent.
	   The Hang Seng index, the market's indicator for blue chips,
climbed 511.62 points, or 6.4 percent, closing at 8,515.97. It had
gained 6.3 percent Wednesday.
	   The key index surged 500 points at the market's opening,
reaching a midday high of 8,644.14 points, before the yen began to
edge lower against the U.S. dollar.
	   The slip set off some mild profit-taking on the local bourse,
said Percy Au-Young, sales director at DBS Securities (HK) Ltd.
	   Turnover was 10.35 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.32
billion), up from Wednesday's 6.14 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 787 million).
	   Investors snapped up shares following news of a joint
intervention by the United States and Japan on Wednesday to prop up
the yen, which had tumbled to an eight-year low earlier this week
and dragged down currencies and stock prices across the region.
	   The Japanese currency made a dramatic comeback Thursday, trading
slightly below 137 yen against the U.S. dollar.
	   The yen's sudden strength helped ease local interbank rates. The
volatile overnight rate fell to 7.5 percent late Thursday from 9.0
percent late Wednesday. The benchmark three-month rate slid to 9.5
percent from 11.0 percent.
	   Shares in the London-based banking giant HSBC Holdings staged
the biggest rally, surging 6.50 Hong Kong dollars to 187.50. Hang
Seng Bank was up 2.30 to 46.70.
	   Property stocks also rose sharply. Cheung Kong Holdings rose
2.40 to 36.80, and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 2.20 to 33.60.
	   Among others, conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa rose 3.90 to 38.10,
and China Light rose 1.10 to 33.40.

Precede BUENOS AIRES Croatian war crimes suspect arrives in Germany en route to Croatia GMT 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Sakic arrival in Frankfurt; due in Zagreb at 1710
By COLLEEN BARRY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ After 41 years living quietly along
the Atlantic coast southeast of Buenos Aires, Dino Sakic headed
home to Croatia on Thursday to face charges of World War II
atrocities.
	   The 76-year-old former concentration camp commander arrived in
Frankfurt aboard a commercial flight at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) en route
to Zagreb. His lawyer, state-appointed attorney Ivan Kern, was to
meet Sakic at the airport and accompany him to Croatia later in the
day.
	   Four uniformed German police officers waited at the rear of the
plane, and escorted four men in business suits who came off the
aircraft to police vans parked on the tarmac. None of the men
coming off the plane was handcuffed.
	   Sakic, who was accompanied from Buenos Aires by three Croatian
police officers, was to be held at an airport jail until his flight
to Croatia.
	   Commercial passengers entered the terminal directly from a
gangway at the plane's front.
	   Sakic is accused of crimes against humanity and international
law for actions carried out in the early 1940s, when he commanded
the Jasenovac concentration camp, known later as the ``Auschwitz of
the Balkans.''
	   Exact numbers for the thousands of Serbs, Jews and Gypsies who
died there are not known. Figures range from 35,000 to 500,000.
	   ``He has always wanted to go to Croatia to explain the facts,''
Miguel Angel Rossi, Sakic's public defender, told reporters before
the Lufthansa flight departed.
	   He was to be tried in Zagreb's local courts, which critics claim
means leniency is likely.
	   In the April 6 interview with a Buenos Aires television station
that brought him to the nation's attention, Sakic denied any
wrongdoing or that prisoners were killed under his command.
	   ``We never put a hand on any of the prisoners in the camp,'' he
said. ``The people died of natural death. There was a typhus
epidemic, for example, but there were no cremation ovens that
killed anybody.''
	   Sakic also said he has traveled openly, on a passport using his
real identity, to a number of countries, including the United
States.
	   He said he even met with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
during the president's 1994 visit to Buenos Aires.
	   President Carlos Menem called for Sakic's arrest a day after the
broadcast, even though was no standing extradition request.
	   ``It was a great shame he was ever received (in Argentina) and
it is a great joy to send him away,'' Argentine Foreign Minister
Guido di Tella told reporters.
	   Argentina's quick extradition, helped by Sakic's acquiescence,
contrasted with previous cases in Argentina, which has a reputation
as a haven for Nazis hiding from their World War II pasts.
	   Rabbi Abraham Cooper, dean of the Los Angeles-based Simon
Wiesenthal Center, said Sakic's extradition ``signals Argentine
authorities will be more pro-active in seeking remaining
suspects.''
	   A recent government report suggests several other prominent
Nazis, including former top SS members Friedrich Rauch and Erich
Mueller, could be in Argentina. In the past month, a government-led
group has formed to monitor neo-Nazi activity, skinheads and war
criminals.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's deputy defense minister denied
Thursday that Israel carried out a nuclear test in the Gulf of
Aqaba, after two Israeli legislators raised the matter in
parliament.
	   Labor lawmaker Rafi Elul said Wednesday that he had heard
``rumors about an Israeli nuclear test'' in the gulf.
	   Democratic Arab Party member Abdul Wahab Darawshe added that he
had information that a neutron bomb test had been carried out on
May 28, causing an earthquake in the region, the Maariv newspaper
said.
	   Darawshe based his claims on a report by Egyptian scientist
Tarik el Nimar that appeared in the Egyptian paper al Bayan, Maariv
said.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Silvan Shalom issued a statement calling
the allegations ``baseless'' and reaffirming Israel's commitment to
the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

Singapore currency, stocks rally for second day 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Currency and stock markets strengthened
Thursday for a second day in Singapore, riding the Asian euphoria
that followed the American-Japanese action to prop up the yen.
	   The key Straits Times Industrials Index closed up 25.71 points,
or 2.3 percent, from the opening level of 1,107.70. On Wednesday,
the index had gained 5 percent after sliding for more than two
weeks.
	   The Singapore dollar, along with other regional currencies, also
gained against the U.S. dollar. The U.S. currency was valued at
1.6581 Singapore dollars by the end of the Singapore business day
Thursday, compared with the local currency's five-month low of 1.75
on Tuesday.
	   Dealers said investor opinion that the Singapore market had been
oversold was also driving the dramatic rebound in share prices. The
benchmark index had hit a series of 9 1/2-year lows during the past
week.
	   But dealers were skeptical that the market would be able to
continue making heavy gains, as Asia's economic crisis is expected
to last another two to four years.

Japan prepares to tell world how it will fix its economy 
</HEADLINE>
By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Under intense pressure following a U.S. move to
prop up the plunging yen, Japanese leaders scrambled Thursday to
explain how they plan to bring the world's second largest economy
out of its deepest recession in 50 years.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, in an hour-long nationally
televised news conference, said the nation's economic health would
improve after the government implements its latest stimulus plan.
	   He also pledged that his government would come up with a plan to
clean up the problem of bad loans at the nation's banks.
	   Declining financial markets and worries about banks had severely
discouraged consumers, Hashimoto said, conceding that his
government's decision to raise the nation's sales tax last year had
hurt the economy.
	   ``Japan has fallen into a state of excessive lack of
confidence,'' Hashimoto said. ``These are very hard times.''
	   The prime minister made the comments just hours before a group
of U.S. finance officials was scheduled to arrive in Tokyo.
	   The delegation, headed by Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers, was to attend a series of private talks with Japanese
leaders, and a broader meeting of international finance officials
was set for Saturday.
	   On Wednesday, the United States joined Japan in intervening in
currency markets to support the sinking yen.
	   The dollar sales pushed the U.S. currency down more than 5 yen
from its previous day's level in Tokyo, a drop of 3.6 percent. In
late Tokyo trading Thursday, one dollar bought 136.88 yen compared
with 142.00 yen late Wednesday.
	   The dollar's decline took some of the pressure off Asia's
troubled economies, where it was feared excessive yen weakness
could deepen the region's currency crisis.
	   But the problems that first drove the yen lower remained
unresolved. In the eight years since Japan's high-growth economy
ground to a halt, the troubles in the nation's financial and real
estate sectors have only worsened.
	   In meetings scheduled for Friday and Saturday, Japan is expected
to outline for international finance officials its plans for
finally cleaning up the mountain of bad loans at the nation's
banks.
	   Hashimoto said repeatedly during his news conference that ``bad
debts must be cleared from the banks' balance sheets,'' although he
offered no concrete proposals.
	   Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said Thursday that ministry
officials and politicians are meeting to discuss measures for
resolving the bad-loan problems and that he will explain them to
Summers.
	   Politicians from Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party have
promised recently to draft legislation to fix the bank mess before
an upper house election July 12.
	   Matsunaga, who was to meet with Summers on Friday, denied media
reports here that Japan had promised a permanent income tax cut in
exchange for U.S. support of the yen.
	   Hashimoto also avoided making any commitment to extending income
tax cuts beyond next year. A one-time tax cut included in the
government's 16 trillion yen (dlrs 117 billion) economic stimulus
plan has been criticized as unlikely to do much to boost the
economy.
	   Japan's financial system is struggling with 77 trillion yen
(dlrs 562 billion) in bad loans, many left from the collapse of the
real-estate market in the early 1990s.
	   ``The important thing for Japan is to resolve the bad debt
problem as early as possible,'' said Eisuke Sakakibara, a vice
minister at the Finance Ministry who was scheduled to meet with
Summers late Thursday.
	   The bad-loan problem has curtailed economic growth by making
banks reluctant to make new loans to even healthy companies.
	   Japan announced last week that its economy was in recession,
raising concerns that it would drive its troubled neighbors deeper
into their own economic slumps.
	   Japan called for a meeting in Tokyo on Saturday of finance
officials from around the world to discuss the Asian economic
situation, Matsunaga said.
	   Finance officials from the Group of Seven, which includes
Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Germany and the United
States, are expected to attend along with as many as 22 senior
officials from the ``Manila Framework Group'' of Asian countries.
Representatives from the International Monetary Fund, the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank were also expected to attend.

Second Chinese teen-ager rescued from cave dies

	   BEIJING (AP) _ The second of two teen-age girls rescued after 42
days lost in a cave in southwest China has died in a hospital, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday.
	   Li Qingzhu, 16, died of heart failure Wednesday, two days after
her 19-year-old schoolmate Liang Xiaofei had died, the news agency
said.
	   The girls and two other friends entered the cave near Jinzitian
village in Guizhou province on an outing May 2 without informing
anyone. They got lost when their candles went out.
	   The other two died of starvation during the ordeal, but Li and
Liang managed to survive on water but without food. Four people
exploring the countryside discovered the two girls Saturday.

New parliament convenes in Hungary 
</HEADLINE>
By EVA KEKES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary's new parliament convened
Thursday, the first formal step toward seating a conservative
government which promises tax cuts and swifter economic
improvements.
	   The session marks the debut of a new power structure led by the
Young Democrats-Civic Party, who won the most votes in last month's
elections and concluded a coalition agreement Tuesday with the
Smallholders Party.
	   The new coalition replaces a Socialist-led government whose
strict austerity policies won plaudits from economists and made
Hungary a frontrunner in European Union accession talks, but left
many cash-strapped voters disgruntled.
	   President Arpad Goencz told the new assembly that ``your work
will determine how the people will feel about the extent of
democracy in the country.''
	   ``People have voted for their future, which they want to be
peaceful and predictable,'' he said.
	   He praised the outgoing government for having established strong
foundations for a market economy, but noted that the country's
transformation remains at a critical.
	   ``Although the economy is strong and we have good chances to
maintain a sustainable economic growth, we are at the very
beginning of our road of transformation, and our achievements are
very fragile,'' he said.
	   Difficulties in adapting to the free-market economy prompted
Hungarians to vote out of power the former government, composed by
Gyula Horn's Socialists and the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats.
	   The leader of the new center-right coalition will be Young
Democrats-Civic Party chairman Viktor Orban, who was formally
invited by Goencz on Thursday to form the new government.
	   The Young Democrats occupy 147 seats in the 386-seat unicameral
legislature. Their coalition partners will be the agrarian-based
Independent Smallholders Party, with 48 seats, and the center-right
Hungarian Democratic Forum, with 18 seats.
	   The Socialists will be the biggest opposition party, with 134
deputies. The Free Democrats will have 24 seats, and there will be
one independent deputy.
	   Also in parliament are the ultra-right, xenophobic and
anti-Semitic Hungarian Truth and Life Party, with 14 seats, with
whom all other parliamentary parties have excluded cooperation at
any level.
	   A speaker was expected to be elected later Thursday _ expected
to be Young Democrats vice chairman Janos Ader.
	   The Smallholders will have four ministerial portfolios,
including the Ministry of Agriculture and Regional Development that
will be led by party head Jozsef Torgyan.
	   Other portfolios of strategic importance, such as the Defense
Ministry and the Environment Protection Ministry, also go to them,
and they will hold a post of ministry without portfolio,
controlling EU funds.
	   The Hungarian Democratic Forum will have one ministerial post,
the Justice Ministry.

India rejects proposals for Pakistan's participation in ASEAN forum 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ India has rejected proposals to
invite Pakistan to a security forum next month of high officials
from Southeast Asian nations and other countries, an official said
Thursday.
	   Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said India's
minister of state for foreign affairs, Vasundhra Raje, told him of
her country's position on Pakistan's participation at a meeting
late Wednesday.
	   India set off three underground nuclear explosions on May 11 and
two more on May 13. Pakistan, which has fought three wars with
India, responded with tests of its own.
	   Siazon said Raje told him that the problem is ``essentially
between India and Pakistan and that they should be given the
opportunity and ample time to work on this bilateral problem and
hopefully present a common solution.''
	   Raje was in Manila for an overnight stop on a four-day tour,
also including visits to Vietnam and Singapore, that is aimed at
winning friends in the aftermath of its nuclear tests.
	   Siazon is chairman this year of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, which is holding a meeting of its ASEAN Regional
Forum, a security grouping, in Manila July 27.
	   Siazon said he explained to Raje the forum's proposal to include
Pakistan in the meeting to prevent a ``one-sided'' discussion since
India is already a member.
	   Siazon said Raje told him that a meeting between the prime
ministers of the two countries is being arranged in the near future
and that mediation by the forum before that meeting is
``premature.''
	   ``If that is the case then maybe I will not insist on Pakistan's
participation either as an ad hoc member or observer or guest,''
Siazon said he told Raje.
	   Siazon said Raje turned down the proposal and even asked him to
delete any mention of the two countries' names in discussions on
the nuclear issue.
	   In an ASEAN meeting in Manila in May, India successfully lobbied
against a proposal for a statement condemning India's nuclear
tests.
	   ASEAN consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   Its dialogue partners in the ASEAN Regional Forum are Australia,
Cambodia, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Russia, South Korea and the United
States.

Thai juvenile inmates riot after orders to stop watching World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A guard who set off a riot in a youth
detention center by slapping an inmate for staying up late to watch
a World Cup soccer match could lose his job, a juvenile court judge
said Thursday.
	   Prapas Kongwannat, a supervisor at the center 210 kilometers
(130 miles) northeast of Bangkok, allegedly slapped Viranyu
Chomchai, 17, and scolded his companions for staying up beyond
their bedtime to watch Tuesday's match between Scotland and Norway.
	   ``If it is concluded that Prapas had committed a serious
violation, then it's likely that he could be transferred from his
position or removed from the civil service entirely,'' said Chaipat
Chulapak, chief judge of the province's Juvenile and Family Court.
	   An investigation is expected to be concluded Friday, he said.
	   Angered at the action of Prapas, who several news reports said
was intoxicated, more than 300 inmates went on a rampage,
destroying property worth an estimated 250,000 baht (dlrs 6,000),
said Chaipat.
	   One inmate climbed on to the roof and shouted demands for
Prapas' immediate transfer, reported the newspaper Bangkok Post,
which said that two officials were injured among the 100 who tried
to calm the young offenders.
	   The chaos died down after deputy provincial governor Suwat
Chokesuwattanasakul entered the building with television crews and
met with six youth leaders.
	   The youth leaders, who told Suwat they were often subjected to
cruel punishment from the guards, offered an apology for the riot.
They asked to be pardoned in return for cleaning up the place.
	   Chaipat said the center's rules on television watching and other
regulations could be relaxed.
	   ``Our aim here is rehabilitation. We are not out to get anybody
but it's important that both the youths and the officials follow
the rules,'' said Chaipat.
	   The center has 114 staff and houses 750 offenders, mostly
brought in on drug and theft charges.

U.N. missile experts end search for Iraqi warheads 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A team of U.N. weapons experts left Iraq
Thursday after concluding a month-long search for Iraqi missile
warheads, the top U.N. weapons official in Baghdad said.
	   Nils Carlstrom said 27 arms monitors under German Jean Jano
completed their large-scale excavation at al-Nibai, the site where
Iraq unilaterally destroyed and buried a great number of its
long-range missiles and special warheads.
	   He would not say whether the experts had accounted for all the
missing warheads which Iraq had filled with chemical and biological
agents.
	   The experts, using magnetic and electro-magnetic sensors,
unearthed steel and aluminum canisters the Iraqis had filled with
toxic agents. They also dug up metal parts belonging to
conventional warheads.
	   The Iraqis said there were enough pieces to reconstruct the 48
special warheads they had before the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Carlstrom declined comment on the Iraqi claim.
	   The parts are now stored in a warehouse in Taji, 20 kilometers
(12 miles) north of Baghdad. The United Nations intends to send
another team of experts to analyze the scrap.
	   Work at al-Nibai, 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of Baghdad,
began in 1992. The United Nations sent scores of teams to the site
in a bid to prove Iraq's claim that it had destroyed its banned
missiles and warheads.
	   Carlstrom did not say whether more work will be needed at
al-Nibai. He only said: ``We have a lot of work ahead of us in the
coming two months.''
	   Iraq and the United Nations reached an agreement Sunday on a
two-month timetable to bring disarmament activities in the country
to an end. Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler, who ended
his latest Baghdad visit Monday, has said work in the long-range
ballistic missile sphere is about to be completed.
	   He said the dig at al-Nibai will put the warhead issue on the
back burner. But still, he added, Iraq will need to come clean on
missile fuel and domestic production of long-range missiles.
	   U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990
will not be lifted until Baghdad proves it has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs as well as its
long-range missiles.

World Cup: Aging Bulgaria tries to slow Super Eagles again 
</HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Ask Taribo West what he thinks about Bulgaria and
the Nigerian defender drops his tough-guy demeanor. ``They're the
same as four years ago,'' West chuckles, ``but older.''
	   The two countries play Friday at the Parc des Princes in a
rematch of a group game at the 1994 World Cup, when the quicker,
slicker Nigerians cruised to a 3-0 win.
	   The Super Eagles are still playing the same no-holds-barred
brand of high-flying soccer that took them to the second round then
and the Olympic title in 1996.
	   And Nigeria's defense still leaves something to be desired _
Bulgaria coach Hristo Bonev called it ``the weak point'' _ leaving
the team to try to outscore its opponent.
	   The tactic worked in Nigeria's Group D opener, a 3-2 victory
over favored Spain that saw the Africans rally twice from one-goal
holes. The team has extra incentive to beat Bulgaria, with
authorities in Lagos promising match bonuses of dlrs 15,000 per man
for a win.
	   ``Winning that first match helps,'' said Bora Milutinovic, who
became the first coach to win World Cup matches with four different
countries.
	   ``A lot depends now on how you control your emotions. No one can
put pressure on you if you don't want it.''
	   Spain exposed a big gap on the right side of the defense, which
was manned by Mobi Oparaku, a stocky 21-year-old making his seventh
appearance in the green-and-white.
	   Bulgaria could cause trouble there as well.
	   Hristo Stoichkov may have lost a step or two at 32, but is still
crafty and made dangerous runs up the left flank in Bulgaria's
opening 0-0 draw with Paraguay. He was joint top-scorer at the last
World Cup, when Bulgaria made it to the semifinals, shocking
defending champion Germany en route.
	   ``We know him and respect him,'' Nigerian 'keeper Peter Rufai
said of the 1994 European Player of the Year. ``I know he has some
skills and one real weapon, the free kick. ... We know he and the
others want revenge.''
	   Stoichkov will likely be partnered by Emil Kostadinov, who came
off the bench against Paraguay. In his last trip to the Parc des
Princes, on the last day of European qualifying for USA '94,
Kostadinov scored twice in a 2-1 defeat of France.
	   Bonev, who played at the 1970 and 1974 World Cups, has other
changes in store.
	   Gocho Guintchev trained with the first 11 this week in defender
Ivaylo Iordanov's spot, while Marian Hristov looks set to fill in
at right back for Anatoly Nankov, who received the first red card
of the tournament. In addition, midfielder Ilian Iliev is fighting
a hamstring injury and might be ruled out.
	   No matter who plays, it is unlikely Bulgaria will keep up with
Nigeria's pace and versatility.
	   Against Paraguay, Bulgaria used seven players who are 30 or
older, a stark contrast to Nigeria's youth.
	   Early this week, Milutinovic said, ``You don't change a team
that won,'' before suddenly closing the doors on his
previously-open practice sessions.
	   He may opt to use Nwankwo Kanu, who is 19 months removed from
heart surgery and when fit is the team's most skilled attacker, or
Daniel Amokachi, fully recovered from a twisted knee, for the first
time in France if the offense drags Friday.

Taiwan hopes for the best from Clinton China summit 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan expects U.S. President Bill
Clinton's Beijing visit will benefit regional stability, but it
will loudly protest any sacrifice of its interests, Foreign
Minister Jason Hu said Thursday.
	   Clinton's summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin next week
may even benefit Beijing-Taipei relations, Hu told reporters.
	   ``Of course we would like to see the so-called win-win-win
situation develop,'' Hu said, referring to the U.S. model of
improved three-way relations between Taipei, Washington and
Beijing.
	   But Taiwan will show its displeasure if Clinton accepts Chinese
demands for formal concessions on Taiwan, Hu said.
	   ``We will cry out. We will let you know if we are feeling
insecure,'' he said.
	   Taiwan has a contingency ``task force,'' ready to act in the
event of U.S. concessions on Taiwan, Hu said without giving
additional details. Taiwan has strong support in Congress, and a
formidable Washington lobbying organization.
	   China has been pushing Washington to put policy guidelines into
writing, including assurances the United States would not support
an independent Taiwanese republic or back Taiwan's entry into the
United Nations.
	   Taiwan considers this a serious interference in its statehood,
Hu said. Such a statement would allow China to define as it wished
what exactly constitutes Taiwan independence, he added.
	   ``It's not the substance, but the format that we're worried
about,'' Hu said.
	   Clinton and Jiang will meet June 27-28 in Beijing during the
first U.S. presidential visit to China in nine years. Taiwan, which
Beijing claims as a renegade province, is expected to be on the
agenda.
	   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government driven off
China's mainland by Communist forces in 1949.
	   The Nationalists formally hold to the concept of eventual
reunification, but the main opposition party calls for formal and
permanent independence from China.
	   Many Taiwanese worry that the United States will sacrifice
Taiwan's interests in its rush to enhance Beijing ties, said Andrew
Yang, secretary-general of the independent Chinese Council of
Advanced Policy Studies.
	   Those fears are born largely of the fact Taiwan has no say in
the forming of U.S. policy toward it because it has no diplomatic
relations with Washington, Yang said.
	   Washington broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1979 to
recognize Beijing.
	   But Taiwan may benefit if the United States encourages Beijing
to restart negotiations with Taipei, Yang said.
	   Beijing broke off those talks in 1995 in anger over a perceived
drift toward formal independence in Taiwan.
	   Shen Lyu-shun, Foreign Ministry director general for North
American affairs, said Taiwan is ``concerned but not worried''
about the summit's impact on Taiwan.
	   Scholar Chao Chun-shan, writing in the China Times, said Taiwan
should be optimistic about the summit.
	   ``Leaders from the two sides have gone out of their way to
prevent Taiwan becoming an interfering element that would block
their burgeoning cooperation,'' Chao wrote.

Fossilized dinosaur dung may shed light on T. rex eating habits AP Science Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By MALCOLM RITTER
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ That T. rex was a chewer isn't in doubt. But did
the big meat-eater crunch the bones?
	   Researchers have found a big piece of fossilized dinosaur dung
that contains what may be the first direct evidence that
Tyrannosaurus rex chomped the bones of its prey to pieces instead
of gulping them down in big chunks.
	   The 65-million-year-old lump is apparently the biggest fecal
fossil known from a meat-eater. It was found in southwestern
Saskatchewan, Canada, and because of its size, scientists think it
came from a T. rex.
	   The whitish-gray mass is littered with bone fragments from a
young dinosaur.
	   Up to now, there had been no sign that T. rex and its two-legged
cousins mashed up bones before swallowing, said Thomas Holtz Jr., a
dinosaur expert from the University of Maryland who was not
involved in the study.
	   Instead, he said, most scientists suspected the meat-eaters
either avoided bone or tore off huge chunks of their prey and
simply swallowed whatever bone chunks came with it.
	   T. rex couldn't chew as people do because its upper and lower
teeth didn't meet each other. But those powerful teeth might have
still pulverized bone as they sheared past each other, said Gregory
Erickson of Stanford University, one of the scientists reporting
the find.
	   The fossil, some 17 inches (43 centimeters) long, 5 inches (13
centimeters) high and 6 inches (15 centimeters) wide, was found
sticking out of a hillside in 1995 near the town of Eastend.
	   ``It doesn't look like your typical dog doo-doo on the side of
the road,'' said Timothy Tokaryk, supervisor of the Eastend Fossil
Research Station. He and other scientists describe the find in
today's issue of the journal Nature.
	   Dung fossils are called coprolites. They have been found on
every continent, but few have been linked to dinosaurs with any
confidence.
	   The new specimen is more than twice as big as any previously
reported coprolite from a meat-eating animal, the researchers said.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine plans to boost its natural gas
production and bring down gas consumption with the aim of fully
abolishing gas imports, a news agency reported Thursday.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Holubchenko said Ukraine
would bring its gas production to 30 billion cubic meters (1
trillion cubic feet) by 2005 from 18.1 billion cubic meters (633
billion cubic feet) in 1997.
	   At the same time, gas consumption would be reduced by 15 billion
cubic meters (525 billion cubic feet), he said Wednesday at a
meeting in Kiev with representatives of the British Petroleum
company, according to the Interfax news agency.

Japan prepares to tell world how it will fix its economy 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Summers arriving in Tokyo, grafs 7-8
By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Under intense pressure following a U.S. move to
prop up the plunging yen, Japanese leaders scrambled Thursday to
explain how they plan to bring the world's second largest economy
out of its deepest recession in 50 years.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, in an hour-long nationally
televised news conference, said the nation's economic health would
improve after the government implements its latest stimulus plan.
	   He also pledged that his government would come up with a plan to
clean up the problem of bad loans at the nation's banks.
	   Declining financial markets and worries about banks had severely
discouraged consumers, Hashimoto said, conceding that his
government's decision to raise the nation's sales tax last year had
hurt the economy.
	   ``Japan has fallen into a state of excessive lack of
confidence,'' Hashimoto said. ``These are very hard times.''
	   The prime minister made the comments just hours before a
delegation of U.S. finance officials, headed by Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, arrived in Tokyo.
	   Summers said only that he looked forward to ``discussing a range
of economic issues between the United States and Japan.''
	   The U.S. group was to attend a series of private talks with
Japanese leaders, and a broader meeting of international finance
officials was set for Saturday.
	   On Wednesday, the United States joined Japan in intervening in
currency markets to support the sinking yen.
	   The dollar sales pushed the U.S. currency down more than 5 yen
from its previous day's level in Tokyo, a drop of 3.6 percent. In
late Tokyo trading Thursday, one dollar bought 136.88 yen compared
with 142.00 yen late Wednesday.
	   The dollar's decline took some of the pressure off Asia's
troubled economies, where it was feared excessive yen weakness
could deepen the region's currency crisis.
	   But the problems that first drove the yen lower remained
unresolved. In the eight years since Japan's high-growth economy
ground to a halt, the troubles in the nation's financial and real
estate sectors have only worsened.
	   In meetings scheduled for Friday and Saturday, Japan is expected
to outline for international finance officials its plans for
finally cleaning up the mountain of bad loans at the nation's
banks.
	   Hashimoto said repeatedly during his news conference that ``bad
debts must be cleared from the banks' balance sheets,'' although he
offered no concrete proposals.
	   Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said Thursday that ministry
officials and politicians are meeting to discuss measures for
resolving the bad-loan problems and that he will explain them to
Summers.
	   Politicians from Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party have
promised recently to draft legislation to fix the bank mess before
an upper house election July 12.
	   Matsunaga, who was to meet with Summers on Friday, denied media
reports here that Japan had promised a permanent income tax cut in
exchange for U.S. support of the yen.
	   Hashimoto also avoided making any commitment to extending income
tax cuts beyond next year. A one-time tax cut included in the
government's 16 trillion yen (dlrs 117 billion) economic stimulus
plan has been criticized as unlikely to do much to boost the
economy.
	   Japan's financial system is struggling with 77 trillion yen
(dlrs 562 billion) in bad loans, many left from the collapse of the
real-estate market in the early 1990s.
	   ``The important thing for Japan is to resolve the bad debt
problem as early as possible,'' said Eisuke Sakakibara, a vice
minister at the Finance Ministry who was scheduled to meet with
Summers late Thursday.
	   The bad-loan problem has curtailed economic growth by making
banks reluctant to make new loans to even healthy companies.
	   Japan announced last week that its economy was in recession,
raising concerns that it would drive its troubled neighbors deeper
into their own economic slumps.
	   Japan called for a meeting in Tokyo on Saturday of finance
officials from around the world to discuss the Asian economic
situation, Matsunaga said.
	   Finance officials from the Group of Seven, which includes
Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Germany and the United
States, are expected to attend along with as many as 22 senior
officials from the ``Manila Framework Group'' of Asian countries.
Representatives from the International Monetary Fund, the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank were also expected to attend.

By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - A team of U.N. weapons experts left Iraq
Thursday after concluding a month-long search for Iraqi missile
warheads, the top U.N. weapons official in Baghdad said.
	   Nils Carlstrom said 27 arms monitors under German Jean Jano
completed their large-scale excavation at al-Nibai, the site where
Iraq unilaterally destroyed and buried a great number of its
long-range missiles and special warheads.
	   He would not say whether the experts had accounted for all the
missing warheads which Iraq had filled with chemical and biological
agents.
	   The experts, using magnetic and electro-magnetic sensors,
unearthed steel and aluminum canisters Iraqis had filled with toxic
agents. They also dug up metal parts belonging to conventional
warheads.
	   The Iraqis say the pieces are enough to reconstruct the 48
special warheads they had before the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait.
	   Carlstrom declined comment on the Iraqi claim.
	   The parts are now stored in a warehouse in Taji, 20 kilometers
(12 miles) north of Baghdad. The United Nations intends to send
another team of experts to analyze the scrap.
	   Work at al-Nibai, 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of Baghdad
began in 1992. The United Nations sent scores of teams to the site
in a bid to prove Iraq's claim that it had destroyed its banned
missiles and warheads.
	   Carlstrom did not say whether more work will be needed at
al-Nibai. He only said: ``We have a lot of work ahead of us in the
coming two months.''
	   Iraq and the United Nations reached an agreement Sunday on a
two-month timetable to bring disarmament activities in the country
to an end. Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler, who ended
his latest Baghdad visit Monday, has said work in the long-range
ballistic missile sphere is about to be completed.
	   He said the dig at al-Nibai will put the warhead issue on the
back burner. But still, he added, Iraq will need to come clean on
missile fuel and domestic production of long-range missiles.
	   U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990
will not be lifted until Baghdad proves it has destroyed all
weapons of mass destruction, including chemical, biological and
nuclear, as well as long-range missiles.

A dynasty is emerging in the NHL AP Hockey Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By KEN RAPPOPORT
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Suddenly, the NHL has a dynasty _ or as close to
one as you can get these days.
	   It's the Detroit Red Wings, who have won two straight Stanley
Cups and made the finals three of the last four years. Following
their second straight sweep in the finals, the Red Wings are now
talking three-peat.
	   ``It's a nice feeling winning back to back,'' Brendan Shanahan
said after the Red Wings wrapped up the finals by beating the
Washington Capitals 4-1 Tuesday night. ``It would be better to win
three.''
	   No team has won three straight Stanley Cups since the New York
Islanders took four in a row from 1980-83. Even the great Edmonton
Oiler teams of the '80s couldn't do it, although they did win five
in seven years.
	   Dynastic possibilities for the Red Wings? Steve Yzerman thinks
the ingredients are there for his team to be competitive for many
years.
	   ``I expect they will look to bring the guys back for another
year,'' Yzerman said. ``I expect this team to be very competitive
again for the next year and the years after just because the core
of our team is very youthful _ and I expect that they'll stay
together.''
	   The Red Wings became the first team to win consecutive
championships since the Pittsburgh Penguins did it 1991-92. They're
the first NHL team to sweep consecutive finals since the Islanders
did it in 1982 and 1983.
	   In winning the Stanley Cup, the Red Wings finished a bittersweet
season for themselves and a tumultuous year for the NHL.
	   The Red Wings dedicated their season to defenseman Vladimir
Konstantinov and team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov, who were disabled
in an auto accident following last year's Stanley Cup victory.
	   The wheelchair-bound Konstantinov was present at the MCI Center
to watch the clincher and joined his teammates on the ice as they
celebrated with the Stanley Cup.
	   ``There's no speech you can come up with or story you can tell
that equates anywhere near what that team has gone through,''
Washington coach Ron Wilson said.
	   In an extended hockey season marked by an unprecedented break
for the Olympics, which produced early exits by Canada and the
United States and a trashed suite, the Red Wings brought some
constancy with a second straight title.
	   Even though they were the defending champions, the Red Wings
actually weren't necessarily the favorites. Not only had they lost
one of their top defenseman in Konstantinov, there were other
factors that impacted them during the season.
	   Most notably, the trade of their Conn Smythe-winning goaltender
Mike Vernon and the absence of superstar free agent Sergei Fedorov,
who waged a long contract battle with the Red Wings before joining
them late in the season.
	   For the first time in history, the NHL sent players to the
Olympics. The league might have regretted it, after some players
from the underachieving U.S. team caused an international incident
by trashing their room at Nagano. Canada, another early favorite,
was also knocked out as the Czech Republic swept to the gold medal
behind goaltender Dominik Hasek.
	   With a record-tying 165 ties during the season, the NHL showed
how balanced it was. The close play continued in the playoffs.
	   Such teams as New Jersey, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh _ the
1-2-3 teams in the Eastern Conference _ made early exits. That
opened the door for the fourth-seeded Capitals to advance to the
finals. Along the way, the Capitals eliminated the Sabres and
Hasek, most everyone's choice to win the most valuable player award
after a 13-shutout season.
	   Things went more according to form in the West as Detroit
emerged after beating Phoenix, St. Louis and Dallas, which finished
with the best record during the regular season. Fedorov, back with
the Red Wings after signing a substantial contract, was in prime
form, as was Yzerman, who eventually was named the playoffs' MVP,
and Chris Osgood, who had supplanted Vernon as the Red Wings' No. 1
goalie.
	   Bowman thought that after the Red Wings beat the Blues, they had
a good shot to win the Cup.
	   ``When we played St. Louis, a lot of people tried to say that
might be the Stanley Cup final,'' he said. ``They just swept (Los
Angeles). We had trouble with them during the season. When we got
them in the playoffs, we seemed to reach our goals.''
	   It wasn't official, however, until the Red Wings won four
straight from Washington in the finals.

Au pair returns to hometown that campaigned for her freedom 
</HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Finally, Louise Woodward got to see
firsthand the yellow ribbons and ``Justice for Louise'' banners
that have bedecked this quiet little village for so many months.
	   The former au pair returned to her north England hometown
Thursday after two years in the United States that saw her
convicted of manslaughter in the death of an 8-month-old baby in
her care.
	   ``It's a very emotional time for us,'' resident Audrey McCardle
said. ``We just want her to go home quietly, be with her family and
be left to get on with her life.''
	   After flying into London's Heathrow Airport and driving 180
miles (290 kms) to Manchester to hold a news conference, Ms.
Woodward, 20, traveled the last 30 miles (50 kms) to Elton in a
mini-van with both parents at her side.
	   She walked up the drive to the family home, where her younger
sister, Vicky, stood in the doorway. They hugged and went inside
for a private moment before coming back out to pose for a small
pool of photographers.
	   A ``Justice for Louise'' poster was still visible in a
downstairs window.
	   Despite police anticipation that hundreds of wellwishers would
line the roads to welcome Ms. Woodward home, Elton's streets were
deserted.
	   Christine Gray, a member of the committee campaigning for Ms.
Woodward's freedom, said residents wanted to avoid the champagne
celebrations so criticized when a judge reduced the au pair's
conviction from second-degree murder to manslaughter in November,
sentencing her to the 279 days she already had served.
	   ``I just feel very happy and I feel tearful,'' Mrs. Gray said.
``It's been a privilege to have been able to help an innocent
girl.''
	   Phil Ward of Newton-le-Willows in Yorkshire, a healthy drive
away, camped out in Elton overnight just to catch a glimpse of Ms.
Woodward.
	   ``I just burst into tears when I heard her,'' he said of her
press conference, viewed avidly all over Elton. ``Not tears of
sadness but tears of joy because she was back with their family
where she belongs.''

Port workers' strike hampers cargo, tourist ships 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Dock workers began a planned six-day
strike Thursday that threatens to paralyze Greece's main ports and
severely disrupt cargo and tourist traffic.
	   Port workers are protesting plans to privatize the Salonica and
Piraeus port authorities, part of the Socialist government's
efforts to trim its inflated public sector and qualify for the
European Union's single currency by 2001.
	   The strike is expected to create a severe backlog of cargo to be
unloaded from waiting ships, while tourists traveling on ferries
and cruise ships are also likely to face problems.
	   During the work protest, a skeleton staff will deal only with
cargoes of pharmaceutical, military and perishable goods, union
leaders said.
	   Participation in the strike was running at around 97 percent on
its first day, said Ioannis Georgoulakos, a spokesman for the port
workers union.
	   The government has said it intends to float 49 percent of the
port authorities on the stock exchange next year.

U.S. emergency rice shipments to arrive in Indonesia within two weeks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Emergency shipments of American rice
will arrive in Indonesia within two weeks as part of a dlrs 155
million U.S. humanitarian aid program for the economically
shattered nation, a U.S. aid official said Thursday.
	   Meanwhile, the Indonesian government said it will have to import
3.1 million tons of rice in 1998 to compensate for production
shortages caused by prolonged drought and crop failure. Last year,
Indonesia imported 350,000 tons of rice.
	   Plagued by financial turmoil, Indonesia has suffered big leaps
in inflation and unemployment, sparking deadly riots nationwide.
	   Millions of poor people have been especially hard hit, with
sporadic food shortages in some areas. There are fears of more
unrest if the situation worsens.
	   To alleviate the hardship, the U.S. Agency for International
Development, or USAID, is coordinating programs for food aid, loan
guarantees and job creation in the nation of 200 million people.
	   Fifty thousand tons of rice will be distributed to Indonesians
who are too poor to afford basic necessities, USAID director J.
Brian Atwood said in a statement.
	   Atwood, who is visiting Jakarta, said the first shipments of
rice will go to islands including Sumatra as well as the territory
of East Timor.
	   The aid is a response to an appeal from the United Nations World
Food Program, he said. It complements the efforts of the World
Bank, which has provided a dlrs 400 million loan to support food
purchases.
	   However, a dlrs 43 billion bailout plan fashioned by the
International Monetary Fund was suspended because of political
turmoil that led to the ouster last month of authoritarian
President Suharto after 32 years in power.
	   The U.S. aid includes dlrs 50 million worth of food as well as
dlrs 105 million in other humanitarian assistance, such as medical
supplies and funds for family planning programs.

Ukrainian gynecologist sentenced for neglect in death of patient 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ In a landmark case, a Ukrainian court
sentenced a gynecologist to two years in prison for neglect in the
death of her young patient, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Julia Onyshchenko, 19, died in March 1997 in a Kiev district
hospital after developing a post-natal inflammation of the uterus.
Onyshchenko's parents sued her doctor, Olga Kvochina, charging her
with criminal neglect, Kievskiye Vedomosti said.
	   A district court in Kiev sentenced Kvochina on Wednesday to two
years in prison and ordered her to pay 20,000 hryvna (dlrs 10,000)
in damages to the bereaved parents. However, the doctor will not
serve her sentence because of a state amnesty that would include
her, the daily reported.
	   The newspaper said it was apparently the first case in which a
Ukrainian doctor has been sentenced for harming a patient.
	   Its importance was highlighted by a report Thursday on the
recent death of a 14-year-old girl in a summer camp near the
central town of Vinnitsa.
	   The girl contracted measles, later complicated by pneumonia.
Camp medical staff attempted to treat her themselves and sent her
to a hospital when it was already too late to save her, Kievskiye
Vedomosti said.
	   Officials described the case as a ``medical mistake,'' and said
the girl's condition had not been assessed properly, the newspaper
added.

Government says no evidence to prosecute Arthur C. Clarke 
</HEADLINE>
By DILIP GANGULY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's justice minister said
Thursday the government would not prosecute its most famous
resident _ science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke _ after a
British tabloid reported he had sexually abused children.
	   ``There is not sufficient evidence to start prosecution,''
Justice Minister Lakshman Peiris said about the case sparked by a
February report in the Sunday Mirror.
	   Peiris would not elaborate, but an official at the Attorney
General's office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
investigators were on the verge of closing the case. He said they
were only waiting to hear the original tape Sunday Mirror reporters
made of an interview with Clarke, although they had listened to a
copy of the tape.
	   Peiris made the comments while announcing that his
administration was taking further steps to protect children from
abuse. He said the Parliament will debate and enact laws to form a
Child Protection Authority in about a month. The agency will have
its own police, legal officers and sweeping powers to investigate
allegations of child abuse.
	   ``This has been a neglected area for a long time,'' Peiris said.
	   This Indian Ocean island off the southern tip of India has long
had a reputation as a place where children are sexually exploited.
	   The case against Clarke was instituted after a presidential task
force formally asked Sri Lankan police to investigate the Mirror's
accusations. Clarke has denied the accusations.
	   The British-born Clarke, author of the science fiction classic
``2001: A Space Odyssey'' and 80 other books, has lived in Sri
Lanka since 1956.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ After 41 years living quietly along
the Atlantic coast southeast of Buenos Aires, Dino Sakic headed
home to Croatia on Thursday to face charges of World War II
atrocities.
	   The 76-year-old former concentration camp commander arrived in
Frankfurt aboard a commercial flight at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) en route
to Zagreb.
	   Four uniformed German police officers waited at the rear of the
plane, and escorted four men in business suits who came off the
aircraft to police vans parked on the tarmac. None of the men
coming off the plane was handcuffed.
	   Sakic, who was accompanied from Buenos Aires by three Croatian
police officers, was to be held at an airport jail until his flight
to Zagreb later in the afternoon.
	   A defense lawyer appointed by authorities in Croatia, Ivan Kern,
told Croatian television that Sakic is scheduled to give a brief
statement to the investigating judge Friday morning. Kern was to

Asian markets rebound, thanks to Japan's stronger yen 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES stock and currency figures; TRIMS
By PRISCILLA CHEUNG
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Across East Asia, traders enjoyed something
Thursday they hadn't seen for months: Japan's yen pulling out of
its tailspin with the U.S. dollar, and the region's battered stock
and currency markets recording some big gains.
	   Even China and Hong Kong, two critics of Japan's anemic economy
and the responses of its government, praised Tokyo for intervening
with Washington on behalf of the yen Wednesday.
	   ``This is exactly the type of thing that should happen,'' said
Jean-Michel Severino, a senior World Bank official, as the U.S.
dollar traded sharply lower against the yen in Tokyo Thursday, one
day after the United States and Japan jumped into global currency
markets to halt the yen's slide.
	   But others were less optimistic.
	   ``This is definitely not a turning point in the crisis,'' said
Carlton Poon, head of research for Worldsec International Ltd., in
Hong Kong. ``The fundamentals in Asia continue to deteriorate,''
and the markets cannot sustain the gains, he said.
	   A stronger yen could reduce the risk of more East Asian
economies slipping into recession as the one-year anniversary of
the region's financial crisis nears, Severino said.
	   Currency traders estimate that Washington sold dlrs 2 billion to
buy yen and that Tokyo sold a similar amount.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 136.88 yen, down 5.12 yen
from 142.00 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and but higher than its
late New York rate of 136.37 yen overnight. It ranged between
135.50 yen and 137.27 yen in Thursday's trading.
	   Following the lead of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which
gained 164.17 points Wednesday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei
Stock Average jumped 646.16 points, or 4.39 percent, closing at
15,361.54.
	   Shares also soared on other markets in the region.
	   The key Stock Exchange of Thailand index jumped more than 10
percent in early trading before profit-taking set it. It closed 8.1
percent higher at 295.15.
	   In South Korea, the key index climbed 7.1 percent, closing at
325.49 points.
	   Hong Kong's the blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed 6.4 percent
higher at 8,515.97 points as interbank interest rates eased. It had
gained 6.3 percent Wednesday.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 6.6 percent to
1,828.59, its heftiest gain in four months.
	   Share prices in Indonesia and Malaysia also rose, with Jakarta's
JSX Composite Index closing up 5 percent at 440.093 points, and
Kuala Lumpur's Composite Index rising 4.6 percent to 471.82 points.
	   After hitting a 9 1/2-year low earlier this week, Singapore's
Straits Times Industrials Index surged 5.6 percent at one point
before profit-taking trimmed some earlier gains. It closed up 2.3
percent at 1,133.41.
	   Taiwan's key Weighted Price Index jumped 4 percent to 7,768.31
points.
	   New Zealand's key NZSE-40 capital index closed up 1.6 percent at
2,031.96 points, and Australia's All Ordinaries Share Index jumped
2.3 percent, closing at 2,031.96 points.
	   Across Southeast Asia, currencies opened sharply higher Thursday
as well, following the rallying yen. But the dollar recovered
slightly in afternoon trading, with traders citing the region's
political uncertainties as reasons to buy the safe-haven U.S.
currency.
	   In late trading, the Indonesian rupiah was at 14,500 to the U.S.
dollar, up sharply from 16,850 late Wednesday.
	   The Malaysian ringgit was trading at a mid-range of 3.9550 to
the U.S. dollar, up from 4.0650 late Wednesday.
	   Against Thailand's baht, the U.S. dollar was at 41.25 baht, down
from 43.1250 late Wednesday in Asia.
	   Against Singapore's dollar, the U.S. dollar was at 1.6581, down
from 1.7190 late Wednesday.
	   For months, Japan's yen had been sliding against the U.S.
dollar, leading some economists to believe that the East Asian
financial crisis could enter a far more dangerous phase that would
hurt the United States and the rest of the world.
	   On Saturday, Group of Seven finance deputies, including U.S.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, will meet in Tokyo to
discuss the economic problems of Japan and many of its neighbors.
	   In a telephone conversation Wednesday, Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto told U.S. President Bill Clinton that his
government would speed efforts to pull Japan out of a deepening
recession. But Japan has many other problems, including mountains
of bad loans, rising unemployment and falling consumer spending.
	   The weak yen has made Japanese goods abroad cheaper,
undercutting products from other nations and provoking criticism
that Japan was trying to export its way out of trouble.

Officials deny Israel carried out nuclear test in Gulf of Aqaba defense minister 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPGRADES attribution in 5th graf, with statement by deputy
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Officials denied Thursday that Israel had
carried out a nuclear test in the Gulf of Aqaba, after two Israeli
legislators raised the matter in parliament.
	   Labor lawmaker Rafi Elul said Wednesday that he had heard
``rumors about an Israeli nuclear test'' in the gulf.
	   Democratic Arab Party member Abdul Wahab Darawshe added that he
had information that a neutron bomb test had been carried out on
May 28, causing an earthquake in the region, the Maariv newspaper
said.
	   Darawshe based his claims on a report by Egyptian scientist
Tarik el Nimar that appeared in the Egyptian paper al Bayan, Maariv
said.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Silvan Shalom issued a statement calling
the allegations ``baseless'' and reaffirming Israel's commitment to
the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
	   Elul did not reveal the source of his information.
	   ``The public has a right to know if Israel is carrying out
nuclear tests which could affect our security,'' Maariv quoted him
as saying. ``If in fact such tests were carried out ... this is a
public matter of the first order.''
	   Shai Feldman, head of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies,
said on Israel Radio that it is common after regional earthquakes
for many people, ``especially Egyptians,'' to accuse Israel of
carrying out nuclear tests.
	   ``Time and time again scientific tests have proved these
accusations false,'' he said. ``The factual and logical basis
behind this story is completely fictional.''

Pope receives Mandela in Vatican 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photo
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ A jaunty Nelson Mandela was greeted by Pope
John Paul II at the Vatican Thursday, returning as president of
South Africa eight years after his first visit as a newly released
prisoner.
	   ``Well, Your Holiness!'' Mandela said in a booming voice as he
strode down a hallway to meet the pontiff outside the papal
library. ``What an honor it is for me to meet Your Holiness
again.''
	   The two aging leaders -- Mandela one year older at 79 -- clasped
hands. ``Welcome to the Vatican,'' said John Paul.
	   ``Your Holiness is looking very well,'' Mandela said. The pope,
who has been ailing in recent years and walked with a cane during
the visit, smiled slightly.
	   ``God bless South Africa,'' John Paul said after their 25-minute
meeting.
	   The pope was a prominent voice condemning apartheid in the
1980s.
	   He has declared himself an admirer of Mandela, and once said he
was praying every day for his release from prison. Mandela was
jailed for 27 years by the apartheid regime.
	   He came to the Vatican five months after his release. After
being elected president in 1994, Mandela welcomed the pope in South
Africa.
	   Mandela showed his ease while introducing his entourage.
	   ``This is my boss,'' he joked, presenting his chief of staff.
	   On leaving, he wished the pope ``a long and healthy life.''

Aquino joins protest against Marcos burial in Heroes' Cemetery 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former President Corazon Aquino, who
helped topple dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, joined a protest
Thursday against a plan to bury him in Manila's Heroes' Cemetery.
	   ``He is not a hero,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``The Heroes' Cemetery
should be reserved for heroes of our country.''
	   Mrs. Aquino was among 200 people who joined the rally against a
decision by President-elect Joseph Estrada to allow Marcos' burial
in the cemetery nearly nine years after his death.
	   She said Marcos should be buried in his home province of Ilocos
Norte instead.
	   A coalition of 28 organizations has been demonstrating each day
this week against Marcos' burial at the Heroes' Cemetery.
	   Estrada, a former Marcos supporter, has approved plans by the
Marcos family for a burial on July 11, a source close to the family
said. Estrada said no state honors will be given.
	   Rene Saguisag, a human rights lawyer and a former senator, said
Estrada's approval of Marcos' burial is premature since he will
only become president on June 30.
	   ``Why is he in a hurry?'' Saguisag asked.
	   On Wednesday, workers began pouring cement at the planned burial
site for Marcos, a former soldier who died in exile in Hawaii in
September 1989, three years after he was ousted in a ``people
power'' revolt that ended his 20-year rule.
	   His body was not allowed back in the Philippines until 1993,
when it was flown to his hometown of Batac in northern Ilocos Norte
province and placed in a glass casket inside an air-conditioned
crypt.
	   President Fidel Ramos and his predecessor, Mrs. Aquino, refused
to allow Marcos to be buried at Heroes' Cemetery, in part because
of possible clashes between Marcos loyalists and opponents.
	   Last week, Marcos' widow, Imelda, said she has agreed to a
burial without state honors.
	   Mrs. Marcos had previously insisted on full state honors for her
husband. But many Filipinos, including those who suffered human
rights abuses during Marcos' rule, opposed the idea.

Two Saudis beheaded for kidnapping, raping boy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Two Saudi men were beheaded Thursday
for kidnapping and raping a young boy, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Turki bin Saad al-Qurshi was convicted of raping the boy after
kidnapping him with the help of Khaled bin Mahmas al-Maktami. The
boy's name and age were not revealed.
	   The men were executed in the holy city of Mecca in western Saudi
Arabia.
	   Their executions bring to 11 the number of people beheaded in
the kingdom this year. Last year, the 124 people were executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out in public with a sword.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
suspects are typically arrested without a warrant, tortured, denied
lawyers and not given opportunities to appeal.

Report: Selig will become baseball commissioner 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Selig comments to Milwaukee newspaper.
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bud Selig will drop the ``interim'' from in
front of his job title and officially take over as baseball
commissioner this year, The New York Times reported Thursday.
	   The announcement could be made by the All-Star Game, scheduled
July 7, the newspaper reported, quoting unidentified sources. One
owner, the newspaper said, predicted the announcement would be made
in 2-4 weeks.
	   Selig, 63, the Milwaukee Brewers owner, has been interim
commissioner for six years.
	   However, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Thursday that
Selig has not agreed to take the job on a permanent basis despite
pressure by other owners.
	   ``There's always been a great deal of speculation on this matter
but at this point in time I can assure you there is nothing
definitive,'' he told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
	   The Times quoted one official as saying ``an almost unified
ownership came to him and said you've got to do it; you're the only
one.'' That reportedly swayed Selig, who has said he didn't want
the job.
	   Election requires a 75 percent vote of baseball's 30 owners and,
according to the Times, Selig has the backing. Only a few owners
oppose Selig, notably Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox and
The Tribune Co., owner of the Chicago Cubs.
	   Rich Levin, a spokesman for baseball, told USA Today that Selig
``has accepted nothing. There are no meetings scheduled.''
	   Baseball has been without a commissioner since Fay Vincent was
forced out of office by the owners on Sept. 7, 1992. Selig was
named chairman of the executive council two days later.
	   The Times said Selig would likely put his share of the Brewers
into a trust. Selig's daughter runs the day-to-day operation of the
club.

China assails forced-abortion allegations as plot 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China defended its one-child policy Thursday and
called allegations in the U.S. Congress that the government uses
forced abortion an attempt to derail Chinese-U.S. relations.
	   An unidentified spokesman for the State Family Planning
Commission, in an interview with the official Xinhua News Agency,
rebutted testimony in Congress last week by a former family
planning official and personally attacked her character.
	   Gao Xiaoduan testified that her office in a Fujian province
township used paid informants to uncover unauthorized pregnancies.
She said families were threatened and their houses sometimes
destroyed unless the women submitted to abortions or
sterilizations.
	   The commission spokesman said an investigation found no forced
abortions were conducted on women nine months pregnant in Fujian's
Jinjiang city area nor were lethal injections used to kill the
fetuses _ as Gao supposedly claimed.
	   The spokesman, however, admitted that some officials in Fujian
committed unspecified abuses in carrying out the one-child policy
in 1996 and had been sentenced to two or more years in prison.
	   Questioning Gao's motives, the spokesman said the former
official fled China owing local credit cooperatives and villagers
more than 2 million yuan (dlrs 240,000). He did not say what the
money had been borrowed for.
	   The spokesman also took issue with Gao's partner in testimony,
Harry Wu, a former labor camp prisoner who has crusaded to expose
the abuses of China's vast penal colony.
	   ``Their purpose was to mislead and deceive the public and
undermine the normal development of the relations between China and
the United States,'' Xinhua paraphrased the spokesman as saying.
	   The spokesman defended the one-child policy, saying that without
it, China's population would now exceed 1.5 billion, instead of 1.2
billion, the largest of any country in the world.
	   He reiterated the government's stance that the policy does not
condone the use of coercive tactics. Exceptions in the policy have
allowed many families to have two children, he said, adding that in
Gao's Jinjiang area, a 1995 survey found that more than half the
women of childbearing age had two or more children.

	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Excerpts from the news conference by
au pair Louise Woodward upon her return from the United States,
where she was convicted of manslaughter in the death of 8-month-old
Matthew Eappen:
	   ``I feel great sorrow for the death of baby Matthew. But like
I've said time and time again, I had nothing to do with his death.
I did not hurt Matthew and I did not kill baby Matthew. I just hope
that the medical community will take up my case now that all
avenues of appeal are closed now, to help prove my innocence.''
	   ``With the missing medical evidence, I didn't receive a fair
trial and I think the only way to do it now is through educating
people. I'm all in favor of educating people about shaken baby
syndrome, because I think there really isn't enough known about it,
and hopefully prevent mistakes being made and a rush to judgment
like what happened in my case.''
	   ``I would like to go to university like I was planning to do in
the first place. I'd like to do what any other 20-year-old would
do. I would like to get a part-time job, you know, do a few other
things.''
	   ``I've grown up an awful lot. I know too much about American
law. I hope it will have changed me for the better, but I guess
only time will tell how it's really changed me.''
	   ``Of course, I am upset I have got a conviction, but it is a
conviction I don't deserve and I think in time the truth will come
out. I think in time I will be cleared.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Across East Asia, traders enjoyed something
Thursday they hadn't seen for months: Japan's yen pulling out of
its tailspin with the U.S. dollar, and the region's battered stock
and currency markets recording some big gains. In late afternoon,
the dollar bought 136.88 yen, down 5.12 yen from 142.00 yen late
Wednesday in Tokyo, but higher than its late New York rate of
136.37 yen overnight. It ranged between 135.50 yen and 137.27 yen
in Thursday's trading. Following the lead of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, which gained 164.17 points Wednesday, the Tokyo
Stock Exchange's Nikkei Stock Average jumped 646.16 points, or 4.39
percent, closing at 15,361.54. In Thailand, the key Stock Exchange
of Thailand index jumped more than 10 percent in early trading
before profit-taking set it. It closed 8.1 percent higher at
295.15. In South Korea, the key index climbed 7.1 percent, closing
at 325.49 points. Hong Kong's the blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed
6.4 percent higher at 8,515.97 points as interbank interest rates
eased. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Quickening the pace of its economic
restructuring, South Korea on Thursday announced a list of 55
companies it deems so financially weak they should be liquidated.
Although the firms have debts totaling dlrs 12.14 billion, most are
small and analysts viewed the government's action as at best a
first step toward revamping the nation's industries. The move was
the latest in a series of reforms South Korea has promised to the
International Monetary Fund in exchange for a dlrs 58 billion
bailout in December. (SKOREA-ECONOMY)
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia is still suffering sharp
falls in the number of tourists from Asia, with latest figures
Thursday showing an almost 80 percent slump in visitors from South
Korea. The overall number of visitors from Southeast Asia fell by
almost 20 percent in May from the same month last year, and from
Northeast Asia by more than 11 percent in the same period, the
official Australia Bureau of Statistics reported. In addition to a
78 percent fall in visitor numbers from Korea, figures for Thailand
were down almost 60 percent, from Malaysia down 36 percent and
Indonesia down 23 percent. But there was some good news, with a 2.2
percent rise in the number of visitors from Japan, Australia's
biggest tourist source, the bureau said. (AUSTRALIA-TOURISTS)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Declining imports helped the
Philippines post a current account surplus in the first two months
of this year, a turnaround from the sizable deficit registered a
year earlier, the government said Thursday. The surplus in the
current account _ a broad measure of financial flows from trade,
tourism, and other services _ totaled dlrs 131 million in the two
months compared to a deficit of dlrs 437 million in the year
earlier period, the central bank said. The surplus represents far
better performance than the government's dlrs 241 million deficit
projection for the period under a two-year, dlrs 1.4 billion
standby loan arrangement with the International Monetary Fund. The
country's trade deficit has been declining since October 1997 on a
year-on-year basis mainly due to a slowdown in imports caused by
the weak peso. (PHILIPPINES-CURRENT ACCOUNT)
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Hong Kong chief executive Tung
Chee Hwa said Thursday that Asia faces economic difficulties ``for
a number of quarters'' to come, but that he expects the region to
rebound ``quite quickly'' once the upturn begins. ``Obviously we
are pleased with the rebound of the yen,'' Tung said, responding to
the overnight intervention of the United States and Japan to boost
the ailing Japanese currency. Tung, the chief executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region, is in Wellington, where he met
Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and other senior Cabinet ministers.
Earlier in the day he welcomed an announcement that New Zealand had
removed visa requirements for travel by Hong Kong residents to New
Zealand.(NEW ZEALAND-YEN-TUNG)

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Under intense pressure following a U.S. move to
prop up the plunging yen, Japanese leaders scrambled Thursday to
explain how they plan to bring the world's second largest economy
out of its deepest recession in 50 years. Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, in an hour-long nationally televised news conference,
said the nation's economic health would improve after the
government implements its latest stimulus plan. He also pledged
that his government would come up with a plan to clean up the
problem of bad loans at the nation's banks. Declining financial
markets and worries about banks had severely discouraged consumers,
Hashimoto said, conceding that his government's decision to raise
the nation's sales tax last year had hurt the economy.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ NATO is going ahead with contingency plans for
an attack on Serbs amid signs the conflict in Kosovo could be
spilling over to Albania. Senior U.S. diplomat Robert Gelbard says
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is not meeting the main
demands of a six-nation group that overseas the Balkans. So while
military planners look at ways to use force, diplomacy also is
being pursued. The six nations, the United States, Germany, France,
Russia, Britain and Italy, will convene on an urgent basis in Bonn,
Germany, next Wednesday, Gelbard said. He called the situation
grave. (US-KOSOVO)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a major overture after nearly two decades of
distrust, the Clinton administration offered to start a new
relationship with Iran _ even including a role in Persian Gulf
security _ if it abides by international standards of conduct. U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held out the olive branch,
responding to openings from Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, in
a speech delivered Wednesday to The Asia Society in New York.
Already, the Clinton administration has supported cultural and
academic exchanges with Iran, and eased travel to the United States
by many Iranians. (US-IRAN)
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Au pair Louise Woodward arrived back in
Britain on Thursday, proclaiming her innocence and predicting her
name eventually would be cleared in the death of a child in her
care. The 20-year-old au pair returned to her native country for
the first time in two years, following her manslaughter conviction
in the death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen. ``I feel great sorrow
for the death of baby Matthew,'' she said. ``But like I've said
time and time again, I had nothing to do with his death.'' A judge
has issued a temporary injunction barring Ms. Woodward from
spending any money if she sells her story. But, at a press
conference at the Manchester Airport, she vehemently denied she had
any plans to do so. (BRITAIN-AU PAIR)
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ African leaders, opening a mission
to restore peace in the Horn of Africa, met Thursday with Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and planned a session with Eritrean
President Isaias Afwerki. The Ethiopian-Eritrean border conflict
that broke out in early May has claimed hundreds of lives on three
fronts and in air attacks. In a first sign that Meles and Isaias
may be willing to compromise, they agreed under U.S.-Italian
pressure on Sunday to halt air strikes. Ground fighting has
subsided since June 11. (ERITREA-ETHIOPIA)

Vietnam urged to open up economic information 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A Vietnamese business newspaper urged the
government Thursday to open up economic information currently
treated as state secrets so private enterprise can operate more
successfully.
	   The Saigon Economic Times said in an opinion piece that
Vietnamese businessmen were at a disadvantage because of such
secrecy, since foreigners could often rely on home offices overseas
or consultant companies to come up with information.
	   Private Vietnamese businesses are forced to rely on the
state-owned press, which is restrained by regulations, or on paying
bribes to officials, the paper said. Information treated as secrets
includes gross domestic product figures and the state budget.

Netanyahu: Israel is considering referendum on West Bank pullback 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed
Thursday that he is looking into ways of holding a referendum on a
West Bank troop withdrawal, a step that would further delay a
pullback, but effectively silence those trying to prevent it.
	   Recent polls have suggested that two-thirds of Israelis support
a U.S. proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the
West Bank. Jewish settler leaders have said they would stage
protests and try to topple Netanyahu over such a pullback, which
would bring 40 percent of the West Bank under Palestinian rule.
	   Palestinian officials accused Netanyahu of playing for time by
raising the idea of referendum. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
senior aide, Nabil Abourdeneh, noted that Israel's parliament has
already approved the 1995 interim peace accord that calls for a
gradual West Bank Bank troop pullback.
	   ``It (a referendum) is a waste of time,'' Abourdeneh told The
Associated Press. ``At one time, he (Netanyahu) used the issue of
security, and then the problems with his coalition to delay the
implementation of the agreement, and now he is trying to use the
referendum.''
	   An Israeli newspaper said U.S. President Bill Clinton has given
Netanyahu until Wednesday to reach a decision on the U.S. peace
plan that was first submitted in January and has been accepted by
the Palestinians. Netanyahu has ignored previous U.S. deadlines,
and the Clinton administration has not taken action against him.
	   Netanyahu on Thursday confirmed reports that he and his staff
are looking into various techniques of holding a referendum.
	   ``We are checking the possibility,'' Netanyahu told reporters,
adding that there have been meetings ``on a variety of aspects,
including technological ones and some of the technological methods
have been used successfully elsewhere.''
	   Israel TV's Channel Two reported that one option would be to
send copies to the agreement to each Israeli household, with secret
identity numbers attached to avoid cheating.
	   However, Netanyahu made it clear that he had not yet made a
decision. He said his main goal was to get the best possible deal
for Israel, ``and I think this precedes the question of whether we
will be bringing the issue to a referendum.''

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ African leaders, opening a mission
to restore peace in the Horn of Africa, met Thursday with Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and planned an afternoon session with
Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
	   The countries' border conflict that broke out in early May has
claimed hundreds of lives on three fronts and in air attacks. In a
first sign that the two men may be willing to compromise, they
agreed under U.S.-Italian pressure on Sunday to halt air strikes.
	   Ground fighting has subsided since June 11.
	   The OAU delegation ``has no new initiative of its own, but will
be building on the OAU resolution'' urging the two sides to accept
and implement a four-point U.S.-Rwandan peace proposal, Ethiopian
government spokewoman Selome Tadesse said.
	   The proposal includes a call to Eritrea to redeploy to positions
held prior to the outbreak of hostilities.
	   ``Unfortunately, the Ethiopian side has been very adamant on
that point,'' said Eritrean presidential aide Yemane Gebreab.
	   Unable to resolve that impasse, each side has been crafting
proposals to find common ground, he said.
	   Eritrea will lobby for a cessation of hostilities and
demilitarization of the entire border,Yemane said. The steps would
clear the way for the U.N. Cartographic Section to delimit and
demarcate the border, he said.
	   ``We might fight a few more rounds, but at the end of it, we're
going to have to negotiate,'' Yemane said.
	   The Ethiopians did not discuss their proposals.
	   Burkina Faso President Blaise Campaore, as current OAU chief,
leads the delegation that also includes Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe and OAU
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim.
	   Djibouti President sent Foreign Minister Mohammed Musa Sheahim
in place of President Gouled Atidon, who is unwell.
	   While the diplomats pursued their initiative, hundreds of
Eritreans deported from Ethiopia headed by bus for the Eritrean
capital, Asmara, after an arduous three-day journey from Addis
Ababa.
	   The deportees, after crossing the border on Wednesday near the
Eritrean village of Om Hajer, said they were given food but
insufficient water on the trip.
	   ``This is a very bad crime,'' said a 43-year-old deportee who
lost limbs when he served in the Ethiopian army. ``I lost my hand
and leg for them __ and now I get this.''
	   He declined to give his name out of concern for the wife and
children he left behind.
	   The deportations were fiercely criticized by Eritrea as a
``witch-hunt,'' but Ethiopia said the deportees posed security
risks because they had military training or were raising funds for
the Eritrean war effort.
	   That contention was denied by many of the deportees.
	   ``Not even now when we are standing in Eritrea'' are funds being
raised, said Hiab Gebreselassie, a 30-year-old school principal.
	   Ethiopia has accused Eritrea of expelling thousands of its
citizens, a charged denied by Eritrea.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
rebels overthrow a 17-year military regime in July 1991. Eritrea
gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

World Cup: Hispanic battle to stave off early exit 
</HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ When Spain and Paraguay meet
Friday, language and historic links won't be the only points they
have in common. Both teams are also desperate for a victory to
stave off an early exit from the World Cup.
	   Playing Paraguay for the first time ever, Spain is in the more
delicate position lying bottom of Group D with no points and morale
jabbed by its shock 3-2 defeat by Nigeria.
	   The loss was only Spain's second in 35 games and the Iberian
side is having a hard time swallowing it.
	   ``We're gunning for revenge,'' said Spain's veteran Real Madrid
defender Fernando Hierro, adding that a victory would help restore
Spain as a group and tournament favorite.
	   Paraguay, struggling to emerge from more than a decade in
soccer's backwaters, boasts one point from its scoreless tie with
Bulgaria. Its final group match is against Nigeria next Wednesday.
	   ``It will be a difficult match for both, but I think it will be
more so for them (Spain) because they have to win. Otherwise they
go home,'' Paraguayan goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert said.
	   Asked if he'll try to score with of his famous free kicks,
Chilavert said, ``If the opportunity comes, I am ready. But I know
my main responsibility is to protect my own goal. I have to provide
security to our defense''.
	   Spain knows they'll be facing a determined opponent.
	   ``They also need to win if they are to qualify,'' said the FC
Barcelona defender Miguel Angel Nadal. ``I think we're in the same
boat, although Spain if it plays well, is the superior team.''
	   This is Spain's 10th World Cup and its sixth consecutive
appearance. Paraguay, with five in all, has not been in the
competition since 1986.
	   Hierro believes experience and familiarity are likely to work in
favor of Spain, one of the only sides in the World Cup whose entire
squad plays at home and which has undergone few changes since coach
Javier Clemente took over in 1992.
	   Paraguay, in contrast, is made up almost entirely of emigrant
players, including Miguel Angel Benitez and Roberto Acuna, who star
for first division Spanish clubs.
	   Coach Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani has no qualms about ranking Spain
as his most difficult opponent and admits he would have preferred
Clemente's crew to have defeated Nigeria and face its Hispanic
cousins in a more relaxed manner.
	   ``We will seek to keep calm in the front. We lacked that against
Bulgaria and that prevented us from taking advantage of a couple of
good scoring chances we had.''
	   ``I want my team going more to the attack, to the front. We have
the capacity to play a better, faster soccer.
	   ``I do not want to wait for them to come after us. I want to go
after them.''
	   In contrast, the Spaniards this week confessed to knowing little
about Paraguay beyond a video of the Bulgarian game and the fact
that it finished runner-up to Argentina in the South American
qualifiers.
	   But they are aware that recently Paraguay has not fared so good
and suffered a string of warm-up defeats prior to France, including
a 5-1 walloping by the Netherlands on June 1.
	   Nadal, with a minor calf problem, is Spain's only injury
concern, while Paraguay looks certain to be without River Plate
defender Celsio Ayala because of a hip injury.
	   The South American side, however, should be able to count on
right winger Francisco Arce who missed the game against Bulgaria
with a thigh injury.

Belfast peace agreement, an opinion poll indicated Thursday.
	   The survey in the Irish Times newspaper was published eight days
before Northern Ireland residents return to the voting booths to
select a new 108-seat legislature for this British-ruled territory,
the intended cornerstone of the April 10 agreement. Voters in both
parts of Ireland ratified the deal last month.
	   The poll's results were roughly in line with traditional party
strengths, although Northern Ireland surveys have historically
underestimated the true support for the most hard-line voices _ the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party on the Catholic side of society, and Ian
Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party on the pro-British Protestant
side.
	   The poll, which had a margin of error of 3 percentage points,
measured support for the largest Protestant party, the Ulster
Unionists, at 27 percent. By contrast, Paisley's party _ the major
opponent of the accord _ enjoyed 16 percent approval.
	   The moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party, which represents
most of the north's substantial Catholic minority, registered 26
percent support in the poll.
	   Support for Sinn Fein, which like the SDLP supports the
agreement, was measured at 10 percent _ far lower than the 17
percent the party won in two elections last year.
	   Northern Ireland's other established party, Alliance, rated 9
percent approval. Alliance draws support from the province's most
moderate Protestants and Catholics alike.
	   Paisley has been predicting that sufficient Protestant support
will fall behind his party in the June 25 elections for him to
control a mininum 30-seat bloc in the new Assembly.
	   It's estimated about 30 seats would be sufficient for Paisley's
followers to obstruct decision-making in the new compromise
government, which will require majority support from both sides of
the communal divide.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Anatoly Chubais, the Kremlin's newly appointed
liaison to international lending institutions, called on Thursday
for dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion in financial aid to stabilize
Russia's markets.
	   The Interfax news agency quoted Chubais as saying that Russia
would not accept loans ``at any price,'' and said that the Cabinet
was discussing the conditions under which the country could get
financial help.

Communists denounce re-appointment of Chubais

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Communist opposition on Thursday angrily
denounced the return of Russia's most high-profile reformer, whom
President Boris Yeltsin has brought back to the government's inner
circle to work on resolving the nation's financial crisis.
	   Premier Sergei Kiriyenko's Cabinet meanwhile approved formation
of a presidential commission to monitor the implementation of the
country's so-called anti-crisis program, which will be presented on
Tuesday at a Cabinet meeting chaired by Yeltsin.
	   Such a strict system of control over the program was necessary,
Yeltsin said, ``so that everyone knows what he is and will be
responsible for,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Communists bristled at Yeltsin's re-appointment on Wednesday
of Anatoly Chubais, who has negotiated several foreign loans for
Russia, as the top liaison with international lending
organizations.
	   ``This is our great Russian beggar,'' the leader of the
parliament's hard-line Agrarian faction, Nikolai Kharitonov, said
of Chubais.
	   Another well-known communist, Viktor Ilyukhin, said the
appointment was ``the evidence of a complete fiasco of the
president's and government's policy.''
	   ``In effect, in order to prolong his agony, the president is
ready to grab so many loans to put our descendants into a debtors'
prison,'' Ilyukhin said.
	   Russian officials confirmed Wednesday that they are seeking a
new bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Yeltsin, who has already fired and rehired Chubais twice, tried
to parry criticism, saying Chubais' job was ``temporary.'' But he
said that the Duma's reaction was irrelevant.
	   ``For us, more important are the state, the current situation at
the world's financial markets, the value of today's ruble,''
Yeltsin was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin also hinted at new appointments to the Cabinet, saying
``the appearance of new figures is possible,'' the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   The government meanwhile was working on its strategy to lower
its debt costs. The Finance Ministry said Thursday that the
government has selected J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank as joint
bookrunners for a long-dated, dollar-dominated Eurobond, but has
declined to comment further on the bond issue.
	   Such a long-term bond would reduce the amount of money the
government pays on short-term debt-servicing.
	   Russia also plans to tighten control over state institutions and
eliminate redundant structures to cut spending on the government,
Kiriyenko said Thursday. And the government decided Thursday to
postpone sending to parliament a bill to rise the minimum wage.
	   Sergei Dubinin, the head of Russia's Central Bank, said Thursday
that the bank's gross reserves stood at dlrs 15.7 billion on June
12 _ up dlrs 700,000 since the week before, but down from dlrs 17.8
billion at the start of this year.

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Customs officials at the
Bulgarian-Romanian border on Thursday fined a Romanian railroad
engineer who tried to smuggle more than 3,000 compact discs into
his country.
	   The train driver was ordered to pay leva 15 million (dlrs 8,400)
after customs officers found the CDs he had hidden in the engine's
ventilation system, the state news agency BTA reported.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the 3,090 CDs were pirated.
	   The seizure was made at the Ruse border crossing, 314 kilometers
(196 miles) northeast of Sofia.
	   On Tuesday, customs officials at the Bulgarian-Yugoslav border
seized 6,525 CDs a Yugoslav national tried to smuggle out of
Bulgaria.
	   Western officials have recently praised Bulgaria's government
for imposing stringent controls on compact disc makers and traders
in an effort to crack down on copyright piracy, which prior
governments had tolerated.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ A jaunty Nelson Mandela was greeted by Pope
John Paul II at the Vatican Thursday, returning as president of
South Africa eight years after his first visit as a newly released
prisoner.
	   ``Well, Your Holiness!'' Mandela said in a booming voice as he
strode down a hallway to meet the pontiff outside the papal
library. ``What an honor it is for me to meet Your Holiness
again.''
	   The two leaders -- Mandela one year older at 79 -- clasped
hands. ``Welcome to the Vatican,'' said John Paul.
	   ``Your Holiness is looking very well,'' Mandela said. The pope,
who has been ailing in recent years and walked with a cane during
the visit, smiled slightly.
	   ``God bless South Africa,'' John Paul said after their 25-minute
meeting.
	   During their conversation, which was private, Mandela gave
thanks for Vatican and South African Roman Catholic Church support
for the country and its ``difficult moments of the past,'' papal
spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said.
	   They underlined the need to find ``urgent solutions'' to
Africa's critical problems, he said.
	   The pope was a prominent voice condemning apartheid in the
1980s.
	   He has long declared himself an admirer of Mandela, and once
said he was praying every day for his release from prison. Mandela
was jailed for 27 years by the apartheid regime.
	   He came to the Vatican five months after his release. After
being elected president in 1994, Mandela welcomed the pope in South
Africa.
	   Mandela showed his ease while introducing his entourage.
	   ``This is my boss,'' he joked, presenting his chief of staff.
	   On leaving, he wished the pope ``a long and healthy life.''
	   Mandela has been traveling recently on ``farewell tours'' to
world leaders. His mandate as president expires next year.

Shelling pounds Guinea-Bissau countryside as rebels due in talks 
</HEADLINE>
By IAN STEWART
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Heavy weaponry crashed in the countryside
of Guinea-Bissau on Thursday as the leader of rebels fighting
government forces was due to meet with a Gambian mediator bidding
to end the 12-day rebellion in the West African country.
	   The Portuguese ambassador in Bissau said talks between Gambian
Foreign Minister Mohamed Sedat Jobe and rebel leader Ansumane Mane
were scheduled for 9:30 a.m. (0930 GMT) Thursday.
	   Ambassador Francisco Henriques da Silva, interviewed by
Portuguese radio RDP-Africa, could not confirm whether the talks
had begun. He also did not know where the meeting was to be held.
	   The Gambian mediator met with government officials Wednesday who
said they were ready to enter into talks if the rebels laid down
their weapons.
	   The renegade soldiers have accused President Joao Bernardo
Vieira of corruption and demanded he step down.
	   A meeting planned for Wednesday between the rebel leader and the
Gambian fell through for security concerns, the Portuguese news
agency reported from Bissau.
	   The rebels had insisted that Sedat Jobe go to their positions
near the Bra military garrison in a suburb of Bissau for the talks,
but the government said it could not guarantee the mediator's
safety, according to Lusa.
	   Government soldiers, backed by troops from neighboring Senegal
and the Republic of Guinea, have pinned the rebels in areas around
the garrison, including the international airport, since the mutiny
began there, the loyalists said.
	   Yet fighting seemed to have escalated into the countryside on
Wednesday night and Thursday morning, when the constant thud and
crash of heavy artillery fire could be heard in rural Guinea-Bissau
from across the border in Senegal.
	   A Senegalese commander said his forces were rushing heavy
weapons to the capital to reinforce loyalists who had reportedly
pinned down rebels there in areas around Bissau's sprawling
military garrison complex where the mutiny began.
	   In the capital, Guinea-Bissau government troops were bombarding
what they called final pockets of resistance.
	   ``The government operation is now focused on the airport where
the rebels are concentrated,'' Guinea-Bissau's Foreign Minister
Fernando Delfim da Silva told The Associated Press in Lisbon, where
he was stuck due to flight cancellations.
	   The rebels, who seized heavy weapons from the garrison's
arsenal, were dug into positions on high ground around the airport
about 10 kilometers (6 miles) out of the city, Delfim da Silva
said.
	   Fighting, which began at the garrison on June 7, has escalated
to include forces from three West African neighbors, including
Senegalese rebels apparently linked to the Guinea-Bissau renegade
soldiers.
	   Senegal's government has rushed to the aid of Guinea-Bissau in
part because of its ongoing clashes with separatist rebels in
Senegal's southern Casamance region. Mane, a former Guinea-Bissau
army chief, is accused of supplying weapons to the Casamance
guerrillas in the past.
	   More than three-quarters of Bissau's population of 300,000
people had fled the city during the fighting, witnesses and aid
groups said.
	   The U.N. food agency, the World Food Program, reported some
100,000 refugees near the town of Mansoa, about 60 kilometers (40
miles) from the capital. A Catholic mission put the number at
150,000.
	   Many of the refugees were said to be without food.

Taiwan suspends war games during Clinton's China visit 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Taiwan-China-US
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's armed forces have suspended
exercises to avoid complicating U.S. President Bill Clinton's
upcoming visit to China, newspapers reported Thursday.
	   All but routine drills have been called off until mid-July to
avoid ``unnecessary speculation and misunderstanding,'' Taiwan's
China Times reported.
	   The United States earlier notified Taiwan of its hope that no
exercises would be held during Clinton's June 25-Aug. 3 stay in
China, the paper said, quoting a high-ranking military officer whom
it did not name.
	   The Taiwan Daily said the exercises were pushed back to avoid
opening Taiwan up to accusations of being provocative and a
``troublemaker'' during Clinton's visit.
	   But the Defense Ministry said maneuvers and live firing
exercises were suspended to allow extra training under a forces
reduction and redeployment program.
	   The suspensions have ``absolutely nothing to do with the meeting
between Clinton and (Chinese President) Jiang Zemin,'' the ministry
said in a statement.
	   Exercises by the armed forces of Taiwan and China have been
closely watched since China staged provocative war games in
1995-1996 aimed at intimidating Taiwan independence supporters.
	   Though the two sides have been united for just four of the last
100 years, China still considers Taiwan a breakaway province to be
reunited with the mainland by force if necessary.
	   A Taiwanese military display around the time of Hong Kong's
return to Chinese rule last July 1 was widely construed as a
reminder to Beijing of the island's ability to defend itself.
	   China has guaranteed Hong Kong great autonomy, a reunification
formula it hopes Taiwan will accept. But Taiwan has ruled that out.
	   Taiwan held annual combined services exercises in May this year,
and has scheduled another round of war games for later in the year.

Turkey sends warplanes to northern Cyprus 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey sent jets to Cyprus on Thursday,
two days after four Greek F-16 warplanes and two C-130 transport
planes landed at an air base near in the southern half of the
Mediterranean island, the Anatolia news agency reported.
	   Six F-16 fighter jets landed Thursday at the airbase of
Gecitkale, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of the port town
of Famagusta, the agency said.
	   Turkey ``has taken and will take all necessary measures,'' said
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, who described the landing of
the Greek planes at an air base near Paphos as a threat to Turkey's
security.
	   ``This is the first step of a permanent deployment,'' Cem said
about the Greek warplanes, which later returned to Greece.
	   The Greek-Cypriot government controls southern Cyprus. The
arrival of the Greek planes was within the framework of a five-year
joint defense agreement between Greek Cypriots and Greece.
	   The island remains divided since 1974, after an invasion by
Turkish troops following a short-lived coup by supporters of union
with Greece. Turkish Cypriots declared independence in the northern
third of the island in 1983, but it is only recognized by Turkey.
	   United Nations-sponsored efforts to reunify the island have been
deadlocked.
	   Tensions on the island have been on the rise for the past year
after the Greek Cypriots made a deal with Russia to buy S-300
anti-aircraft missiles. They are due to be deployed on the island
later this year.
	   Turkey says the deal threatens its security and has threatened
to strike if Greek Cypriots go ahead with their deployment. Turkey
increased surveillance on the passage of ships through its straits
for possible missile components.
	   ``The latest developments proved that the alliance between the
Greek Cypriot administration and Greece is not only a threat to the
Northern Turkish Cypriot Republic, but also a direct threat to
Turkey,'' Cem said. ``Greece will directly bear the responsibility
of the outcome of this dangerous escalation started by the Greek
side in Cyprus.''

	   Chubais didn't spell out where the assistance should come from.
He said, however, he would soon be discussing Russia's financial
difficulties with the IMF's First Deputy Managing Director, Stanley
Fischer.
	   ``The situation in Russia right now is not a simple one,''
Chubais told Interfax.
	   The communist opposition on Thursday angrily denounced Chubais'

	   ``This is our great Russian beggar,'' the leader of the

worldwide backlash against the effects of globalization, Australian
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Thursday.
	   ``The Hanson phenomenon in Australia is part of a fairly global
phenomenon where at least a percentage of the population in most
societies feel uncomfortable with the process of globalization,''
Downer said in an interview with CNN.
	   In its first electoral test, One Nation attracted around 23
percent of the vote in last Saturday's election in Queensland
state, after campaigning on policies to halt immigration, limit
foreign investment, raise industry protection and drastically cut
welfare spending.
	   Business leaders in Australia and some parts of Asia have
expressed concern that Hanson's isolationist and anti-Asian
immigration views will harm foreign investment.
	   Recent opinion polls have put Hanson's support nationally in
double figures, and Prime Minister John Howard's conservative
coalition government has included direct appeals to One Nation
supporters in its campaign for an upcoming federal election.
	   ``We have to be part of the globalized economy, continue the
process of economic reform in Australia, make sure that we have
competitive markets and that we repudiate protectionism and that we
encourage free flows of foreign investment,'' Downer told CNN's
International Business Asia program.
	   One Nation's success showed governments had to do more to
explain the benefits of foreign investment and trade
liberalization, Downer said.
	   Meanwhile, Hanson disciplined One Nation national director David
Ettridge on Thursday for saying the party advocated the government
printing more money to pay for low-interest loans to farmers and
business.
	   Hanson said this was not One Nation policy, and that Ettridge
was now barred from commenting on party policy. At a news
conference, Hanson jokingly hit Ettridge with a bundle of papers
and said: ``David, don't do that again.''
	   The government seized on the comment as an example of what
Howard has said are One Nation's ``dangerous'' and ``simplistic''
policies.
	   He said Thursday the proposal was ``one of the most misguided
ideas'' he had heard in 24 years in politics.
	   ``The very idea that you would print money ought to send a
shiver down the spine of every retired Australian because high
inflation would result and that would destroy savings,'' Howard
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Hanson said One Nation's policy to fund the loans, with planned
interest rates of 2 percent, was to cut welfare payments to
unemployed people and Aborigines.
	   Hanson said it was hypocritical of Howard to condemn plans for a
low-interest bank when he had provided hundreds of millions of
dollars of taxpayers' funds in low-interest loans to Asian
countries, including Korea.

Rolling Stones cancel Spanish concert 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ The Rolling Stones canceled Thursday's
concert in this northern Spanish city because lead singer Mick
Jagger was suffering from laryngitis.
	   The Stones were scheduled to play in Bilbao as part of their
nationwide ``Bridges to Babylon'' tour that kicked off last year.
Jagger has been suffering from laryngitis in the past weeks,
organizers said.
	   The concert was part of this year's celebration of the 100th
anniversary of the city's soccer club, the Athletic de Bilbao.
About 40,000 seats were sold for the concert.
	   Organizers said they will not re-schedule the concert but
promised that tickets bought for Thursday's event will be
reimbursed.
	   The legendary rock group canceled an upcoming concert in Milan,
Italy, upsetting some 45,000 fans.
	   Last month, other concerts were called off in Germany, Croatia
and in the Spanish northern port city of Gijon when guitarist Keith
Richards broke a rib after falling off a chair while reaching for a
book.

Chubais calls for dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion in aid to Russia trim.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Anatoly Chubais, the Kremlin's newly appointed
liaison to international lending institutions, called on Thursday
for dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion in financial aid to stabilize
Russia's markets.
	   The Interfax news agency quoted Chubais as saying that Russia
would not accept loans ``at any price,'' and said that the Cabinet
was discussing the conditions under which the country could get
financial help.
	   The government had previously said it would try to cope with the
financial crisis on its own, without an added infusion of foreign
aid. But officials confirmed Wednesday that Russia would seek a
bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Chubais, Russia's highest-profile free market reformer who has
previously served as deputy prime minister, was called back to
President Boris Yeltsin's inner circle on Wednesday to negotiate
with the IMF and other international financial institutions.
	   Chubais didn't spell out where the assistance should come from.
He said, however, he would soon be discussing Russia's financial
difficulties with the IMF's First Deputy Managing Director, Stanley
Fischer.
	   ``The situation in Russia right now is not a simple one,''
Chubais told Interfax. He said that the IMF aid would be the
cheapest Russia could get.
	   Russian government officials have warned that any IMF help for
Russia would come with strict, and politically unpopular
conditions. Westerners close to negotiations say the government has
been divided over whether to readily accept many of them.
	   Chubais is deeply unpopular within Russia in part because of his
strong ties to the west. The communist opposition on Thursday
angrily denounced his return to government.
	   ``This is our great Russian beggar,'' the leader of the
parliament's hard-line Agrarian faction, Nikolai Kharitonov, said
of Chubais.
	   Another well-known communist, Viktor Ilyukhin, accused Yeltsin
of consigning ``our descendants to a debtors' prison.''
	   Yeltsin, who has already fired and rehired Chubais twice, tried
to parry criticism, saying Chubais' job was ``temporary.'' But he
said that the Duma's reaction was irrelevant.
	   ``For us, more important are the state, the current situation at
the world's financial markets, the value of today's ruble,''
Yeltsin was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin also hinted at new appointments to the Cabinet, saying
``the appearance of new figures is possible,'' the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Premier Sergei Kiriyenko's Cabinet meanwhile approved formation
of a presidential commission to monitor the implementation of the
country's so-called anti-crisis program, which will be presented on
Tuesday at a Cabinet meeting chaired by Yeltsin.
	   Such a strict system of control over the program was necessary,
Yeltsin said, ``so that everyone knows what he is and will be
responsible for,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The government also was working on its strategy to lower its
debt costs. The Finance Ministry said Thursday that the government
has selected J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank as joint bookrunners for
a long-dated, dollar-dominated Eurobond.
	   Such a long-term bond would reduce the amount of money the
government pays on short-term debt-servicing.

Asian rallies fail to impress European markets AP Business Writer

Eds: Incorporates material from BC-Asian Markets
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Asian stock markets soared Thursday after central
bank intervention yanked the Japanese yen out of its doldrums, but
European prices gave up early gains amid skepticism about whether
the news was too good to be true.
	   ``The problems haven't been solved yet,'' said Jeremy Batstone,
a strategist at NatWest Stockbrokers in London.
	   Shares rose modestly Thursday morning on the London Stock
Exchange, Europe's biggest equity market. But after the blue-chip
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index gained a little more
than half a percentage point in value, it reversed course into
negative territory.
	   The so-called ``footsie'' was down by 33.2 points, or 0.6
percent, at 5,799.5 by midday.
	   The pattern was similar across continental Europe, with big
markets in Frankfurt and Paris, as well as the smaller ones in
Milan, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Zurich, showing losses in the
afternoon.
	   The sober dealings in Europe marked a blunt contrast to Asia's
euphoria. Asian traders pushed the blue-chip Nikkei index in Tokyo
up by 4.4 percent, and smaller Asian markets showed even bigger
gains.
	   ``The signs are that the Asian crisis is slowly coming under
control, and the initial fears have diminished,'' said Guenter
Burgold, a dealer at BHF Bank in Frankfurt. ``But intervention in
the past has always proven to be grasping at straws. The skepticism
remains.''
	   The U.S. and Japanese central banks intervened on Wednesday to
prop up the yen, which has suffered a recent sharp decline against
the dollar. A rally on Wall Street helped fuel the buying frenzy in
Asia.
	   ``This is exactly the type of thing that should happen,'' said
Jean-Michel Severino, a senior World Bank official.
	   Others were less optimistic.
	   ``This is definitely not a turning point in the crisis,'' said
Carlton Poon, head of research for Worldsec International Ltd. in
Hong Kong. ``The fundamentals in Asia continue to deteriorate,''
and the markets cannot sustain the gains, Poon said.
	   Still, a stronger yen could reduce the risk of more East Asian
economies slipping into recession as the one-year anniversary of
the region's financial crisis nears, Severino said.
	   Southeast Asian economies were thrown into turmoil after the
Thai baht was sharply devalued last July, setting off more
devaluations of regional currencies and big stock market plunges.
	   On European currency markets early Thursday, the U.S. dollar
bought 136.91 yen _ roughly 5 yen less than the greenback was worth
late Wednesday in Tokyo.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average
jumped 646.16 points, or 4.39 percent, closing at 15,361.54.
	   Throughout Asia, other markets showed huge gains, with key
indices up by 6.4 percent in Hong Kong, 8.1 percent in Bangkok, 6.6
percent in Manila, 7.1 percent in Seoul and 5 percent in Jakarta.

Court upholds treason conviction of man who downed Turkish flag 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ An appeals court on Thursday upheld a
22-year prison sentence for a man who removed a Turkish flag during
a party convention and replaced it with the flag of a Kurdish rebel
group.
	   The court also upheld a decision to acquit a prominent Kurdish
politician and ordered a new trial for 43 members of the
pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party, who were either convicted or
acquitted of the crime of separatism. The court said there had been
``insufficient investigation.''
	   Faysal Akcan, was charged with treason for downing the Turkish
flag at the convention in June 1996. He was convicted by an Ankara
state security court last year.
	   Delegates at the convention were charged with separatism for
chanting slogans against the government and in support of
guerrillas of the Kurdish rebel group, PKK. HADEP chairman Murat
Bozlak and another party official received six-year jail terms for
separatism, 29 people were sentenced to four years and 13,
including former Kurdish deputy Sirri Sakik, were acquitted.
	   No new trial date has been set for the 43 who face retrial.
	   Turkey frequently comes under criticism for its human rights
record, marred by its treatment of Kurds and Kurdish political
groups.
	   The People's Democracy Party was formed in 1994. Two of its
predecessors were shut down for alleged ties to the PKK.
	   Bozlak and six other HADEP members are currently on trial in a
separate case on charges of belonging to the outlawed PKK, which
has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast since 1984.
	   The charge carries a maximum punishment of death. The minimum
penalty is 22 1/2 years in prison.
	   The defendants were arrested in February when police stormed
their party headquarters searching for links to the PKK. The
indictment is based on a calendar and other documents seized in the
raid that police claim features pictures of slain PKK rebels.

China welcomes efforts to strengthen Japanese yen 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with Foreign Ministry comment
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Thursday welcomed moves by the Japanese
and U.S. governments to bolster the Japanese yen and urged them to
ensure that the currency doesn't slump again.
	   ``We are glad to see that the exchange rate of the Japanese yen
is picking up,'' Dai Xianglong, governor of the central People's
Bank of China, was quoted as saying by the state-run Xinhua News
Agency.
	   Speaking at an Asian bankers meeting after Japan and the United
States sold dollars to prop up the yen, Dai reaffirmed that China
won't devalue its own currency, the yuan.
	   ``It's unnecessary to do that,'' Xinhua quoted him as saying.
	   World currency markets feared a sliding yen would place further
pressure on regional currencies to depreciate and force China to
adjust its own exchange rate to maintain export competitiveness.
That in turn could spark further devaluations, setting off a chain
reaction that could rock the global economy.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said the yen's
slide had ``an outstanding adverse influence on the Chinese
economy'' and ``brought new pressure on the economic development of
China and other Asian countries.''
	   He too welcomed Tokyo's and Washington's decision to bolster the
yen by selling dollars. But he also urged them to make sure the yen
does not slide again.
	   ``We hope that they will conscientiously fulfill their due
responsibilities and obligations,'' he said at a regular briefing
for reporters.
	   President Bill Clinton's decision to authorize for the first
time in his presidency the sale of dollars to drive down the
currency's value followed a Tuesday night telephone call with
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   Zhu said action to stop the yen's slide had been ``necessary.''
	   He also said China hoped ``relevant countries'' would ``properly
handle their difficulties and problems'' _ an apparent hint to
Japan that it should take steps to revive its struggling economy.
	   In recent days, Chinese state-run media have bemoaned the
sinking yen and the Japanese government's inability to strengthen
its currency.
	   Some mainland Chinese economists also blamed the United States
and Europe for not doing more to support Japan's currency, saying
Asia was on the verge of entering a new phase of financial crisis.
	   ``The Asian financial situation is very grim,'' the Communist
Party newspaper, the People's Daily, said in a commentary Thursday.
	   The newspaper, which has its published opinions approved by the
Chinese leadership, warned that the sliding yen has become the
``root of instability in the current international economy, which
may lead to a new financial crisis.''
	   It said joint action to support the yen was necessary to prevent
pressure on the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese economies.

General strike paralyzes life in major Bangladesh cities 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A general strike called by Bangladesh's
main opposition to protest a government peace accord disrupted life
in major Bangladesh cities Thursday.
	   Nearly 3,000 protesters marched through the streets of Dhaka,
the capital, where businesses were shut down and traffic stayed off
the streets. More than 4,000 security officers guarded government
buildings and the city center. No violence was reported.
	   The strike also hit other major cities, including Chittagong,
Khulna and Rajshahi, United News of Bangladesh news agency said.
	   The daylong strike was called by former Prime Minister Khaleda
Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party and six right-wing allies who
say the peace accord signed last year gave too much power to Chakma
tribespeople at the expense of Muslim settlers from the north.
	   Last week, Mrs. Zia led thousands of opposition activists in a
400-kilometer (250-mile) protest convoy from Dhaka to the
southeastern hills where the tribespeople live.
	   Nearly 2,000 former insurgents have surrendered arms as part of
the peace accord and the government enacted laws to set up a tribal
council that will govern the resource-rich area 176 (110 miles)
southeast of Dhaka.

Washington has no immediate solution for Ukraine's Turboatom 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - A senior U.S. official said Thursday that
Washington has no immediate solution to compensation demands from a
Ukrainian plant that scrapped a nuclear deal with Iran following
American demands.
	   Ambassador Richard Morningstar, President Clinton's adviser for
the former Soviet republics, said the issue was problematic but
that the United States would look for ways to resolve it.
	   Ukraine, which was to participate in a Russian project to
complete Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant, scrapped the dlrs 45
million deal in March under U.S. pressure. Washington has promised
Ukraine enhanced economic ties and cooperation in the nuclear power
industry in exchange.
	   Speaking in the northeastern town of Kharkiv, where he traveled
with a large U.S. government delegation, Morningstar praised
Ukraine for what he termed a ``courageous'' decision on the Bushehr
project, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But Morningstar offered no immediate hope for Turboatom, a
Kharkiv plant that was supposed to provide two turbines for the
Iranian plant. Russia says it now will provide the turbines itself.
	   Turboatom is seeking compensation for the scrapped deal. Company
chief Anatoly Buhayets says Turboatom suffered dlrs 5.1 million in
direct losses and lost about dlrs 130 million altogether by
refusing to take part in the Iranian project.
	   Buhayets told the Americans that compensation could come in the
form of investments, plant modernization projects or orders.
	   Morningstar's delegation was meeting with officials, plant
chiefs and business leaders in northeastern Ukraine this week to
explore business opportunities.

Netanyahu: Israel is considering referendum on West Bank pullback 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed
Thursday that he is looking into ways of holding a referendum on a
West Bank troop withdrawal, a step that would further delay a
pullback and effectively silence those trying to prevent it.
	   ``We are checking the possibility,'' Netanyahu told reporters,
adding that there have been meetings ``on a variety of aspects,
including technological ones and some of the technological methods
have been used successfully elsewhere.''
	   Israel TV's Channel Two reported that one option would be to
send copies to the agreement to each Israeli household, with secret
identity numbers attached to avoid cheating.
	   However, Netanyahu made it clear that he had not yet made a
decision. He said his main goal was to get the best possible deal
for Israel, ``and I think this precedes the question of whether we
will be bringing the issue to a referendum.''
	   Recent polls have suggested that two-thirds of Israelis support
a U.S. proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the
West Bank. Jewish settler leaders have said they would stage
protests and try to topple Netanyahu over such a pullback, which
would bring 40 percent of the West Bank under Palestinian rule.
	   Palestinian officials accused Netanyahu of playing for time by
raising the idea of referendum. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
senior aide, Nabil Abourdeneh, noted that Israel's parliament has
already approved the 1995 interim peace accord that calls for a
gradual West Bank Bank troop pullback.
	   ``It (a referendum) is a waste of time,'' Abourdeneh told The
Associated Press. ``At one time, he (Netanyahu) used the issue of
security, and then the problems with his coalition to delay the
implementation of the agreement, and now he is trying to use the
referendum.''
	   An Israeli newspaper said U.S. President Bill Clinton has given
Netanyahu until Wednesday to reach a decision on the U.S. peace
plan first submitted in January and has been accepted by the
Palestinians. Netanyahu has ignored previous U.S. deadlines, and
the Clinton administration has not taken action against him.

Officials fired over train engineers strike that entered second day 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Acting swiftly to end a two-day-old strike
that has idled 40 percent of the nation's train, Polish railway
authorities fired eight rail officials Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek has declared the strike illegal
because striking train drivers did not follow correct negotiating
procedures before walking off the job at midnight Tuesday. He has
threatened ``tough consequences'' for the strikers.
	   The state-run railway's director, Jan Janik, declined to say
whether it would also fire striking train drivers.
	   The government has estimated that 850 engineers have stopped
work, idling 40 percent of the nation's passenger trains and 60
percent of the cargo trains. Talks aimed at ending the strike were
scheduled in the afternoon.
	   The strike was called by the leftist Trade Union of Train
Engineers, representing 14,000 of the railway's 22,000 rail
engineers, to press demands for pay raises and early retirement
plans.
	   The right-wing Solidarity trade union, representing the second
largest bloc of train engineers, has not joined the strike, and has
called it politically motivated.
	   Labor and political issues remain tightly entwined in Poland,
where the Solidarity trade union helped bring down communist rule
with strikes and other acts of opposition in the 1980s. Solidarity
lives on as both a trade union, and also as a political movement
that controls parliament.
	   Solidarity politicians and labor officials alike have suggested
that the strike is motivated not purely out of labor concerns, but
also in an attempt by the left to destabilize the Solidarity-led
government.
	   Strike organizer Jan Zaborowski, a former leftist lawmaker,
angrily denied the allegations, and called the strike when a
government official refused to apologize for saying the action was
politically motivated.
	   The striker are demanding a 300-zloty (dlr-88) increase in the
current average monthly pay of 1,600 zlotys (dlrs 470) and the
right for workers with 20 years of service to retire at age 55.
	   Local trains have been hardest hit by the strike, particularly
in the region around the Baltic port city of Gdansk, the birthplace
of the Solidarity trade union movement, where trains are the
primary means of transport.
	   Non-striking engineers and buses have been mobilized to minimize
disruptions, and international and long-distance trains were
running with delays.
	   Railway officials estimated the losses so far at 7 million
zlotys (dlrs 2 million). The Polish rail carries 1.1 million
passengers and some 600,000 tons of goods daily.

World Cup: Chile falls in betting stakes after draw 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The odds on Chile winning the World Cup fell from
40-1 to 80-1 after the team's 1-1 draw with Austria.
	   British bookmakers Ladbrokes said Austria, despite gaining its
second straight draw with a late equalizer, saw its odds plummet
from 500-1 to 1000-1.
	   Ladbroke's spokesman Sean Boyce said Austria's late goal saved
British bookmakers about 2.5 million pounds (dlrs 4.1 million).
	   ``Until Austria's last gasp goal, things had been going very
much the way of punters (bettors) all week,'' he said. ``Chile was
extremely well supported to win the game but, more crucially, was
in many doubles and trebles with the earlier winners in the week.''
	   Boyce said one Coventry man missed out on 21,242 pounds (dlrs
34,624) after betting 5,000 pounds (dlrs 82,000) that Brazil,
Italy, England and Chile would all win this week.
	   Brazil remains favorite at 3-1, followed by Argentina and France
at 11-2, the Netherlands and Germany 6-1, England 8-1 and Italy
10-1.

With BC-China-Clinton

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Beijing on Thursday dampened hopes for an
agreement not to aim Chinese missiles at U.S. cities, saying it was
more important that both countries pledge not to initiate attacks
on each other.
	   Failure to win a deal on missile detargeting could leave China
and the United States with little in the way of new agreements to
sign when U.S. President Bill Clinton visits Beijing next week for
a summit meeting.
	   Last week, U.S. Ambassador to China James Sasser said he was not
optimistic that the summit would produce a declaration of U.S.
backing for China's long-stalled entry into the World Trade
Organization.
	   Washington wants China to open its markets further to foreign
goods before it joins the rule-setting body for world trade. U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky was in Beijing Thursday
for further discussions on the issue.
	   Allegations bedeviling the White House of possible transfers of
sensitive satellite technology to China also appear to have reduced
the likelihood of Clinton bowing to Chinese demands that Washington
ease restrictions on high-technology sales to China.
	   The Pentagon had said Tuesday that a deal in which both sides
agreed not to target each with nuclear missiles could be part of
Clinton's visit, the first by a U.S. president to China in nine
years.
	   But when asked Thursday about the issue, Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao repeated earlier demands that both
countries pledge not to be the first to launch a nuclear strike.
	   ``We think it is more important that the U.S. and China reach
agreement on mutual non-first use of nuclear weapons,'' Zhu said.
	   The United States has refused to make such a pledge, saying it
would be largely meaningless and unverifiable.
	   In another possible sign that the two sides were deadlocked,
Sandra Kristoff, the National Security Council's leading Asia
expert, who was in Beijing reportedly to win a missile detargeting
agreement, checked out of her hotel Thursday morning, hotel staff
said.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Palmer said he did not know if she
had left Beijing. A trip to Beijing three weeks earlier by
Kristoff's boss, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, was
described by embassy sources as a failure.
	   China has a small number of long-range missiles _ 18 to about
6,000 U.S. nuclear warheads.
	   Detargeted missiles can be quickly retargeted. Nevertheless,
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon has said an agreement would be
``an important confidence-building measure'' that would reduce the
``hair-trigger aspect of the strategic nuclear arsenal.''
	   China's hopes for Clinton's visit appear largely symbolic. It
wants to showcase its growing role in international affairs, and
balance U.S. dominance as the world's only remaining superpower.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu said that as permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council, China and the United States have a
``common and major responsibility for maintaining international and
regional development, security and stability.''
	   The visit will ``inject new vitality into the constructive
strategic partnership between the two countries,'' he said.
	   On the sensitive issue of human rights, Zhu said Beijing was
speeding up preparations to sign a U.N. treaty on protecting
political and civil rights.
	   He added, however, that he did not know if the review would be
finished so the pact could be approved during Clinton's visit.
	   By signing the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, Beijing would ease domestic pressure on Clinton to severely
criticize China's human rights record during his trip.

Scottish court adjourns theft charges against nurse freed by Saudis 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUNDEE, Scotland (AP) _ A Scottish court Thursday adjouirned
charges of stealing from a dying patient against a British nurse
who was convicted in Saudi Arabia in the murder of an Australian
colleague.
	   Lucille McLauchlan, 32, was not at the Dundee Sheriff Court for
the brief hearing. The case was adjourned until July 16.
	   ``She hasn't been in the United Kingdom to see the charges. It
is as simple as that,'' her lawyer, William Boyle. told reporters.
He refused to say where McLauchlan was.
	   Saudi King Fahd freed McLauchlan and another British nurse,
39-year-old Deborah Parry, on May 20 as an ``act of clemency.''
They returned to Britain and immediately sold their stories for at
least 100,000 ponds (dlrs 160,000) each to tabloid newspapers.
	   They were convicted in the December 1996 murder of Yvonne
Gilfford, who was stabbed, suffocated and beaten in her room at a
Saudi hospital where all three women worked on contracts.
	   McLauchlan faces charges of stealing 1,960 pounds (dlrs 3,200)
in March 1996 from a patient at Dundee's Kings Cross Hospital by
lifting a credit card and fraudulently using it.
	   She was fired from the Dundee hospital, applied for the Saudi
job and left the country.
	   Prosecutors in the murder case claimed McLauchlan used Gilford's
bank card to steal money after the nurse was killed.
	   Parry and McLauchlan said their confessions to Gilford's murder
were extracted under brutal treatment, and they later retracted
them.

Report: Graft threatens Russia's future 
</HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Corruption is costing Russia tens billions of
dollars in economic losses every year, eroding trust in democratic
institutions and scaring away foreign investors, said a report
released Thursday by the Council for Foreign and Defense Policies,
an independent Russian think-tank.
	   ``Corruption has become the main obstacle to Russia's economic
growth,'' said Georgy Satorov, a former top policy advisor to
President Boris Yeltsin who led the group of political scientists
who prepared the report.
	   Russia has been well-known for corruption among top officials
for the last few hundred years. Satarov claims that the nation's
main woe is grassroots corruption and public tolerance of it.
	   ``Imagine a U.S. motorist offering a bribe to a traffic police
officer. You can't because this is impossible,'' he said.
	   ``Here, 99 percent of motorists give bribes.''
	   The Kremlin's efforts to fight graft have mostly boiled down to
score-settling among the political elite, he said. The government
has failed to address the fundamental goal _ uprooting the economic
grounds and eradicating legal loopholes spurring corruption,
Satarov told reporters.
	   Russia's chaotic free-market reforms have provided a rich
feeding ground for bribes. According to the report, 30 percent of
deals in the massive sell-out of state assets broke the law. And in
about half of Russia's 89 regions, officials overseeing
privatization have been slapped with criminal charges over recent
years.
	   As the cash-strapped government struggles to meet its
obligations, regional officials line up for meager federal
subsidies _ and give bribes to put them ahead of others. Nearly
half of the decisions to allocate government credits are
accompanied by bribes, the report said.
	   A convoluted tax system and the vagueness of laws in the banking
sphere also give rise to corruption. In the highest-level
corruption scandal in recent years, the head of Russia's state
statistics service and his deputies were arrested earlier this
month on charges of helping big companies evade taxes.
	   On the grassroots level, bribes are requested ``almost every
time a citizen has to ask the government for something or the
government wants something from him,'' the report said.
	   Small businesses have not only tax inspectors and local police
to bribe, but they also have to deal with fire safety inspectors,
public health controllers and uncounted other agencies all
demanding their cut.
	   The report urges the government to eradicate the grounds for
corruption by cutting the budget deficit, streamlining tax
legislation and increasing non-cash payments in the economy.
	   It also calls for creation of a strong independent control
authority, a hotline for corruption victims and increasing the
wages of police officers and other law-enforcement workers.

Hiroshima survivor campaigns against nuclear weapons in India TRIMS. No pickup. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with background, anti-nuclear march in southern India.
By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KHETOLAI, India (AP) _ A Hiroshima survivor took his campaign
against atomic weapons Thursday just a few kilometers (miles) from
India's underground nuclear test range, where he appealed to
villagers to join his protest to ``protect your own lives.''
	   Yasuhiko Taketa spoke tearfully of seeing a fiery cloud engulf
his Japanese hometown Aug. 6, 1945. Days later he watched a younger
sister die of radiation poisoning _ one of the 130,000 victims of
the first atomic bomb.
	   ``Please stand up and raise your voice against all governments
using atomic weapons,'' Taketa said in Japanese, his comments
translated first into English and then Hindi.
	   ``You must protect your own lives. The government will not do
anything for you,'' he told the audience of about 300 in the
village square of Khetolai, a dairy farming community of 1,500.
	   The village is 10 kilometers (six miles) from the Pokaran
military test range, where India set off a series of nuclear
weapons tests last month, prompting retaliatory tests from neighbor
and longtime rival Pakistan. Pokaran is 550 kilometers (330 miles)
southwest of New Delhi.
	   Indians and Pakistanis initially reacted with pride, seeing the
tests as proof of their nations' technical expertise and ability to
stand up to industrialized powers despite grinding poverty. But
that initial euphoria has been dampened on both sides of the border
by international sanctions and fear of the consequences of stepping
up the region's costly and potentially explosive arms race.
	   Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda led hundreds of people in
an anti-nuclear march Thursday, Press Trust of India news service
reported from Bangalore, 2,020 kilometers (1,250 miles) south of
New Delhi.
	   In Khetolai, Indian anti-nuclear campaigners who helped organize
Taketa's visit issued a declaration calling on all countries to
stop testing nuclear weapons and destroy their nuclear arsenals.
	   Shouts of ``Yes! Yes! Yes!'' rang out in the tent where men in
white turbans and women in the flowing, brightly colored skirts and
scarves of India's Rajastan state gathered to hear Taketa. Adults
rushed to sign the declaration while children lined up to shake
Taketa's hand.
	   ``What happened in Hiroshima can happen anywhere,'' said
Khetolai resident Jeevan Lal.
	   Taketa's Japan Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is
supported by Japanese labor unions and works closely with survivors
from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Japanese cities where the United
States dropped atomic bombs near the end of World War II.
	   Bhera Ram Bishnoi, a local government official, said he
supported his government's declaration that it needed a nuclear
deterrent from neighboring China and Pakistan. But he said people
in Khetolai were uncomfortable living so close to the test site.
India first set off a nuclear device there in 1974.
	   Bishnoi said villagers feared that 20 cancer deaths since 1974
and recent symptoms such as vomiting blood, stomach pains and
incessant coughs were linked to living so close to the test site.
	   The government has said no radiation leaked during last month's
explosions and dismissed reports of health problems linked to the
tests.

African leaders begin peace mission to Eritrea, Ethiopia comment. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Leads with four grafs to UPDATE with OAU secretary-general

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ African leaders, opening a mission
to restore peace in the Horn of Africa, met Thursday with Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and headed for an afternoon session
with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
	   The countries' border conflict that broke out in early May has
claimed hundreds of lives on three fronts and in air attacks. In a
first sign that the two men may be willing to compromise, they
agreed under U.S.-Italian pressure on Sunday to halt air strikes.
	   Ground fighting has subsided since June 11.
	   OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said after the meeting
with Meles that the delegation brought a ``message of concern on
behalf of Africa and the message of Africa's desire to see a
peaceful end to this very tragic and very unfortunate conflict.''
He declined to answer questions about the meeting.
	   The OAU delegation ``has no new initiative of its own, but will
be building on the OAU resolution'' urging the two sides to accept
and implement a four-point U.S.-Rwandan peace proposal, Ethiopian
government spokewoman Selome Tadesse said.
	   The proposal includes a call to Eritrea to redeploy to positions
held prior to the outbreak of hostilities.
	   ``Unfortunately, the Ethiopian side has been very adamant on
that point,'' said Eritrean presidential aide Yemane Gebreab.
	   Unable to resolve that impasse, each side has been crafting
proposals to find common ground, he said.
	   Eritrea will lobby for a cessation of hostilities and
demilitarization of the entire border,Yemane said. The steps would
clear the way for the U.N. Cartographic Section to delimit and
demarcate the border, he said.
	   ``We might fight a few more rounds, but at the end of it, we're
going to have to negotiate,'' Yemane said.
	   The Ethiopians did not discuss their proposals.
	   Burkina Faso President Blaise Campaore, as current OAU chief,
leads the delegation that also includes Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe and Salim.
	   Djibouti President sent Foreign Minister Mohammed Musa Sheahim
in place of President Gouled Atidon, who is unwell.
	   While the diplomats pursued their initiative, hundreds of
Eritreans deported from Ethiopia headed by bus for the Eritrean
capital, Asmara, after an arduous three-day journey from Addis
Ababa.
	   The deportees, after crossing the border on Wednesday near the
Eritrean village of Om Hajer, said they were given food but
insufficient water on the trip.
	   ``This is a very bad crime,'' said a 43-year-old deportee who
lost limbs when he served in the Ethiopian army. ``I lost my hand
and leg for them __ and now I get this.''
	   He declined to give his name out of concern for the wife and
children he left behind.
	   The deportations were fiercely criticized by Eritrea as a
``witch-hunt,'' but Ethiopia said the deportees posed security
risks because they had military training or were raising funds for
the Eritrean war effort.
	   That contention was denied by many of the deportees.
	   ``Not even now when we are standing in Eritrea'' are funds being
raised, said Hiab Gebreselassie, a 30-year-old school principal.
	   Ethiopia has accused Eritrea of expelling thousands of its
citizens, a charged denied by Eritrea.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
rebels overthrow a 17-year military regime in July 1991. Eritrea
gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific rim ministers will push for
freer trade as ``the solution'' to the financial crisis that is
wreaking havoc on Asian economies, a Malaysian official said
Thursday.
	   The economic downturn had created a resurgence toward
protectionism in Asia, said Adlan Yahaya Uddin, executive director
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation secretariat.
	   Adlan said the trend should be countered by a public relations
campaign promoting economic and trade liberalization.
	   ``As far as APEC is concerned ... greater liberalization is the
solution'' to the economic crisis, Adlan told reporters, based on a
meeting of trade officials from 18 nations.
	   Trade ministers and officials from APEC member countries will
meet in the Malaysian city of Kuching starting Monday to prepare
for the Kuala Lumpur APEC summit in November.
	   Senior officials met Thursday for a two-day session to lay the
groundwork for the ministerial-level meeting, which is expected to
focus on a fast track to liberalize trade for nine priority areas.
	   The plan is an effort to speed progress toward APEC's goal of
free trade for all countries by 2020.
	   The plan, launched at the November Vancouver APEC meeting, is
known as the Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization process.
	   The nine sectors targeted are environmental goods and services,
medical equipment, chemicals, energy, forest products, fish, gems
and jewelry, toys and electronic commerce.
	   APEC ministers already had squared off an agreement to boost
trade and electronic commerce in Singapore earlier this month. At
that meeting, ministers agreed to reduce testing requirements for
imported telecommunication and information equipment.
	   In Kuching, ministers are expected to submit their plans for
achieving freer trade in the remaining eight sectors.
	   The regional economic crisis has instilled a sense of urgency in
pushing the plan through, Adlan said.
	   He added that an APEC task force had been working on an
assessment of trade liberalization with respect to ``difficulties
of financial instability and the economic problems which have
wreaked havoc on some APEC economies.''
	   Adlan said there was a resurgence toward protectionism, but did
not elaborate.
	   ``So far there had been no policy translation of
protectionism,'' he said. ``The pace of liberalization has not been
affected.''
	   He said no APEC country had ``pulled back'' from early
liberalization plans.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru, which are slated for admission in
November, have sent their ministers as observers.

Philippine Airlines to decide on possible closure in three months 
</HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines will decide in
three months whether it will shut down because of crippling
financial troubles worsened by a pilots' strike, an official said
Thursday.
	   PAL's decision will depend on the results of a rehabilitation
plan launched to cope with the impact of the strike by more than
600 pilots, Senior Vice President Avelino Zapanta said.
	   ``By that time, we'll have a clear idea of where we are
headed,'' Zapanta said.
	   PAL fired all the striking pilots after they ignored a
government back-to-work order and now has only 25 management pilots
left.
	   The pilots' union went on strike June 5 to protest an airline
plan to retire certain pilots who have reached 20 years of service
or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age. The plan puts 225 pilots
in danger of forced retirement, the union says.
	   The labor department, however, has upheld PAL's power to retire
the pilots, which is included in a collective bargaining agreement
signed by the union and management.
	   The strike cost the company more than 2 billion pesos (dlrs 50
million) in lost revenue, PAL said.
	   PAL announced Monday it will lay off 5,000 workers _ nearly 40
percent of its 13,000-member work force _ in an effort to survive.
	   The airline was already in serious financial shape before the
strike due to an ambitious dlrs 4 billion modernization program
launched shortly before Asia's currency crisis, which reduced
passenger numbers and inflated operating and loan repayment costs.
	   Officials said the rehabilitation program includes a suspension
of payments on the airline's estimated dlrs 2 billion in debt owed
to foreign and local creditors and aircraft lessors.
	   The officials said PAL will soon file a petition before Manila's
Securities and Exchange Commission to allow the suspension and
prevent creditors from hauling away the airlines' assets.
	   Zapanta said PAL will also cut its operations to match the
number of available pilots, resulting in the cancellation of most
regular international and domestic flights.
	   PAL also plans to dispose of all but 14 of its 54 planes and
suspend all new plane orders.
	   Zapanta said the rehabilitation plan has been presented to some
of PAL's creditors, which expressed their support.
	   Among destinations where flights have been suspended are
Australia, the Middle East, Europe, South Korea, China, Thailand,
Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei.
	   PAL will continue flights to Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and San
Francisco and will probably resume service to Taipei, Fukuoka and
Los Angeles in the next few weeks, Zapanta said.
	   The company says it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 202 million) in
the fiscal year that ended March 31 _ the biggest loss in its
57-year history.

French player fined dlrs 3,500 for verbal abuse 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Cedric Pioline was fined dlrs 3,500
Thursday for the outburst that got him kicked out of the Nottingham
Open.
	   The fine was announced by the ATP Tour a day after the French
player was defaulted for ``verbal abuse'' of the chair umpire.
	   Officials said Pioline, runner-up at Wimbledon last year and No.
8 seed for the tournament starting next week, swore in French at
Chilean umpire Pedro Bravo.
	   Pioline, trailing 6-3, 1-1 to Australia's Scott Draper, was
upset that the umpire did not call a let on his serve.
	   ``I don't remember what I said to the umpire but when you get
fed up you don't send flowers _ you're not happy,'' Pioline said.
	   In addition to the fine, Pioline loses whatever prize money he
would have earned from the tournament and gets zero points for
computer rankings. This tournament must also be included in his top
14 performances for ranking purposes.

Veteran German parliament member to retire, gives last speech 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Veteran German parliament member and
three-time government minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg, gave his
farewell speech Thursday in the Bundestag, parliament's lower
house.
	   The 69-year-old Stoltenberg, who also served as the Christian
Democrats' governor of Schleswig-Holstein state for 10 years ending
in 1982, followed Chancellor Helmut Kohl to the podium in a debate
on the European Union summit held in Cardiff this week.
	   ``I gave my first speech here more than 40 years ago,''
Stoltenberg said.
	   He said his farewell wish was that the Bundestag ``as in the
past continues to remain a forum for great debates and clear
alternatives, but, when necessary, also as the tried and tested
bearer of united responsibility.''
	   Known as the ``cool one,'' from the north, Stoltenberg is ending
his career with parliamentary elections on Sept. 27.
	   He served as a lower house deputy from 1957-71 when he became
governor of Schleswig-Holstein. He returned to the Bundestag in
1983.
	   A former history lecturer at the University of Kiel, Stoltenberg
was research minister from 1965-69; finance minister from 1982-89;
and then defense minister until April 1992.

Rice would be nice, but hold the curry, says Nigerian World Cup team 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An offer by Thailand to fire up
Nigeria's World Cup soccer team with a spicy meal of curry before
its next match has been politely declined, but the African players
would be happy to accept some fragrant rice.
	   Thailand's ambassador in France was informed by his Nigerian
counterpart that the players appreciated the offer, but had to
follow a strict diet to stay in playing trim, Thai Foreign Ministry
spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said Thursday.
	   Not wishing to spurn the offer entirely, the Nigerians agreed to
accept a present of Thai rice without any condiments, he said.
	   The Thai embassy in Paris is expected to present a 100-kilogram
(220-pound) sack of high-quality jasmine rice to the team's coach
by the end of the week.
	   Thailand had offered to make 30 meals of khao kaeng (meat curry
over rice) for the Nigerian team ahead of its match against
Bulgaria Friday in appreciation for the West African nation's
purchases of Thai rice.
	   Last year, Nigeria bought 500,000 tons of rice from Thailand,
making it one of Thailand's biggest overseas markets.
	   Nigeria beat Spain 3-2 in its opening match last week. Thailand
does not have a team in the monthlong soccer tournament, but every
game is being televised live here to a large and enthusiastic
audience.

Netanyahu: Israel is considering referendum on West Bank pullback 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Israel-Referendum
By KARIN LAUB
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday
he is looking into ways of holding a referendum on a West Bank
troop withdrawal, a step that would further delay a pullback, but
effectively silence those trying to prevent it.
	   Netanyahu also demanded that the PLO cease efforts to upgrade
its observer status in the United Nations, saying such a move
violated the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements and would be a
``fatal blow'' to peacemaking. Israel might respond by annexing
parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, he said.
	   The prime minister also pledged that construction would begin
soon on 6,500 homes for Jews in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
The Palestinians hope to set up a future capital in the city's
eastern sector and suspended negotiations with Israel in March 1997
after ground was broken for the project.
	   ``By 2000, you will see buildings, quite a few buildings
there,'' Netanyahu said of the area, referred to in Hebrew as Har
Homa and in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim.
	   Netanyahu spoke after receiving a plan by various ministries on
how to improve housing, services and transportation in Jerusalem,
the city whose future will be a key issue in talks on a permanent
peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   As part of the plan, Jerusalem's municipal area would be
expanded westward to incorporate wealthier suburbs and improve the
city's tax base. An eastern ring road would be built to connect
Jewish settlements to the city.
	   The plan also calls for building at least 140,000 homes over the
next two decades, a step that would nearly double the city's
population of 420,000 Jews and 180,000 Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu insisted that the plan did not violate the peace
accords with the Palestinians which stipulate that neither side
take steps that would prejudice the outcome of the talks on the
final status of the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem.
	   Concerning a West Bank troop withdrawal, recent polls have
suggested that two-thirds of Israelis support a U.S. proposal for a
13 percent pullback. Jewish settler leaders have said they would
stage protests and try to topple Netanyahu over such a withdrawal
which would bring 40 percent of the land under Palestinian rule.
	   Netanyahu on Thursday confirmed reports that he was examining
various ways of holding a referendum on a withdrawal.
	   ``We are checking the possibility,'' Netanyahu said. Meetings
have been held ``on a variety of aspects, including technological
ones,'' he said.
	   Palestinian officials accused Netanyahu of playing for time.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's senior aide, Nabil
Abourdeneh, noted Thursday that Israel's parliament has already
approved the 1995 interim peace accord that calls for a gradual
West Bank Bank troop pullback. ``It (a referendum) is a waste of
time,'' Abourdeneh told The Associated Press.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton reportedly has given Netanyahu until
Wednesday to reach a decision on the U.S. peace plan that was first
submitted in January and has been accepted by the Palestinians.
Netanyahu has ignored previous U.S. deadlines, and the Clinton
administration has not taken action against him.

Government announces dlrs 7 billion boost to 1998 budget 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Malaysia-Politics
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia announced Thursday it
would spend an additional 7 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.8 billion) this
year to help boost its economy.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim made the announcement in a
speech at the annual convention of the ruling United Malays
National Organization.
	   International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz told the
UMNO women's group that the spending would stimulate the economy
and spur development.
	   The Southeast Asian nation's economy shrank by 1.8 percent in
the first quarter of this year, compared with 6.9 percent growth in
1997.
	   At the top of the spending list, Rafidah said, were
infrastructure projects such as the Multimedia Super Corridor,
envisioned as Asia's Silicon Valley.
	   ``The development of the MSC's infrastructure must be given
priority,'' she told the assembly. ``Without that, we will not get
the benefits of information technology which will be a major factor
in the country's development and industrialization.''
	   Rafidah said roads and ports would also be given priority as
they generate business.
	   Malaysian stocks rose sharply after Anwar made the announcement,
and the key index closed 4.6 percent higher at 471.82 points.
	   ``The government's doing its bit to preserve the economy,'' said
Joanne Song, an economist at PhileoAllied Securities in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   However, she added that Anwar's announcement was
``overshadowed'' by the U.S. decision to sell dollars to help
Japan's ailing yen, a move that boosted financial markets
throughout Asia.
	   Analysts said the government's move to increase fiscal spending
was welcomed, but may be too little, too late.
	   ``The question would be whether 7 billion is enough,'' said
Zainal Aznam, deputy director general of the Institute of Strategic
and International Studies. ``My hunch is that we may need more than
7 billion.''
	   He said a growing budget deficit may be better than a continual
shrinking economy.
	   ``If you want to have at least some kind of chance to reach a 2
percent growth for 1998, you can't just let the economy slide,''
Zainal said. ``We're in a recession zone. So we have to get this
stimulus going immediately.''

Ethnic Albanians increasingly favor militants With Albania-Kosovo BY ISMET HAJDARI 
</HEADLINE>
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians on Thursday
welcomed their exiled government's proposal for villages to defend
themselves against Serb forces _ a sign public sentiments are
turning increasingly in favor of fighting for Kosovo's
independence.
	   The growing support for militants in the secessionist province
of southern Serbia comes amid a Serb campaign that has driven some
60,000 people from their homes since March. More than 300 people
have died in clashes between Serbs and militants.
	   In the latest evidence the crackdown has not silenced the
shadowy Kosovo Liberation Army, Serb sources reported two incidents
Thursday involving actions by the separatist guerrillas.
	   The state-run Tanjug news agency accused militants of attacking
two Serb villages 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the provincial
capital Pristina early Thursday. The villagers fired back, and
there were no casualties, Tanjug said.
	   Also, the pro-Serb Media Center reported that a Yugoslav army
border patrol opened fire on a group of armed Albanians trying to
enter Kosovo from neighboring Macedonia.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army or KLA, known also by its
Albanian-language acronym UCK, has gained in strength and
popularity this year despite Serb authorities' efforts to crush
militant resistance to their rule.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders, who for years have sought
independence through diplomatic means, now are making overtures to
the KLA out of desperation.
	   After a seven-hour meeting Wednesday in Tirana, Albania, with
representatives of five Kosovo political parties, the Kosovo
Albanians' self-described government-in-exile proposed setting up
self-resistance headquarters in villages across the battered
province.
	   The move is an acknowledgement that the pacifist policies of
ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova have failed.
	   Bujar Bukoshi, the head of the exiled government, admitted late
Wednesday in an interview with The Associated Press that the KLA is
``now a reality and a challenge'' that has to be faced.
	   Many Pristina politicians and residents quickly endorsed the
measure.
	   Baton Haxhiu, an ethnic Albanian journalist, said Kosovo
Albanians may have no choice but to accept the proposal for more to
take up arms.
	   ``This proposal is an attempt to unite the two options among
Albanians _ the pacifist one and the militant,'' said Milazim Koci,
42. ``But the UCK has spread so vastly that I don't think they will
easily relinquish their prized position among the people out there
in the villages.''
	   Bajram Kosumi, deputy head of Kosovo's Parliamentary Party,
called it ``a wise decision, and one our government has the
authority to implement.''
	   Meanwhile, the KLA aired another message Wednesday night on
neighboring Albania's Television Tirana, asking the international
Red Cross to take over two Yugoslav army deserters now in their
hands.
	   According to the KLA message, the two deserters are from
Montenegro, Serbia's tiny co-partner in the Yugoslav Federation.
Since both are of Muslim origin, the KLA said their lives would be
endangered if they were to fall back into Serbian government hands.
	   Parents of Serb soldiers serving in Kosovo also showed their
displeasure Thursday, in another sign of the conflict's
unpopularity. Several hundred blocked traffic in downtown Belgrade,
the Serb and Yugoslav capital, demanding their sons be returned.
	   After an hour, about 40 policemen dispersed the demonstration in
front of the army general-staff headquarters.

Britain closer to Europe than ever before, says Blair 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair said
Thursday he has turned around Britain's relations with Europe since
his Labor government took office a year ago.
	   ``Britain has come a long way in the past year in its relations
with the rest of the EU,'' Blair told deputies at the European
Parliament.
	   The prime minister was delivering his end-of-term report on
Britain's six- month presidency of the European Union. Austria will
take over on July 1.
	   ``The days of the beef war, fourteen against one, government
positions ravaged by warring factions in the governing party are
over,'' he said.
	   Blair said fears that Europe is too centralized and
over-regulated did not justify being anti-European, but they must
be addressed.
	   ``I am pro-European, without hesitation - but I am anti the
status quo,'' he said.
	   The president of the EU Commission, Jacques Santer, said
Britain's new attitude toward Europe is important for both Britain
and the EU.
	   The leader of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament,
Pauline Green, praised the Blair government for its positive
attitude toward the Parliament.
	   ``We all remember the arrogant disregard of the previous
Conservative ministers for the European Parliament,'' she said.
	   Before addressing the deputies, the prime minister spoke
separately to the 214-member Socialist group, the largest faction
in the Parliament.

Thailand asks Muslim neighbors to help develop Islamic tourism 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand has asked Malaysia and
Indonesia to help it develop Islamic tourism facilities to attract
visitors from the Middle East, the country's tourism promotion
board said Thursday.
	   Malaysia and Indonesia are both predominantly Islamic countries,
and Indonesia has the world's biggest Muslim population. Thailand's
population is 90 percent Buddhist, although the country's four
southernmost provinces have Muslim majorities. All three countries
are tolerant of other religions.
	   The statement from the Tourism Authority of Thailand said help
had been sought from Thailand's neighbors since they are ``more
experienced in catering to'' Islamic markets.
	   The authority's aim is to provide Muslim visitors with
facilities and arrangements in accord with their religion's rules,
a tourism spokesman said. These would include dietary and living
arrangements, she said.
	   Prince of Songkhla University in southern Thailand _ the only
university in the country that has an Islamic studies program _
will certify food as halal, meaning it has been prepared according
to Muslim rules, the statement said. The major Muslim dietary
restriction is a ban on eating pork.
	   Thailand made the aid request at the recent meeting of the
Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle working group on
tourism, held in Kedah, Malaysia.
	   The Growth Triangle is an area with 22 million people that
covers five provinces of southern Thailand, four states of
northwestern Malaysia and the Indonesian provinces of north and
west Sumatra, Riau and Aceh. The working group was established to
promote the ``sub-region'' as a single destination.

Indonesian rescuers find bodies of Singapore, Dutch divers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rescuers have found the bodies of a
Dutch man and a Hong Kong movie maker's granddaughter, who had
disappeared while scuba diving in Indonesian waters, the National
Search and Rescue Agency said Thursday.
	   Singaporean Shaw Su Ling, a 29-year-old granddaughter of Sir Run
Run Shaw, and her Dutch companion Phillip Lamette, 31, were
reported missing Saturday while diving near Indonesia's Anambas
Islands in the South China Sea.
	   Shaw is a daughter of Harold Shaw, managing director of the Shaw
Organization, a Singapore-based entertainment company.
	   ``Their bodies have been recovered, and were sent this morning
to Singapore aboard M.V. See Shaw from Tarempa,'' an agency
official said. Tarempa is a town in the islands, about 270
kilometers (168 miles) north of Singapore.
	   The bodies of the two were found late Wednesday.
	   Shaw and Lamette were among a group of 20 Singaporeans who
arrived at the diving spot early Saturday.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey sent six F-16 warplanes Thursday to
northern Cyprus in a sharp warning that it would retaliate to all
Greek military actions threatening Turkish security.
	   The jets landed at Gecitkale airbase, or Lefkoniko in Greek,
some 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of the port town of
Famagusta, two days after four Greek F-16 warplanes and two C-130
transport planes landed at an air base in the southern Greek half
of the Mediterranean island.
	   ``With the airforce deployed on the island, Greece has exhibited
its offensive intentions directed against Turkey,'' the Anatolia
news agency quoted Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz as saying during a
visit to Romania. ``It is out of the question for Turkey not to
respond to that.''
	   ``The Greeks will be the ones to lose from the escalation of
tensions,'' Yilmaz said, underlining that Turkey had no desire for
a war in Cyprus.
	   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said the landing of Greek planes
near Paphos was the ``first step of a permanent deployment,'' by
Greece.
	   The Greek warplanes had returned to Greece. Two of the Turkish
F-16s were scheduled to return to Turkey later in the day.
	   The arrival of the Greek planes was within the framework of a
five-year joint defense agreement between Greek Cypriots and
Greece.
	   The Mediterranean island remains divided since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded the northern-third, following a short-lived coup by
supporters of union with Greece. Turkish Cypriots declared
independence in the northern third of the island in 1983, but it is
only recognized by Turkey.
	   United Nations-sponsored efforts to reunify the island have been
deadlocked.
	   Tensions on the island have been on the rise for the past year
after the Greek Cypriots made a deal with Russia to buy S-300
anti-aircraft missiles. They are due to be deployed on the island
later this year.
	   Turkey says the deal threatens its security and has threatened
to strike if Greek Cypriots go ahead with their deployment. Turkey
increased surveillance on the passage of ships through its straits
for possible missile components.

Poisonous caterpillars invade Belarus 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Storm-ravaged Belarus may be catching up to
Biblical Egypt when it comes to plagues.
	   After trees struck by lightning killed four people and destroyed
thousands of acres of farmland earlier this week, the country faced
another scourge Thursday: poisonous caterpillars.
	   The caterpillars secrete a poisonous liquid that can trigger
allergies, red spots, and body temperatures of up to 40 degrees
Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) when in contact with human skin.
	   Hundreds of people have been affected, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported Thursday.
	   The caterpillars are also quickly munching their way through
tree foliage and flowers, the news agency said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least 14 servicemen were killed and 17 injured
while battling a blaze that engulfed an ammunition storage compound
in the Ural Mountains and set off a series of explosions, a news
agency reported Thursday.
	   Thirteen soldiers and one policeman died, 17 soldiers were
wounded and four were missing, the Interfax news agency said,
citing the Defense Ministry.
	   Firefighting efforts were hampered by the munitions explosions.
By late Thursday afternoon firefighters, doctors, and rescuers were
still on the scene. Some 240 tons of ammunition and other military
equipment were stored at the compound, including mines, artillery
shells and rockets that belonged to Russian troops withdrawn from
East Germany.
	   An Il-76 airplane from the Emergency Situations Ministry that
can carry 40 tons of water was on standby at the airport in the
regional capital Yekaterinburg, about 1500 kilometers (900 miles)
east of Moscow, but no decision had yet been made to send it into
action, Interfax said.
	   The fire broke out Wednesday afternoon after the military
compound was struck by lightning. By Thursday morning, it had
almost completely destroyed the compound, Interfax said.
	   The blaze has also consumed more than 200 hectares (494 acres)
of forest surrounding the compound, Interfax said.
	   More 1,000 residents of nearby villages were evacuated on
Wednesday, but were already returning to their homes Thursday even
though some settlements were without power, water, or telephone
connections because of the explosions, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Blazes at ammunition depots, which are often located in thick
forests, break out frequently in Russia.

Second strike in a week hits Norwegian airlines 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Travelers headed to Norway might want to
double-check flight schedules for the next few days to make sure
the latest labor dispute doesn't disrupt air traffic for the second
time in a week.
	   State-led mediation between the Norwegian Aircraft Mechanics
Association and airlines broke down Thursday. The union ordered
four mechanics to strike immediately.
	   It said 38 more would join the conflict during the weekend, and
another 40 next week unless a settlement were reached.
	   The strike could ground aircraft in need of more than routine
repair, or if crews are not available for scheduled service.
	   On Monday, the government ordered 235 air traffic controllers to
return to work after a four-day strike that grounded virtually all
flights in southern Norway, where most of the country's 4.4 million
people live.
	   The government ordered binding arbitration, saying the strike
was damaging national interests.
	   It took the airlines, which had not expected the back-to-work
order, until Wednesday to round up the crews and aircraft needed
for normal service.

Philippine central bank orders closure of two thrift banks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Central Bank ordered
the closure late Thursday of two thrift banks experiencing cash
flow problems and failures to collect on loans.
	   The two banks were identified as Community Savings and Loan Bank
and Fortune Savings and Loan Association.
	   The Central Bank said the two banks would be placed under
receivership of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp., which
insures deposits in banks.
	   Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said the closure of the
two banks doesn't represent a threat to the Philippine banking
system as their combined assets represent far less than 1 percent
of the banking system's total resources.
	   ``The Philippine banking sector has not been spared by the
financial turmoil ... but bank failures in other Asian countries
have been more widespread,'' Singson noted.
	   Thrift banks, the smallest category of banks in the Philippines,
are required to have a minimum capital of 250 million pesos (dlrs
6.25 million). The largest category, universal banks, are required
to have a minimum capital of 4.5 billion pesos (dlrs 112 million).
	   In the Philippines, universal banks are commercial banks with
expanded licenses allowing them to venture into non-commercial
banking operations such as investment banking and fund management.
	   Since the start of the year, three thrift banks and one small
commercial bank have been ordered closed by the Central Bank. These
banks were also experiencing cash flow problems triggered by the
Asian financial crisis, which led to escalating interest rates in
the region.

Netanyahu: Israel is considering referendum on West Bank pullback 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Israel-Referendum
By KARIN LAUB
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday
that he is looking into ways of holding a referendum on a West Bank
troop withdrawal, a step that would further delay a pullback, but
effectively silence those trying to prevent it.
	   ``We are checking the possibility,'' Netanyahu said. Meetings
have been held ``on a variety of aspects, including technological
ones,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu also demanded that the PLO cease efforts to upgrade
its observer status in the United Nations, saying such a move
violated the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements and would be a
``fatal blow'' to peacemaking. Israel might respond by annexing
parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, he said.
	   The prime minister also pledged that construction would begin
soon on 6,500 homes for Jews in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
The Palestinians hope to set up a future capital in the city's
eastern sector and suspended negotiations with Israel in March 1997
after ground was broken for the project.
	   ``By 2000, you will see buildings, quite a few buildings
there,'' Netanyahu said of the area, referred to in Hebrew as Har
Homa and in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim.
	   Netanyahu spoke after receiving a plan by various ministries on
how to improve housing, services and transportation in Jerusalem,
the city whose future will be a key issue in talks on a permanent
peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   As part of the plan, Jerusalem's municipal area would be
expanded westward to incorporate wealthier suburbs and improve the
city's tax base. An eastern ring road would be built to connect
Jewish settlements to the city.
	   The plan also calls for building at least 140,000 homes over the
next two decades, a step that would nearly double the city's
population of 420,000 Jews and 180,000 Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu insisted that the plan did not violate the peace
accords with the Palestinians that stipulate neither side take
steps that would prejudice the outcome of the talks on the final
status of the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem.
	   Concerning a West Bank troop withdrawal, recent polls have
suggested that two-thirds of Israelis support a U.S. proposal for a
13 percent pullback. Jewish settler leaders have said they would
stage protests and try to topple Netanyahu over such a withdrawal
which would bring 40 percent of the land under Palestinian rule.
	   Palestinian officials accused Netanyahu of playing for time in
studying the possibility for a referendum.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's senior aide, Nabil
Abourdeneh, noted Thursday that Israel's parliament has already
approved the 1995 interim peace accord that calls for a gradual
West Bank Bank troop pullback. ``It (a referendum) is a waste of
time,'' Abourdeneh told The Associated Press.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton reportedly has given Netanyahu until
Wednesday to reach a decision on the U.S. peace plan that was first
submitted in January and has been accepted by the Palestinians.
Netanyahu has ignored previous U.S. deadlines, and the Clinton
administration has not taken action against him.

World Cup: Humble baked bean banished from England camp 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Forget the hooligans. England's latest World Cup
controversy involves something less threatening _ baked beans.
	   Beans have been yanked off the menu at the England team's
training base in France because they allegedly contain too much
sugar, sparking a furor back home.
	   Baked beans, an institution in England, are known to be a
favorite of several of the players, including star striker Alan
Shearer.
	   England dietician John Crane abolished baked beans from the diet
in favor of poached fish, pasta, grilled chicken and lightly-boiled
vegetables.
	   ``With sugar levels so high it could upset the finely-tuned
balance of the players' diets,'' Football Association spokesman
Steve Double said.
	   The decision, reported on the front page of most British
newspapers Thursday, sparked amazement from officials at beans
manufacturer Heinz.
	   Heinz public affairs manager Steve Marinker, ``armed with as
many tins as I can carry,'' traveled to France to challenge the
ban.
	   ``Beans are a fantastic source of protein and fiber and they
come highly recommended for sportsman,'' he said. ``When I get to
La Baule I will be asking the dieticians why they made this
decision and make sure what they are reported to have said is
true.''
	   Nigel Dickie, a nutrition consultant at Heinz, said baked beans
are full of protein and fiber and low in fat.
	   The Times newspaper's medical expert, Dr. Thomas Stuttaford,
said replacing baked beans with broccoli and spinich will rob the
players of nutritional benefits.
	   ``Baked beans contain complex starches needed to release a slow,
regular source of energy,'' he said. ``The sugar content in the
sauce doesn't matter at all _ they will burn that off in no time.''

Production by Japan's leading automakers falls amid sluggish demand 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's leading automakers said Thursday their
production continued to fall in May, reflecting sluggish domestic
demand and declining exports to Asia.
	   Toyota Motor Corp. said domestic production in May fell 20.4
percent from a year earlier to 223,602 vehicles as exports
decreased 3.7 percent to 115,877. Exports of passenger cars rose
2.3 percent, but exports of trucks and buses plunged 23.2 percent.
	   Nissan Motor Co. said domestic output tumbled 22.8 percent to
108,443, while exports declined 10.7 percent to 46,573. The
automaker said exports were hurt by inventory adjustments in North
America. While exports of Nissan's passenger cars tumbled 12.4
percent, exports of its commercial vehicles increased 0.4 percent,
helped by strong demand for its recreational vehicle models in
Europe and the Middle East.
	   Honda Motor Co.'s output dropped 15.3 percent to 89,591, and its
exports dropped 4.8 percent to 40,331. Exports fell for the first
time since August 1996, hurt mainly by a 63 percent plunge in
Asia-bound shipments, said Takeshi Sumita, a Honda spokesman.
	   Separately, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said that its May domestic
production fell 20 percent from a year earlier to 75,210 vehicles
as domestic sales dropped 13.4 percent to 35,691. Exports, however,
rose 4.1 percent to 38,256, helped by growing shipments of
passenger cars to Europe, in particular. Overall passenger car
exports rose 9.3 percent, but commercial exports dropped 6.3
percent. Exports climbed for the first time since March.
	   Mitsubishi's overseas output shrank 27.6 percent to 116,431.
	   Mazda Motor Corp. said its May domestic production fell 22.4
percent from a year earlier to 58,251 vehicles as exports edged
down 1.6 percent to 40,241. Mazda's domestic sales declined 2.1
percent to 23,061.

Russia asks West to encourage Kosovo Albanians 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has urged Western powers to convince Kosovo
Albanians to resume talks with Yugoslav officials, a news agency
reported Thursday.
	   After Russian leaders extracted a promise from Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to resume negotiations with the
moderate leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, the Albanian side
must also be prepared to restart talks, Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told reporters.
	   It is unclear whether talks between the Yugoslav president and
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova could quell the two sides' conflict.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March. The
recent clashes have driven some 60,000 people from their homes,
most within Kosovo. Others have fled to Albania, where some claim
to have been fired on by Serb forces from across the border this
week, or the neighboring Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
	   Rakhmanin said that Russia's western partners in the six-nation
Contact Group monitoring the Balkans could play a crucial role in
bringing Kosovo Albanians back to the negotiating table, Interfax
reported.
	   The Contact Group comprises the United States, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, and Russia.
	   Interfax also reported that two top Russian Foreign Ministry
officials left Thursday on a trip to Yugoslavia, including Kosovo's
capital Pristina, to meet with representatives of both sides in the
conflict.

Military says 98 killed in northern Sri Lanka EDITOR'S NOTE: Sri Lankan military censors made no changes in the following story. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Government troops killed 59 Tamil
Tiger rebels and lost 39 men in the past week in northern Sri
Lanka, where a fierce battle is raging for the control of a
strategic highway, the defense ministry said Thursday.
	   Brigadier Sarath Munasinghe, the ministry spokesman, said 81
soldiers and more than 200 Tamil rebels also were wounded in the
fighting in the Mankulam area between June 11-17.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the military claim
since journalists are barred from visiting the war front.
	   Located 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of Colombo, Mankulam is
the largest town along a 77-kilometer (48-mile) highway that the
army has been trying to seize from the rebels since May last year.
The area has seen the longest and the bloodiest offensive of the
15-year-old civil war.
	   The government troops have taken control of nearly two-thirds of
the highway, with 27 kilometers (17 miles) still under the rebel
control.
	   The military has lost a total of 247 soldiers since it launched
an offensive May 28 to re-capture Mankulam. It claims to have
killed 284 Tamil guerrillas.
	   The government earlier said it lost 208 men and killed 225
rebels in the first 13 days of the latest offensive.
	   The highwayis the only land link between Jaffna, a former rebel
stronghold the army captured two years ago, with the mainland.
Jaffna's half million people at present rely on air and sea
deliveries for food and other supplies.
	   The rebels accuse the Sinhalese majority of widespread
discrimination against minority Tamils. The government denies the
charge.

Death toll rises to 40 in Rwandan rebel attack 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwandan soldiers on Thursday combed the
mountains along the Congolese border where an attack by Hutu rebels
left 40 Tutsis dead and 85 wounded, Radio Rwanda reported.
	   The number of deaths in the attack Wednesday on a camp for
displaced Tutsis at Nkamira, 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of
Kigali, rose from 25 to 40 after some of the victims died on the
way to the hospital in nearby Gisenyi. Most had machete wounds,
doctors said.
	   At least 55 children were among the 85 wounded, Dr. Leon Ngeruka
said.
	   About 50 Hutu rebels, armed with machine-guns and machetes,
attacked from hills surrounding the camp with 6,000 people who have
fled the region's violence, officials said.
	   Often without protection, the displaced Tutsis, most of whom
have returned from decades in exile under the former Hutu
government, have been an easy target for the rebels.
	   In December, a similar rebel attack on the camp and a nearby
army contingent left 71 people dead, including 48 rebels killed by
the troops.
	   Last week, a shadowy rebel group calling itself the Rwanda
Liberation Army issued a statement in Nairobi, Kenya, claiming
responsibility for a June 7 attack on another camp, 20 kilometers
(10 miles) south of Gisenyi.
	   State-run Radio Rwanda said the troops were in search of the
attackers, who had probably crossed from neighboring Congo where
they are believe to maintain bases.
	   The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen who fled the
country in 1994 in fear of reprisals for a 1994 genocide of more
than 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
	   The three-month slaughter ended when Tutsi-led fighters won
power in July 1994.
	   Authorities say the rebels have killed thousands since 1996,
when the Hutu militiamen slipped back into the country with more
than 1 million Hutu refugees.

EU veterinary experts delay vote again on end to beef ban 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union veterinary experts on
Thursday delayed for the second time a vote on whether to lift a
global ban on British beef exports imposed in 1996 because of fears
over ``mad cow'' disease.
	   The experts from the 15 EU countries want more time to consider
the EU Commission's recommendation to resume exports of British
beef from cattle born after Aug. 1, 1996, EU spokesman Gerard Kiely
said.
	   The committee will meet again Tuesday and Wednesday, but it's
unclear whether it will be able to take a decision then, another EU
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The vote was initially scheduled for last Friday but was delayed
until this week. If there is no majority among the veterinary
experts, the proposal to lift the export ban goes to EU agriculture
ministers.
	   Under the proposal, beef must be deboned, come from animals aged
between six and 30 months that have been killed in approved
slaughterhouses and come from herds guaranteed to be free of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, known as mad cow disease.
	   Sources say Britain, Ireland and Sweden favored ending the ban.
Germany and others, however, questioned the wisdom of such a move.
	   The ban was imposed in March 1996 after Britain acknowledged a
link between BSE and the fatal human brain ailment
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

	   NISHINOMIYA, Japan (AP) _ Toru Suzuki, seeking his second title
in two weeks, fired a 7-under-par 65 Thursday and took a one-stroke
lead in the opening round of the 100 million yen (dlrs 730,000)
Yomiuri Open.

Frankie Minoza of the Philippines, who tied for fourth at 68 with
Yoshinori Mizumaki, Shigeki Maruyama and Kazuhiko Hosokawa.
	   Carlos Franco of Paraguay, who leads the earnings list this
season, withdrew midway through the round because of pain in his

Warsaw Appeals Court to act as screening court 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Poland-Condemning Communism
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The rightist-dominated parliament
empowered the Warsaw Court of Appeals on Thursday to investigate
whether politicians and candidates collaborated with Poland's
former communist secret police.
	   The lower house, or Sejm, voted 242-148 with 19 abstentions to
resuscitate a year-old law that never fully took effect because
judges nationwide refused to sit on a 21-member screening panel
envisioned by the law.
	   The law requires lawmakers and political candidates to state
whether they had collaborated with the former communist regime
during 1945-89. Proven collaborators would be barred from holding
political office, judicial posts or jobs in the state-run media.
	   The appeals court, already overburdened, will verify only those
declarations that raise the doubts of a special official charged
with sifting through the declarations.
	   The bill still requires the approval of the upper house and of
the ex-communist President Aleksander Kwasniewski, who said he will
first ask the Constitutional Tribunal to ensure that it does not
violate the constitution.
	   Kwasniewski wanted judges to be assigned to a special screening
panel for 6-month terms and intelligence officers exempted from
screening.
	   The law was proposed by members of the right-wing Solidarity
bloc, founded by democracy activists who were once the main target
of communist repression. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain in
1989, they have argued that those who benefited from the former
totalitarian system should now be barred from office.
	   Only a handful of the 2,000 judges eligible for the screening
panel agreed to participate. Some argued the law does clearly
define ``collaboration'' and that it limits their access to secret
security files that could verify statements.
	   But the refusal also suggested a reluctance to dredge up the
past. Many of the judges were appointed under communism.

World Cup: Scifo makes return in vital game against Mexico 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MONTHIEUX, France (AP) _ Playmaker Enzo Scifo will make a return
to the Belgian team for the vital qualifying game against Mexico,
allowing the veteran to play in his fourth World Cup in a row,
coach Georges Leekens said Thursday.
	   Leekens called on Scifo to provide a sparkle of style and
additional offensive push for Saturday's game after the Belgians
did little else than defending during their opening 0-0 draw with
the Netherlands.
	   ``I need his creativity,'' said Georges Leekens.
	   Mexico leads Group E after beating South Korea 3-1.
	   Scifo, 32, opened his World Cup career at the Mexico edition in
1986, but was long uncertain to play in France, especially after a
long and bitter quarrel with coach Leekens.
	   ``I hadn't counted on this at all,'' said the Anderlecht
midfielder. ``I'm delighted.''
	   Last month, Scifo suffering from flu and the ear infection,
delayed his physical preparation for the finals.
	   ``He has made major strides in his recovery,'' said Leekens.
	   The coach announced two other changes for Saturday's game in
Bordeaux, recovering defender Gordan Vidovic from injury and
holding on to substitute defender Eric Deflandre, who came on early
in the opening match and kicked two Dutch balls off the line to
give Belgium the unexpected draw.
	   Belgian captain Franky Van der Elst was still uncertain for the
game after he had to quit training Wednesday because of a groin
strain.
	   Van der Elst was a key member of Belgium's staunch defense that
kept the favored Dutch to a goalless draw in their first game on
Saturday. Mexico beat South Korea 3-1 to lead the group.
	   Like Scifo, 37-year-old Van der Elst is playing in his fourth
World Cup.

Stewart sends South Africa into bat 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's Steve James was forced to wait a full
session before he got onto the field in his test debut in the
second test against South Africa at Lord's on Thursday.
	   The Glammorgan player was a late inclusion in the team when Mark
Butcher was ruled out with a thumb injury. But after waiting so
long to win his first cap, one rained-out session was only a minor
delay.
	   He had to wait a little longer to fulfill his dream of opening
the innings for England, however, after Alec Stewart won the toss
and sent South Africa into bat.
	   Overnight rain saturated the outfield, delaying the start until
1230 GMT. Play will continue until 1800 GMT or until a minimum of
78 overs are bowled.
	   James and medium pace bowler Dean Headley were the two new
players in the England team, with Headly replacing the injured
Darren Gough.
	   Alec Stewart was passed fit to lead the side after he was
troubled by a bout of food poisoning and a recurrence of a bad
back.
	   South Africa selectors replaced opener Gehardus Liebenberg with
Adam Bacher.
	   England _ Mike Atherton, Steve James, Alec Stewart (captain),
Nasser Hussain, Graham Thorpe, Mark Ramprakash, Mark Ealham,
Dominic Cork, Robert Croft, Dean Headley, Angus Fraser.
	   Twelfth man: Chris Silverwood.
	   South Africa _ Gary Kirsten, Adam Bacher, Jacques Kallis, Daryll
Cullinan, Hansie Cronje (captain), Jonty Rhodes, Mark Boucher,
Shaun Pollock, Lance Klusener, Allan Donald and Paul Adams.
	   Twelfth man: Gehardus Liebenberg.
	   Umpires: George Sharpe (England) and Darrell Hair (Australia).
TV umpire: Barry Dudleyston.
	   Match referee: Javed Burki (Pakistan).

Indonesian military chief warns against rumor-mongers 
</HEADLINE>
By HARIS SYAMAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The head of Indonesia's powerful
military on Thursday announced a crackdown against rumor-mongers he
said were trying to trigger national disintegration amid a
deepening economic and political crisis.
	   Gen. Wiranto did not identify who has been ``systematically
spreading'' rumors that he said would erode public confidence in
the new government of President B.J. Habibie and the armed forces.
	   Rumors have been flowing thickly across the world's fourth most
populous nation since Suharto quit as president and ended 32 years
of autocratic rule last month after a wave of riots and protests.
	   Since taking over, Habibie has promised sweeping political
change and economic reforms.
	   Despite this, many are unhappy with the pace and direction of
Habibie's promised agenda for change and have staged regular
protests against the government.
	   In a stern statement read out to reporters at a meeting with
Habibie, Wiranto said some groups were using the mantle of reform
to cause social unrest as the value of the currency plummets,
inflation soars and unemployment grows.
	   He specifically denied one rumor that members of Suharto's
former New Order regime planned a political comeback.
	   ``There are rumors that former leaders of the New Order are
trying to divert the progress of reform and want to make a comeback
that would restrain reform,'' he said.
	   ``This is baseless and misleading. The aim of the rumors is to
destroy the people's confidence in state institutions and the armed
forces.
	   ``If this condition is allowed to go on, this nation will sink
further into crisis and in the end internal conflict among the
people will be unavoidable and in time the nation will
disintegrate,'' Wiranto said.
	   Wiranto said the military would take action ``to guarantee peace
and security for the people'' and would ``stop criminals.''
	   He did not elaborate.
	   At the height of last month's political events, thousands troops
and dozens of tanks were deployed on the streets of Jakarta. All
but a handful have since returned to barracks.

Pakistan says nuclear testing moratorium could be broken 
</HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan warned Thursday that its
unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing could broken if it
discovers neighboring India has taken a lead in the nuclear arms
race.
	   ``If at any stage we feel that we need to take actions which are
necessary in our supreme national interest, we reserve the right to
take such actions,'' according to a foreign ministry statement
issued in response to a question of whether the unilateral
moratorium meant the end to nuclear testing for Pakistan.
	   Pakistan tested six nuclear devices last month, one-upping its
longstanding enemy India which tested five nuclear devices two
weeks before Pakistan's tests.
	   The nuclear testing caused an international furor and sparked
fears among the world's major powers of a nuclear arms race in an
impoverished region that has been the scene of three wars in 51
years.
	   Pakistan and India fought two wars over the disputed state of
Kashmir, in 1948 and again in 1965. It fought a third war in 1965
over Bangladesh, or what was known then as east Pakistan.
	   A fourth confrontation loomed in 1990 when relations between the
two countries plummeted again over Kashmir, the former Himalayan
state that both countries claim.
	   Earlier this month, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub
warned that a fourth conflagration on the subcontinent would likely
escalate into a nuclear war.
	   The international community has urged both Pakistan and India to
step back from the edge of a nuclear arms race. Pakistan has
offered to sign a non-aggression pact with India as well as a
regional no-test agreement, but New Delhi has rejected both.
	   ``We have made it clear that Pakistan, while continuing to
exercise restraint, will nonetheless calibrate its response to the
level of provocation,'' said the foreign ministry statement.
	   ``There are a number of factors which need to be analyzed,''
including the results of India's nuclear tests and the potential
weapons capability of neighboring India, it said.
	   ``We will continue to closely scrutinize our regional security
situation in order to ensure that a balance is maintained at all
times,'' the statement said.

Parliament condemns communism in Poland as responsible for crimes 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Poland-Communist Collaborators
By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ After years of debate and resistance,
parliament on Thursday adopted a resolution condemning communism
and holding the former communist party responsible for its ``many
crimes and offenses.''
	   Still, the hard-won resolution, passed by a vote of 250-150 with
31 abstentions in the powerful lower chamber, or Sejm, was
considerably softer than Solidarity deputies wanted.
	   The Solidarity bloc's original draft included language declaring
the former communist party, Polish United Workers Party, a criminal
organization and collectively condemning its members responsible
for the totalitarian system's evils. They backed down in a
compromise with their junior coalition partner, the Freedom Union,
who said the wording generalized the crimes and harmed people who
were not directly responsible.
	   The ex-communist left opposed the resolution as
counterproductive, focusing on the past at the expense of reforms
needed to bring Poland into NATO and the European Union. Leftist
deputies walked out of parliament when the motion first came to the
floor in April to continue work in committee on a plan to redraw
administrative districts.
	   Solidarity politicians, however, say that a full reckoning with
the past is necessary before Poland can truly move ahead. Since
communism fell in 1989, no former leader has been convicted of
wrongdoing, leaving the wounds of the past open for many,
particularly former Solidarity activists who were singled out by
the communist regime.
	   The resolution said the former communist party was ``in the
highest degree, to the very end, responsible for the continuation
and the shape of the communist system in Poland, which is guilty of
many crimes and offenses.''
	   It says that the ``communist dictatorship was imposed in Poland
by the Soviet Union and Joseph Stalin, against the nation's will
... the imposed system introduced a utopia economy that destroyed
the country.
	   ``The system was maintained with force, lies and with the threat
of Soviet intervention and it served foreign interest.''
	   Communism was imposed on Poland in 1945 as World War II was
ending. Under orders from Russian liberators, Polish communist
officials' first act was to arrest and secretly execute thousands
of members of the Nazi resistance, the best of Poland's surviving
intelligentsia and considered a threat to communist doctrine.
	   The four decades of communist rule was marked by repeated bloody
quelling of social protests, notably in 1956, 1968, 1970 and 1976.
The last one was 1981 martial law, intended to crush Solidarity
democratic movement. Ultimately, the bloody crackdown galvanized
resistence, which continued until the weakened communists consented
to talks in 1989 aimed at bringing Solidarity into government.
	   Communist officials were ousted in 1990 elections.
	   In the intervening years, attempts by Solidarity-controlled
governments to officially condemn communism took a backseat at
times to urgent reforms, and the issue was stalled in
leftist-controlled legislatures from 1993-1997.

Hundreds of deported Eritreans reach homeland 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Eritrea-Ethiopia

<TEXT>
	   OM HAJER, Eritrea (AP) _ Hundreds of angry Eritreans deported
from Ethiopia amid a border conflict were warmly welcomed home by
countrymen waving flags and singing patriotic songs.
	   Buses, army trucks and pickups loaded with 720 Eritreans were
headed from the southwestern tip of the country along bad roads to
the capital Thursday.
	   They returned as the Organization of African Unity began a
diplomatic effort to resolve the nearly 6-week-old conflict that
has killed hundreds on both sides of the disputed border.
	   The deportations were fiercely criticized by Eritrea as a
``witch-hunt,'' but Ethiopia said the deportees posed security
risks because they had military training or were raising funds for
the Eritrean war effort.
	   That contention was denied by many of the deportees.
	   ``Not even now when we are standing in Eritrea, we are not
raising money for the war, not now and not in the future,'' said
Hiab Gebreselassie, a 30-year-old school principal.
	   The deportees who crossed into Eritrea at Om Hajer, 310
kilometers (190 miles) to the southwest, on Wednesday carried few
belongings and told harrowing tales of being hauled off to military
camps from their beds, offices and an airport.
	   The mostly male deportees feared for the safety of the wives,
mothers and children they were forced to leave behind. Men from age
18 to 22 remained in camps in Ethiopia, deportees said.
	   Alem Gebreab, 41, said military police pulled him from his bed
at home in Addis Ababa and dragged him in his slippers to ``a
concentration camp'' where other Eritreans were being held.
	   Alem, who worked at a printing press, said he suspected some
Ethiopian official wanted his home. ``They're selfish.''
	   ``I want my family alive. That is all I want from them,'' he
said, adding he will rebuild his life in Eritrea.
	   In a well-organized welcoming ceremony, villagers lined the
dusty street of Om Hajer, clapping, dancing and singing an
insulting song about Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.
	   Cups of sweet tea, water and a traditional flatbread were
quickly served _ the travelers had not had enough to eat or drink
for the past three days.
	   ``This is a very bad crime,'' said a 43-year-old deportee who
lost limbs when he served in the Ethiopian army. ``I lost my hand
and leg for them _ and now I get this.''
	   He declined to give his name out of concern for his family.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
rebels overthrow a 17-year military regime in July 1991. Eritrea
gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.
	   Ethiopia has accused Eritrea of expelling thousands of its
citizens, a charged denied by Eritrea.
	   The Eritrean government has failed to reply to a letter
Ethiopian officials sent last week complaining of the
disappearances of 19 Ethiopians in Eritrea, including prominent
community leaders. Two embassy drivers who were arrested have been
released.

Cambodian premier calls for arrest, trial of Khmer Rouge leaders 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian Co-Premier Hun Sen called
Thursday for the immediate arrest and trial of Khmer Rouge
guerrilla leaders, but hinted that the group's nominal president
could be granted amnesty if he turns in his comrades.
	   The government wants to try Ta Mok, the real leader of what
remains of the radical group; Nuon Chea, who had been No. 2 to the
group's notorious former leader, Pol Pot; and Khieu Samphan, long
seen as the guerrilla group's more palatable public face.
	   Hun Sen said that if Khieu Samphan helped capture the other two
longtime Khmer Rouge leaders, ``we will forgive (him).''
	   If he didn't cooperate, he would be arrested and brought to
trial with the others, Hun Sen told reporters after a speech to
business school students in the capital.
	   The Khmer Rouge was responsible for the deaths of as many as 2
million Cambodians from overwork, starvation and execution when it
held power from 1975-79.
	   After the Khmer Rouge was ousted by Vietnamese-backed troops, it
continued to wage guerrilla warfare against successive governments.
	   Wracked by defections since 1996 _ including five influential
hard-liners just this week _ the decades-old revolutionary movement
appeared to be on the verge of extinction.
	   Pol Pot, ousted by his own comrades last year, died in mid-April
of a heart attack as the group was being driven out of its last
major stronghold.
	   The current whereabouts of Ta Mok, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan
are not known.
	   ``We will have forgiveness (for Khieu Samphan) if now he arrests
Ta Mok and Nuon Chea for us,'' said Hun Sen. ``We will have an
exchange on this point.''
	   Co-Defense Minister Tea Banh said Thursday the three top-ranking
guerrillas ``are still on the run along the border and we are
searching for them.''
	   Though Khieu Samphan is seen by historians as being as culpable
as any of the Khmer Rouge leaders for the atrocities they carried
out, Tea Banh agreed that if he could help turn Ta Mok and Nuon
Chea over to the government, an amnesty for him would likely be
considered.
	   ``If he can do so, he will be considered as the one who
contributes to ending the war,'' Tea Banh said by telephone. ``If
he can bring benefit to national interest, we must take his deed
into consideration.''
	   After former Khmer Rouge foreign minister Ieng Sary defected to
the government in 1996 with some 10,000 war-weary guerrillas, he
received a royal pardon lifting a death sentence handed down in
absentia in 1979 by a Phnom Penh court. That pardon does not
protect Ieng Sary from prosecution by an international tribunal.

Hotels boost pay, avert strikes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A day-long strike at Lisbon's four
Tivoli hotels was averted Thursday after management agreed at the
last minute to a 6 percent pay hike, union leaders said.
	   The agreement, reached Wednesday night, was similar to dozens
worked out in recent weeks at other Lisbon hotels, union spokesman
Rodolfo Caseiro said.
	   A strike planned Thursday at the five-star Ritz hotel was also
put on hold after management agreed to meet for new talks Monday,
Caseiro said.
	   The union will go ahead with a work stoppage at the Lisbon
Sheraton if no deal is reached Thursday, Caseiro said.
	   Services at the Sheraton were severely affected by a strike
earlier this month, when most staff at the hotel heeded a strike
call.
	   Unions have pressed for an improvement on the 3 percent
sector-wide pay award made at the start of the year, pointing to an
increased workload and soaring profits during the Portuguese
capital's Expo 98 world's fair.
	   Lisbon hotels have hiked prices by as much as 35 percent in
response to increased demand during Expo 98, according to the
Association of Portuguese Hotels.
	   Promoters expect some 8.3 million visitors, almost half of them
foreign, at Expo 98, far exceeding the capacity of the city's
hotels and forcing tourists to stay outside town. The fair opened
May 22 and will close Sept. 30.

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ African leaders, opening a mission
to restore peace in the Horn of Africa, met Thursday with Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and headed for an afternoon session
with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
	   The countries' border conflict that broke out in early May has
claimed hundreds of lives on three fronts and in air attacks. In a
first sign that the two men may be willing to compromise, they
agreed under U.S.-Italian pressure on Sunday to halt air strikes.
	   Ground fighting has subsided since June 11.
	   Organization of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed
Salim said after the meeting with Meles that the delegation brought
a ``message of concern on behalf of Africa and the message of
Africa's desire to see a peaceful end to this very tragic and very
unfortunate conflict.'' He declined to answer questions about the
meeting.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey sent six F-16 warplanes Thursday to
northern Cyprus in a sharp warning that it would retaliate against
all Greek military actions it viewed as threatening Turkish
security.
	   The jets landed at Gecitkale airbase, or Lefkoniko in Greek,
some 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of the port town of
Famagusta. They flew in two days after four Greek F-16 warplanes
and two C-130 transport planes landed at an air base in the
southern Greek half of the Mediterranean island.
	   ``With the air force deployed on the island, Greece has
exhibited its offensive intentions directed against Turkey,'' the
Anatolia news agency quoted Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz as saying
during a visit to Romania. ``It is out of the question for Turkey
not to respond to that.''
	   ``The Greeks will be the ones to lose from the escalation of
tensions,'' Yilmaz said, underlining that Turkey had no desire for
a war in Cyprus.
	   Turkey was also planning to send a cargo plane full of staff
officers, private NTV television said.
	   Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos criticized Turkey for
sending the jets.
	   ``It is not Mr. Yilmaz's right to send fighter planes to the
Turkish occupied part of Cyprus. It is completely illegal, because
first of all there shouldn't be a Turkish occupation there,''
Pangalos said. ``Turkey already has a host of military weapons,
illegally, on Cypriot territory.''

Separatist rebels kill three in western New Guinea: report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rebels fighting Indonesian rule in
western New Guinea have shot and killed three civilians, a report
said Thursday.
	   Members of the outlawed Free Papua Movement ambushed the victims
Wednesday on a road outside Jayapura, the provincial capital of
Irian Jaya, about 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) east of Jakarta,
the daily Suara Pembaruan reported.
	   The attackers escaped into a nearby forest, the newspaper said.
	   The three victims were settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
	   Irian Jaya, a former Dutch colony that covers the western
portion of New Guinea Island, was taken over by Indonesia in 1963.
	   The rebels have been fighting since then for independence.

EU approves dlrs 1.65 million in emergency aid for Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union approved
humanitarian aid for Kosovo worth dlrs 1.65 million Thursday to
help tens of thousands of people who have fled the fighting in the
southern Serbian province.
	   The money will help provide shelter and medical aid to refugees
fleeing Kosovo into Albania. It will also lend support to Albanian
families who give them shelter, a statement by the EU Commission
said.
	   ``Escalation of the violence in Kosovo triggered the flight of
over 50,000 people from their homes in areas near the border with
Albania,'' the statement said.
	   ``Over 10,000 of them crossed the border into Europe's poorest
country, and the situation is expected to deteriorate still
further.''
	   The money will be used to fund projects run by humanitarian
organizations in the Albanian-majority province over the next three
months.
	   Earlier this month the Commission said it would increase a dlrs
2.2 million aid package earmarked this year for Kosovo to help
Albania cope with the influx of refugees from the Serbian province.
	   Separately, EU foreign ministers have approved spending of dlrs
990,000 to enable former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to
act as EU envoy to the region - although Belgrade has warned it
won't tolerate meddling in its internal affairs.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic launched an offensive in February against
Albanian nationalists in the province.

Russia sells submarine to China 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian shipyard completed a new submarine
destined for China on Thursday, a news agency reported.
	   The Kilo-class diesel-electric submarine will be handed over at
the end of the year. It is Russia's second of that class for China,
Interfax reported.
	   The submarine can carry a total of 18 torpedoes and costs about
dlrs 300 million on the world market.
	   Russia has become a major military supplier to China in recent
years. The two countries have frequently signed deals worth
hundreds of millions of dollars for Su-27 warplanes, Kilo-class
submarines and 7,600-ton Sovremenny destroyers.
	   China, which has the largest military in the world in terms of
manpower, is far behind Western armies with its high-technology
weapons.
	   And if it ever makes good on its threats to use force to assert
its claim of sovereignty over Taiwan, its fleet of submarines,
including the advanced Kilo class subs, would be key to enforcing a
blockade of the island.

Report: secret phone number led to unfair ticket sales byline. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs; UPDATES with report of secret phone number, changes
By MARILYN AUGUST
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A confidential phone number giving privileged
callers direct access to World Cup ticket sales may have allowed
thousands to unfairly buy up huge numbers of tickets, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
	   France's organizing committee did not directly deny the report
in Le Parisien. It said that a ``technical'' phone number existed
in addition to the main switchboard number _ but that the number
didn't correspond to the one published by the newspaper.
	   The main number was in service from April 22 through May 8 to
sell 170,000 tickets on a first-come, first-served basis.
	   But the switchboard was so swamped, most callers had to dial
more than 500 times before getting through.
	   According to Le Parisien, the secret number _ leaked from within
France's main telephone company, France Telecom _ allowed callers
in the know to get through immediately.
	   The paper cited a person identified only as Frederic, a
communications student, who used the number to snap up more than
400 tickets.
	   At a daily briefing, Bruno Travade, communications director for
the CFO, France's central organizing committee, said only that the
number published didn't correspond to what he called ``a technical
number.''
	   He said the committee has asked France Telecom to launch its own
investigation.
	   The revelations came a day after three people, including a
consultant for a subsidiary of the World Cup's marketing agency,
were arrested in an investigation into ticket fraud.
	   The arrests on Wednesday were a response to the 12,000 Japanese
fans who were left ticketless for the World Cup.
	   Police arrested the consultant for ISL France at his home Monday
in the upscale western Paris suburb of Rueil-Malmaison, said police
officials, speaking on customary anonymity.
	   Investigators found a large amount of cash and about 100 World
Cup tickets at the home of the consultant, identified as Gilles
Favard, the police said.
	   ISL Worldwide, which has a minority stake in ISL France and is
the marketing agency for soccer's international body FIFA, said it
was conducting an audit of the French company's books.
	   Glen Kirton, ISL Worldwide senior vice president, told a news
conference Wednesday that ISL France ``is an independent company
responsible for its own business and the employment of permanent
and non-permanent persons who operate the business.''
	   He said it ``has no relationship with FIFA in any capacity,
either via ISL Worldwide or otherwise.''
	   It was the latest scandal to hit France's controversial sale of
World Cup tickets.
	   Critics have said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.7 million tickets
printed, almost 1.5 million were earmarked for interests in the
host country.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Residents living near the site of a deadly cyanide
spill in Kyrgyzstan have begun moving back to their homes, a news
agency reported Thursday.
	   More than 4,000 people were evacuated after a truck carrying an
estimated 1,700 kilograms (3,400 pounds) of cyanide crashed into
the Barskaan River on May 20, killing four and sending than 400 to
the hospital.
	   Residents of the area began returning home on Thursday. Local
authorities promise that everyone who was forced to leave the area
will be able to return to their settlements by the end of the week,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The Barskaan river feeds into Lake Issyk Kul, which includes a
valuable nature preserve and is home to several rare species.
	   The cyanide was being delivered to a gold mine operated by
Canada's Cameco company, the world's largest publicly traded
uranium company.
	   Citing the government commission investigating the spill, the
Interfax news agency said that Gerhard Glattes, the former
president of the Kumtor Operating Company, was being interrogated
by the Kyrgyz Security Ministry. It said that the a legal case has
been opened on charges of damaging the environment, which can carry
punishment from 12 to 20 years in prison.

Au pair returns to hometown that campaigned for her freedom 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS, RAISES references to near-deserted streets
By AUDREY WOODS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Finally, Louise Woodward got to see
firsthand the yellow ribbons and ``Justice for Louise'' banners
that have bedecked this quiet little village for so many months.
	   But the streets were nearly deserted Thursday as the former au
pair returned, in contrast to scenes of wild rejoicing when a
Massachusetts court let her out of jail in November.
	   Declaring the Woodward family needed privacy with their
daughter, convicted of manslaughter in the death of an 8-month-old
baby in her care, villagers went about their business as normal _
or as normally as possible with dozens of reporters and TV crews
around.
	   Christine Gray, a member of the committee campaigning for Ms.
Woodward's freedom, said residents wanted to avoid the champagne
celebrations so criticized when a judge reduced the au pair's
conviction from second-degree murder to manslaughter, sentencing
her to the 279 days she already had served.
	   ``I just feel very happy and I feel tearful,'' Mrs. Gray said.
``It's been a privilege to have been able to help an innocent
girl.''
	   After flying into London's Heathrow Airport and driving 180
miles (290 kms) to Manchester to hold a news conference, Ms.
Woodward, 20, traveled the last 30 miles (50 kms) to Elton in a
mini-van with both parents at her side.
	   She walked up the drive to the family home, where her younger
sister, Vicky, stood in the doorway. They hugged and went inside
for a private moment before coming back out to pose for a small
pool of photographers.
	   A ``Justice for Louise'' poster was still visible in a
downstairs window.
	   ``It's a very emotional time for us,'' resident Audrey McCardle
said. ``We just want her to go home quietly, be with her family and
be left to get on with her life.''
	   Phil Ward of Newton-le-Willows in Yorkshire, about 80 miles (135
kms) away, camped out in Elton overnight just to catch a glimpse of
Ms. Woodward.
	   ``I just burst into tears when I heard her,'' he said of her
press conference, viewed avidly all over Elton. ``Not tears of
sadness but tears of joy because she was back with their family
where she belongs.''

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ A small commuter plane billowing smoke
crash-landed at Mirabel airport Thursday morning, killing all 12 on
board, Canadian police said.
	   Police officials said the plane was based at nearby Dorval
airport and had been headed to Ontario. The plane was rerouted
because of the smoke.
	   Police Sgt. Marcel Parent told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
that the cloudy weather at the airport Thursday morning did not
appear to be a factor.
	   ``We were told there was a technical problem,'' Parent said.
	   Officials had few other details.
	   Smoke could be seen billowing from the aircraft at the end of
one of Mirabel's runways, and emergency vehicles surrounded the
wreck.
	   Mirabel airport lies about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of
Montreal.

Philippine stocks rise sharply on stronger yen; peso gains 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with peso closing higher
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks soared Thursday,
ending seven days of losses after joint U.S.-Japanese market
intervention reversed the yen's recent slide.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 112.41 points,
or 6.6 percent, to 1,828.59, its heftiest gain in four months.
	   The peso also rose sharply against the dollar in early trading
but then slipped partially back as the market began to doubt that
the joint U.S.-Japan intervention to support the yen could be
sustained, traders said.
	   After touching a morning low of 39.800 pesos, the dollar
averaged 40.425 pesos for the day, down 3 percent from Wednesday's
41.717 pesos.
	   The dollar was last traded at 40.650 pesos, close to its
intraday high of 40.830 pesos.
	   One trader said the market saw the intervention as a ``temporary
relief'' in the yen's continued weakening.
	   Some players opted to purchase dollars at the 40-peso level,
believing the peso will depreciate anew when support for the yen
isn't sustained, traders said.
	   Analysts fear that a continued decline in the yen might spark a
new round of currency devaluations in the rest of Asia, throwing
the region back into financial turmoil.
	   In stock trading, traders said the decision by the U.S. Federal
Reserve, on behalf of the Bank of Japan and the U.S. Treasury, to
address the yen's decline renewed investor confidence in Asian
stock markets.
	   Traders hailed the Fed's move as timely and a great strategy.
	   ``It's not every day that the Fed intervenes,'' said Ian Kane,
trader for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc.
	   Kane said he expects further upticks in the market during the
next two to three trading days.
	   Beyond that, however, the market may resume its downturn as
inherent problems in the region remain, traders said.
	   ``Enjoy it (the rally) while it lasts,'' said Mitzi de Dios,
trader for ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett Securities Philippines Inc. ``Asia
is still viewed as one region by foreign investors, so we are still
at the mercy of the yen and how the rest of the region performs,''
she said.
	   De Dios said the problem doesn't end with the Fed intervention.
Japan still needs to do something about its economy, which is
saddled with a debilitating recession, she said.
	   ``The recession can't be reversed immediately. What Japan can do
now is to start injecting reforms to prop up its economy,'' she
said.
	   Fears of more bad loans as the peso weakens and the Philippine
economy slows down are also weighing down on Manila shares,
particularly bank stocks, Kane said. The latest to signify its plan
to seek debt relief is flag carrier Philippine Airlines, which is
burdened with heavy losses and a dlrs 2 billion debt.
	   On Wednesday, the Philippine Stock Exchange Index sank 10.37
points in its seventh straight session of weakness. The string of
losses, attributed by traders to the weakness in Asian currencies
sparked by the yen's fall, shaved a total of 241.58 points, or 12
percent, off the main index.

Bosnian conflict should be lesson to Kosovo, Plasvic warns 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The Bosnian Serb president warned Thursday
that the bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia should serve as a
lesson to Kosovo that prevention is better than cure in the
volatile Balkans.
	   ``The flames of war in Bosnia have just been extinguished. But
everyone is truly worried by the appearance of a possible crisis in
Kosovo,'' said Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plasvic during a
visit to Athens.
	   ``Anything can be achieved during the stages of discussion. But
... war is very easy to begin and very difficult to put an end
to,'' she stressed.
	   Tension has been steadily mounting in the southern Serbian
province of Kosovo between Serbs and ethnic Albanians, who make up
about 90 percent of the local population.
	   A Serb campaign has driven some 60,000 people from their homes
in the area since March. More than 300 people have died in clashes
between Serbs and ethnic Albanian militants.
	   ``No one has the right to experiment so much with the peoples
who live in this area,'' Plasvic said without elaborating.
	   ``Whatever has happened and is happening in the Balkans can be a
lesson that preventative measures are the main factor for the
achievement of stability and peaceful development in the area,''
she said.
	   The potential for an escalation of tension in Kosovo has sparked
concern that the conflict could spill over into neighboring
countries and trigger a wider Balkan war.
	   ``We must implement all past experiences to avoid the rekindling
of a possible conflict in Kosovo,'' Plasvic said. ``We believe
there are enough logical politicians who will make preventative
efforts so that we don't reach that situation.''

World Cup: Matthaeus aims to set record for most matches 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Lothar Matthaeus still hopes to get that
record _ his 22nd World Cup match.
	   It would make Matthaeus alone the player with most World Cup
matches. Right now, the 37-year-old German veteran, who is in his
fifth World Cup, shares that honor with three others _ Uwe Seeler
of Germany, Wladyslaw Zmuda of Poland and Diego Maradona of
Argentina. All four have played 21 World Cup matches.
	   But to set the record, Matthaeus must play. Captain of Germany's
1990 victorious team, Matthaeus was a late addition to Germany's
current roster and has to reconcile himself with sitting on the
bench.
	   ``My personal goal naturally is to play at this World Cup,''
Matthaeus said in an interview published Thursday with the German
soccer magazine Kicker.
	   ``The coach surely didn't bring me here to carry suitcases. He
has confidence in me. And the fans also have confidence in me,''
Matthaeus said.
	   Germans fans shouted Matthaeus' name during Germany's 2-0
victory over the United States in its opener.
	   ``I don't want to disappoint this confidence. If I get to play,
I will do everything to reconcile my personal goal with the common
goal of the team,'' Matthaeus said.
	   Matthaeus seems unlikely to win the job of libero from the
reliable Olaf Thon. But the German media had been speculating that
Matthaeus may be brought into defensive midfield Sunday against
Yugoslavia in Lens.
	   When Germany opened its 1990 campaign against Yugoslavia,
Matthaeus scored twice in a 4-1 victory that launched Germany
toward the title.
	   ``We can of course play a different game tactically against
Yugoslavia than we did against the United States. And the starting
lineup could look differently. Of course, it could still be without
Matthaeus,'' he said.
	   The Germans began the game against the United States with two
offensive midfielders, winning 2-0. But against Yugoslavia's
dangerous forwards, coach Berti Vogts looks likely to use more
defensive midfielders and leave Andy Moeller as the only offensive
midfielder.

Thai share prices, currency strengthen; repo rate cut 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo BK103
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai stock prices shot up more than 10
percent at one point Thursday after the currency followed advances
made by the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said the central bank
cut its one-day bond repurchase rate by 1.25 percentage points to
17.75 percent to reflect the improvement in the currency.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index, which finished Wednesday
at 272.94, broke above the psychological barrier of 300 points to
304.65 before profit-taking brought it down to 295.15 at the close,
still a gain of 8.1 percent.
	   The Thai baht was strengthening to about 41.22 to the U.S.
dollar from 43.10 Wednesday after the Japanese currency firmed up
to 136 from 141 after the United States intervened to bolster the
yen.
	   Dealers said that the huge gains on the Thai stock market were
unsustainable since the country remains in recession and economic
fundamentals are in disarray.
	   The rise in the yen, however, removed investor fears that China
would devalue its currency and undermine the rest of Asia.
	   The Finance Ministry, meanwhile, said Thailand generated a trade
surplus of dlrs 958 million in May, compared with a deficit of dlrs
587 million in the same month last year.

Study: Smoking doubles risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease 
</HEADLINE>

By EMMA ROSS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Smokers are more than twice as likely as people
who have never smoked to develop dementia and Alzheimer's disease,
a study published Friday suggests.
	   Results of other studies conflict on whether smoking increases
the risk of developing Alzheimer's or protects against it. But
scientists say the latest study by researchers at Erasmus
University in the Netherlands is important because it is the
largest to investigate the link and the first major project to have
evaluated people before they develop brain disease.
	   The study, published in this week's issue of The Lancet, a
British medical journal, followed 6,870 men and women aged 55 and
older living in a suburb of Rotterdam. It found that smokers were
2.2 times more likely to develop dementia of any kind and had a
risk for Alzheimer's disease that was 2.3 times higher than those
who had never smoked cigarettes.
	   Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia,
estimated to affect nearly 18 million people worldwide, or 3
percent of people over the age of 60, according to the
not-for-profit organization Alzheimer's Disease International.
	   Unlike previous studies, none of the people in the Rotterdam
study had dementia when first examined. They were asked about their
smoking habits and divided into smokers, former smokers and those
who had never smoked. Two years later, 146 of them had developed
dementia and 105 of those had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's
disease.
	   Factors such as age, sex, education and alcohol intake were
taken into account.
	   Within that group, the researchers also examined the effect of
smoking on people who carried a gene believed to increase the risk
of Alzheimer's disease. They found that despite the overall result
that smoking doubled the risk of developing the degenerative
disease, smokers who carried the gene actually were no more likely
to develop the disease than non-smokers.
	   But smokers who did not carry the gene were found to be four
times more likely to develop the disease than non-smokers, the
study said.
	   ``It seems that if you have the gene, you're better off if you
smoke,'' said Dr. Monique Breteler, who headed the research.
	   Dr. Anthony Mann, an old-age psychiatrist and professor of
epidemiology at the Institute of Psychiatry in London, called the
study's results ``powerful.''
	   ``They are the first to do a prospective study and it's the
largest to show a positive link,'' Mann said. ``It's the best we've
had. It takes forward that things that put you at risk for vascular
disease put you at risk for dementia in general.''
	   Scienctists are unsure exactly how smoking might contribute to
Alzheimer's.

Turkish, Romanian premiers meet 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Turkish and Romanian prime
ministers agreed Thursday that trade between the two countries
should increase to dlrs one billion a year.
	   The two-day official visit by Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz is the
first by a Turkish premier to Romania in 12 years, Yilmaz said said
after meeting with counterpart Radu Vasile.
	   Both sides voiced willingness to improve collaboration in such
domains as energy, transportation and oil, especially in the
pipeline that will take gasoline from the Caspian Sea through the
Black Sea to Western Europe.
	   Vasile and Yilmaz promised to visit each other's country twice a
year, ``or even more often if necessary,'' said Yilmaz.
	   The Turkish prime minister was to meet with President Emil
Constantinescu on Friday.

Philippine central bank chief calls inflation `worrisome' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The increase in the Philippines'
inflation rate so far this year is worrisome because it makes it
increasingly unlikely that the government will achieve its
inflation target, an official said Thursday.
	   Sharp increases in food prices and the El Nino drought caused
consumer prices to rise a higher-than-expected 10.3 percent last
month.
	   The government has set an average inflation target of between
7.5 and 8.5 percent for 1998, although this is expected to be
revised upward soon, possibly to between 9.5 and 10.0 percent.
	   Central bank Governor Gabriel Singson said he is concerned with
the relatively high inflation average, but noted that it is still
far below the level of some other Asian countries embroiled in the
region's financial crisis.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ George Bush and Boris Yeltsin traded light-hearted
banter and bear hugs Thursday at a Kremlin reception marking Bush's
first visit to Moscow since he lost the presidency in 1992.
	   Yeltsin jovially gave himself and Bush credit for ending the
Cold War, declaring with a smile that they had ``turned everything
around, decreased the level of strategic weapons, and signed a
partnership of friendship between our two countries.''
	   Bush said that seeing Yeltsin was ``like seeing an old friend''
and added that he believed the Russian president would ``prevail in
the reforms he has initiated.''
	   Yeltsin declared the former U.S. president in ``good physical
form,'' and praised his wife, Barbara.
	   In fact, even though he has a generally low opinion of American
cookery, Yeltsin said he had read Mrs. Bush's cookbook and some of
the recipes ``coincide'' with his tastes.
	   Bush, apparently trying to return the compliment, then pointed
at Yeltsin and chirped to reporters, ``My wife Barbara is still
madly in love with him.''

World Cup: German confidence growing as injured healing 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ The injured are healing and German
confidence is growing before Sunday's match against Yugoslavia,
which is likely to decide the winner of Group F.
	   The Germans are keen to avoid the Netherlands in the second
round, with the conventional wisdom being that the Dutch would win
Group E and play the second-placed team from Group F.
	   ``We want to win our group,'' said coach Berti Vogts, whose team
has a 14-7 winning record against Yugoslavia, with three draws.
Germany, European champion, is seeking to match Brazil's four World
Cup titles.
	   While Germany overwhelmed the United States 2-0 in its opening
match, Yugoslavia, back in the World Cup after an eight-year
absence because of sanctions, struggled to a 1-0 win over underdog
Iran.
	   German libero Olaf Thon warned Thursday that Yugoslavia would
surely improve, but that the Germans would be stronger as well.
	   ``Against the United States, we attacked a lot on the flanks but
that last cross didn't come,'' Thon said. ``We've been training
hard these crosses so that our forwards can get more balls.''
	   ``We have to put the Yugoslavs under pressure, we have to check
them early so that we can get some turnovers and launch
counter-attacks,'' the 32-year-old libero from Schalke 04 said.
``They have very skilled individuals, and their forwards can also
pass very well. They have to be marked very closely, they must not
be given space.''
	   He expected the match to be a tactical exercise, probably played
at slow pace because of the early kickoff (1230 GMT).
	   Christian Woerns, who could get the job of marking Yugoslavia's
star striker Predrag Mijatovic, played against the Yugoslav in the
Champions League and kept him scoreless.
	   ``He is also a very good passer and he can always surprise with
a quick move,'' Woerns said of Mijatovic. ``You must watch him for
90 minutes.''
	   Mijatovic's only goal in the Champions League gave Real a 1-0
victory over Juventus Turin and the title.
	   The good news for Germany was that defensive midfielder Jens
Jeremies had resumed light training after straining his right ankle
ligaments against the United States.
	   Jeremies should have a key role in Germany's plan to disrupt
Yugoslavia's midfield game, although Vogts said Wednesday that he
was questionable for Sunday's match.
	   The last time Germany and Yugoslavia met at the World Cup was in
1990, in the opening group match when Germany posted a lopsided 4-1
victory and later went on to win the title.
	   Lothar Matthaeus, then German captain and now a veteran
substitute, scored twice. Other German players who played in that
match and are here again were Juergen Klinsmann, Thomas Haessler
and Stefan Reuter, while Andreas Moeller came on as a substitute.
Yugoslav captain Dragan Stojkovic is also still around.

Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Adams' first name, removes reference to
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Britain may no longer object to
Australia granting a visa to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, British
High Commissioner to Australia Alex Allan said Thursday.
	   Allan told the National Press Club in Canberra that times had
changed since Adams' last attempt to visit Australia, most
critically with the Irish Republican Army's July 1997 announcement
of a cease-fire.
	   Last year, Australia turned down Adams' visa application because
of his links to the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Adams is
appealing the decision.
	   ``Circumstances change, and the time when (Adams) was refused a
visa ... was a time when the IRA conducted a bombing campaign in
Northern Ireland, in Britain, in Europe,'' Allan said.
	   ``Now ... the IRA has a cease-fire. I imagine (the visa) is
something the Australian government would want to consider as and
when a new application is made.''

EDs: UPDATES with details of pilot's discussion with tower, info on
<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ A small commuter plane billowing smoke
crash-landed at Mirabel airport Thursday morning, killing all 12 on
board, Canadian police said.
	   The plane was based at nearby Dorval airport and had been headed
to Ontario, police said. The specific destination was not
immediately known. The plane was rerouted because of the smoke.
	   ``Once in the air the pilot, in discussion with the tower,
advised them there was some smoke in the cockpit,'' police Cpl.
Pierre Giguere said. ``At that time, the plane was redirected to
Mirabel, where it crashed.''
	   The 10 passengers and two crew members onboard were killed,
Giguere said.
	   ``From the information received, there are no survivors,'' he
said.
	   Police Sgt. Marcel Parent told the Canadian Broadcasting Company
that the weather did not appear to be a factor. It was cloudy, but
not raining Thursday morning at the airport.
	   ``We were told there was a technical problem,'' said Parent.
	   The King Air twin-engine commuter plane was owned by Prop Air, a
company based in Rouyn-Noranda in western Quebec, reports said.
	   Two hours after the crash smoke still could be seen billowing
from the aircraft at the end of one of Mirabel's runways, and
emergency vehicles surrounded the wreck.
	   Mirabel airport lies about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of
Montreal.

Bosnian conflict should be lesson to Kosovo, Plavsic warns 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING to correct Plavsic spelling throughout
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The Bosnian Serb president warned Thursday
that the bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia should serve as a
lesson to Kosovo that prevention is better than cure in the
volatile Balkans.
	   ``The flames of war in Bosnia have just been extinguished. But
everyone is truly worried by the appearance of a possible crisis in
Kosovo,'' said Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic during a
visit to Athens.
	   ``Anything can be achieved during the stages of discussion. But
... war is very easy to begin and very difficult to put an end
to,'' she stressed.
	   Tension has been steadily mounting in the southern Serbian
province of Kosovo between Serbs and ethnic Albanians, who make up
about 90 percent of the local population.
	   A Serb campaign has driven some 60,000 people from their homes
in the area since March. More than 300 people have died in clashes
between Serbs and ethnic Albanian militants.
	   ``No one has the right to experiment so much with the peoples
who live in this area,'' Plavsic said without elaborating.
	   ``Whatever has happened and is happening in the Balkans can be a
lesson that preventative measures are the main factor for the
achievement of stability and peaceful development in the area,''
she said.
	   The potential for an escalation of tension in Kosovo has sparked
concern that the conflict could spill over into neighboring
countries and trigger a wider Balkan war.
	   ``We must implement all past experiences to avoid the rekindling
of a possible conflict in Kosovo,'' Plavsic said. ``We believe
there are enough logical politicians who will make preventative
efforts so that we don't reach that situation.''

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Italian media tycoon Vittorio
Cecchi Gori, producer of the Cannes hit ``La Vita e Bella,'' won an
international film convention's most prestigious award Thursday.
	   In a gala evening ceremony, Cecchi Gori was being honored with
the lifetime achievement award of Cinema Expo International at its
annual convention in Amsterdam.
	   Cecchi Gori, who has extensive media holdings and film
production and distribution facilities across Europe, is the son of
Italian producer Mario Cecchi Gori. His Cannes entry, ``La Vita e
Bella'' (Life is Beautiful), was screened at the Dutch exposition.
	   ``We are honored to pay tribute to his outstanding career,''
said Jimmy Sunshine, the convention's co-director.
	   The film, directed by and starring Roberto Benigni, is about a
father who uses desperate and hilarious means to shield his son
from the horrors of a Nazi death camp. It won the runner-up Grand
Prize at Cannes.
	   Los Angeles-based Cecchi Gori Pictures produced ``A Bronx
Tale,'' Robert De Niro's directorial debut.
	   Past recipients of the expo's lifetime achievement award are
Lord Richard Attenborough, Nicolas Seydoux, Steven Spielberg, Bernd
Eichinger and the late Francois Truffaut.

World Cup: Matthaeus still hopes to get that record match With Sports-Soccer-Germany 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Lothar Matthaeus still hopes to get that
record _ his 22nd World Cup match.
	   That would make Matthaeus the player with most World Cup matches
ever. Right now, the 37-year-old German veteran, who is in his
fifth World Cup, shares that honor with three others _ Uwe Seeler
of Germany, Wladyslaw Zmuda of Poland and Diego Maradona of
Argentina. All four have played 21 World Cup matches.
	   But to set the record, Matthaeus must play. Captain of Germany's
1990 victorious team, Matthaeus was a late addition to Germany's
current roster and has to reconcile himself with sitting on the
bench.
	   ``My personal goal naturally is to play at this World Cup,''
Matthaeus said in an interview published Thursday with the German
soccer magazine Kicker.
	   ``The coach surely didn't bring me here to carry suitcases. He
has confidence in me. And the fans also have confidence in me,''
Matthaeus said.
	   Germans fans shouted Matthaeus' name during Germany's 2-0
victory over the United States in its opener.
	   ``I don't want to disappoint this confidence. If I get to play,
I will do everything to reconcile my personal goal with the common
goal of the team,'' Matthaeus said.
	   Matthaeus seems unlikely to win the job of libero from the
reliable Olaf Thon. But the German media had been speculating that
Matthaeus may be brought into defensive midfield Sunday against
Yugoslavia in Lens.
	   When Germany opened its 1990 campaign against Yugoslavia,
Matthaeus scored twice in a 4-1 victory that launched Germany
toward the title.
	   ``We can of course play a different game tactically against
Yugoslavia than we did against the United States. And the starting
lineup could look differently. Of course, it could still be without
Matthaeus,'' he said.
	   The Germans began the game against the United States with two
offensive midfielders, winning 2-0. But against Yugoslavia's
dangerous forwards, coach Berti Vogts looks likely to use more
defensive midfielders and leave Andy Moeller as the only offensive
midfielder.

Eds: UPDATES thruout with source saying Selig will take
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Acting American baseball commissioner Bud Selig has
decided to accept the job on a permanent basis and intends to call
an owners' meeting in the next few weeks for a formal vote, a
baseball source said Thursday.
	   Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, made the decision after a
group of team owners approached him during last week's meetings in
Seattle, according to a member of the ruling executive council who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   ``It's just a matter now of the timing,'' the council member
said.
	   Selig, 63, has been interim commissioner for six years.
	   The council member said that while Selig decided to accept the
job after a group of owners approached him, it had been evident for
some time that he would eventually accept the position on a
permanent basis.
	   The New York Times, quoting unidentified sources, reported
Thursday that Selig would take the commissioner's job on a
permanent basis. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, however, reported
that Selig had not agreed to do so despite pressure by other
owners.
	   The Times said the announcement could be made by the All-Star
Game, scheduled July 7. One owner, the newspaper said, predicted
the announcement would be made in two to four weeks.
	   Election requires a 75 percent vote of baseball's 30 owners and,
according to the Times, Selig has the backing. Only a few owners
oppose Selig, notably Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox and
The Tribune Co., owner of the Chicago Cubs.
	   Rich Levin, a spokesman for baseball, told USA Today that Selig
``has accepted nothing. There are no meetings scheduled.''
	   Baseball has been without a commissioner since Fay Vincent was
forced out of office by the owners on Sept. 7, 1992. Selig was
named chairman of the executive council two days later.
	   The Times said Selig would likely put his share of the Brewers
into a trust. Selig's daughter runs the day-to-day operation of the
club.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Turkish and Romanian prime
ministers agreed Thursday that trade between the two countries
should increase to dlrs 1 billion a year.
	   The two-day official visit by Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz is the
first by a Turkish premier to Romania in 12 years, Yilmaz said
after meeting with counterpart Radu Vasile.
	   Both sides voiced willingness to improve collaboration in
energy, transportation and oil, especially in the pipeline that
will take gasoline from the Caspian Sea through the Black Sea to
Western Europe.
	   Vasile and Yilmaz promised to visit each other's country twice a
year, ``or even more often if necessary,'' said Yilmaz.
	   Yilmaz was to meet Friday with President Emil Constantinescu.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union accorded
humanitarian aid worth 1.5 million European currency units (dlrs
1.65 million) Thursday for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
Jordan.
	   The EU is giving 1 million ecu (dlrs 1.1 million) to the West
Bank and Gaza for medical programs already underway, including a
vaccination campaign and training of local staff, a statement by
the EU Commission said.
	   In Jordan, 500,000 ecu (dlrs 550,000) will help provide food and
medical supplies to the population.
	   ``Jordan's resources as host for Palestinian refugees are
stretched to the limit, and the local population is also in need of
humanitarian assistance,'' the statement said.
	   In both cases, the aid will be channeled through humanitarian
organizations for projects over the next four to six months.

	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Loyalist forces in Guinea-Bissau launched a
heavy weapons attack in the nearly deserted capital Thursday as
peace talks between rebels and a Gambian mediator trying to end the
12-day rebellion were reportedly called off.
	   Artillery fire also could be heard reverberating across rural
parts of the former Portugese colony on Africa's western tip from
across the border in Senegal, which has sent troops to fight
alongside the Guinea-Bissau government forces.
	   Portugese TV station S.I.C reported from Bissau that government
forces began shelling rebel positions in the city after a lull in
the fighting just as mediation talks between rebel leader Ansumane
Mane and Gambian Foreign Minister Mohamed Sedat Jobe were due to
begin at 9:30 a.m. (0930 GMT) Thursday.
	   The talks were called off because of the fighting and it was not
immediately clear if they would be rescheduled.
	   The Gambian mediator met with government officials Wednesday who
said they were ready to enter into talks if the rebels laid down
their weapons.
	   But in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro
published Thursday, President Joao Bernardo Vieira said he would
never agree to a proposal to meet the mutineers on a French ship
anchored off Bissau. The president vowed to crush the renegades.
	   ``If I'll negotiate with the mutineers on the French ship?
Never!'' the president was quoted as saying.
	   Vieira said the rebels were losing ground and repeated loyalists
boasts of having captured a military garrison where the rebellion
began on June 7. The renegade soldiers have not directly responded
to the claim, but have demanded all peace discussion occur at the
garrison.
	   He refused to predict when the conflict would end.
	   ``You know, war is war. You can't fix a date,'' Vieira
reportedly said.
	   The renegade soldiers have accused Vieira of corruption and
demanded he step down.
	   Government soldiers, backed by troops from Senegal and the
Republic of Guinea, have pinned down the rebels in areas around the
garrison, including the international airport, the loyalists said.
	   Michael Kleiner, spokesman for the International Committee of
the Red Cross, said in Geneva that four large explosions were heard
from the direction of the airport Thursday morning.
	   Yet fighting seemed to have escalated in the countryside
Wednesday night and Thursday morning, when the constant thud and
crash of heavy artillery fire could be heard in rural Guinea-Bissau
from across the border in Senegal.
	   A Senegalese commander said his forces were rushing heavy
weapons to the capital to reinforce loyalists who had reportedly
pinned down rebels around Bissau's sprawling military garrison
complex, where the mutiny began.
	   In the capital, Guinea-Bissau government troops were bombarding
what they called final pockets of resistance.
	   ``The government operation is now focused on the airport where
the rebels are concentrated,'' Guinea-Bissau's Foreign Minister
Fernando Delfim da Silva told The Associated Press in Lisbon, where
he was stuck due to flight cancellations.
	   The rebels, who seized heavy weapons from the garrison's
arsenal, were dug into positions on high ground around the airport
about 10 kilometers (6 miles) out of the city, Delfim da Silva
said.
	   Fighting has escalated to include forces from two West African
neighbors, including Senegalese rebels apparently linked to the
Guinea-Bissau renegade soldiers.

Off-field dramas overshadow soccer rescinding of alcohol ban, another arrest AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with further security measures in Marseille,
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Somehow the soccer seems just a sideshow.
	   The World Cup rumbles on with so much going on off the field _
ticket fraud arrests, violent fans in court, the threat of
political demonstrations, quarrels between players and one even
kicked off his squad.
	   Oh, and Austria tied 1-1 with Chile and Italy downed Cameroon
3-0 Wednesday.
	   With his team almost certainly tumbling out of the World Cup,
Austrian substitute Ivica Vastic fired an injury-time goal against
Chile after Marcelo Salas got his third of the championship.
	   Christian Vieri tied Salas atop the scorers list with two late
strikes after Luigi Di Biagio headed in the first goal as the
Italians went to the top of Group B, where the other three games
have been draws. They also welcomed back Alessandro Del Piero after
a month-long absence for a thigh injury.
	   ``Everything went well, and we showed we have top strikers,''
Italian coach Cesare Maldini said. ``It was a win for the whole
team.''
	   Games on Thursday feature host France against Saudi Arabia at
Saint-Denis and Denmark against South Africa in Toulouse.
	   Before Wednesday's games kicked off, police sources announced
the first arrests in an international scandal that left thousands
of fans without paid-for World Cup tickets.
	   French authorities arrested three people, including a consultant
for a subsidiary of FIFA's exclusive marketing partner, ISL. A
large amount of cash and about 100 Cup tickets were found and more
arrests were expected.
	   The fallout continued from the fan violence involving England
and Tunisian fans in Marseille three days ago.
	   More than 100 people remained jailed, some having received
sentences of at least two months and others kept behind bars until
the World Cup ends July 12. Another English fan was detained in
Montpellier.
	   In Marseille, authorities planned increased security for
Saturday's match between the Netherlands and South Korea. Some
2,000 regular police will be on weekend duty, along with some 200
Anti-Criminal Brigade forces patrolling the city center. Riot
police also will be posted about town.
	   But under pressure from cafe owners, authorities relented today
on a weekend alcohol ban in Marseille and agreed to allow drinks to
be sold until midnight.

World Cup: Yugoslav coaches plan strategy against Germany 
</HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-GALMIER, France (AP) _ Yugoslav coaches have prepared a
perfect game plan against Germany: tight defense, creative midfield
and fast counterattacks. Will it work? Some Yugoslav players are
skeptical.
	   ``Oh those Germans. Even when they are outplayed, they somehow
manage to win,'' said Yugoslav team captain Dragan Stojkovic.
	   Germany and Yugoslavia, the favorites in Group F with three
points each, will play next Sunday in Lens. The other teams in the
group, the United States and Iran with no points so far, will face
each other the same day in Lyon.
	   Yugoslavia has a history of losses against Germany at big soccer
championships. Germany leads Yugoslavia 14-7, with 3 ties (goal
difference 44-29) in their overall record. The last time Yugoslavia
beat Germany at the World Cup was in 1962 in Chile, 1-0.
	   But this time, the star-studded Yugoslav team is bent on bending
history in its favor.
	   ``We have to tighten our defense, move it upfield further away
from our goal,'' said Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac. ``In the
midfield, we have to be creative and wage an uncompromising battle
for every ball.''
	   ``And then, launch counterattacks. That's the winning formula
against the Germans,'' said Santrac, who has closed down all
training practices before Sunday's match.
	   And what about the striking German duo of Oliver Bierhoff and
Jurgen Klinsmann who gave the United States so much trouble last
Monday when Germany won 2-0?
	   ``They have to be watched very closely,'' said Yugoslav defender
Goran Djorovic who will probably guard Klinsmann next Sunday. ``And
they have to be outjumped, which will be very difficult.''
	   Yugoslavia pins its hope on star striker Predrag Mijatovic who
had a poor game in Yugoslavia's lackluster 1-0 win against Iran
last Sunday.
	   ``Yes, I didn't play too well,'' said Mijatovic of Real Madrid.
``But we can't play so badly twice in a row. We always play better
when we face strong opponents, and Germany is terribly strong.''
	   Mijatovic, who is often compared to Brazilian star Ronaldo, has
previously said that he doesn't fear the Germans as ``they are
aging and on the decline.''
	   But after watching them play the U.S., he seemed to have changed
his mind.
	   ``We can't count on their age. They may be one of the oldest
teams at the World Cup, but they also have the greatest experience
which works in their favor,'' Mijatovic said.
	   Santrac said that his star midfielder Dejan Savicevic _ who has
missed the Iran match because of a knee injury _ will not be ready
for the German game. His place will likely be taken by rising star
Dejan Stankovic, 19, who said he doesn't fear ``the mighty
Germans.''

Albright overture `inadequate,' says Iranian radio With US-Iran 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran on Thursday rejected as ``inadequate''
a U.S. offer for starting a new relationship to end nearly two
decades of mutual hostility.
	   Instead of words, the United States should offer actions, the
state-run Iran radio said in a commentary in response to U.S.
Secretary of States Madeleine Albright's statement on Wednesday.
	   In order to restore relations, the United States must first
``renounce violence against Iran'' by ending its support for an
Iranian opposition guerrilla group based in Iraq, free frozen
Iranian assets and ``apologize to the Iranian nation for its wrong
policies in the past 50 years,'' the radio commentary said.
	   In a speech to The Asia Society in New York, Albright said the
United States is ``ready to explore further ways to build mutual
confidence'' and called on Iran to ``consider parallel steps.''
	   But Iran radio said ``Washington's mere announcement that it is
prepared to establish ties with Iran is inadequate, for Washington
(must) show goodwill as well.''
	   Despite U.S. overtures in the past year, ``there has emerged no
shift in U.S. policy towards Iran,'' it said.
	   The radio said the U.S. decision to lift sanctions on European
companies doing business with Iran was not a positive development
since it was simply a U.S.-EU issue.
	   It added that the United States had sustained ``substantial
losses'' as a result of severing ties with Iran.
	   In her speech, Albright praised Iran for trying to bring peace
to Afghanistan and for improving relations with Saudi Arabia. She
also lauded Iran's decision to accept any agreement Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat works out with Israel.
	   But Albright tempered her praise by calling on Iran to end its
support for terrorism and to improve its human rights record. She
also repeated a longstanding U.S. complaint that Iran is still
trying to acquire nuclear weapons and develop long-range missiles.
	   A thaw in relations between the two countries became a
possibility after Iran's new President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate
cleric in the ruling clergy, proposed cultural exchanges as a way
to start a new friendship.
	   The United States severed ties with Iran after militants stormed
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran at the start of the 1979 Islamic
revolution and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. The
hard-line clergy that took power in the revolution brands the
United States a ``Great Satan'' although that rhetoric has been
subdued since Khatami took office in August 1997.

Space experts work to get ``spy mailbox'' satellites working 
</HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian space experts struggled Thursday to get
six ``spy mailbox'' satellites to relay secret messages to and from
intelligence agents after an abortive launch put them into the
wrong orbit.
	   The satellites are in working condition but can not be used in
their current positions, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Vladimir
Utkin, the head of a government commission supposed to give advice
how to fix them.
	   The six satellites were launched atop a Tsiklon-3 booster rocket
early Tuesday from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northwestern Russia.
Russian media said they were designed for the Main Intelligence
Department of the Russian Defense Ministry (GRU).
	   Due to a failure in a booster's engine or bad fuel, the
satellites have failed to enter the designated orbit, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Instead of going into a round orbit 1,400 kilometers (900 miles)
above the Earth, the satellites went into an elliptical one,
passing 1,310 kilometers (812 miles) above the Earth at the lowest
point, and 1,889 kilometers (1171 miles) at the highest point.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev expressed confidence Wednesday
that a solution will be found, but acknowledged that Russia's
military space forces are ``in a tense state,'' according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The satellites, which the military earlier described generically
as the Kosmos variety, were actually Strela-3s _ also known as
``space mailboxes for Russian spies,'' the Russky Telegraf
newspaper said.
	   Strela-3 satellites are used to record radio messages
transmitted by Russian intelligence agents throughout the world,
and relay them to intelligence headquarters in Moscow. They can
also receive messages from Moscow for spies abroad.
	   The military said on Wednesday they still intend to use the
satellites, but will have to adjust some settings. However, Utkin's
panel has yet to find a way how to do that, the ITAR-Tass said. One
possible solution is to try boost the signal from satellites, it
said.
	   Utkin said his commission would release its verdict within 10
days.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels killed 80 students and abducted
more than 100 others at a technical school in western Uganda, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces raided Kichwamba
Technical Institute near Kabarole, about 320 kilometers (200 miles)
west of Kampala, on June 8, the state-owned New Vision newspaper
reported.
	   The rebels set three dormitories on fire when students refused
to come out and join the insurgency, the newspaper said.
	   Abel Rwendeire, a minister of state for higher education, said
283 students who survived the massacre will be transferred to other
institutions in the East African nation, the newspaper said.
	   The ADF rebels operate from bases on the slopes of the Rwenzori
mountains. They seek President Yoweri Museveni's ouster but have no
know political program.
	   The government is also fighting the Lord's Resistance Army,
another, better equipped, insurgency in the north.
	   New Vision said a parliamentary committee on defense and
internal affairs is threatening to block this year's defense
appropriations unless the army can satisfactorily explain why it is
unable to end insecurity.
	   The government seeks to increase defense spending from 132
billion shillings (drls 13 million) last year to 163 billion
shillings (dlrs 163 million) in the 1998-99 financial year.

	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ A group of women lawyers
and judges has accused the government in the Central African
Republic of stalling preparations for legislative elections
expected later this year.
	   In a statement, the Female Jurists Organization of the Central
African Republic said President Ange-Felix Patasse's government had
failed to convince opposition groups to set up a national electoral
commission or establish laws on the number of seats in the
forthcoming Parliament.
	   Twelve opposition parties have so far boycotted the election
plans, accusing Patasse of trying to manipulate the process.
	   The jurists' group also called on the international community to
step in and help the country ``avoid a new wave of political
troubles.''
	   The Central African Republic has been plagued by several army
insurrections and attempted coups in recent years and rural parts
of the country are largely controled by groups of bandits and
foreign rebels.
	   In most cases, French troops based in the country have helped
quell the uprisings. The French recently pulled their troops out of
the country as part of sweeping overseas military cutbacks. In
their place, a new 1,400-strong U.N. force has been set up in the
capital of Bangui.
	   Patasse was elected in 1993, ending more than a decade of army
rule in the country.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Scientists working on a secret
chemical and
	   biological warfare program dumped stockpiles of illegal drugs
into the sea, a panel probing apartheid-era human rights abuses was
told on Thursday.
	   Testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,
former army surgeon-general Niel Knobel said twenty blue plastic
barrels of mandrax, ecstasy and a cocaine derivative were thrown
from an army plane off the coast near Cape Town in early 1993.
	   The drugs came from a project researching ways of putting them
in grenades for use in riot control. When the project was cancelled
the drugs needed to be destroyed, Knobel said.
	   The chemical and biological warfare program was run through a
network of military front companies headed by Dr. Wouter Basson. He
currently faces a range of charges from making drugs to conspiracy
to murder.
	   His lawyers are resisting him appearing before the commission,
fearing he may prejudice his trial, to start in August.
	   ------
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ The U.S. assistant secretary of
state for refugees and migration, Julia Taft, has urged Sierra
Leoneans to seek reconciliation between warring groups in the
strife-torn West African country.
	   ``One of the biggest challenges which Sierra Leone faces is how
to build a
	   sense of forgiveness and reconciliation,'' Taft told journalists
on Wednesday.
	   Taft, who was leading a three-day mission of U.S., British and
International Monetary Fund officials to Sierra Leone, earlier held
discussions with President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah about possible aid
packages to the country.
	   She suggested that large-scale aid may not be forthcoming until
the country forged peace with rebels who have committed massacres
in the country's rural north. The rebels were ousted from the
capital by a Nigerian-led West African intervention force in
February.

World Cup: Asprilla apologizes, asks to be taken back 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A teary eyed Faustino Asprilla apologized Thursday
for comments that led to his dismissal from Colombia's World Cup
team and asked for a second chance.
	   Head coach Hernan Dario Gomez said he's studying the situation,
but admitted he ``liked what Faustino had to say.''
	   Asprilla, a star forard, was dismissed Wednesday for publicly
criticizing Gomez. He left the team's hotel in Tour-du-Pin, south
of Paris, and was staying in the French capital with his agent.
	   ``I want to offer my apologies to the president (of the
Colombian Soccer Federation), his executive committee, the head
coach, my teammates, and, of course, the Colombian people,''
Asprilla said, reading a prepared statement.
	   ``If our head coach considers my being here important, I'm
willing to follow, enthusiastically and with discipline, all World
Cup rules, as I've always done,'' he said.
	   Gomez told Colombia's Radio Caracol he was not ruling out
readmitting Asprilla and that he'll study the striker's apology.
	   ``But I don't know what the decision will be,'' he said. ``The
truth is, those are nice words by Faustino.''
	   Asprilla was sent packing for the rest of the tournament after
publicly criticizing Gomez. He claimed Gomez had a group of
``preferred'' players and that the coach had ``disrespected'' him
when he took him out of the Colombia's 1-0 loss to Romania on
Monday with five minutes remaining.
	   ``He took himself out of the team with his behavior,'' Gomez
said in explaining Wednesday why he had dismissed the player.
	   Asprilla's departure was supported by Alvaro Fina, Colombian
Football Federation president, who said that ``unfortunately, he
had to be removed from the team. There is a limit for everything,
and this time he went over the limit.''
	   The announcement of Asprila's banishment from the team caused
shock waves in Colombia, where President Ernesto Samper even tried
to persuade Gomez to reconsider his decision.
	   ``I personally talked to him. He stressed what 'Tino' represents
to the world, to the country, and to the hopes of Colombians to
advance to the second round,'' Fina said.
	   But neither Fina nor Gomez yielded.

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ A commuter plane making an emergency landing
because of an engine fire crashed at Mirabel airport Thursday,
killing all 11 onboard, airport authorities said.
	   The twin-engine plane was based at nearby Dorval airport and was
headed to Peterborough, Ontario, authorities said. The plane was
rerouted because of the fire.
	   ``Once in the air the pilot, in discussion with the tower,
advised them there was some smoke in the cockpit,'' police Cpl.
Pierre Giguere said. ``At that time, the plane was redirected to
Mirabel, where it crashed.''
	   The nine passengers and two crew members onboard were killed,
said Mirabel airport manager Ray Monette.
	   ``It was a very turbulent landing,'' Monette told the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. ``The fire on board just got worse. It just kept
on going badly''
	   The King Air twin-engine commuter plane was owned by Prop Air, a
company based in Rouyn-Noranda in western Quebec.
	   Two hours after the crash smoke still could be seen billowing
from the aircraft at the end of one of Mirabel's runways, and
emergency vehicles surrounded the wreck.
	   Mirabel airport lies about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of
Montreal.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dozens of prominent scientists joined striking
miners Thursday at a protest outside the Russian White House,
demanding the resignation of President Boris Yeltsin.
	   The scientists, some of whom had been marching to Moscow from
outlying towns since Monday, castigated the government for fiscal
mismanagement and accused it of destroying one of the world's
finest scientific establishments.
	   ``Without science, Russia will become a colony!'' boomed one
speaker, Alexander Bryuchanov, a union leader at the Kurchatov
Atomic Institute.
	   About 200 miners from four far-flung mining regions have been
camped outside the White House, the main government building, for
the past week, demanding back wages.
	   While most of the scientists at the demonstration said they were
still being paid, their pay is a pittance _ 480 rubles (dlrs 80) to
600 rubles (dlrs 100) a month _ and they complained that they no
longer have the equipment or other resources they need to carry out
their work.
	   The tenor of the protest was far different from many
demonstrations held in Moscow in the past couple of years, which
have tended to attract hard-core Communists, most of them elderly
and now on the political fringe.
	   The scientists and miners were mostly of working age, with
political views spanning the spectrum. They agreed only that the
Yeltsin government has failed them and must go.
	   Sergei Dembovsky, a physicist who heads a laboratory at the
Russian Academy of Science, clapped his arms around a fellow
scientist and a miner and hugged them toward him.
	   ``We are scientists and he is a miner, but we have the same
problem,'' Dembovsky said. ``We are tired of tyrannical demands and
don't believe our government, and demand the resignation of the
president.''
	   The miner, Viktor Fokin, nodded his agreement. ``We hate this
regime,'' he said. ``We will struggle until the end for this
government to be eliminated, to be crushed into powder.''
	   Fokin, who marched to Moscow from Vorkuta, about 1,900
kilometers (1,200 miles) to the northeast, said he hadn't been paid
in nine months.
	   Earlier in the day, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov met with
miners and asked them to support his party's drive for Yeltsin's
impeachment.
	   Also Thursday, oil workers in northern Russia, taking a cue from
miners, blocked a rail line used to transport oil to a refinery, a
news agency reported.
	   Workers have held frequent protests in recent years, but none
seemed as effective as that of miners who crippled the Russian
railroad system last month by blocking rails throughout the
country.
	   Millions of Russians routinely go without pay or pensions. The
recent tumble in financial markets _ sparked by the miners' strike
as well as global economic pressures _ has further weakened the
ability of both government and private industry to pay workers.

Ousted prime minister heads into elections stronger than expected

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ When Vaclav Klaus left office in
disgrace six months ago, he was written off as a political
has-been. But on the eve of Friday's parliamentary elections,
Czechs appear to be thinking again.
	   There is scant chance that Klaus _ who alongside President
Vaclav Havel led the country through post-1989 political and
economic reform _ will return to office.
	   But pre-election polls show his party has jumped to second place
and is expected to make a strong showing when 8.09 million eligible
voters cast ballots Friday and Saturday.
	   Roughly 15 percent said they would support Klaus' center-right
Civic Democratic Party, according to the most recent polls by a
government-funded agency. A margin of error was not given.
	   While the center-left Social Democrats still lead with slightly
more than 20 percent, Klaus' party has made an unexpected comeback
from their all-time low of 9.1 percent in February.
	   After Klaus left office, following a high-profile party
financing scandal, things fell apart. The government collapsed,
forcing Havel to form a pinch-hitter Cabinet to rule until
elections could be held, two years ahead of schedule.
	   The scandal also hurt Klaus' party. Nearly half of its deputies
deserted, many of them forming a rival party dubbed the Freedom
Union, which hit the political scene in February with 18 percent
popularity.
	   Now, the Freedom Union, which was formed as an alternative to
the personality-driven politics that has taken hold in the Czech
Republic, has plummeted to a mere seven percent support.
	   Some observers worry it won't even clear the five percent
threshold needed to gain representation in the 200-seat parliament,
thereby opening up more room for the extremist Republicans,
old-style Communists and an eclectic pensioners' party who do seem
likely to clear that barrier.
	   Despite the surge in support for Klaus' party, not everyone is
ready to welcome him back.
	   ``I respect Klaus as an expert but the way he chooses his
advisors is tragic,'' said student Petr Kostohryz, 25. ``He has
surrounded himself with people suspect of criminal acts and he's
loyal to them.''
	   Neither Klaus' party, nor the Social Democrats of his bitter
rival Milos Zeman are expected to get a clear majority. That means
difficult coalition negotiations. Analysts fear the Czech crown
could take a dive, dragging down the economy.
	   And that uncertainty is apparently what has made some Czechs
think again. Klaus, after all, master-minded the reforms that made
the Czech Republic the darling of foreign investors and the model
post-communist economy in the early 90s.
	   ``For me, Klaus is a guarantee of economic transformation,''
said Michal Bares, another 25-year-old student.
	   Jaromir Volek, a sociologist at the Masaryk University in Brno,
says Klaus' authority is growing over the media-fueled scandals.
	   ``People have already half-forgotten the scandals and affairs in
which Klaus played the main role and which led to his downfall,''
Volek told the Mlada Fronta daily.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Adel Osseiran, a leader of Lebanon's
independence campaign from the French, died Thursday of old age at
the age of 94, his family said.
	   Osseiran was among a group of Lebanese Christian and Muslim
politicians rounded up by French forces during the 1943 agitation
for independence from France.
	   They were later released. But the accompanying troubles prompted
France to grant Lebanon its independence that year. Osseiran went
on to become one of Lebanon's prominent politicians over the next
five decades.
	   Osseiran, member of a prominent Shiite family in the south,
earned his political sciences degree from the American University
of Beirut in 1935. He was first elected to Parliament in 1943 as a
deputy for southern Lebanon.
	   He served as Parliament speaker between 1953 and 1957. He also
held Cabinet portfolios for defense, interior, justice, public
works, economy and education during his career.
	   He was among the voices of moderation during the 1975-90 civil
war, preaching coexistence among the country's various sects.
	   Osseiran is survived by his son, Ali, a current legislator, and
five daughters.
	   He will be buried Friday in his hometown of Sidon, provincial
capital of southern Lebanon.

Officials fired as train strike enters second day striking engineers, rail link with Ukraine cut, negotiations opened 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with 50 percent of trains idled, RAISES number of
By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Acting swiftly to end a two-day-old strike
that has idled more than half of the nation's trains, Polish
railway authorities fired eight rail officials Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek has declared the strike illegal
because striking train drivers did not follow correct negotiating
procedures before walking off the job at midnight Tuesday. He has
threatened ``tough consequences'' for the strikers.
	   The state-run railway's director, Jan Janik, declined to say
whether it would also fire striking train drivers.
	   The government has estimated that 4,600 engineers have stopped
work, idling half of the nation's passenger trains and two-thirds
of the cargo trains. Talks aimed at ending the strike opened in the
afternoon.
	   The strike was called by the leftist Trade Union of Train
Engineers, representing 14,000 of the railway's 22,000 rail
engineers, to press demands for pay raises and early retirement
plans.
	   The right-wing Solidarity trade union, representing the second
largest bloc of train engineers, has not joined the strike, and has
called it politically motivated.
	   Labor and political issues remain tightly entwined in Poland,
where the Solidarity trade union helped bring down communist rule
with strikes and other acts of opposition in the 1980s. Solidarity
lives on as both a trade union, and also as a political movement
that now controls parliament.
	   Solidarity politicians and labor officials alike have suggested
that the strike is motivated not purely out of labor concerns, but
also in an attempt by the left to destabilize the Solidarity-led
government.
	   Strike organizer Jan Zaborowski, a former leftist lawmaker,
angrily denied the allegations, and called the strike when a
government official refused to apologize for saying the action was
politically motivated.
	   The strikers are demanding a 300-zloty (dlr-88) increase in the
current average monthly pay of 1,600 zlotys (dlrs 470) and the
right for workers with 20 years of service to retire at age 55.
	   Local trains have been hardest hit by the strike, particularly
in the region around the Baltic port city of Gdansk, the birthplace
of the Solidarity trade union, where trains are the primary means
of transport.
	   Non-striking engineers and buses have been mobilized to minimize
disruptions, and most international and long-distance trains were
running with delays. However, all trains to neighboring Ukraine
were out of service.
	   Railway officials estimated the losses so far at 7 million
zlotys (dlrs 2 million). The Polish rail carries 1.1 million
passengers and some 600,000 tons of goods daily.

China warns of plague, epidemics following floods 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China warned Thursday of the threat of plague,
malaria and serious epidemics following the earlier than usual
onset of the nation's deadly summer flood season.
	   ``If forceful preventive measures are not taken, the
consequences will be extremely serious,'' the state-run Xinhua News
Agency said in a report on a national conference on epidemic
prevention.
	   The early onset of severe floods that already have claimed some
350 lives means that ``the appearance of quite big epidemics is
very likely,'' Xinhua said.
	   There already has been an increase in intestinal illnesses, it
said. Outbreaks of plague, malaria and other illnesses spread by
rats or insects also could follow the flooding, it warned.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Starting Friday, Italian phone numbers will be a
little longer.
	   Italy's phone company, Telecom Italia, is requiring area codes
even for local calls. The longer numbers will allow for more lines
and enable Telecom to conform to new EU rules deregulizing the
phone market, the company said.
	   For example, to make a call within Rome, you now need to dial
06, the city's area code, before the number. To call the Italian
capital from abroad you need to dial the country code, 39, as
before, then 06.
	   If you forget the new codes, you'll still get through, but only
until Dec. 31, 1998, when Telecom makes the changes final.

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Hunters in southeastern Finland felled
a female bear Thursday which mauled a jogger to death the night
before near the Russian border, police said.
	   The victim, Kari Juhani Pulkkinen, came across the irate bear
while running on Wednesday night in a forest near his home at
Ruokolahti, 275 kilometers (170 miles) east of Helsinki.
	   Pulkkinen, 42, a frontier guard officer, told his wife he would
be back by 10 p.m. (1900GMT). She sounded the alarm when he failed
to return before midnight. His body was found at 4:30 a.m.
(0130GMT) Thursday by police.
	   Twenty-seven hunters with dogs helped officers track down the
brown bear and its cub. They shot and killed both on Thursday
afternoon, about one kilometer (half a mile) from where Pulkkinen's
body was found.
	   The bear had also attacked police officers who were searching
for the missing jogger in the early hours of the morning, but they
managed to escape.
	   It was the first recorded case of a bear killing a person in
Finland this century, officials said.
	   ``Once in a while, a bear _ especially a female with cubs _ will
attack,'' said Ilpo Kojola from the Finnish Game and Fisheries
Research Institute. ``But they usually leave after a bit. Killer
bears are very rare in Finland, indeed in Europe.''
	   There are an estimated 700 brown bears in Finland. Game
officials grant about 70 permits a year to shoot bears.

Tennis players 85 and over having a ball

<TEXT>
	   PORTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ Gripping an imaginary cane, the
tanned tennis player hunched over at courtside and tottered slowly
forward _ a convincing impersonation of an old man.
	   Then 90-year-old Emil Johnson chuckled, straightened and resumed
a relaxed athletic pose, thrusting his hands in the pockets of a
black USA Team warmup suit.
	   ``I'm not old yet,'' he declared matter-of-factly.
	   Soon afterward he did his best to prove it, routing in straight
sets a German ``whippersnapper'' a few years his junior in the
first international tennis tournament for men 85 and over.
	   Forget the World Cup. For sheer inspiration, it may have been
held to a draw last weekend by the obscure Billy Talbert Cup in
this pristine Austrian lake resort.
	   Old enough to be Titanic survivors, possessing a combined
medical history longer than the Wimbledon starters' list, these
competitors showed they also are young enough to hit overhead
smashes in your face. With polite apologies, of course.
	   And who couldn't like a team featuring an 87-year-old named
Bubba who water-skis in his spare time and can still jump the net?
	   Thirteen accomplished U.S. senior male players were drawn to
Austria for this unusual event for ``really old people,'' as one
player quipped, their expenses partly defrayed by American
billionaire Kirk Kerkorian. They played alongside U.S. women
competing in the first-ever international team competition for
75-and-over women.
	   Playing singles and doubles for two days last week against a
team of contemporaries from Europe, the American men won 17-3 and
the women lost 10-5.
	   But this was more a celebration for the ageless _ an exclamation
point to the trend of people living longer, staying healthy longer,
serving aces longer.
	   ``It's fabulous,'' said Mark Winters, 49, a California-based
tennis writer and former touring pro who came to Portschach to
watch the elders-only competition.
	   ``Most people at 85 are worried about walking, not hitting a
backhand,'' he said. ``But with these guys, it's tennis, tennis,
tennis. They sit down to eat and they're still talking about their
rackets and, `Did you see that score?'''
	   They've had hip, knee and artery replacements, angioplasties,
coronary bypasses, broken bones and bowel problems. Their teeth are
newer than their equipment in some cases, and many are hard of
hearing _ ``Did you say that was out?''
	   But a few minutes of watching them in action is enough to dispel
any notion that the octogenarians' competitive instincts might have
disappeared with the wooden racket.
	   ``It's a drive like sex or hunger _ you don't lose it,'' said
86-year-old Bill Wendt of Chicago.
	   Take Herman ``Bubba'' Ratcliffe. A former Georgia paper mill
manager with 19 national age-group titles to his credit, he wears a
hearing aid and weighs 135 pounds (61 kilos). But you don't mess
with Bubba.
	   Angered by his Romanian opponent's call in this umpire-less
competition, he raced across the clay court and wagged a finger in
his face: ``I get another serve!'' He won his way, if not the
match.
	   ``Oh yeah, I don't just want to win, I want to tear somebody up
if I can,'' he deadpanned afterward. ``I don't mean I'd hurt 'em,
of course.''
	   Another match, involving U.S. team captain Bill Lurie and a
German opponent, also erupted in finger-pointing and bilingual
bickering. But no racket-throwing here _ these seniors wisely took
a 15-minute break to cool off.
	   ``I'm just happy that at 85 I'm healthy and can play competitive
tennis,'' said Lurie, a Californian like many of his teammates.
	   Like the reinvigorated oldsters who tapped an otherworldly
source in the 1985 movie ``Cocoon,'' these energetic seniors seem
to have discovered a fountain of youth. Their more mundane energy
source: age-group tennis.
	   Rankings and tournaments for 55-and-overs began in the 1970s.
Categories for 85-year-old men and 75-year-old women began in the
1990s, with a series of national competitions.
	   Now there's a push to sanction a 90-and-over category, and who's
to say there won't be rankings for centenarians someday?
	   Few young players have a passion for tennis to match that of
old-timers like 86-year-old Andre Tiberius De Grad of Romania, Ilie
Nastase's former coach.
	   After winning his singles match, he proudly showed a visitor a
picture of him with all-time tennis great Bill Tilden, and a gray,
misshapen ball that Tilden autographed after playing him in 1931.
	   ``I had to travel 24 hours to get here, but it was worth it,''
said De Grad, a 12-time European champion.
	   Johnson, the U.S. team's senior senior, was city champion of
Lexington, Kentucky, in 1934. But he has really hit his stride in
retirement, winning 200-300 trophies in his age group and still
racking them up at 90.
	   ``All that tennis keeps us alive, keeps us going,'' said the
retired Army major. ``You don't age as fast.''
	   He still remembers the young doctor who once told him he
shouldn't be playing tennis competitively, because, ``They don't
race broken-down horses.''
	   That was nearly a half-century ago.
	   ``I wouldn't be a bit surprised if he's dead now,'' Johnson
said, unable to suppress a smile.

Report: secret phone number led to unfair ticket sales 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quote from ISL France director; edits; trims.
By MARILYN AUGUST
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's World Cup central organizing committee on
Thursday asked France Telecom to launch an investigation into
reports that a confidential phone number allowed thousands to
unfairly buy huge numbers of tickets.
	   The daily Le Parisien reported that a special phone number gave
privileged callers direct access to the central switchboard
handling ticket sales from April 22 through May 8.
	   About 170,000 tickets were sold on a first-come, first-served
basis. But the switchboard was so swamped, most callers had to dial
more than 500 times before getting through.
	   According to Le Parisien, the secret number _ leaked from within
France Telecom, the main telephone company _ allowed callers in the
know to get through immediately.
	   France's organizing committee did not directly deny the report.
	   At a briefing, it said a ``technical'' phone number existed in
addition to the main switchboard number _ but that the number
didn't correspond to the one published by the newspaper.
	   Bruno Travade, communications director for the CFO, France's
central organizing committee, said the CFO has asked France Telecom
to investigate, and would file legal charges if necessary.
	   The paper cited a person identified only as Frederic, a
communications student, who used the number to snap up more than
400 tickets.
	   The revelations came a day after three people, including the
director general and a consultant for ISL France, a subsidiary of
the World Cup's marketing agency, ISL Worldwide, were arrested in
an investigation into ticket fraud. The third person was cleared.
	   The arrests were a response to the 12,000 Japanese fans who were
left ticketless for the World Cup.
	   ISL Worldwide said it was conducting an audit of the French
company's books.
	   Didier Porter, ISL France president, told France Info radio
Thursday the company was being victimized and would file a slander
suit if the allegations in the media continued.
	   ``People are looking for a guilty party, and ISL makes a
marvelous one,'' he said. ``The company never cashed in on a single
ticket.''
	   It was the latest scandal to hit France's controversial sale of
World Cup tickets.
	   Critics have said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.7 million tickets
printed, almost 1.5 million were earmarked for interests in the
host country.

Opposition group claims Tehran trying to ban refugees from games 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The leading Iranian exiled opposition group claimed
Thursday that a Tehran intelligence official has come to France
bearing files of opponents so they can be arrested as hooligans
during World Cup matches.
	   At a news conference, the Mujahedeen Khalq claimed that Tehran
authorities were ``sparing no effort'' to keep Iranians from
attending matches.
	   Sunday's upcoming match in Lyon between Iran and the United
States is the most politically charged match of the month-long
World Cup, which ends July 12.
	   On Wednesday, there were brief fears Iran would pull out of the
soccer championships, angered by the showing of the film ``Not
Without My Daughter'' on French television. The American movie
portrays Iranians as boorish and obsessed with Islamic religious
customs.
	   Spokesman Behzad Naziri repeated claims that Iranian authorities
had charged an Iranian security corps and ``foreign mercenaries,
notably among Arabs and Turks, to create, if necessary, clashes
during the matches with refugees and Iranian opponents.''
	   Naziri alleged such a tactic had been used in Sunday's
Iran-Yugoslavia match, which it lost 1-0. He claimed that Arabs
from the St. Etienne region had been given free tickets by Iranians
working for the government.
	   The Iranian Embassy would not immediately respond to the
allegations.
	   According to Naziri, a deputy minister for intelligence,
identified only as Moussavi, is in France with a team of
``torturers and interrogators'' to help coordinate the alleged
effort to keep Iranian exiles away from the matches.
	   He claimed he had seen a document from the Intelligence Ministry
showing that Moussavi brought to France files ``of a great number
of opponents and political refugees so French police can arrest
them during the match for hooliganism.''
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said Wednesday that his office had
received correspondence from groups opposed to the Islamic
government in Tehran, who said there would be trouble at Sunday's
match in Lyon. Naziri denied it.
	   Blatter declined to identify the group or say whether specific
action had been threatened.
	   The Mujahedeen, one of the forces that helped topple the Shah of
Iran in 1979, has long lobbied from Western capitals against the
Tehran government.

British priest's trial adjourned to July 2 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The trial of a British vicar who has
admitted molesting two 13-year-old Romanian street boys was
adjourned to next month, his attorney said Thursday.
	   Jean Talupca expressed his frustration that Michael John
Taylor's court hearing was moved back for unknown but
``bureaucratic'' reasons.
	   The hearing was adjourned from June 11 and then to June 18.
	   British Consul Maurice Harper also said he was frustrated that
the case is being dragged out. Taylor, 34, who was arrested last
August, admitted to authorities sexually molesting two 13-year-old
runaways but denied he was a pedophile.
	   He is expected to admit this to the court in the next hearing.
	   He could expect a seven-year prison sentence for the offense.

Dragons beat Giants 10-8, take league lead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Takeshi Yamasaki hit a three-run home run in the
eighth inning Thursday as the Chunichi Dragons beat the Yomiuri
Giants 10-8 and took the Central League away from them again.
	   The Dragons' Lee Jong Beom hit a two-run home run in the
four-run fourth inning and teammate Leo Gomez added a solo homer in
the ninth.
	   Gomez, formerly with the Chicago Cubs, has 11 homers, and Lee,
formerly with the Hai Tai Tigers of South Korea's professional
baseball league, has nine.
	   Hideki Matsui of the Giants hit a two-run home run in the first
inning. He leads the league with 14 homers.
	   The Dragons have a half-game lead over the Yokohama BayStars,
who moved into second place with a 7-6 victory over the Hanshin
Tigers at Yokohama.
	   The Giants fell to third, but only .005 percentage points behind
the BayStars.
	   At Yokohama, the BayStars' Robert Rose, formerly with the
California Angels, drove in a run in the three-run eighth inning
with a sacrifice fly and singled home the winning run in the bottom
of ninth against reliever Ben Rivera.
	   Rivera, formerly with the Philadelphia Phillies, gave up five
hits and two walks in the last 1 2/3 innings and took the loss. He
is 1-1.
	   The BayStars extended their winning streak to three and the
Tigers suffered their sixth straight defeat.
	   At Tokyo's Jingu Stadium, Takahiro Ikeyama belted a two-run home
run in the eighth as the Yakult Swallows beat the Hiroshima Toyo
Carp 5-3 and extended their winning streak to four. Ikeyama has 10
homers.
	   In the Pacific League, Yuji Yoshioka hit a two-run home run in
the bottom of the 11th inning, giving the Kintetsu Buffaloes a 7-5
victory over the Chiba Lotte Marines and a slim hold on first
place.
	   Yoshioka has two homers.
	   The Buffaloes are .002 percentage points ahead of the Nippon Ham
Fighters, who lost 5-3 to the Seibu Lions at Seibu Dome.
	   Domingo Martinez, formerly with the Triple-A Rochester team,
singled home a run in the two-run first inning and Tsutomu Itoh hit
a home run in the fourth to help the Lions win. Itoh has two
homers.
	   At Kobe, Troy Neel hit a double and scored the winning run in
the eighth on pinch hitter Yasuo Fujii's single as the Orix
BlueWave edged the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 5-4.
	   The BlueWave's Neel, formerly with the Oakland Athletics,
smashed his eighth homer of the season in the two-run third inning.
	   Reliever Edwin Hurtado, formerly with the Seattle Mariners,
limited the Hawks to two hits in the last 4 2/3 innings for his
sixth victory against one defeat.

Klaus rallying strongly from ouster six months ago Ousted prime minister heads into elections stronger than expected 
</HEADLINE>
By MELISSA EDDY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ When Vaclav Klaus left office in
disgrace six months ago, he was written off as a political
has-been. But on the eve of Friday's parliamentary elections,
Czechs appear to be thinking again.
	   There is scant chance that Klaus _ who alongside President
Vaclav Havel led the country through post-1989 political and
economic reform _ will return to office.
	   But pre-election polls show his party has jumped to second place
and is expected to make a strong showing when 8.09 million eligible
voters cast ballots Friday and Saturday.
	   Roughly 15 percent said they would support Klaus' center-right
Civic Democratic Party, according to the most recent polls by a
government-funded agency. A margin of error was not given.
	   While the center-left Social Democrats still lead with slightly
more than 20 percent, Klaus' party has made an unexpected comeback
from their all-time low of 9.1 percent in February.
	   After Klaus left office, following a high-profile party
financing scandal, things fell apart. The government collapsed,
forcing Havel to form a pinch-hitter Cabinet to rule until
elections could be held, two years ahead of schedule.
	   The scandal also hurt Klaus' party. Nearly half of its deputies
deserted, many of them forming a rival party dubbed the Freedom
Union, which hit the political scene in February with 18 percent
popularity.
	   Now, the Freedom Union, which was formed as an alternative to
the personality-driven politics that has taken hold in the Czech
Republic, has plummeted to a mere 7 percent support.
	   Some observers worry it won't even clear the 5 percent threshold
needed to gain representation in the 200-seat parliament, thereby
opening up more room for the extremist Republicans, old-style
Communists and an eclectic pensioners' party.
	   Despite the surge in support for Klaus' party, not everyone is
ready to welcome him back.
	   ``I respect Klaus as an expert, but the way he chooses his
advisers is tragic,'' said student Petr Kostohryz, 25. ``He has
surrounded himself with people suspect of criminal acts and he's
loyal to them.''
	   Neither Klaus' party, nor the Social Democrats of his bitter
rival Milos Zeman are expected to get a clear majority. That means
difficult coalition negotiations. Analysts fear the Czech crown
could take a dive, dragging down the economy.
	   And that uncertainty is apparently what has made some Czechs
think again. Klaus, after all, master-minded the reforms that made
the Czech Republic the darling of foreign investors and the model
post-communist economy in the early 90s.
	   ``For me, Klaus is a guarantee of economic transformation,''
said Michal Bares, another 25-year-old student.
	   Jaromir Volek, a sociologist at the Masaryk University in Brno,
says Klaus' authority is growing over the media-fueled scandals.
	   ``People have already half-forgotten the scandals and affairs in
which Klaus played the main role and which led to his downfall,''
Volek told the Mlada Fronta daily.

New UN envoy will have to hit the ground running 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ As America's U.N. envoy, Richard Holbrooke
will need all his negotiating skills to cope with potential
firestorms from Kosovo to South Asia at a time when U.S. leverage
over old foes and reluctant allies is waning.
	   Holbrooke, architect of the 1995 agreement that ended the 3
1/2-year Bosnian war, was named U.N. ambassador Thursday,
succeeding Bill Richardson who will take over as energy secretary.
	   The 57-year-old Holbrooke, one-time assistant secretary of state
for European affairs, will be the most seasoned diplomat to
represent America at the United Nations since Thomas Pickering
served here during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
	   Holbrooke will be arriving at a critical period. Numerous crises
are looming:
	   _ In Kosovo, fighting between Serbs and ethnic Albanians
threatens to engulf region, triggering a wider Balkan war and
unraveling the very peace Holbrooke put together in Bosnia.
	   _ In Cyprus, Turkey is threatening military action if the Greek
Cypriot government takes delivery of surface-to-air missiles, which
a Russian company plans to deliver by mid-August.
	   _ Nuclear tests last month by India and Pakistan have undermined
the fabric of nuclear nonproliferation agreements and raised the
specter of nuclear conflict in South Asia.
	   _ A showdown is brewing with Iraq over economic sanctions, which
had been the cornerstone of U.S. security policy in the Persian
Gulf.
	   _ Washington's inability to revive the moribund Arab-Israeli
peace process is making it difficult to fend off pressure from the
Arabs and Europeans for a stronger international role in mediation.
	   Those are just the major ones. No effective security policy has
been developed to cope with instability in Africa, where any number
of local conflicts could explode into crisis.
	   Similar crises are smouldering in Georgia, Afghanistan and
Tajikistan.
	   The high-watermark of U.S. influence at the United Nations was
reached in 1990, when the Bush Administration persuaded the
Security Council to endorse military action to drive Iraqi invaders
from Kuwait.
	   Since then, however, Washington has been less successful in
mustering support in the Security Council for a robust response to
crises.
	   U.S. efforts to threaten military action against Iraq over U.N.
weapons inspections fell flat. Washington had to rely on
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to negotiate a way out of the impasse
and convince the Iraqis to open sensitive sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   If U.N. inspectors report significant progress by October in
accounting for Iraq's illegal arms, Russia, France and China will
exert strong pressure within the Security Council to wrap up
inspections and lift sanctions, with or without Saddam in power.
	   Russia has resisted British and American efforts in the Security
Council to threaten military force to halt the fighting in Kosovo.
China too is playing a more assertive role in the council, taking
positions closer to the Russians than the Americans on several
major issues.

Ukrainian president to take emergency economic measures 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma described Ukraine's
financial situation as close to critical on Thursday and announced
that he would issue a package of decrees because parliament is too
``paralyzed'' to act.
	   In a nationally broadcast address, Kuchma said Ukraine's heavy
international borrowing is nearing a critical mark, and the crisis
could undermine the stability of the national currency, the hryvna.
	   The president assailed both the previous parliament and the
newly elected legislature, which he criticized for being
preoccupied with infighting and unable to elect a speaker.
	   Kuchma's attempts at market reforms long have been stalled by
parliament. The current Verkhovna Rada, elected in late March, is
dominated by leftists and the centrist opposition.
	   As many as 42 draft laws meant to improve the economic situation
are awaiting parliamentary approval, Kuchma noted.
	   ``But the newly elected parliament has no time for them. For the
second month, it's been paralyzed by the leadership election
crisis,'' Kuchma said.
	   The president said he has decided to heed recommendations of his
staff and sign a series of ``vital'' decrees.
	   ``The people and the state can no longer remain hostages to
uncertainty plaguing the Verkhovna Rada,'' Kuchma said.
	   The decrees, expected to be signed later Thursday, would lower
the current 20 percent value-added tax, simplify tax procedures for
small businesses, introduce a fixed agricultural production tax and
allow the government to raise over 1 billion hryvna (dlrs 500,000
million) to address a huge backlog in overdue wages.
	   Kuchma's spokesman Olexander Maidannik said Thursday that
Ukraine's financial situation might become critical later this
summer. If the funds needed to service foreign debt exceeds budget
revenues, inflation could be triggered, he said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The chief analyst from the Finance Ministry's foreign debt
department, Maxim Blank, issued similar warnings.
	   But ``it is too early to speak of bankruptcy. We are hoping to
overcome the crisis,'' Interfax quoted Blank as saying Wednesday.
	   The government is particularly concerned about the current
domestic bond redemption, as it has to pay about 1 billion hryvna
(dlrs 500 million) over the next few weeks, according to Ukrainian
reports.
	   National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko said Wednesday that
Ukraine plans to attract a new dlrs 100 million foreign loan, which
would allow it rebuild its currency reserves.

Swiss central bank says U.S. freeze of assets unlikely byline. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS for AMs, UPDATES throughout with news conference, adds
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Switzerland's central bank Thursday said it will
fight any U.S. legal moves over its wartime handling of Nazi gold,
but sees little likelihood of the United States freezing its
assets.
	   Even so, the Swiss National Bank _ which reportedly has 1,000
tons of gold stored in the United States _ ``provisionally'' has
prepared for such a move, said bank President Hans Meyer.
	   The bank, however, has no active plans to pull out the gold,
Meyer told reporters.
	   ``We are of the opinion that moving around (the gold) in the
current situation is inopportune for obvious reasons,'' he said.
	   The bank stressed it would oppose ``vigorously'' any
class-action suit filed against it in the United States and
continues to maintain U.S. courts have no jurisdiction over a
central bank of another sovereign state.
	   Such a suit has been threatened by a key U.S. lawyer
representing Holocaust victims and their heirs who already are
suing Switzerland's three biggest commercial banks.
	   Jean-Pierre Roth, vice president of the central bank, said it
also would refuse to ``enter into negotiations concerning an
out-of-court settlement.''
	   The commercial banks, which have U.S. subsidiaries under
government supervision, have been working with Jewish organizations
and the plaintiffs on a ``global settlement'' of claims by
Holocaust victims.
	   The central bank has no subsidiaries in the United States, but
has stored undisclosed amounts of gold there for decades and
maintains other assets there as well.
	   Meyer declined to confirm reports that some 1,000 tons of the
bank's 2,600-ton total _ worth 36 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 24
billion) _ is still in the United States.
	   But he did say the bank maintains a policy of storing its gold
in ``a decentralized way.''
	   He said it was difficult to assess the U.S. threats against the
bank's assets, but that there were two sources _ those relating to
a law suit and those from the White House or Congress.
	   ``We assume that this possibility (of a freeze) is not very
great,'' said Meyer.
	   He noted that the U.S. dollar remains the world's dominant
currency and said the bank would continue to need dollars for
international transactions.
	   However, Meyer said, the bank has been moving to use German
marks and other means to reduce its dependency on the U.S.
currency.
	   Recent studies have underscored that the central bank, charged
with maintaining the gold backing for the neutral country's
currency during the war, had accepted gold looted from
Nazi-occupied countries and Third Reich victims.
	   Switzerland needed increasing amounts of gold to meet the ever
greater demand for the Swiss franc, the only internationally
acceptable currency on the European continent.
	   Roth noted that the central bank had already acknowledged that
it even ``may have unwittingly acquired gold originating from
concentration camps.''
	   ``We regret most profoundly that the National Bank became
involved in the horrors of the Holocaust in this way by the
confusions of the war,'' Roth said.
	   A panel of independent historians said last month that Nazi
Germany sent the Swiss National Bank at least 119.5 kilograms
(263.4 pounds) of gold taken from Holocaust victims in
concentration camps.
	   Roth conceded that the national bank ``misjudged the political
and moral implications of its actions during the war,'' but noted
that the historians found no indication the bank board knew some of
the gold came from individual victims.
	   At the same time, he said, the historians had failed to look at
the full picture of the challenges faced by the central bank of a
small neutral country surrounded Nazi Germany and its allies.
	   For one thing, Roth said, the U.S. government's freezing of
Swiss assets during the war, including the gold deposits, forced
Switzerland to deal more heavily with the Nazis.
	   The bank's current managers agree with the historians, however,
that the wartime board had too narrow of a view of right and wrong
even though they succeeded in maintaining the country's stability
during a difficult time.
	   ``Our predecessors undoubtedly showed a certain bookkeeper's
mentality in their approach to neutrality, particularly since the
two sides involved in the war could not be considered on a par in
moral respects,'' Roth said.

Ousted prime minister heads into elections stronger than expected 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING to fix byline format
By MELISSA EDDY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ When Vaclav Klaus left office in
disgrace six months ago, he was written off as a political
has-been. But on the eve of Friday's parliamentary elections,
Czechs appear to be thinking again.
	   There is scant chance that Klaus _ who alongside President
Vaclav Havel led the country through post-1989 political and
economic reform _ will return to office.
	   But pre-election polls show his party has jumped to second place
and is expected to make a strong showing when 8.09 million eligible
voters cast ballots Friday and Saturday.
	   Roughly 15 percent said they would support Klaus' center-right
Civic Democratic Party, according to the most recent polls by a
government-funded agency. A margin of error was not given.
	   While the center-left Social Democrats still lead with slightly
more than 20 percent, Klaus' party has made an unexpected comeback
from their all-time low of 9.1 percent in February.
	   After Klaus left office, following a high-profile party
financing scandal, things fell apart. The government collapsed,
forcing Havel to form a pinch-hitter Cabinet to rule until
elections could be held, two years ahead of schedule.
	   The scandal also hurt Klaus' party. Nearly half of its deputies
deserted, many of them forming a rival party dubbed the Freedom
Union, which hit the political scene in February with 18 percent
popularity.
	   Now, the Freedom Union, which was formed as an alternative to
the personality-driven politics that has taken hold in the Czech
Republic, has plummeted to a mere 7 percent support.
	   Some observers worry it won't even clear the 5 percent threshold
needed to gain representation in the 200-seat parliament, thereby
opening up more room for the extremist Republicans, old-style
Communists and an eclectic pensioners' party.
	   Despite the surge in support for Klaus' party, not everyone is
ready to welcome him back.
	   ``I respect Klaus as an expert, but the way he chooses his
advisers is tragic,'' said student Petr Kostohryz, 25. ``He has
surrounded himself with people suspect of criminal acts and he's
loyal to them.''
	   Neither Klaus' party, nor the Social Democrats of his bitter
rival Milos Zeman are expected to get a clear majority. That means
difficult coalition negotiations. Analysts fear the Czech crown
could take a dive, dragging down the economy.
	   And that uncertainty is apparently what has made some Czechs
think again. Klaus, after all, master-minded the reforms that made
the Czech Republic the darling of foreign investors and the model
post-communist economy in the early 90s.
	   ``For me, Klaus is a guarantee of economic transformation,''
said Michal Bares, another 25-year-old student.
	   Jaromir Volek, a sociologist at the Masaryk University in Brno,
says Klaus' authority is growing over the media-fueled scandals.
	   ``People have already half-forgotten the scandals and affairs in
which Klaus played the main role and which led to his downfall,''
Volek told the Mlada Fronta daily.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Even riding on a plane or train, movie buffs can
now watch dramas and videos on what appears to them as a giant
screen simply by wearing a pair of special goggles that will go on
sale this weekend.
	   The new portable entertainment display Eye-Trek, produced by
Olympus Optical Co., will hit the Japanese market Saturday at a
suggested retail price of 65,000 yen (dlrs 480), the company said
in a press release.
	   When the goggles are connected to a TV set, video player or
video game, images burst into view with the impact and reality
provided by a 62-inch screen at a distance of two meters (6.6
feet), Olympus said.
	   Users can enjoy movies on a commuting train ride or aboard a
plane without interfering with other people by connecting the
device, which weighs only 110 grams (3.85 ounces), to portable
audio-visual equipment such as portable DVD players, the company
said.
	   Eye-Trek has been provided to first-class passengers of Japan
Airlines since the end of May.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ On the eve of the 98th U.S. Open, Justin
Leonard wondered if the USGA's answer to equipment concerns would
be to make players carry only nine clubs and walk barefoot.
	   That wasn't the case Thursday at The Olympic Club, when the Open
began in chilly, overcast conditions with light fog rolling over
the hills in the distance.
	   Steve Pate may have set the tone for the day _ the first ball
struck in the championship drifted right and disappeared into the
rough as the gallery groaned.
	   Even with 15 clubs in the bag, Leonard and the rest of the field
would do well to concentrate on only a few of them.
	   A 3-wood or low iron will come in handy off the tee, anything to
keep the ball out of the 5-inch (13-centimeter) rough that frames
the tight fairways.
	   The wedge is a must, if only to get the ball back into play if
it does roll through the slanted fairways into the thick stuff.
	   ``You just stick the long wedge behind it and hit it as hard as
you can,'' said England's Lee Westwood.
	   Keep the wedge handy. It'll be needed again to get it close
enough to the hole to save par. And as is the case in any
tournament, a trusty putter is always key.
	   ``There's not a lot of places to make birdies out there,'' said
David Duval. ``You're going to stick one close every now and then,
but I would say you're going to have to make at least one 25-footer
(7.62-meter stroke) for birdie every day.''
	   That's the challenge facing defending champion Ernie Els, Tiger
Woods and Leonard, along with Generation Next players trying to win
their first major _ Duval, Jim Furyk and Phil Mickelson.
	   But perhaps youth will take a back seat this year. After Woods,
Els and Leonard won the first three majors last year, Mark O'Meara
won his first major at Augusta National in April.
	   And a month later, 48-year-old Tom Watson showed he still has
plenty of game to contend by winning at Colonial. Watson finished a
stroke behind Scott Simpson the last time the U.S. Open came to
Olympic, and knows as well as anyone what it will take this week.
	   ``Keep it in play,'' he said.
	   Olympic is straightforward, even though nearly every fairway
bends around the cypresses and Monterrey pines, dips into valleys
or climbs toward sloped greens that are guarded by fluffy sand
bunkers.
	   ``You cannot go out there and not perform at a reasonably high
level and expect good results,'' O'Meara said.
	   And it doesn't take long for Olympic to take its toll.
	   The first hole looks simple enough, a 533-yard (487-meter shot)
par 5 that played as the easiest hole the last time the U.S. Open
came to Olympic. And No. 7 measures only 288 yards (263 meters),
leaving players only a sand wedge unless they want to risk going
for the green off the tee.
	   The five holes in between comprise one of the toughest stretches
in championship golf. The Open won't be won on those holes, but it
certainly can be lost there.
	   ``You start out and you play the first hole well,'' said Duval.
``Say you make 4. Well, you make any mistakes in the next five
holes, you're standing on the seventh tee at 2- or 3-over par.
	   ``And there is not a whole lot of places to make those shots
up.''
	   That's the nature of a U.S. Open course. The USGA has long said
its goal is not to embarrass the world's greatest players, only
identify them.
	   But they don't identify with this kind of rough any other time
through the course of the year.
	   Miss the fairway and the only option is usually slamming a wedge
through the rough to get the ball back into the fairway.
	   ``I can't hit more than a sand wedge,'' said Tom Lehman, who has
played in the final pairing the last three U.S. Opens. ``I don't
think it's possible unless you get lucky _ I mean really, really,
really lucky _ to get the ball to the green from the rough.''
	   Miss the green and it gets even worse.
	   During a practice round earlier this week, Woods dropped his
ball in the rough no more than 2 feet (0.61 meters) off the green,
aiming for a mark on the green about 15 feet (4.57 meters) away.
	   He whiffed the first shot. His second attempt moved the ball
about 18 inches (46 centimeters). Woods kept trying, letting out a
grunt on his fifth try.
	   Olympic figures to produce that kind of emotion.

EU will watch Slovakia's elections closely 
</HEADLINE>
By JANA DOROTKOVA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The European Union is concerned
about the freedom and fairness of Slovakia's September elections
and will be watching them closely, EU commissioner Hans van den
Broek said Thursday toward the end of a two-day visit.
	   Free and fair elections, and improved legislation concerning
official use of minority languages are priorities Slovakia should
meet before December, when the EU commission prepares a progress
report on accession to the 15-nation group, van den Broek said.
	   Slovakia _ unlike the neighboring Czech Republic, Poland and
Hungary _ has excluded from the first group of post-communist
countries slated to join NATO and the EU, mostly out of concern
over the sometimes undemocratic behavior of Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar.
	   Parliamentary elections are scheduled for September. Slovakia
has been without a president since March, when the five-year term
of a Meciar ally turned foe expired. Parliament has been deadlocked
over trying to choose a successor, meaning Meciar has assumed some
critical presidential powers.
	   ``We consider that the importance of free and fair presidential,
national and local elections is fundamental,'' van den Broek said
in a speech to the Civil Society Development Foundation,
established with EU support.
	   ``We regret the recent amendment to the election law which is
likely to restrict the freedom of the electronic media and
political parties and call on all involved to work hard to ensure
that the election is free and fair,'' van den Broek said.
	   He reiterated that a candidate country can join the EU as soon
as it achieves satisfactory economic conditions and ``stability of
institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights
and respect for and protection of minorities.''
	   Before 1994, Slovakia was among leading candidates among the
post-communist countries for European accession.
	   But as Meciar tightened his grip on power, Slovakia failed to
meet political criteria.
	   ``The question is not whether Slovakia will join the Union, the
question is when. The answer lies in the hands of the Slovak
government,'' van den Broek said ahead of his current visit.
	   While in Slovakia, the commissioner met with Meciar, Foreign
Minister Zdenka Kramplova, Parliament Speaker Ivan Gaparovic and
deputy prime minister Jozef Kalman.
	   Discussions focused on Slovakia's efforts to meet political
criteria for membership.
	   ``I leave with the feeling that steps forward are being made,
but that we have not completed our common goal yet,'' van den Broek
told reporters.

Former police arrested in Mexico kidnap case 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Six people, including four current or former
Morelos state policemen, have been arrested on charges of
kidnapping and killing a rancher near the state capital of
Cuernavaca, newspapers reported Thursday.
	   The arrests announced by state Attorney General Arturo Estrada
Carrillo come a month after Gov. Jorge Carillo Olea and other
officials were forced to resign due to charges of police
involvement in kidnapping rings.
	   Among those arrested was Gilberto Dominguez Romero, who was a
senior official of the state police anti-kidnapping unit and
coordinator of public security for the town of Yautepec, and Victor
Hugo Cuevas Bustamante, another former state judicial policeman.
	   Prosecutors said Gilberto Celis Pineda was kidnapped in late
1997. Though his family paid 90,000 pesos (dlrs 10,000) in ransom,
he was killed and buried at Dominguez' house in Acatlipa, south of
Cuernavaca.
	   Dominguez denied involvement, saying the house had been rented
to Baldemar Mendoza Cruz, another of those arrested. Mendoza, a
state policeman from 1990 to 1994, claimed the gang paid federal
police agents dlrs 12,000 to carry out the kidnapping and to
negotiate with the family.
	   Mendoza admitted he was part of a methamphetamine trafficking
ring that paid state police as much as 150,000 pesos (dlrs 17,000)
a month for protection, according to the daily El Universal.
	   Mendoza claimed the kidnapped rancher was a member of the drug
gang and owed the group money from a drug deal.
	   Cuevas insisted he was innocent, according to the newspaper
Reforma: ``I cannot say anything, and I am not responsible for
anything until the judge says so,'' Cuevas was quoted as saying.
	   Reforma reported that he admitted being at the place the rancher
was held, but claimed he was drunk at the time and denied
involvement in the kidnapping.
	   Reforma also reported that according to state records on 414
kidnappings, victims have paid more than dlrs 100 million in
ransoms over the past four years. The actual figure is probably far
higher because many people avoid reporting kidnappings for fear
police may be involved in them.
	   Carrillo Olea was forced to resign because of an expanding
scandal that erupted when traffic police in neighboring Guerrero
state discovered the chief of Morelos' anti-kidnapping unit dumping
the tortured body of a kidnapping suspect.
	   The state police chief, attorney general and numerous officers
also were fired.

Human Rights Watch warns Cambodian elections unlikely to be fair 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: EMBARGOED BY SOURCE UNTIL 0001 GMT, JUNE 19
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A U.S.-based human rights group on
Friday recommended postponing Cambodia's national election, saying
conditions are not conducive to holding free and fair polls on July
26.
	   ``The primary obstacle is neither logistical nor technical, but
rather the determination of the ruling Cambodian People's Party to
control the electoral process and restrict basic freedoms,'' said
Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia division of Human
Rights Watch.
	   Acknowledging that a delay in the polls is unlikely just six
weeks before their scheduled date, the group urged other nations to
apply economic and diplomatic pressure to help ensure the elections
are as fair and violence-free as possible.
	   The pressure should be applied to make sure the Phnom Penh
government agrees to meet certain minimum standards in organizing
the election, said a Human Rights Watch report.
	   It said that a rushed and flawed electoral process will neither
help Cambodia establish a democracy nor bring an end to disruptive
military activities.
	   The recommendations came on the eve of a meeting Friday in
Bangkok, Thailand, of the so-called Friends of Cambodia, an
influential grouping of Western and Asian countries seeking an end
to Cambodia's continuing political unrest.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his
co-premier in a coup one year ago, shattering a tense dual
premiership formed after U.N.-brokered elections in 1993.
	   As many as 90 of the prince's supporters were killed in the
months that followed, apparently by Hun Sen's forces. Fearing for
their lives, Ranariddh and scores of his loyalists fled the
country.
	   In an effort to win back international legitimacy and foreign
aid that had been held back after the coup, Hun Sen agreed to
proceed with a new election on July 26. Under pressure from foreign
aid donors, he allowed Ranariddh to return to participate.
	   Human Rights Watch noted that there have been no arrests in any
of the politically motivated killings after the coup, creating ``a
widespread climate of fear, stifled dissent, and intimidated
voters.''
	   At the same time, opposition political activists have been
prevented from rebuilding their party structures while Hun Sen's
CPP has launched an aggressive nationwide campaign to pressure
voters into signing up with his party.
	   Access to the media so far has been limited to the CPP, which
also dominates institutions assigned to organize and oversee the
elections, critics say.
	   The most important step the Friends of Cambodia can take at this
stage, Human Rights Watch wrote, ``is to ensure that as many
qualified observers and monitors arrive in the country as soon as
possible.''
	   Only 300 international monitors have been committed to observe
the process, with most of them to arrive in the last weeks of the
campaign. They will be expected to cover more than 11,000 polling
stations and 1,600 counting centers.
	   Their presence could help deter political violence and
intimidation of voters and candidates in the weeks that remain,
ensure secrecy of the ballots, and pave the way for a smooth
transition of power to the victors, the group wrote.
	   ``If donor resources are to go anywhere, it should be to this
monitoring effort,'' Human Rights Watch wrote.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ On the eve of the 98th U.S. Open, Justin
Leonard wondered if the USGA's answer to equipment concerns would
be to make players carry only nine clubs and walk barefoot.
	   That wasn't the case Thursday at The Olympic Club, when the Open
began in chilly, overcast conditions with light fog rolling over
the hills in the distance.
	   Steve Pate may have set the tone for the day _ the first ball
struck in the championship drifted right and disappeared into the
rough as the gallery groaned.
	   Even with 14 clubs in the bag, Leonard and the rest of the field
would do well to concentrate on only a few of them.

Russia emerges from wings as U.S. ally in court battle 
</HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) - Russia emerged from the wings Thursday as an ally of
the United States in the battle over an international criminal
court.
	   Like the United States and China, it opposes giving the court an
independent prosecutor _ an idea favored by a wide coalition of
nations and human rights groups.
	   In a speech at a U.N. conference on creating the tribunal,
Deputy Foreign Minister U.V. Ushakov said only the U.N. Security
Council or a state should be able to trigger court action.
	   ``The court in no circumstances should become an instrument of
political manipulation,'' he told the delegates.
	   As envisioned, the tribunal prosecute individuals for the most
heinous crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
	   Some nations want aggression added to the list and a handful,
including Turkey, Algeria and Russia, are in favor of including
terrorism.
	   The court would get involved only when national government fail
_ or are unable - to act.
	   The debate over an independent prosecutor and how much control
the Security Council would have is a hot one.
	   Three of the council's five permanent members _ Russia, China
and the United States _ want strong council control and no
independent prosecutor.
	   France, another permanent member, broke with them on Wednesday,
saying it now favors an independent prosecutor.
	   The move further isolated the United States. And it elated
members of the pro-stong prosecutor coalition, which includes such
close U.S. allies as Britain and Canada as well as a coalition of
hundreds of human rights and other organizations.
	   The United States has been out front on the debate during the
years of negotiations leading up to the treaty conference, with
China and Russia content to let it take the often controversial
lead.
	   The permanent members have Security Council vetos, which gives
them immense power. If the council has control over the court,
their clout would extend to the criminal tribunal.
	   It is far from certain that the five-week conference will
produce a treaty. Even if it does, it could takes years for enough
countries to ratify it to make the court a reality.
	   The idea for a permanent criminal tribunal was born after World
War II and the Nuremberg war crimes trials. It moved to the
forefront a few years ago after the creation of ad hoc tribunals
for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.

U.N. official says delay of spare parts will have serious effect 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council's delay in
authorizing Iraq's purchase of spare parts to repair its oil
facilities will have ``serious consequences,'' a top U.N.
humanitarian official said Thursday.
	   A resolution authorizing dlrs 300 million in spare parts for
Iraq's oil industry was introduced in the Security Council late
Wednesday, about three months after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan recommended the measure to the council.
	   The United States had held up the resolution because it wanted
to link a spare parts deal to changes in the oil-for-food program
that would make it last as long as Iraq remains under economic
sanctions. Baghdad warned that prolonging the program _ and, in
effect, keeping sanctions in place _ would lead it to cease oil
exports.
	   Iraq has been barred from freely exporting oil since 1990 when
the Security Council imposed sanctions after Iraqi forces invaded
Kuwait. In 1996, the council approved the oil-for-food program
which enables Baghdad to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food,
medicine and humanitarian goods for Iraq's 22 million people.
	   ``The current delay by the member states of the Security Council
in approving dlrs 300 million for oil sector spare parts and
equipment is going to affect the amount of oil produced and
exported out of Iraq in the coming months,'' Denis Halliday, the
U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Baghdad, told reporters.
	   ``This is expected to have serious consequences for the whole
program,'' he said.
	   Halliday said there was growing concern that the state of Iraq's
oil industry would prevent it from reaching the target of exporting
dlrs 4.5 billion in oil for the 180-day period that began June 3.
	   Halliday said that even if the spare parts were received within
three months, he did not think Iraq would see the benefits before
the end of the current six-month period.
	   ``Time is the enemy and is cause for alarm,'' said Halliday, who
is the first senior U.N. official to openly criticize the council's
delay of the spare parts.
	   He said the delay will hinder Iraq's ability to boost food
rations and reduce the malnutrition that already affects one-third
of Iraq's 3 million children under five years of age.
	   Iraq had planned to use dlrs 3 billion of the expected revenue
to import food, medicine and other commodities to repair basic
infrastructure. These purchases would include dlrs 300 million for
the oil industry.

Prosecutors investigate army soldier for deadly accident in Bosnia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KASSEL, Germany (AP) _ State prosecutors on Thursday charged an
army tank commander with reckless manslaughter and causing bodily
injury for the deaths of two German soldiers hit by friendly fire
while on peacekeeping duty in Bosnia.
	   A 20-millimeter gun mounted on a German tank fired accidentally
as soldiers prepared for a patrol in May 1997, killing two and
injuring a third.
	   Prosecutors said the gun when off when the 38-year-old master
sergeant was investigating why a warning light was on. They charge
that he failed in his duty to secure the area and personnel against
the possibility that the gun would fire.

Indian border guards kill four Bangladeshi farmers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Indian border guards shot and killed
four Bangladeshi farmers plowing a rice field along the northern
frontier Thursday, a Bangladeshi official said.
	   The shooting occurred at the border village of Baraipara in
Lalmonirhat district, 250 kilometers(160 miles) north of Dhaka, the
Bangladesh capital, Lt. Col. Aminul Islam, a local commander of
Bangladesh's border forces, said in a telephone interview.
	   Islam said the Indian firing was unprovoked and he has lodged a
protest with his Indian counterpart.
	   There was no immediate comment by the Indian authorities.
	   Bangladesh has a long border with India. Farming of land up to
the border, illegal infiltration and smuggling often create
problems.

	   Weather Summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
	   Numerous showers moved over the coastal waters surrounding
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands overnight. Some of these
showers moved on shore over the islands mainly over St. Thomas, St.
John and the north and east coastal plains of Puerto Rico. These
showers generally produced light to moderate rain with amounts
between an inch or two overnight. But a few of the heavier showers
and isolated thunderstorms over the coastal waters produced over 2
inches of rain in one hour according to the Doppler radar. Skies
were variably cloudy with the least amount of clouds over southwest
Puerto Rico and St. Croix. The winds were light out of the east to
northeast.
	   Plenty of moisture still remains upstream from Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands. This moisture will continue to be carried
into the local area with easterly winds. And the combination of
this moisture and the location of the upper trough in the vicinity
of the islands will trigger showers and thunderstorms again
Thursday. The flow will be slightly more east to southeast rather
than northwest and therefore the focus of the shower and
thunderstorm activity will be over interior to north sections of
Puerto Rico and the northwest this afternoon.
	   San Juan and North Sections of Puerto Rico:
	   Thursday variable cloudiness with a 50 percent chance of showers
and thunderstorms. High around 90. Wind east 15 mph.
	   Thursday night variable cloudiness. A 50 percent chance of
showers. Possible thunderstorms. Low 75 to 80. Wind light east.
	   Friday variable cloudiness. Showers and thunderstorms are
likely. High 85 to 90. Wind east near 15 mph. Chance of rain is 60
percent.
	   East Sections of Puerto Rico:
	   Thursday Variable cloudiness with a 40 percent chance of
showers. Slight chance of a thunderstorm. High 85 to 90. Wind east
15 mph.
	   Thursday night variable cloudiness with a 50 percent chance of
showers. Thunderstorms are possible. Low 75 to 80. Wind east 5 to
10 mph.
	   Friday variable cloudiness. Showers and thunderstorms are likely
mostly in the afternoon. High 85 to 90. Wind east 15 mph. Chance of
rain is 60 percent.
	   Ponce and South Sections of Puerto Rico:
	   Thursday partly cloudy morning. Increasing cloudiness afternoon.
A 50 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms. High 90 to 95.
Wind southeast 10 to 15 mph.
	   Thursday night partly cloudy. A 40 percent chance of showers.
Chance of thunderstorms along the coast. Low 70 to 75. Wind east to
northeast 5 mph.
	   Friday increasing cloudiness. A good chance of showers and
thunderstorms. High around 90. Wind southeast 10 to 15 mph. Chance
of rain is 50 percent.
	   Mayaguez and West Sections of Puerto Rico:
	   Thursday increasing cloudiness. Showers and thunderstorms are
likely. High 85 to 90. Wind east 15 mph except for a west wind 5 to
10 mph along the west coast in the afternoon. Chance of rain is 60
percent.
	   Thursday night variable cloudiness. A 30 percent chance of
showers. Chance of a coastal thunderstorm until midnight. Low 70 to
75. Wind east 5 to 10 mph.
	   Friday partly sunny morning. Mostly cloudy afternoon with
showers and thunderstorms likely some with heavy rain. High 85 to
90. Wind east 15 mph except for a west wind 5 to 10 mph along the
west coast in the afternoon. Chance of rain is 70 percent.
	   Interior Sections of Puerto Rico:
	   Thursday increasing cloudiness with showers and afternoon
thunderstorms likely. High from 75 mountains to 85 lower
elevations. Wind east 15 to 20 mph. Chance of rain is 60 percent.
	   Thursday night variable cloudiness. A 40 percent chance of
showers mainly east. Low 65 to 70 mountains to 70 to 75 lower
elevations. Wind east 5 to 10 mph.
	   Friday variable cloudiness in the morning. Mostly cloudy in the
afternoon. Showers and afternoon thunderstorms are likely. High
from 75 to 80 mountains to 85 to 90 lower elevations. Wind east 15
to 20 mph. Chance of rain is 70 percent.
	   St. Thomas, St. John and Adjacent Islands-St. Croix:
	   Thursday variable cloudiness with a 40 percent chance of showers
or thunderstorms. High near 90. Wind east around 15 mph.
	   Thursday night partly cloudy. A 40 percent chance of showers.
Possibly a thunderstorm. Low 75 to 80. Wind east 5 to 10 mph.
	   Friday increasing cloudiness. A good chance of showers and
thunderstorms mostly in the afternoon. Possible heavy rainfall.
High 85 to near 90. Wind east 15 mph. Chance of rain is 50 percent.
	   Waters north and northeast of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands:
	   Thursday wind east 15 knots, seas 3 to 5 feet. Scattered
showers. Isolated thunderstorms.

U.N. official says delay of spare parts will have serious effect

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council's delay in
authorizing Iraq's purchase of spare parts to repair oil facilities
will have ``serious consequences,'' a top United Nations
humanitarian official said Thursday.
	   A resolution authorizing dlrs 300 million in spare parts for
Iraq's oil industry was introduced in the Security Council late
Wednesday, about three months after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi

	   The United States held up the resolution because it wanted to

	   Iraq has been barred from freely exporting oil since 1990 when
the Security Council imposed sanctions after Iraqi forces invaded
Kuwait. In 1996, the council approved the oil-for-food program,
which enables Baghdad to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food,
medicine and humanitarian goods for Iraq's 22 million people.
	   In the first three phases of the deal, Iraq was allowed to sell
dlrs 2 billion worth of oil every six months, but that amount was
raised in the fourth phase.
	   ``The current delay by the member states of the Security Council
in approving dlrs 300 million for oil sector spare parts and
equipment is going to affect the amount of oil produced and
exported out of Iraq in the coming months,'' Denis Halliday, the
U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Baghdad, told reporters. ``This is

rations and reduce the malnutrition that already affects one-third
of Iraq's 3 million children younger than 5.
	   Iraq planned to use dlrs 3 billion of the expected revenue to
import food, medicine and other commodities to repair basic
infrastructure. These purchases would include the dlrs 300 million
for the oil industry.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Nearly 15,000 World Cup tickets and hundreds of
thousands of dollars in cash have been stolen from the Paris office
of an American travel agency, police said Thursday.
	   The burglary happened overnight at the office of Prime Sport
International, said police officials, speaking on customary
anonymity.
	   They said one or two burglars had climbed the scaffolding
outside the office, and had broken the safe as well as the door.
	   Also recovered was 2.4 million francs (about dlrs 400,000) and
another 100,000 pounds (about dlrs 160,000) in British currency.

Adoption activists: New bill hinders both foreign and Russian adoptions 
</HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Adoption activists complained Thursday that
Russia's new adoption bill would hinder not only foreign adoptions
but also those by Russians.
	   The proposed law, which has been passed by both houses of
parliament, is waiting for President Boris Yeltsin to decide
whether to sign it or veto it. The president has not indicated his
stand on the issue.
	   The bill would allow foreign adoption agencies to operate in
Russia only after their country signs an agreement with Russia
setting out the rules.
	   Various groups have offered differing interpretations of the
provisions, with the bill's supporters saying it will prevent
bribery and illegal adoptions.
	   But at a joint news conference, the adoption advocates said the
bill would only put private adoption agencies in legal limbo. As a
result, prospective adoptive parents _ whether Russian or foreign _
would be forced to rely on ineffective and often corrupt state-run
agencies.
	   ``Our state yet again has given state organizations a monopoly _
and every monopoly is a field for corruption, red tape and abuse of
authority,'' said Boris Altshuler, an adoption activist who runs a
program called Child's Rights. ``It's especially frightening when
this monopoly concerns children.''
	   Altshuler and three other human rights advocates have sent a
letter to Yeltsin, asking him to veto the bill, saying it would
condemn orphans to life in substandard orphanages.
	   An average Russian orphanage houses 150 children, and some have
more than 200, said Anatoly Severny, president of the Independent
Association of Juvenile Psychiatrists and Psychologists.
	   ``These are real warehouses. It's impossible to carry out any
nurturing or educational work with such numbers of children,''
Severny said.
	   Russia's orphanages for children with disabilities are ``among
the most horrible places on Earth and quite deserve to be called
`death camps','' the activists said in their letter to Yeltsin.
	   Supporters of the new bill _ mostly Communists and nationalists
_ insist that Russian orphans should stay in their homeland. They
have said the new bill would only hinder foreign adoptions, while
encouraging adoptions by Russians.
	   But Altshuler and the others said the rules would hit
prospective Russian parents just as hard.
	   ``And here, all their `patriotism' flies off our legislators
like a fig leaf,'' he said.
	   By passing the bill, the Communist-dominated parliament ``has
done everything Lenin-style _ that is, have deceived everybody,''
Altshuler said.

Truck with smuggled weapons confiscated

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A truck loaded with light and heavy
weapons arriving from the Italian port of Ancona was seized by
Albanian customs in the Adriatic port of Durres, officials said
Thursday.
	   Reporters were allowed on Thursday to view the truck, a 15-ton
Mercedes Benz half loaded with sacks of washing powder and the
other half with about 30 automatic guns, a sniper, 30 antitank
launchers, maps and communication equipment.
	   The truck had arrived in Durres on June 11, aboard the ``San
Savino'' ferry from Ancona, officials said. It had plain white
plates with black lettering. Customs officials did not specify
where it was registered, but one senior official suggested the
weapons were of the type once used in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   Customs officials gave no explanation for the delay in reporting
the incident, which appeared to show that Albania is trying to cut
arms smuggling into the country as neighboring Yugoslavia accuses
it of smuggling guns to ethnic Albanian militants in rebellious
Kosovo province.

Kournikova beats Graf for place in semifinals
<TEXT>
	   EASTBOURNE, England (AP) _ In a victory for the new guard over
the old, 17-year-old Anna Kournikova overcame an angry Steffi Graf
in three sets Thursday to reach the semifinals of the Wimbledon
warmup tournament at Eastbourne.
	   Kournikova, a Wimbledon semifinalist last year, needed just over
two hours to beat the seven-time Wimbledon champion 6-7 (4-7), 6-3,
6-4.
	   Kournikova fell during the seventh game of the final set and,
after the match, was taken to a hospital for precautionary checks
on her right hand.
	   The second-seeded Graf, playing in just her fourth tournament
since undergoing knee surgery a year ago, was infuriated by several
line calls.
	   After being broken to go down 5-4 in the final set, Graf spent
the entire changeover complaining to tournament director Brenda
Perry. She refused to shake hands with the chair umpire at the end
of the match.
	   ``There were too many bad calls,'' Graf said. ``I expect a few,
especially on grass, but not that many. It's frustrating because
you have a professional approach and you expect that from the
umpire as well. I was asking for the lines-people to be changed,
and I can't recall ever doing that before.
	   ``They didn't do a good job, and I didn't do a good job either.
I didn't take enough risks. I didn't really go enough to the net. I
was tentative and sometimes didn't really go for my forehand, and I
didn't really step into the ball. I had my chances and didn't take
them.''
	   The match produced high quality tennis, especially in the final
set, with both players rallying superbly and hitting spectacular
winners from all parts of the court.
	   In a battle of big forehands, it was Kournikova who impressed
most with a number of passes that skimmed the lines.
	   Graf was let down by her serve, with three of her seven
double-faults coming on break point.
	   ``It was windy out there but I didn't feel very comfortable with
my serve,'' she said. ``I didn't really go for it.''
	   Graf's first double-fault gave Kournikova a break for 3-1 in the
second set, another a break for 2-1 in the third and the last one
allowed the young Russian to serve for the match.
	   ``She really went for some great shots,'' Graf said. ``She came
in, she took more risks than I did, she approached very well. She
really played a good match.''
	   With only five matches on grass this year, Graf is still happy
with her preparations for Wimbledon.
	   ``Even though I'm not so happy about losing, I have a couple
more days to practice what I really need,'' she said. ``I think I'm
ready.''

Iranian foreign minister skeptical about Albright's offer of improved relations 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photos
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain _ Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharazzi
expressed skepticism Thursday over a U.S. offer to normalize
bilateral relations.
	   ``Words are not enough, they must be followed by acts,''
Kharazzi said at a press conference after meeting Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
	   Kharazzi was responding to an offer of improved U.S.-Iranian
relations made Wednesday by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in a speech in New York.
	   Albright praised recent developments in the country but also
demanded Iran end support for terrorism, improve its human rights
record and drop attempts to acquire nuclear weapons.
	   But the Iranian foreign minister said the abolition of U.S.
economic sanctions was a prerequisite for improved relations.
	   U.S. ``political hostility to Iran'' was also demonstrated by
its opposition to an oil pipeline through the Mideast country,
Kharazzi said.
	   The United States severed ties with Iran following the country's
1979 Islamic revolution in which militants held 52 Americans
hostage for 444 days after storming the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
	   Relations began to thaw with the arrival of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami who subdued the rhetoric branding the U.S. the
``Great Satan''.
	   Kharazzi, on the first day of a two-day visit to Spain, told
Aznar that Iran was undergoing major social and political
transformations, the national news agency EFE reported.
	   The minister said Iran had a right to its idiosyncrasies like
any other country, the agency reported.

Official sees less rhetoric, more hope on road to Sudan peace 
</HEADLINE>
By JENIFER CHAO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ After years of empty rhetoric, a
peaceful solution to Sudan's long civil war is within reach, a
Dutch official heading a donor conference said Thursday.
	   War fatigue and fear of isolation are fueling desires to make
peace, said Dutch Minister for Development Cooperation Jan Pronk.
	   His comments followed a two-day international conference aimed
at bolstering ongoing peace talks to end the 15-year civil war in
southern Sudan and find new ways to assist the east African
country.
	   ``The parties seem to realize that military options will not
lead to victory,'' Pronk said. ``People on the ground are fed up
with war. There have been too many casualties.''
	   In Sudan, rebels have been seeking greater autonomy from the
Islamic-dominated government for the mainly Christian and animist
south. More than 1.5 million Sudanese have died in the fighting and
ensuing famines.
	   ``The continuation of the war is depriving them of contact with
the world,'' said Pronk. ``A generation consisting of younger
people with a rational mind want to participate in a global
society.''
	   Pronk said after years of rhetoric from both sides, he now sees
genuine hopes for peace from the warring factions.
	   ``The political pledge that they want to go for peace now is, in
my view, serious,'' he stressed. ``The situation has changed ... I
can feel it.''
	   The conference, chaired by Pronk, was attended by
representatives from 15 donor countries that pump hundreds of
millions of dollars each year to Sudan in relief aid. The
participating nations were mostly European, plus Japan, the United
States and Canada.
	   During the conference, officials _ mostly development ministers
_ held talks separately with the Sudanese government and with
representatives of the Sudan People's Liberation Army. The warring
parties didn't talk to each other.
	   Pronk said the role of donor nations was to facilitate peace
talks and not mediate negotiations, which is a job for the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, a regional body headed
by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.
	   Pronk said donor nations agreed they will continue with
humanitarian assistance, but ``there are limits to our
assistance.''
	   The costs of delivering humanitarian aid have skyrocketed due to
poor road access caused by fighting, said Pronk, adding he had
previously threatened to halt aid if situations do not improve.
	   ``This is not donor fatigue, but fatigue with anti-peace
actions,'' said Pronk. Both sides have given their assurance to
improve access, Pronk added.
	   The conference also allowed participants to review progress made
during the last round of peace talks in Nairobi in May. The next
scheduled round of peace talks will be in the Ethiopian capital of
Addis Ababa in August.

Body found in Germany believed to be missing California guardsman 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A body found in a wooded training area
is believed to be that of a California National guardsmen missing
for nearly a year, the U.S. Army in Europe said Thursday.
	   The badly decomposed body was found Tuesday by a German forest
ranger in a wooded area at the army's Grafenwoehr training area,
about 250 kilometers (150 miles) east of Frankfurt.
	   Based on documents found on the body, the army has tentatively
identified the deceased as Spec. Mason J.K. O'Neal of Sunnyvale,
California, said U.S. Army Europe spokesman Col. Mike Sullivan.
Forensics will confirm the identification.
	   U.S. army officials declined to comment on the cause of death.
The military's Stars and Stripes newspaper quoted a German forestry
official Christian Luecke as saying that the body had cloth and
string around the neck, indicating a possible suicide.
	   O'Neal has been missing since fleeing an escort taking him to
the Grafenwoehr base medical clinic for observation last July 17.
	   He was part of a National Guard military police company that
arrived in Germany in January 1997 as part of the peacekeeping
mission in Bosnia, and was attending a leadership development
course when began reporting problems, the National Guard said.
	   After O'Neal fled, his 649th Military Police Company conducted
three unsuccessful searches for him on land and by air, Stars and
Stripes said. In December, five special agents searched again
without success.
	   O'Neal is survived by a wife and three children in California.

Millions of pages of Securitate files still haunt Romanians 
</HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ It's been nine years since Stalinist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was executed. But Romanians are still
haunted by the 125 million pages of secret files collected by his
feared Securitate secret police.
	   Those mountains of pages, with the potential for ruining many
Romanians' lives, are guarded by the Securitate's successor, the
Romanian Information Service. They lie safe, except for the
occasional leak that turns into a bombshell.
	   This week three ruling party politicians, including a government
minister, were unmasked as Securitate collaborators.
	   The revelations are a jolt to the reformist government that came
to power 18 months ago, vowing to bring a new moral attitude to the
country. They tried to establish a law forcing anyone in a position
of responsibility to declare any past allegiance to the Securitate,
but Parliament has not voted on it yet.
	   This week's revelations also revived the hysterical
finger-pointing and unsubstantiated accusations that followed
Ceausescu's demise.
	   Unable to deal with their past, many Romanians are still
obsessed with the secret police. That's little shock considering a
quarter of Romania's adult population reportedly worked for the
shadowy organization under Ceausescu.
	   ``Romanian society preferred to hush up the Securitate, thinking
it would die out. But look, it didn't go away'' said Cristian
Dumitrescu, a senator for the ruling Democratic Party.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile on Wednesday asked for the
resignation of Health Minister Francisc Baranyi after he admitted
having been a ``Securist.''
	   Baranyi confessed he signed a written declaration in 1961
promising to collaborate with the Securitate. He was forced to sign
the commitment ``under the threat of a weapon,'' he said, but never
harmed anyone.
	   Vasile Lupu, deputy leader of the profoundly anti-Securitate
National Peasant Party, also worked as an informer. Many members of
his party were tortured, interrogated or killed by the Securitate.
	   There has been no word what, if any action, the party will take.
	   Democratic Party member Adrian Vilau, also exposed, was accused
of covering up his past and banned from holding a parliamentary
post controlling foreign intelligence.
	   He said he was not ashamed of his past and never harmed anyone.
	   Senators from the Liberal Party, a partner in the ruling
coalition, said Thursday they would leave a note with Parliament on
Monday saying whether they had collaborated with the Securitate or
not.
	   After communism ended in 1989, Romanians had a perverse pride in
the efficiency of the Securitate, which controlled people's lives,
noting what someone ate, what time his wife went to work and who
called him on the telephone.
	   Although Romanians are unwilling to face up to the past, there
is a feeling that everyone should have the right to know what was
written about them.
	   ``I think there should be total access for anyone to his
personal file,'' said sociologist Alin Teodorescu. ``But you
shouldn't be able to use it in a court of law, otherwise we would
have 4 million lawsuits.''

General strike paralyzes life in Bangladesh cities, 100 injured

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Clashes during a general strike called
to protest a government peace accord with Buddhist insurgents
injured at least 200 people in parts of Bangladesh on Thursday,
police and news reports said.
	   The daylong strike called by the country's main opposition
parties halted most traffic and shut stores, disrupting normal life
in capital Dhaka and other major cities of Chittagong, Khulna and
Rajshahi.
	   In Dhaka, supporters and opponents of the strike fought with
bamboo trenches and homemade bombs _ small tin pots filled with
explosives. Police fired tear gas shells to push back rioters. At
least 100 people were injured and at least 160 protesters were
detained in Dhaka, where nearly 3,000 protesters marched through
the streets. More than 4,000 security officers guarded the
government buildings and the city center.
	   No arrest was reported outside of Dhaka.
	   Nearly 2,000 former insurgents have surrendered arms as part of
the December 1997 peace accord. The government enacted laws to set
up a tribal council that will govern the resource-rich area 176
kilometers (110 miles) southeast of Dhaka.
	   The strike was called by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's
Bangladesh Nationalist party and its six right-wing allies who say
the peace accord gave too much to Chakma tribespeople at the
expenses of Muslim settlers from the north.
	   Last week, Mrs. Zia led thousands of opposition activists in a
400-kilometer (250-mile) protest convoy from Dhaka to the
southeastern hills where the tribespeople live.

Chubais is back, says Russia needs dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion in aid protest, background, details. CHANGES byline.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's leading capitalist reformer came bouncing
back into the government Thursday, and immediately held out an SOS
sign to the West for dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in aid.
	   Anatoly Chubais, who was recently fired for a second time as a
deputy prime minister, was brought back onto President Boris
Yeltsin's team and charged with securing new loans to stabilize its
economy.
	   Chubais is one of the most disliked and mistrusted men in
Russia, and his appointment enraged Yeltsin's critics in
parliament, who questioned the legality of the appointment.
	   But he is also one of the few figures in Russia whose economic
expertise is respected by Western bankers and leaders, and is the
first person Yeltsin seeks out when the economy is in trouble.
	   Chubais said he would meet the acting chairman of the
International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, on Monday to discuss
the possible conditions for an additional loan to Russia.
	   In the wake of last month's crash in Russian financial markets,
the IMF is reportedly demanding that Russia slash its budget
deficit, improve tax collection and make its Central Bank more open
to scrutiny.
	   The Interfax news agency quoted Chubais as saying that Russia
would not accept loans ``at any price.''
	   But while the government had previously insisted it could shore
up the economy on its own, Chubais said Western aid was needed.
	   ``The situation is very difficult,'' he said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Reaction from the Duma, the Communist-dominated lower house of
Parliament, was predictably caustic.
	   ``This is our great Russian beggar,'' said the leader of the
Parliament's hard-line Agrarian faction, Nikolai Kharitonov.
	   At a demonstration outside Russia's White House, the main
government building, striking miners were joined by scientists
furious over budget cuts that have turned them and their programs
into paupers.
	   Sergei Dembovsky, a physicist at the Russian Academy of
Sciences, spoke with disgust about Chubais' appointment.
	   ``I think it's a continuance of the same old policy of
thievery,'' he said. ``The situation will be even more tense. We
are approaching a social holocaust.''
	   Yeltsin, who has already fired and rehired Chubais twice, tried
to parry criticism. He said even though Chubais has been given back
his old title of deputy prime minister, the job is not technically
a Cabinet appointment and would be ``temporary.''
	   He also said the Duma's reaction was irrelevant.
	   ``For us, more important are the state, the current situation at
the world's financial markets, the value of today's ruble,'' the
president was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin also hinted at new appointments, saying ``the appearance
of new figures is possible,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Chubais lost his job in March in a government shakeup. He was
quickly hired as chief executive of a huge utility, Unified Energy
Systems _ a job he said he will keep.
	   In the past, Chubais was responsible for carrying out Russia's
controversial privatization program. Many Russians believe he all
but gave away billions of dollars in state assets to cronies at
fire-sale prices.
	   In addition, critics consider him personally corrupt, especially
since he was demoted last year in a scandal over a dlrs 90,000
advance from a politically connected publisher for a book he was to
write with several other top government officials. The others were
fired.
	   A prosecutor recently said no charges would be filed in the
case.

By IAN STEWART
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's breakaway military faction
rejected peace talks mediated by a Gambian envoy and vowed Thursday
to launch a counter-strike against government forces loyal to
President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   The army mutineers, led by the country's former military chief
of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane, also struck back at an advancing
coalition force by capturing a radio transmitter near the capital,
Bissau.
	   ``We are sure of our victory,'' Maj. Manuel De Santos Gomes said
in a clandestine broadcast monitored in the Senegalese bordertown
of Mpak.
	   ``We are regrouping our forces and planning an offensive on
Bissau once the civilians have all left,'' he said.
	   Bissau and the surrounding areas have been pounded by heavy
artillery and mortar fire in recent days. More than three-quarters
of the city's population of 300,000 have fled, according to
witnesses and aid groups.
	   The rebels are fighting for Vieira's ouster, while loyalist
troops backed by the Senegalese army claim to have the renegade
force on the run.
	   On Thursday, loyalist forces in Guinea-Bissau launched a new
attack in the nearly deserted capital, muting the promise of peace
talks which disintegrated hours after being being proposed.
	   Gomes said the rebels would only negotiate through their own
chosen mediator, Senegalese opposition legislator Landing Sauname.
Gambian Foreign Minister Mohamed Sedat Jobe traveled to Bissau by
boat to act as a go-between for the warring factions.
	   Jobe met Wednesday with government officials who said they were
ready to enter into talks if the rebels laid down their weapons.
	   But in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro
published Thursday, Vieira said he would never agree to a proposal
to meet the mutineers.
	   ``If I'll negotiate with the mutineers on the French ship?
Never!'' the president was quoted as saying.
	   Vieira said the rebels were losing ground and repeated loyalists
boasts of having captured a military garrison where the rebellion
began on June 7.
	   The rebels said they had fallen back from their positions to buy
time to reorganize, but said they had not been hurt by approaching
Senegalese troops.
	   ``This situation is not alarming,'' Gomes said. ``We are
reinforcing and changing our tactics.''
	   The renegade soldiers have accused Vieira of corruption and
demand he step down.
	   ``This is not a coup d'etat, this is a military action for
justice,'' the rebel spokesman said in his broadcast. ``We are
against Vieira the person. We want him out and put before a
tribunal.''
	   Michael Kleiner, spokesman for the International Committee of
the Red Cross, said in Geneva that four large explosions were heard
from the direction of the airport Thursday morning.
	   Fighting seemed to have escalated. The periodic thud and crash
of heavy artillery fire could be heard in rural Guinea-Bissau from
across the border in Senegal.
	   A Senegalese commander said his forces were rushing heavy
weapons to the capital to reinforce loyalists.
	   In the capital, Guinea-Bissau government troops were bombarding
what they called final pockets of resistance.
	   ``The government operation is now focused on the airport where
the rebels are concentrated,'' Guinea-Bissau's Foreign Minister
Fernando Delfim da Silva told The Associated Press in Lisbon, where
he was stuck due to flight cancellations.
	   The rebels, who seized heavy weapons from the garrison's
arsenal, were dug into positions on high ground around the airport
about 10 kilometers (6 miles) out of the city, Delfim da Silva
said.
	   The U.N. food agency, the World Food Program, reported some
100,000 refugees near the town of Mansoa, about 60 kilometers (40
miles) from the capital. A Catholic mission put the number at
150,000.
	   Refugees attempting to cross the border into Senegal were turned
back by Senegalese troops who sealed the frontier on Wednesday.
	   Because of the fighting, Red Cross officials said they had only
been able to get aid to 30,000 of the estimated 200,000 displaced
Bissau residents. Many of the refugees were said to be in small
villages without food.

U.N. teams prepare ground for handover of rebel areas in Angola 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ United Nations officials Thursday headed
for the last remaining areas still held by the former rebel
movement UNITA, in an effort to secure compliance with next week's
deadline for the handover of these strongholds to the government.
	   The teams, accompanied by government representatives, left
Luanda at dawn to visit the four UNITA-controlled areas in the
interior of the country which are described by the U.N. as
``sensitive areas.''
	   Two of the towns are in Huambo province _ Mungo and Bailundo
where the UNITA leadership is based. The others are in Bie province
_ Nhaeria and Andulo where UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi lives.
	   All four lie about 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of
Luanda.
	   The U.N. envoy to Angola, Alioune Blondin Beye, gained approval
for the visits during a five-hour meeting with Savimbi on Tuesday.
	   Under Angola's 1994 peace accord, which ended a two-decade civil
war between the government and UNITA, the strongholds should
already have been returned to state control.
	   But lingering hostility between the former foes has stymied full
implementation of the pact in this vast southwest African country.
	   Savimbi has refused to move to the capital Luanda, saying he
fears for his safety there.
	   The U.N. Security Council last week decided to impose new
sanctions on UNITA, banning its diamond exports and freezing its
overseas bank accounts, unless it complies with all terms of the
1994 peace accord by June 23.
	   U.N. officials also claim UNITA is secretly retaining an armed
capability, despite the movement's denials, and say there is
worrying instability in eight of the countries 18 provinces due to
bandits. The government claims the bandits are UNITA troops.
	   A 1991 peace deal collapsed when UNITA _ the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola _ rejected its defeat in the
country's first-ever democratic elections in 1992 and returned to
the bush.

World Cup: Southgate struggles ahead of Romania match 
</HEADLINE>
By MORLEY MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ Central defender Gary Southgate faces a
race against the clock to recover from a nagging ankle injury
before England's second World Cup Group A match against Romania in
Toulouse on Monday.
	   The 27-year-old Aston Villa player emerged unscathed as England
opened its campaign in Marseille last Monday with a 2-0 victory
Tunisia, but injured himself during light training the following
day after falling awkwardly.
	   While the rest of the England squad enjoyed a rest day Thursday,
Southgate was receiving medical treatment alongside fellow defender
Tony Adams, team captain Alan Shearer and his striker partner Teddy
Sheringham.
	   Shearer and Adams, both suffering from blistered feet, were
excused training Tuesday and Wednesday, as was Sheringham who has a
slight hamstring strain.
	   ``It was a just a precautionary measure and all three will be
training tomorrow,'' England FA official Steve Double said.
	   But there is greater concern about Southgate and England's
assistant coach John Gorman says the defender will not be able to
train again until Saturday, the day before England leave for
Toulouse.
	   While the England camp is optimistic about Southgate's chances
of recovery in time for the match, recurring injuries are
particularly hazardous.
	   The Villa player was sidelined for nine matches after twisting
his ankle in a World Cup qualifier against Poland and aggravated
the injury again last November during a friendly international
against Cameroon.
	   But until Tuesday's mishap, Southgate seemed to have overcome
his ankle problem.
	   Although the prospects for Southgate look good, England manager
Glenn Hoddle has no problems finding strong replacements such as
Gary Neville or Martin Keown.
	   Neville has 27 caps under his belt and Keown is also an
experienced international with the additional advantage of
establishing a superb understanding with his Arsenal teammate
Adams.
	   Neville and Keown are justifiably keen to get into World Cup
action in France, but that doesn't match the rivalry which has
built up between Tottenham's Darren Anderton and Manchester
United's David Beckham.
	   Beckham, who played in all eight of England's World Cup
qualifiers, is still reacting badly after losing out to Anderton
for a midfield place in England's opening match against Tunisia.
	   He complained of being shocked and upset at Hoddle's decision.
	   ``At the time I was told it hurt and devastated. I had played in
every game leading up to the World Cup finals and to be told I not
in the side for the first game in France was really hard for me,''
he said. ``I still haven't got over being left out. I still haven't
come to terms with it. I was happy England got the result but not
being involved in the game was quite upsetting.''

Report: Swiss police fear racist propaganda boom 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's federal police force is
warning of a flood of racist propaganda into the country, according
to an internal report published Thursday.
	   ``Trade in far-right propaganda is booming,'' said the report,
extracts from which were published by the Swiss Jewish weekly
Israelitisches Wochenblatt.
	   Both distribution and seizures of such material rose markedly in
1997 on the previous year, it said.
	   The report identified the import of anti-Semitic, racist and
pro-Nazi recordings, for instance on CD-ROMs and film, as the
greatest problem.
	   Some 400 such recordings were seized in 45 police operations
last year, compared to eight operations in 1996, it said.
	   Much of the material was seized in border checks or in searches
connected to other investigations.
	   The Justice Ministry is looking for ways to close any legal
loopholes against racist material, spokesman Viktor Schlumpf said.
	   The police report singled out racist and anti-Semitic Internet
sites based outside Switzerland as particularly dangerous,
particularly for young people.
	   It expressed concern that Switzerland can do nothing about such
sites, which it said are based above all in the United States.
	   European countries are more thorough in prosecuting producers
and distributors of racist material, the report added.
	   No Swiss-based Internet site containing anti-Semitic material
has yet been found, the police said.

In Latvia, NATO Secretary General urges accommodation of Russian minority 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
Thursday urged Latvia to approve legal amendments easing
citizenship requirements for its large Russian minority, thus
easing tensions with Moscow.
	   Solana was on three-day tour of the former Soviet republics of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, all of which aspire to membership in
the Western military alliance.
	   At the end of his six-hour stop in the Latvian capital of Riga,
Solana said one issue he raised with Prime Minister Guntars Krasts
was citizenship for the Russian minority.
	   There are about 700,000 ethnic Russians in the country of 2.6
million, and many have failed to pass tough requirements for
citizenship. Moscow accuses Latvia of prejudice against the
Russians, most of whom moved to the Baltic country during is years
under Soviet rule. Russia has threatened sanctions over the
treatment.
	   Solana told the Baltic News Agency that Krasts said measures to
ease citizenship rules were being presented at special
Parliamentary session this month for final approval.
	   ``I hope they would be approved,'' Solana was quoted as saying.
	   While the citizenship issue alone might not be a stumbling bloc
to Latvian NATO membership, the small country fears that potential
conflicts with Moscow could make the alliance wary.
	   Moscow has already fiercely objected to any expansion of NATO
that would include the Baltic states on Russia's border.
	   Latvia's foreign ministry said Solana assured Latvian leaders
that NATO remained open to Baltic states membership, despite
Moscow's concerns.
	   Since gaining independence from Moscow in 1991, all three Baltic
states have made NATO-membership a top foreign policy goal, seeing
it a their best security guarantee. However, the militaries of all
three countries still fall short of NATO standards.
	   After leaving Latvia, Solana was making a stop in neutral
Finland before heading for Estonia, the last stop on his Baltic
tour.

Ukraine plans to use U.S. technology to store spent nuclear fuel 
</HEADLINE>
By MARINA SYSOYEVA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine is ready to begin using a new U.S.
technology to store spent fuel rods from nuclear power plants,
officials said Thursday.
	   The method, developed with the help of the U.S. Department of
Energy, answers Ukraine's dire need for an affordable method of
storing spent fuel, the officials said.
	   During Soviet times, spent fuel from Ukrainian nuclear power
plants was transported to Russia once every 3 to 5 years for
reprocessing and storage.
	   ``When Ukraine became an independent state, it had to transport
its spent fuel to Russia and pay ... five times more than it would
cost to store the fuel in our own temporary storage,'' said Oleh
Osheka, spokesman for the Zaporizhya power plant.
	   The 2 1/2-year effort involving the United States produced a
method by which uranium fuel assemblies are placed in sealed metal
baskets, which are backfilled with inert helium gas, welded shut,
and then placed in concrete casks where fuel can be stored for up
to 50 years.
	   ``Helping Ukraine become self-reliant in its storage of spent
fuel directly supports U.S. efforts to improve safety at
Soviet-designed reactor plants,'' said Mike McKinnon, fuel cycle
safety manager for the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a
Department of Energy contractor.
	   He said U.S. and Ukrainian experts worked together to develop a
method that was specifically tailored to the Zaporizhya plant.
	   Zaporizhya, Europe's largest nuclear plant, will be the first to
use the method, but nuclear authorities foresee all Ukrainian
atomic power plants eventually using similar storage containers.
	   The fuel, however, must later be transferred to a permanent
storage.
	   ``In 50 years, the fuel will be transported to Krasnoyarsk,
Russia, where a huge regional storage plant should be built by that
time,'' Osheka said. ``Otherwise, we would transfer it to our own
future plant.''
	   He said plants in southeastern Ukraine were prepared to start
production of the new technology and were only awaiting a
government license. Once that comes, production might begin within
several weeks, Osheka said.

Israel wants to keep Jerusalem's Arab population to 30 percent

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Openly acknowledging a quota system for the
first time, Israeli government planners said Thursday that an
overriding concern is to keep the Palestinian population of the
disputed city to no more than 30 percent.
	   The quota was described in a plan for Jerusalem's development
through 2020 submitted Thursday to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu by a special committee for Jerusalem.
	   Palestinian leaders denounced the guidelines.
	   ``This is a racist approach, part of the ethnic cleansing policy
Israel is implementing against Arabs in east Jerusalem,'' said Ziad
Abu Ziad, a member of the Palestinian legislative council from
Jerusalem.
	   Palestinians accuse Israel of trying to keep down the number of
Arab residents in the city by restricting building permits,
demolishing homes built without licenses, and revoking Arabs'
residency permits.
	   The future of Jerusalem is to be negotiated in talks on a
permanent Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement that have not yet
begun, but are to conclude by May 1999.
	   The Palestinians want to establish a capital in east Jerusalem,
captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel says
it will never relinquish sovereignty over all of the city.
	   According to city planners, 174,400 Palestinians and 417,000
Jews lived in the city at the end of 1995. The Palestinians made up
29.5 percent of the population, up from 25.8 percent in 1967.
	   Citing a higher birthrate among Palestinians and a growing
number of Jews leaving Jerusalem, the planners said that by 2020,
the Palestinians will make up 40 percent of the city's population,
unless the government intervenes.
	   Planners said a key development guideline was that ``The
relative size of the Jewish and non-Jewish populations in the city
should be maintained.''
	   If Jerusalem is to remain the united capital of Israel, ``It
will be necessary to aim for a target in which 70 percent of the
population will be Jews and 30 percent will be Arabs in 2020,'' the
report said.
	   The plan, which has been accepted in principle by Netanyahu,
calls for an expansion of Jerusalem's boundaries westward to
include the city's suburbs. The government would also invest
heavily in the city to create more jobs and build an additional
142,000 apartments to lure Jews back to Jerusalem.
	   Retired city officials have acknowledged in the past that an
unofficial quota of 28 percent Palestinians and 72 percent Jews has
served as the basis for all city master plans since 1967.
	   City officials on Thursday defended the quota, saying Jerusalem
is different from other cities because it is at the center of a
conflict between two peoples.
	   ``New York doesn't have a problem of some people trying to
separate from the city,'' said municipal spokesman Hagai Elias.
	   ``It's not a secret that the mayor's priority is to keep a
united Jerusalem, and if you don't have a Jewish majority, you
don't have a basis for that,'' Elias said.
	   On a related issue, the development plan said that 325,000
people lived in east Jerusalem, 48 percent of them Jews. This
appeared to be a change from just a few years ago when city
officials said the number of Jews living in the eastern sector was
slightly larger than the number of Palestinians.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nearly 15,000 World Cup tickets and hundreds of
thousands of dollars in cash have been stolen from the Paris office
of an American travel agency, police said Thursday.
	   The burglary happened overnight at the office of Prime Sport
International, said police officials, speaking on customary
anonymity.
	   They said one or two burglars had climbed the scaffolding
outside the office, and had smashed the safe as well as the door.
	   The cash stolen amounted to 2.4 million francs (about dlrs
400,000) and another 100,000 pounds (about dlrs 160,000) in British
currency, and 23,500 U.S. travelers checks, the amount of which
wasn't specified.
	   The burglars also took access badges to get into Saint-Denis
stadium in Paris.
	   France Info radio said the tour operator has been accused by
ticket-buyers of selling fake tickets.
	   The news came as France Telecom, the country's main telephone
company, was launching an investigation into a report that one of
its workers leaked a phone number that allowed thousands of World
Cup tickets to be bought unfairly.
	   The tickets were among the 170,000 sold by the World Cup
organizing committee, CFO, on a first-come, first-served basis from
April 22 through May 8.
	   The CFO switchboard was so swamped that most callers had to dial
more than 500 times before getting through. But a France Telecom
worker gave a friend a special number that allowed direct access to
the switchboard, said the daily Le Parisien.
	   The friend, named only as Frederic, then used the number to skip
the line and buy about 400 tickets. It was not known how widespread
the problem was.
	   ``We became aware of a possible problem today and we will look
into the situation immediately,'' said Estelle Rozine, a France
Telecom spokeswoman.
	   At a daily briefing, Bruno Travade, communications director for
the CFO, confirmed that a ``technical'' phone number existed in
addition to the main switchboard number _ but said that number
didn't correspond to the one published by the newspaper.
	   The CFO said it would file legal charges if necessary.
	   The revelations came a day after three people _ including the
president of the French affiliate of ISL Worldwide, FIFA's
exclusive marketing partner _ were arrested in a separate
investigation into ticket fraud.
	   The arrests Wednesday were a response to the 12,000 Japanese
fans who were left ticketless for the World Cup.
	   Among those arrested on charges of fraud were Marc Loison,
director general of ISL France, and Gilles Favard, a consultant to
ISL France.
	   ISL Worldwide, which has a minority stake in ISL France, said it
is conducting an audit of the French company's books.
	   Didier Porter, ISL France president, told France Info radio
Thursday that the company was being victimized and would file a
slander suit if allegations in the media continued.
	   ``People are looking for a guilty party, and ISL makes a
marvelous one,'' he said. ``The company never cashed in on a single
ticket.''
	   It was just the latest setback for organizers, who have been
harshly criticized for their ticket sales.
	   Critics have said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.6 million tickets
printed, more than 962,000 were earmarked for supporters in the
host country, while commercial partners snapped up 436,000.

World Cup: Brazilian team's new computer link fails test 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LESIGNY, France (AP) _ With pomp and champagne, the Brazilian
Soccer Confederation on Thursday proudly unveiled a new,
interactive computer linkup with the World Cup team.
	   There was just one snag. It didn't work.
	   As the crowd giggled, confederation executive Marco Antonio
Teixeira tried in vain to communicate with listeners in Paris, Rio
de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. But they apparently couldn't hear and
simply stared back blankly from the screen.
	   ``There seem to be some problems,'' Teixeira allowed.
	   He said the system is supposed to let Brazilian players keep in
touch with home through video, phone and computer keyboard.
Internet users can talk to the players at certain hours and see
images of their hotel in this secluded Paris suburb.
	   The glitch marred a promotional show announced at a surprise
press conference by confederation President Ricardo Teixeira. The
media raced to the team's hotel, but Teixeira never showed up.
Instead, the ``conference'' proved to be a publicity event for the
system's designers.
	   The first to speak was delegation chief Fabio Koff, via hookup
from the hotel a few yards away.
	   Then the link switched to Minneapolis, home of Digi
International. With some audio difficulty, an executive explained
that the company had spent three months designing the system that
cost nearly dlrs1 million.
	   But the call to Rio was a flop. Brazilians in the crowd
snickered _ the Rio phone company, Telerj, is so notoriously inept
there's even an ``I hate Telerj'' website on the Internet.
	   It was no better when the delegates tried to call Sao Paulo,
Brazil's largest and most populous city, or even Paris, where the
carrier is state-run France Telecom. The link switched back to Koff
for parting remarks, but the audio didn't work until his final
``Thank You.''
	   The humor of the media was not improved by the sweltering heat
of a rare warm day in Paris and the feeling that they had been
manipulated by the confederation.
	   ``Hello, Rio? Hello, Sao Paulo?'' laughed Wanderley Nogueira of
the Brazilian radio station Jovem Pan. ``I'm going to have some fun
with this.''

Defendant acquitted, but ordered to pay compensation anyway 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ In a murder case that some Norwegians
compare to the sensational O.J. Simpson trial, a man acquitted of
murdering his cousin was ordered Thursday to pay compensation to
her family anyway.
	   The day before, a jury ruled, on appeal, that there was
reasonable doubt the man, age 21, had murdered his 17-year-old
cousin, Birgitte Tengs, in May 1995. His name was withheld from
public disclosure in accordance with Norway's legal procedures.
	   However, the three-judge panel _ which has the authority to
uphold, reject or modify a jury's ruling _ ordered the penalty
compensation because it felt the man was probably guilty, as a
lower court found last year when it sentenced him to 14 years in
jail.
	   ``It is a clear likelihood that ... (the suspect) has committed
the crimes against Birgitte Tengs that he was accused of,'' the
panel stated in a unanimous ruling.
	   The court said a confession that the 21-year-old later recanted,
and other evidence, made it highly probable that he killed his
cousin in a rage after she rejected his sexual advances.
	   The earlier conviction was successfully appealed because of
defense claims that police used legally questionable interrogation
methods.
	   In the latest ruling, the panel ordered the defendant to pay
100,000 kronor (about 13,300 dollars) to his uncle and aunt for his
cousin's death. The lower court had required that, too, along with
the jail term.
	   News reports said it was the first time a Norwegian acquitted of
murder was then held economically liable for the crime.
	   ``We have a clear parallel in the United States in the Simpson
case, where the suspect was acquitted, but then had to pay
compensation,'' law professor Johs. Andenaes was quoted as telling
the Norwegian news agency NTB.
	   In 1994, football and movie celebrity O.J. Simpson's estranged
wife Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman, were
knifed to death outside her Brentwood, California, home. Simpson
was acquitted of murder but lost a civil judgment in which a jury
found him liable for the deaths and ordered him to pay a penalty
compensation of 33.5 million dollars.
	   The case was news around the world, at least partly because it
was covered so intensely in the United States.
	   In both cases, different rules of evidence apply, explained
Andenaes. In a criminal case, reasonable doubt is grounds for
acquital. In a civil case, the likelihood that a suspect committed
a crime may be sufficient to order compensation.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Smokers are more than twice as likely as people
who have never smoked to develop dementia and Alzheimer's disease,
a study published Friday suggests.
	   Results of other studies conflict on whether smoking increases
the risk of developing Alzheimer's or protects against it. But
scientists say the latest study by researchers at Erasmus
University in the Netherlands is important because it is the
largest to investigate the link and the first major project to have
evaluated people before they develop brain disease.
	   The study, published in this week's issue of The Lancet, a
British medical journal, followed 6,870 men and women aged 55 and
older living in a suburb of Rotterdam. It found that smokers were
2.2 times more likely to develop dementia of any kind and had a
risk for Alzheimer's disease that was 2.3 times higher than those
who had never smoked cigarettes.
	   Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia,
estimated to affect nearly 18 million people worldwide, or 3
percent of people over the age of 60, according to the
not-for-profit organization Alzheimer's Disease International.
	   Unlike previous studies, none of the people in the Rotterdam
study had dementia when first examined. They were asked about their
smoking habits and divided into smokers, former smokers and those
who had never smoked. Two years later, 146 of them had developed
dementia and 105 of those had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's
disease.
	   The study did not give the numbers affected in each group
because the older anyone is the higher is the risk of developing
dementia and giving raw figures for each of three groups would have
skewered the result, the researchers said.
	   Thus, the degree of risk was calculated by taking all factors
into accounts, including age, sex, education and alcohol intake
were taken into account in calculating the risk.
	   Within a random sample of the whole group, the researchers also
examined the effect of smoking on people who carried a gene
believed to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. They found
that despite the overall result that smoking doubled the risk of
developing the degenerative disease, smokers who carried the gene
actually were no more likely to develop the disease than
nonsmokers.
	   But smokers who did not carry the gene were found to be four
times more likely to develop the disease than nonsmokers, the study
said.
	   ``It seems that if you have the gene, you're better off if you
smoke,'' said Dr. Monique Breteler, who headed the research.
	   Dr. Anthony Mann, an old-age psychiatrist and professor of
epidemiology at the Institute of Psychiatry in London, called the
study's results ``powerful.''
	   ``They are the first to do a prospective study and it's the
largest to show a positive link,'' Mann said. ``It's the best we've
had.''
	   Scienctists are unsure exactly how smoking might contribute to
Alzheimer's.

Gold objects seized from Jews handed over to Trieste Jews 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A score of personal items seized from Jews in the
northern Italian city of Trieste by the Nazis were returned
Thursday to the Jewish community there.
	   The objects include pocket watches, cosmetic compacts,
gold-rimmed eyeglasses and silver-handled letter openers.
	   Nazi occupiers looted them from Jewish households in Trieste and
took them to Austria during World War II. The Allies sent the
property back to Trieste in 1954, but few claimants stepped forward
immediately.
	   Two-thirds of Trieste's 4,000 Jews disappeared during the war _
many were killed and others immigrated to the United States.
	   Last year the mementos were transferred from the vaults of a
local bank to the Treasury department, which promised to hand them
over to Trieste Jewish leaders.
	   The objects may eventually go on display in Italy and abroad.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. stocks were trading little changed Thursday
morning as European markets fell amid skepticism about Asia's
economic prospects, despite a rally in Asian stocks after central
bank intervention yanked the Japanese yen out of its doldrums.
	   ``The problems haven't been solved yet,'' said Jeremy Batstone,
a strategist at NatWest Stockbrokers in London.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto acknowledged as much,
saying in a news conference that Japan's troubled economy will get
back on track with help from a government stimulus plan.
	   Hashimoto also pledged to come up with a plan to solve the bad
loan crisis at Japan's banks.
	   ``Japan has fallen into a state of excessive lack of
confidence,'' Hashimoto said, just before he planned to meet with a
delegation of U.S. finance officials. ``These are very hard
times.''
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.97 points at
8,819.49 in early trading.
	   Shares initially rose modestly on the London Stock Exchange,
Europe's biggest equity market, but the blue-chip Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index reversed course into negative
territory.
	   The so-called ``footsie'' was down by 61.6 points, or 1 percent,
at 5,771.1 by mid-afternoon.
	   The pattern was similar across continental Europe. Big markets
in Paris and Frankfurt showed losses in the afternoon _ as did
smaller ones in Milan, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Zurich.
	   The sober dealings in the United States and Europe marked a
blunt contrast to Asia's euphoria. Asian traders pushed the
blue-chip Nikkei index in Tokyo up by 4.4 percent, and smaller
Asian markets showed even bigger gains.
	   ``The signs are that the Asian crisis is slowly coming under
control, and the initial fears have diminished,'' said Guenter
Burgold, a dealer at BHF Bank in Frankfurt. ``But intervention in
the past has always proven to be grasping at straws. The skepticism
remains.''
	   The U.S. and Japanese central banks intervened on Wednesday to
prop up the yen, which has suffered a recent sharp decline against
the dollar. A rally on Wall Street helped fuel the buying frenzy in
Asia.
	   ``This is exactly the type of thing that should happen,'' said
Jean-Michel Severino, a senior World Bank official.
	   Others were less optimistic.
	   ``This is definitely not a turning point in the crisis,'' said
Carlton Poon, head of research for Worldsec International Ltd. in
Hong Kong. ``The fundamentals in Asia continue to deteriorate,''
and the markets cannot sustain the gains.
	   On European currency markets early Thursday, the U.S. dollar
bought 136.91 yen _ roughly five yen less than the greenback was
worth late Wednesday in Tokyo.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average
jumped 646.16 points, or 4.39 percent, closing at 15,361.54.
	   Throughout Asia, other markets showed huge gains, with key
indices up by 6.4 percent in Hong Kong, 8.1 percent in Bangkok, 6.6
percent in Manila, 7.1 percent in Seoul and 5 percent in Jakarta.

U.N. teams prepare ground for handover of rebel areas in Angola 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ United Nations officials headed Thursday
for the last remaining areas still held by the former rebel
movement UNITA in an effort to secure compliance with next week's
deadline for the handover of these strongholds to the government.
	   The teams, accompanied by government representatives, left
Luanda at dawn to visit the four UNITA-controlled areas in the
interior of the country described by the United Nations as
``sensitive areas.''
	   Two of the towns are in Huambo province _ Mungo and Bailundo
where the UNITA leadership is based. The others are in Bie province
_ Nhaeria and Andulo where UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi lives. All
four lie about 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of Luanda.
	   The U.N. envoy to Angola, Alioune Blondin Beye, gained approval
for the visits during a five-hour meeting Tuesday with Savimbi.
	   Under Angola's 1994 peace accord, which ended a two-decade civil
war, the strongholds should already have been returned to state
control. But lingering hostility has stymied full implementation of
the pact in this former Portuguese colony in southwest African.
	   Savimbi has refused to move to the capital Luanda, saying he
fears for his safety.
	   The U.N. Security Council last week decided to impose new
sanctions on UNITA, banning its diamond exports and freezing its
overseas bank accounts, unless it complies with all terms of the
1994 peace accord by June 23.
	   U.N. officials also claim UNITA is secretly retaining an armed
capability, despite the movement's denials, and say there is
instability in eight of the countries' 18 provinces because of
bandits. The government claims the bandits are UNITA troops.
	   A 1991 peace deal collapsed when UNITA _ the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola _ rejected its defeat in the
country's first-ever democratic elections in 1992 and returned to
the bush.

World Cup: Norway unbeaten in 16 games but disappointed AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ They're unbeaten in their last 16
matches, including two in the World Cup.
	   Still, the Norwegians are disappointed after two Group A draws
with Morocco and Scotland that left them in a must-win situation
against defending world champion Brazil next week to avoid an early
trip home to Oslo.
	   Norway's long-ball style, so successful during an unbeaten
qualifying campaign, just has not been working.
	   Perhaps it's too predictable for the other teams and not good
for the World Cup finals.
	   ``It's possible, but I can't really find any reason why,'' said
Dan Eggen, the tall defender whose header earned Norway a 2-2 draw
against Morocco.
	   ``This is the second world championship that we're not doing as
well as we thought we were going to do. I can't really find any
explanation for it,'' he said.
	   Were the Norwegians perhaps overconfident going into the
tournament after beating fellow Cup sides Denmark, Mexico and Saudi
Arabia by a whopping 13-2 and reaching fourth place on FIFA's
rankings?
	   ``There's always a danger you become bigger than you actually
are because of training game results,'' Eggen said. ``We played
against teams that were not very good ... we got some easy wins
compared to the games here.''
	   The Norwegians returned to their training camp at
Saint-Andre-des-Eaux near this Atlantic coast resort for their
first training session Thursday after a 1-1 draw with Scotland in
Bordeaux.
	   After three weeks in training camp, the players looked forward
to meeting their wifes and girlfriends later Thursday.
	   ``It's the ladies evening, they decide what will happen this
time,'' said goalkeeper Frode Grodas before having dinner with his
wife Maria.
	   The Norwegians may be disappointed with only two points from two
games, but another positive thing is that all 22 players on the
squad are healthy.
	   On Tuesday, it's do or die in Marseille against Brazil. While
Norway will be trying to avenge its poor showing so far, Brazil
will be trying for revenge after losing a friendly in Oslo 4-2 a
year ago.
	   ``That (result) doesn't mean anything,'' said Stig Inge
Bjornebye, the Liverpool defender. ``It's a new game and it's a
totally different scene.''
	   ``But Brazil is not unbeatable ... we have to play very well, be
strong in the defense, attack well and create chances and keep
Ronaldo and players like him away from dangerous situations.''
	   Norwegian coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen has been criticized for
his team's style despite its impressive record.
	   ``I'm expecting negative criticism, but perhaps it will turn
even worse after the Brazil game,'' he said.

Thousands strike, hundreds clash with police to protest Puerto Rico telephone sale

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Riot police clashed with telephone
workers who went on strike Thursday to protest the dlrs 1.9 billion
sale of a controlling stake in the state-owned telephone company.
	   One demonstrator was arrested for allegedly assaulting a police
officer, said police Chief Pedro Toledo.
	   Some 6,400 unionized Puerto Rico Telephone Company employees
walked off the job, fearing layoffs once private investors, led by
telecommunications giant GTE Corporation, buy 50 percent plus one
share of the company.
	   The sale is the centerpiece of Gov. Pedro Rossello's
privatization program and must be approved by the legislature.
Senators were expected to vote Thursday.
	   Police shoved protesters and struck some with batons when
hundreds of workers on the picket line tried to block access to
company headquarters in San Juan. Hundreds more strikers
demonstrated at company offices throughout this Caribbean island.
	   Company president Carmen Ana Culpeper warned that lines might be
vandalized. During a work stoppage in October, hundreds of
customers on the island temporarily lost telephone service because
of severed fiber-optic cables.

Greenpeace intercepts Israeli ship dumping waste in Mediterranean 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Greenpeace activists intercepted an Israeli
ship dumping toxic sludge into international waters in the
Mediterranean, the organization said Thursday.
	   An Israeli government spokesman confirmed the report and said
the dumping would end by the end of the year.
	   Israeli Greenpeace representative Ofer Ben-Dov called the
pollution ``an insult to all the people living in the region,
especially Cyprus, Egypt and Lebanon.''
	   Ben-Dov said the ship dumped highly acidic materials which
contained heavy metals such as zinc, cadmium and mercury.
	   The environmental organization said it chartered a ship from
Cyprus on Sunday and lay in waiting for the Israeli ship
``Aribel,'' which arrived Tuesday night at the dumping site.
	   Yiftah Kramer, a spokesman for the Israeli ministry of the
environment said damage from the toxic waste was restricted to the
precise location where the sludge was dropped and did not affect
the surrounding sea.
	   ``We have the area checked regularly by the Israel Oceanographic
Institute, which is just as concerned for the environment as
Greenpeace, and the institute found that there is no damage to the
surroundings,'' Kramer said.
	   Greenpeace said the Israeli government had allowed the
U.S.-owned Haifa Chemicals to dump another 60,000 tons of toxic
sludge in the Mediterranean until October.
	   But Haifa Chemicals spokesman Eitan Levinstein said the dumping
would continue until the completion of the company's new waste
treatment plant which may be as late as December.

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices further slipped, but turnover
increased slightly on the stock market this week, a market report
said Thursday.
	   Brokers attributed the sluggish activity to the political
uncertainty, namely the deadlocked Mideast peace talks, and
shortage of cash currency in the hands of investors.
	   The market report, reflecting activity for five business days
ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share prices index
declined by 0.44 percent to 171.6 points.
	   Shares of industrial firms dropped by 2.18 percent, services
sector by 0.65 percent, insurance sector by 0.62 percent, while
commercial banks shares nudged up by 0.38 percent.
	   Turnover slightly increased by 8.3 percent to 5.2 million dinars
(dlrs 7.3 million), due to selling shares of profitable banks.
	   The report said stocks of 98 companies were traded during the
week.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The average annual yield on 91-day Egyptian
treasury bills rose 0.002 of a percentage point to 8.82 percent in
latest auction, the Central Bank reported Thursday.
	   The government sold 1.1 billion Egyptian pounds (dlrs 323.5
million) of the bills Wednesday, at yields ranging from 8.6 to
8.855 percent.
	   The government received 84 bids totaling 1.25 billion (dlrs
367.4 million), at yields ranging from 8.6 percent to 10.099
percent. The government accepted 71 bids. The average annual yield
on 91-day treasury bills sold at auction June 10 was 8.818 percent.

Britain gives muted welcome mixed with digust to au pair's return 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs; UPDATES with new comment, detail throughout
By AUDREY WOODS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Vowing to clear her name, Louise Woodward
returned home Thursday to muted celebration in her hometown village
and increasing grumbling nationwide about the heroine's status some
awarded the woman convicted of killing an infant boy.
	   The tabloid Mirror took it to extremes with the headline ``First
Class Baby Killer,'' referring to the former au pair's mode of
airline flight from the United States.
	   But ordinary citizens, too, expressed reservations about her
celebrity status coming at a dreadful price.
	   One caller in a Sky-TV phone-in labeled the hoopla ``absolutely
disgusting,'' and others noted that no matter what view people
might hold of the 20-year-old's guilt or innocence, the death of
8-month-old Matthew Eappen should not be overshadowed.
	   Ms. Woodward herself, in her first public comment since
November, also mentioned the loss of the child entrusted to her
care.
	   ``I feel great sorrow for the death of baby Matthew,'' she said,
nervously facing hordes of reporters at a news conference at nearby
Manchester Airport. ``But like I've said time and time again, I had
nothing to do with his death.''
	   In the north England village of Elton, yellow ribbons fluttered
from trees and lampposts and residents expressed great joy, but
there was little outward celebration on the mostly deserted
streets.
	   Citizens remembered all too well the criticism that rained down
after their raucous champagne celebration when a Massachussets
judge freed Ms. Woodward in November.
	   It all contrasted with the overwhelmingly enthusiastic support
offered Ms. Woodward after her conviction in October, when most
national newspapers waged campaigns to win her freedom and 93
percent of the respondents to a Sky poll said her trial was unfair.
	   Many newspapers did not even mention her impending return on
their front pages Thursday.
	   Ms. Woodward's arrival back in Britain followed Tuesday's ruling
by a Massachusetts high court that a lower-court judge acted within
his power when he reduced her second-degree murder conviction to
manslaughter and sentenced her to the 279 days she had served since
her arrest.
	   At her news conference, the former au pair said she did not
receive a fair trial and predicted she eventually would be cleared
of killing young Matthew by violently shaking him and slamming his
head against a hard surface. He died Feb. 9, 1997.
	   In Elton, members of the Justice for Louise campaign committee
said the low-key nature of Ms. Woodward's homecoming after two
years did not signify any weakening of the community's support.
	   ``It's been a privilege to have been able to help an innocent
girl,'' committee member Christine Gray said. ``Everybody just felt
the family should be allowed to come home in a dignified manner.''
	   ``I think the bad press made them all keep quiet now,'' Irene
Williams said of her fellow residents.
	   Gwyn Hamilton, a 16-year-old supporter, said some residents had
grown envious of the celebrity status Ms. Woodward and her family
had received. ``They're sorting out the people who really supported
her and the people who went along for the ride,'' he said.
	   Jean Jones, a committee co-founder who recently quit, would not
speak to reporters Thursday. Mrs. Jones had contended that Ms.
Woodward's mother, Sue, used a defense fund containing thousands of
pounds (dollars) as a private stash and that the family was
generally ungrateful for all the support.
	   British Airways spokeswoman Kate Gay confirmed that the defense
fund had paid for the one-way, first-class Boston-London tickets
for Ms. Woodward and her father, Gary. Ms. Gay would not disclose
the price, but such tickets generally cost about dlrs 4,400 each.
	   Ms. Woodward still faces a wrongful death lawsuit filed by
Matthew Eappen's parents.
	   U.S. District Judge William Young barred her temporarily from
spending any sales proceeds from her story and set a trial date of
Oct. 5 in that suit. The former au pair vehemently denied Thursday
that she has any plans to sell her story.
	   Elton resident Anne Hatfield, who supports the au pair, said it
was perhaps inevitable that some people would turn on Ms. Woodward.
	   ``I hope she does clear her name but sadly, a little boy has
lost his life, which we can't get away from,'' Ms. Hatfield said.
	   ``Those that think she's done it are going to be really
vicious,'' she said. ``And those that are for her are really
campaigning for her. There will be a small element _ there always
is, isn't there? _ who are doubtful.''

World Cup: Mexico prepares for Belgium, attacks reporters 
</HEADLINE>
By MARCOS ALEMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NANGIS, France (AP) _ While his players readied a game plan for
their match against Belgium, Mexico's head coach Manuel Lapuente
ordered his security team to go on the offensive _ against
reporters who got too close to the practice field.
	   Toward the end of Thursday's closed practice, members of the
Mexican security team confronted the reporters outside the stadium
and confiscated several rolls of film. Several French policemen
stood nearby but did not intervene.
	   The Mexican security detail said it was carrying on Lapuente's
orders and took the reporters' and photographers' notes and film.
Rafael Ramos, reporter for the Spanish daily La Opinion, of Los
Angeles, resisted, but had his notes taken anyway.
	   They also confiscated film from a photographer who had shot
several frames of the incident.
	   ``We're only carrying out Mr. Lapuente's orders. The practice is
closed and he doesn't want any reporters nearby,'' said one of the
Mexican security men, who did not identify himself.
	   Stung by criticism about Mexico's poor performance in the run-up
to the World Cup, Lapuente has closed all practices, including
Thursday's two-hour session. Mexico leads Group E with three points
after beating South Korea 3-1 in their opener, and faces Belgium
Saturday in Bordeaux.
	   Belgium held group favorite Netherlands to a scoreless tie in
their opener. The Dutch meet Croatia in Nantes, also on Saturday.
	   Before the guards showed up, the reporters could see defender
Salvador Carmona taking charge on the left side, in place of
Braulio Luna, who started the first game.
	   Mexico finished the practice match with four defenders, three
midfielders and three attackers. The goalkeeper will be Jorge
Campos.

Tajikistan revokes proposed ban on religious parties 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ The government agreed Thursday to
revoke a provision of a bill that would have banned
religiously-based political parties.
	   President Emomali Rakhmonov, parliament, and opposition leaders
all agreed to the new version, which would only prevent such
parties from holding meetings on religious premises, said Rakhmonov
spokesman Zafar Saidov.
	   Tajikistan, which suffered through a five-year civil war and
borders on Afghanistan, is one of several countries in Central Asia
that fears the growth of Islamic political movements.
	   The original version of the bill would have banned religious
parties altogether. It was passed by parliament May 23, shortly
after Rakhmonov had warned that Islamic fundamentalism poses a
``serious threat'' in the region.
	   The United Tajik Opposition protested the bill, since its
largest member, the Islamic Revival Party, would presumably be
banned.
	   United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan also protested the
proposed legislation, saying it could undermine the 1997 peace
accord between the government and the largely Muslim opposition.
	   Under such pressure, Rakhmonov vetoed the bill and sent a new
version to parliament.
	   ``Today this political crisis has been solved,'' said Saidov,
the presidential spokesman.

World Cup: FIFA suspends Cameroon defender for two matches 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Cameroon defender Raymond Kalla Nkongo was
suspended from the World Cup for two games for ``serious foul
play'' against Italy, FIFA announced Thursday.
	   The decision means Kalla is banned from playing in next
Tuesday's Chile-Cameroon game and the first game of the second
round, if the Indomitable Lions advance.
	   Just before the end of the first half of Wednesday's
Cameroon-Italy match, Luigi Di Biagio made a tackle on Kalla.
Kalla, who was on a full run, couldn't stop and went feet first
into Di Biagio.
	   Australian referee Edward Lennie immediately pulled out the red
card for Kalla.
	   Di Biagio, taken off on a stretcher, returned before the first
half was over to the jeers of fans.
	   As the players walked off the field at halftime, Di Biagio
lifted his right shorts leg to show his injury to Cameroon player
Jacques Songo'o and coach Claude Leroy, as if trying to vindicate
the referee's decision.

World Cup: Croatian star seizes ``last chance'' at World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Robert Prosinecki's gifts as a playmaker
have often been eclipsed by injuries and clashes with his coaches,
but this World Cup is a showcase for the Croatian's
better-late-than-never comeback.
	   Prosinecki knows it's probably the swan song for a talented crop
of players who have known each other since winning the 1987 world
youth championship with Yugoslavia.
	   ``We are all around 30 now and this is the last chance for our
generation to something big,'' he said Thursday.
	   Renowned for his skill and imagination with the ball, the
midfielder might never have gotten this far had he listened to the
coach who pronounced the 18-year-old hopeful untalented and threw
him off the Dinamo Zagreb team.
	   Prosinecki, who is of mixed Serb-Croatian parentage, set out to
prove the doubters wrong. He went to archrival Red Star Belgrade,
played for Yugoslavia in the 1990 World Cup and led the club from
the Serbian capital to the 1991 European Champions' Cup.
	   With Yugoslavia breaking up in war, Prosinecki landed a dlrs 15
million contract with Real Madrid. But injuries hampered his stint
at the famed club and he left in 1994, playing for three other
Spanish clubs in as many seasons. At Barcelona, he notably fell out
with coach Johan Cruyff.
	   Ultimately, the sensitive Prosinecki got homesick. Returning
last year as an international star to Croatia Zagreb, the renamed
Dinamo, lifted his spirits. He won the league title and the cup
with the team this year.
	   ``I was away too long,'' he said. ``I'm happy to be back home.''
	   His artful goal against Jamaica on Sunday _ a lob over the
goalkeeper from a tight angle _ was an ideal start in Croatia's
World Cup debut.
	   It helped gave confidence to a seasoned team with great
potential that includes AC Milan midfielder Zvonimir Boban _
another veteran of the 1987 Yugoslav youth team _ and foreign-based
strikers Davor Suker and Mario Stanic.
	   Ironically, the man who once booted Prosinecki out of Dinamo now
is Croatia's coach.
	   Miroslav Blazevic smiles and admits he made a mistake back then.
Prosinecki says he holds no grudge against Blazevic.
	   ``The most important thing is for me to be in form for the
benefit of the team,'' he said.
	   For the blond playmaker, that means distributing balls out of
Croatia's strong midfield as well as surging forward to target the
goal.
	   He's not about to let Japan, Croatia's next opponent, block the
way into the second round.
	   ``If all of us play according to our potential, we won't have
any problem,'' Prosinecki said.

Netanyahu: Israel is considering referendum on West Bank pullback efforts to upgrade observer status at United Nations 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quote from Palestinian planning minister on PLO's
By KARIN LAUB
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday
he is looking into ways of holding a referendum on a West Bank
troop withdrawal, a step that would further delay a pullback, but
effectively silence those trying to prevent it.
	   Netanyahu and Palestinian officials, meanwhile, traded
accusations over the PLO's efforts to upgrade its observer status
in the United Nations.
	   Netanyahu claimed that the campaign violated the peace
agreements by presuming eventual Palestinian statehood and that
granting the PLO ``near-state'' status at the United Nations would
be a ``fatal blow'' to peacemaking that Israel might counter by
annexing parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath denied there was a
violation, saying that in the peace agreements, Israel had
recognized the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people.
``Israel has no right to interfere,'' he said.
	   Addressing another sensitive issue, Netanyahu pledged to begin
construction soon on 6,500 homes for Jews in traditionally Arab
east Jerusalem. The Palestinians hope to set up a future capital in
the city's eastern sector and suspended negotiations with Israel in
March 1997 after ground was broken for the project.

Three British nationals arrested in Jamaica on drug charges 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaican Defense Force officers
intercepted a yacht carrying more than a ton of marijuana and
charged three British nationals with possession and trafficking.
	   Lee Potter, 32, of Manchester; Sean Pearson, 30, of Keysham; and
Dean Blakely, 27, of Portsmouth, could face at least three years in
prison if convicted. A court hearing was expected later this month.
	   The three were arrested Sunday on the yacht Windchild off
eastern Morant Cays, police said Wednesday. Officers found 1,825
kilograms (4,015 pounds) of marijuana on the yacht, which was
registered in Bermuda.

World Cup: Denmark close in on second round, lead 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Brian Laudrup set up Allan Nielsen for
one goal and nearly scored another himself to help Denmark to a 1-0
halftime lead over South Africa on Thursday, putting it within 45
minutes of almost certain advancement to the second round of the
World Cup.
	   Nielsen volleyed Laudrup's cross at the far post in the 13th
minute, deflecting it in off goalkeeper Hans Vonk's hand.
	   A victory by Denmark would give it six points, and either a draw
or victory by France over Saudi Arabia Thursday night would ensure
its place in the final 16.
	   Looking to help his country into the second round, Crown Prince
Frederik, heir to the Danish throne and oldest son of Queen
Margrethe II, was among the crowd at Stade Municipal.
	   South Africa, conversely, needed a victory just to avoid
elimination.
	   Realizing the urgency for victory, Bafana Bafana coach Philippe
Troussier inserted offensive midfielder Halman Mkhalele in place of
Willem Jackson, a defensive midfielder.
	   Mkhalele got off South Africa's first shot, but it was took more
than eight minutes, came from outside the penalty area and was
easily handled by Danish keeper Peter Schmeichel.
	   Otherwise, it was nearly all the Danes, who hit the post twice
in the first 45 minutes.
	   Denmark came within centimeters of a second goal on a corner by
Martin Jorgensen, whose in-bending kick floated over Vonk and
banged off the far post.
	   The rebound came to Laudrup, who put a diving header from six
meters into the stomach of a sprawled Vonk.
	   Denmark hit the same post again in the 42nd when Ebbe Sand
ripped a right-footed shot from the top of the penalty area.
	   South Africa's best chance came in the 28th minute when Mkhalele
sent in a rolling cross off a busted play through the goal box, but
an onrushing Benny McCarthy couldn't get his foot to it to poke it
in.
	   The South Africans also failed to finish on a loose ball in the
penalty are in the 22nd when Piere Issa's one shot was blocked
before Jorgensen was able to dribble it out of danger.

Christie prepared to be tested any time 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Olympic 100-meter champion Linford Christie
said he was prepared to be tested for drugs anywhere, any time, as
his libel case continued in the High Court Thursday.
	   Christie is suing convicted robber turned author John McVicar
over an article ``How did Linford get this good?'', which appeared
in the now defunct magazine, Spiked, in September 1995.
	   The article suggested that Christie used performance-enhancing
drugs.
	   McVicar is conducting his own defense after discharging his
lawyer David Price.
	   During cross-examination by McVicar, Christie said when he died
he would be willing to donate his body to science so it could be
proved once and for all his body had never been tainted by drugs.
	   Christie, the 1992 Barcelona 100-meter gold medalist and 1995
world champion, said it had always been his view that any athlete
caught using drugs should be banned for life.
	   He said he was angered at being given the ``benefit of the
doubt'' at the Seoul Olympics in 1988 after drug testers found tiny
traces of a banned substance in his urine sample.
	   ``At the time I went hysterical. I knew I didn't take any
steroids,'' he said ``I told the team manager about the ginseng I
had taken, and that I was one of the great supporters of no drugs
in the sport.''
	   The Olympic authorities did not disqualify him but issued a
warning about products containing ginseng, a legal health
supplement.
	   ``I was rather annoyed at being given the benefit of the doubt _
that wasn't good enough,'' he said. ``You are either guilty or not
guilty.''
	   McVicar drew comparisons between Christie and disgraced Canadian
sprinter Ben Johnson.
	   The court heard that Christie had cried when Johnson tested
positive at the Seoul Olympics in 1988 because he had never thought
he took drugs and was ``such a nice guy.''
	   Christie said the testing process proved Johnson was a failure
and no comparisons could be made between them.
	   He said Johnson was physically nothing like him.
	   ``He didn't have the same musculature as me. I was in better
shape than him. I trained harder than him,'' he said. ``Ben had a
beer-gut. He's a short, stocky person.''
	   The hearing was adjourned until Friday when McVicar will
continue his cross-examination.

World Cup: Austria, the day after - did Chile score or not? 
</HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARGAUX, France (AP) _ The game is long played, but for some,
the question remains. Did the ball really cross the goal line?
	   The Austrians should be happy with their 1-1 draw against Chile.
After all, it looked like a 0-1 loss until the last minute of
injury time, when midfielder Ivica Vastic got the equalizer.
	   Still, at least one player thinks it should be 2-0 for Austria.
Goal keeper Michael Konsel does not agree with referee Gamal
Ghandour's call that made it 1-0 in the 70th minute Wednesday, when
Marcelo Salas connected on a wild ball six meters away from the
Austrian goal.
	   ``The ball was in a little bit but not completely over the
line,'' Konsel said Thursday. He said footage by Austrian state
television backs up his assertion.
	   Austria coach Herbert Prohaska tried to defuse the controversy.
	   ``The ball looked seven eights behind the line, he said adding:
``In any case, the referee had to decide quickly.''
	   And maybe the goal had its positive side, Prohaska said,
suggesting it helped focus the team and lead to the tying effort by
Vastic.
	   ``Who knows if we would have played as strongly to the front
without that goal,'' he told the Austria Press Agency.
	   The last-minute goal and draw was the second in two games for
Austria. A week ago, it was striker Anton Polster's goal in injury
time that made it 1-1 against Cameroon.
	   For some, almost more than a coincidence. Midfielder Heimo
Pfeifenberger suggested God was an Austria fan, saying: ``Maybe He
has plans for us here.''

Gunmen storm governor's house, kill 12 bodyguards and a civilian 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The governor of a southwest Sudanese
province says he survived an attack on his house in which 12
bodyguards and a civilian were shot dead.
	   In a statement published in newspapers Thursday, Kuay Makwaj,
governor of Bahr el-Ghazal state, said gunmen stormed his house in
Aweil on Tuesday. They shot his bodyguards and a civilian.
	   Makwaj did not explain how he escaped unharmed, nor did he
provide other details.
	   Aweil is 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) southwest of Sudan's
capital, Khartoum, and 150 kilometers (93 miles) northwest of Bahr
el-Ghazal's capital, Wau.
	   The commander of pro-government forces in the state, Atier
Benjamin, said rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army carried
out the attack, the newspaper Akhbar al-Youm said.
	   In January, the SPLA mounted a major offensive against Wau and
claimed to have captured the town. The government denied the claim,
but cut off aid flights to Wau.
	   The flights have now resumed. Relief agencies have estimated
that nearly 380,000 people in Bahr el-Ghazal are short of food
because of the fighting.
	   The rebels, who draw their support from the south's mainly
Christian and animist population, have fought since 1983 for
autonomy from the Islamic north. An estimated 1.5 million people
have died in the fighting and ensuing famines.

Need tickets? Call Frederic UPDATED with Denmark-South Africa and France-Saudi Arabia; CHANGES byline AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Thursday's developments; WILL be
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Need World Cup tickets?
	   If so, it's just a matter of knowing the right person.
	   The Paris office of an American travel agency discovered
Thursday morning that, during the night, someone climbed the
scaffolding outside its building, got inside, broke into the safe
and stole nearly 15,000 tickets and hundreds of thousands of
dollars in cash.
	   In addition to the tickets, the burglars also took access badges
to get into Saint-Denis stadium in Paris. No arrests have been
made.
	   Wayward tickets and absent tickets have been a concern for
organizers since the World Cup began last week. An international
ticket fraud scandal has led to three arrests, and on Thursday
organizers asked France Telecom to launch an investigation into
reports that a confidential phone number allowed thousands to
unfairly buy huge numbers of tickets.
	   The daily Le Parisien reported that a special phone number _
leaked within France Telecom _ gave privileged callers direct
access to the central switchboard handling ticket sales. The paper
cited a person identified only as Frederic, a communications
student, who used the number to snap up more than 400 tickets.
	   An estimated 12,000 Japanese fans have been left ticketless by
the ticket fraud scandal, but there was no word as to whether
Frederic or the travel agency burglars were getting together with
any of the disgruntled visitors from Tokyo.
	   There were plenty of tickets used Thursday, as France played
Saudi Arabia at Saint-Denis and South Africa faced Denmark in
Toulouse. Denmark and France both had chances to clinch second
round berths in Group C.
	   Colombia doesn't play again until Monday, and there is suspense
at to whether temperamental striker Faustino Asprilla will be back
with the team by then.
	   With tears in his eyes, Asprilla apologized Thursday for
comments that led to his dismissal from Colombia's World Cup team
and asked for a second chance.
	   ``I want to offer my apologies to the president (of the
Colombian Soccer Federation), his executive committee, the head
coach, my teammates, and, of course, the Colombian people,''
Asprilla said, reading a prepared statement.
	   Asprilla was kicked off the team after saying that coach Hernan
Dario Gomez ``disrespected'' him when he took him out of Colombia's
1-0 loss to Romania on Monday with five minutes remaining. The
furor has caught the attention of Colombian President Ernesto
Samper, who has also tried to persuade Gomez to reconsider his
decision.
	   ``If our head coach considers my being here important, I'm
willing to follow, enthusiastically and with discipline, all World
Cup rules, as I've always done,'' Asprilla said.
	   Gomez said he's studying the situation, but admitted he ``liked
what Faustino had to say.''
	   ``But I don't know what the decision will be,'' Gomez said.
``The truth is, those are nice words by Faustino.''
	   Meanwhile, in Marseille, where three days of fans violence
surrounded Monday's England-Tunisia game, authorities planned
increased security for Saturday's match between the Netherlands and
South Korea.
	   Some 2,000 regular police will be on weekend duty, along with
some 200 Anti-Criminal Brigade forces patrolling the city center.
Riot police also will be posted about town.
	   But, under pressure from cafe owners, authorities relented on a
weekend alcohol ban in Marseille and agreed to allow drinks to be
sold until midnight.

New twist in property fight: Belarus says diplomats can `visit' their homes 
</HEADLINE>
By MARINA BABKINA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The government said Thursday that foreign
ambassadors will henceforth be considered visitors in their own
homes, giving a strange new twist to their fight to keep diplomatic
residences.
	   The government had previously tried to evict ambassadors from
the United States, Germany, Italy, India and other countries,
claiming their wooded compound was badly in need of sewer and
plumbing repairs.
	   When the ambassadors refused, saying the order violated the
Vienna Convention on embassy affairs, the government eventually
backed down, agreeing Wednesday that they could stay.
	   But at the same time, President Alexander Lukashenko claimed
that the diplomatic residences were presidential property. His own
residence is adjacent to the diplomatic neighborhood in Drozdy, on
the outskirts of the capital.
	   That led to Thursday's announcement by Deputy Foreign Minister
Nikolai Buzo. Referring to the ambassadors, he said, ``Today they
reside on the territory of the presidential residence, so consider
them to be visiting.''
	   In an interview with the daily government newspaper, ``Zvezda,''
Buzo also warned that the diplomats may face some uncomfortable
times ahead, as the government goes ahead with its plans to repair
plumbing.
	   ``Nobody is chasing diplomats out of there, but the repair works
are under way and will continue. Of course there will be
inconveniences,'' he said. ``Those who would like to put up with
them, let them. Those who would like to live more comfortably,
we'll be looking for new accommodation.''
	   Lukashenko said the new accommodation was practically ready.
	   ``We have put up resplendent buildings for them, to which they
can move as early as tomorrow,'' he said, according to the Interfax
news agency. It was not clear what buildings he meant.
	   Lukashenko also scoffed at the diplomats' complaint that the
attempted eviction violated the Vienna accord, which sets forth the
well-established notion that diplomatic residences are the property
of the diplomats' country.
	   The order for diplomats to leave doesn't violate the Vienna
Convention ``or any other convention,'' Lukashenko said.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran on Thursday rejected as ``inadequate''
a U.S. offer for starting a new relationship to end nearly two
decades of mutual hostility.
	   Instead of words, the United States should offer actions, the
state-run Iran radio said in a commentary in response to U.S.
Secretary of States Madeleine Albright's statement on Wednesday.
	   In order to restore relations, the United States must first
``renounce violence against Iran'' by ending its support for an
Iranian opposition guerrilla group based in Iraq, free frozen
Iranian assets and ``apologize to the Iranian nation for its wrong
policies in the past 50 years,'' the radio commentary said.
	   In a similar reaction, Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazzi told
reporters in Madrid, Spain during an official visit: ``Words are
not enough, they must be followed by acts.'' He said the abolition
of U.S. sanctions on Iran was a prerequisite for improved
relations.
	   Albright said in a speech to The Asia Society in New York that
the United States is ``ready to explore further ways to build
mutual confidence'' and called on Iran to ``consider parallel
steps.''

Brazil chooses its first astronaut 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ If all goes well, a Brazilian air force
captain will become the first South American to be sent into outer
space on a NASA mission in about three years, the Brazilian Space
Agency said Thursday.
	   Marcos Cesar Pontes, 35, is scheduled to begin a battery of
medical tests next week at the Johnson Space Center in Houston,
Texas. If he receives a clean bill of health, he will return to the
space center in August to start a two-year training period.
	   He is scheduled to make his first flight into space around 2001
as part of a team that will help build the International Space
Station, said Regina Celia Franca, press spokeswoman for the
Brazilian Space Agency.
	   ``Should he fail to pass the medical examinations, which is
highly unlikely, there are four more potential astronauts ready to
take his place,'' Franca said.
	   During last year's visit by President Bill Clinton, Brazil and
the United States signed an agreement including this country in the
International Space Station.
	   Pontes is currently posted at the Aerospace Technical Center, a
research and development complex in Sao Jose dos Campos, 90
kilometers (56 miles) northeast of Sao Paulo. Together with the
National Space Research Institute, it is the nerve center of
Brazil's ambitious space program.
	   The program aims at giving Brazil a slice of the growing market
for small rockets capable of putting satellites of up to 350 kilos
(770 pounds) into orbits ranging from 250 to 1,000 kilometers (155
to 620 miles) out from the Earth.

Destitute woman kills her newborn boy

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Police in northern Bulgaria arrested a
woman who killed her newborn baby, saying she hardly fed two
children she already had, the state news agency BTA reported.
	   Kristina Raikova, 28, from the village of Tarnak, 120 kilometers
(75 miles) north of Sofia, suffocated her newborn boy and threw his
body into a toilet, the agency quoted local police as saying.
	   She could be sentenced to up to 3 years in prison if found
guilty of murdering her newborn.
	   Raikova told police that her husband recently abandoned her,
leaving no means to support their two elder children, the agency
said.
	   It said Raikova lives in one house with her parents and five
more relatives and everyone in the family is jobless.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ As America's U.N. envoy, Richard Holbrooke
will need all his negotiating skills to cope with potential
firestorms from Kosovo to South Asia at a time when U.S. leverage
over old foes and reluctant allies is waning.
	   Holbrooke, architect of the 1995 agreement that ended the 3
1/2-year Bosnian war, was named U.N. ambassador Thursday,
succeeding Bill Richardson who will take over as energy secretary.
	   The 57-year-old Holbrooke, one-time assistant secretary of state
for European affairs, will be the most seasoned diplomat to
represent America at the United Nations since Thomas Pickering
served here during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
	   After negotiating the Bosnia accord, Holbrooke served as special
U.S. envoy on Cyprus, a Mediterranean island divided between rival
Greek and Turkish communities.
	   Experienced diplomats of other member states say success at the
United Nations _ where envoys deal simultaneously with a range of
issues and many different players _ is quite different from
handling bilateral negotiations on single issues.
	   ``As I found when I came here, it is important to listen to what
others have to say,'' British Ambassador John Weston said Thursday.
``And very often, that is the secret to getting things done in the
U.N.''

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Police at the Bulgarian-Turkish border
arrested Thursday two Turkish nationals who tried to illegally take
to their country 13 migrants from Bulgaria.
	   Orhan Yilmaz and Nazif Karaca tried to sneak across the border
with four women and nine children from Bulgaria's Turkish minority
loaded in two cars and a van, police said.
	   They were arrested near the town of Svilengrad, 300 kilometers
(188 miles) southeast of Sofia.
	   The migrants were charged 1,500 German marks each to be smuggled
to Turkey, police reported.
	   Illegal traffic of people has surged in Bulgaria after the tough
border regime was abolished following the end of the Cold War in
1989.
	   Many of the illegal migrants come from Bulgaria's 800,000 ethnic
Turkish minority, which is hardly hit by poverty and unemployment.
	   Fearing a large inflow of immigrants, Turkey has tightened visa
requirements for Bulgarian Turks as Sofia governments after 1989
restored their human rights once violated by the country's
communist rulers.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ African leaders on a mission to restore
peace in the Horn of Africa met Thursday with Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
	   The countries' border conflict that broke out in early May has
claimed hundreds of lives on three fronts and in air attacks. In a
first sign that the two men may be willing to compromise, they
agreed under U.S.-Italian pressure on Sunday to halt air strikes.
	   Ground fighting has subsided since June 11.
	   Organization of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed
Salim said after meeting with Meles the delegation brought a
``message of concern on behalf of Africa and the message of
Africa's desire to see a peaceful end to this very tragic and very
unfortunate conflict.''
	   Opening the meeting with Isaias in Asmara, the five-member
delegation refused to comment on the negotiations.
	   Immediately after the meeting, they planned to return to the
Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, said Saidou Ouedraogo, spokesman for
delegation leader Blaise Compaore, president of Burkina Faso.
	   The OAU delegation ``has no new initiative of its own, but will
be building on the OAU resolution'' urging the two sides to accept
and implement a four-point U.S.-Rwandan peace proposal, Ethiopian
government spokewoman Selome Tadesse said.
	   The proposal includes a call to Eritrea to redeploy to positions
held prior to the outbreak of hostilities.
	   ``Unfortunately, the Ethiopian side has been very adamant on
that point,'' said Eritrean presidential aide Yemane Gebreab.
	   Unable to resolve that impasse, each side has been crafting
proposals to find common ground, he said.
	   Eritrea will lobby for a cessation of hostilities and
demilitarization of the entire border, Yemane said. The steps would
clear the way for the U.N. Cartographic Section to delimit and
demarcate the border, he said.
	   ``We might fight a few more rounds, but at the end of it, we're
going to have to negotiate,'' Yemane said.
	   In addition to Compaore, as current OAU chief, the delegation
includes Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, Zimbabwe President
Robert Mugabe and Salim.
	   Djibouti President sent Foreign Minister Mohammed Musa Sheahim
in place of President Gouled Atidon, who is unwell.
	   While the diplomats pursued their initiative, hundreds of
Eritreans deported from Ethiopia headed by bus for the Eritrean
capital, Asmara, after an arduous three-day journey from Addis
Ababa.
	   The deportees, after crossing the border on Wednesday near the
Eritrean village of Om Hajer, said they were given food but
insufficient water on the trip.
	   ``This is a very bad crime,'' said a 43-year-old deportee who
lost limbs when he served in the Ethiopian army. ``I lost my hand
and leg for them _ and now I get this.''
	   He declined to give his name out of concern for the wife and
children he left behind.
	   The deportations were fiercely criticized by Eritrea as a
``witch-hunt,'' but Ethiopia said the deportees posed security
risks because they had military training or were raising funds for
the Eritrean war effort.
	   Ethiopia has accused Eritrea of expelling thousands of its
citizens, a charged denied by Eritrea.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
rebels overthrow a 17-year military regime in July 1991. Eritrea
gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A U.S. travel agency offered a reward Thursday
after nearly 15,000 World Cup tickets and hundreds of thousands of
dollars were stolen from its Paris office.
	   The Georgia-based agency, Prime Sport International, offered
``no questioned asked reward'' of 1 million francs (dlrs 166,000)
to recover the tickets that were stolen overnight.
	   In what Prime Sport called ``a highly sophisticated raid,'' one
or two burglars had climbed the scaffolding outside the office in
the upscale 16th district of western Paris, a few blocks from the
Parc des Princes stadium.
	   The burglars broke the safe as well as the door, said police
officials, speaking on customary anonymity. Prime Sport reported
the theft and filed a complaint, officials said.
	   Along with the tickets, the thieves made off with 3.3 million
francs (dlrs 550,000) in cash, the company said in a statement.
	   The agency said the tickets were ``useless to the thieves as
they all bear numbers and names.'' But it said anyone using the
tickets ``will be caught and could be tried as an accomplice of the
burglars.''
	   Police sources said the burglars also took access badges to get
into Saint-Denis stadium in Paris.

Arnold Palmer snubbed by San Francisco restaurant victories have been since October, sted this year. AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: SUBS 20th graf (Duvall item) to CORRECT that his five
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Arnold Palmer may be one of golf's greatest
players, but that apparently wasn't good enough to get him a table
at the venerable Tadich Grill in downtown San Francisco just before
the U.S. Open.
	   Palmer was with four friends Tuesday night when he decided to
have a drink at the Gold Coast Restaurant next door while waiting
to be seated at the famous seafood restaurant.
	   He waited and waited and waited _ two hours in all. Then he got
fed up.
	   ``He didn't have any pull next door,'' said Jim Brandt, owner of
the Gold Coast Restaurant. ``I don't know whether they didn't
recognize him or whether they just like to snub celebrities.''
	   Brandt, who said the city's restaurants were unusually busy for
a weekday night because of the U.S. Open crowd, persuaded Palmer to
eat at the Gold Coast, where the golfer ordered a New York steak.
	   ``He was steaming,'' Brandt said. ``He said, `I hope you can put
those guys out of business next door.'''
	   Tadich Grill manager Mike Buich said reservations are not
accepted and customers are treated equally, pro golfers or not.
	   ``It's just first come, first served,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; AGE NO FACTOR: A few years ago, the talk in golf was all about
Europeans dominating the major championships. Then the American
players took over.
	   Last year, with Tiger Woods, Justin Leonard and Ernie Els
winning majors, the focus was on the youngsters. This year, with
Jack Nicklaus playing so well at the Masters and Tom Watson winning
a PGA Tour event, the spotlight is on the older generation as the
U.S. Open begins.
	   But players said that's just an indication that age, nationality
and similar factors are not important on the golf course.
	   ``Things kind of go in cycles,'' Tom Lehman said Wednesday.
``Great players are great players, period, no matter how old you
are.''
	   Mark O'Meara, 41, who won this year's Masters, said all the
emphasis on age is misleading.
	   ``I think that it is nice to have a good mix,'' he said. ``The
golf ball is sitting out there on the ground. It really doesn't
know how old you are. It doesn't know if you are 20 of 30 or 50 or
60 or 70. It just kind of sits there waiting to be struck.''
	   Leonard, who turned 26 on Monday, agreed that ``age is not as
big a factor as some people make it out to be.''
	   ``I don't look at anybody as a young guy or an old guy,'' he
said. ``Sure, the difference between a 15-year-old and a
30-year-old is a big difference, but once you are a professional on
the PGA Tour, I don't think it is as great a factor as people give
it.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; THRIFTY DUVAL: David Duval set a record by making dlrs 881,000
as a PGA Tour rookie in 1995, and he hasn't stopped making the big
bucks since.
	   In his first two years, he earned dlrs 1.85 million _ another
record _ and he has earned dlrs 1.46 million while winning five
tour events since October.
	   But Duval hasn't let all the money change his lifestyle.
	   ``I am just not really a spendthrift. The things that I kind of
get excited about are everyday things like new tennis shoes,'' he
said Wednesday. ``I am pretty simple, jeans and T-shirt, and I
don't spend a lot on dress shoes because I don't have but a couple
of suits.''
	   Duval has ordered a boat, admitting ``maybe that isn't thrifty,
maybe that is getting wild and crazy with my money.'' And he did
buy a Porsche a year and a half ago.
	   ``It is funny, kind of _ I have put about 2,500 miles (4,000
kilometers) on it,'' he said. ``I have got a truck at home I
drive.''

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran said a U.S. offer for starting a new
relationship to end nearly two decades of mutual hostility was
``inadequate'' without actions, the state-run Iran radio said in a
commentary Thursday.
	   ``Washington's mere announcement that it is prepared to
establish ties with Iran is inadequate, for Washington (must) show
goodwill as well,'' it said.
	   Expressing similar sentiments, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharazzi told reporters during an official visit in Madrid, Spain,
that ``words are not enough, they must be followed by acts.'' He
said the abolition of U.S. sanctions on Iran was a prerequisite for
improved relations.
	   The responses came one day after U.S. Secretary of States
Madeleine Albright said in a speech to The Asia Society in New York
that the United States is ``ready to explore further ways to build
mutual confidence'' and called on Iran to ``consider parallel
steps.''

World Cup: No room for mistakes against Scotland, Moroccans say 
</HEADLINE>
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ If the Atlas Lions are willing to
write off their 3-0 loss to Brazil as a result of feeling
intimidated by playing the defending champions, their coach isn't
buying.
	   The team ``keeps on repeating the same mistakes in every
match,'' Henri Michel told reporters Thursday. ``They are small
mistakes, but in the end, they add up to a goal for the other
side.''
	   Michel's comments about Morocco's defensive errors and habit of
playing high balls when they are shorter than players in other
teams comes soon after players cited nerves as one reason why they
lost to Brazil.
	   ``They had a complex about Brazil. It could have been overcome,
but it wasn't,'' Henri Michel told reporters Thursday. ``And I
can't take on the role of psychologist.''
	   But jittery players or not, to have a chance of making it into
the second round of the World Cup, Morocco has to go through
Scotland. This means that the margin for error is zero.
	   ``In this kind of competition, these kind of errors are not
acceptable,'' Michel said, citing the failure to mark other players
properly as one reason why Brazil was afforded several ``golden
opportunities'' to score.
	   Topping Michel's list of concerns are ``problems with the
goalies.''
	   ``We've always had problems with the goal keepers, even before
the World Cup,'' he said, recalling that goalie Driss Benzekri had
stepped too far out of goal to be able to stop Brazil's Ronaldo
from scoring in the match Tuesday.
	   In the team's opening match against Norway _ a showdown which
the team had also said had intimidated them _ two small mistakes
gave Norway the opportunity to walk off the field with a 2-2 draw.
One of those goals for Norway came when Benzekri collided with
another player and Youssef Chippo, attempting to clear the ball,
had it glance off his head and go into the goal.
	   And in past matches, mistakes robbed Morocco of a win it
otherwise deserved. In the World Cup qualifiers against Ghana,
Morocco led 2-0, but player errors allowed the Ghanaians to catch
up and tie the match. Similarly, in the African Nations Cup
qualifiers against Egypt in 1997, Morocco took an early 1-0 lead,
but was scored on almost immediately. The match also ended 2-2.
	   Though the mistakes have been costly, Michel is not into
finger-pointing.
	   ``I cannot, as coach, place the responsibility on one player,
and tell him that he is not up to par. That would be
psychologically devastating,'' he said.
	   Michel said that no real changes in the lineup will be made,
except for replacing midfielder Said Chiba who received a yellow
card for rough play. He will be replaced by Gharib Amzine.
Similarly, the team will probably adopt the same open style against
Scotland as in its previous matches.
	   ``This match is like the finals (for Morocco). It is the one
chance,'' he said.
	   ``I feel confident about it. They are training hard,'' he said,
but added, laughing, ``Of course, that's what I said before the
match against Brazil.''

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Jaraf says
the national soccer team will remain in the World Cup and try to
defeat the United States, despite being angered by a French
television broadcast of a film critical of Iran.
	   The film, ``Not Without My Daughter'' starring Sally Field, was
shown Monday on Channel M6, a privately owned station. It tells the
real-life story of an American woman who escapes from Iran with her
daughter against the wishes of her Iranian husband. It portrays
Iranians as obsessed with Islamic religion and attitudes toward
women.
	   Hours after the film was aired in France, the Iranians lodged a
protest with the French government, as well as the World Cup
organizing committee and FIFA, and threatened to withdraw the
tournament.
	   Iran, having lost its first World Cup match 1-0 to Yugoslavia,
will stay on and look for a victory over the United States on
Sunday in Lyon, Jaraf told reporters during his two-day visit to
Spain.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Goal differential again will be the primary
tiebreaker for deciding second-round teams at the World Cup, FIFA
said Thursday.
	   Teams that end first-round play tied in points in their group
will be ranked according to several criteria: First, by the
difference in goals they have scored and given up, then the number
of goals scored, then head-to-head results.
	   If the teams still are tied after that, the higher spot would be
decided by a blind draw, FIFA said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ An estimated 2 billion people around the world
watched telecasts of Brazil's 2-1 victory over Scotland in the
opening game of the World Cup, organizing committee officials said
Thursday.
	   Jose Carlin, a committee spokesman, emphasized that the number
was a best-guess and that more accurate figures would be available
later in the week.
	   Organizers said before the tournament that they expected World
Cup audiences to total some 37 billion viewers by the end of the
tournament July 12.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ A fantasy soccer league competition affected by a
World Cup suspension might result in legal action against FIFA.
	   FIFA received a letter from an Englishman complaining about the
dismissal of Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert, FIFA spokesman Keith
Cooper said in a press conference Wednesday.
	   ``He was upset because he is participating in a rotisserie
competition and claims he stands to lose 60,000 pounds (dlrs
100,000) because Kluivert was taken off the team he picked,'' said
Cooper. ``He's obviously assuming he would have won.''
	   Cooper said he was surprised at the letter, which was addressed
to him personally but mistakenly identified him as the director of
refereeing.
	   The FIFA would not give the name of the Englishman, adding that
they take the letter ``semiseriously'' because it does threaten
legal action.
	   ____ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Saudi Arabia held a World Cup practice session that
was so secret not even security personnel were allowed to watch.
	   When the team trained for Friday's match against France in the
Stade de France, the session was not only closed to the press but
also to the stadium personnel, reported French daily L'Equipe
Thursday.
	   The off-limits decree also applied to stadium security charged
with protecting the visiting team, the sports newspaper said.
	   ____ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Brazilian team is so popular the French postal
service gave them their own postal address.
	   ``For the moment we're getting about 30 letters a day,'' said
Jean Paul Cueille, the manager of the Ozoir-la-Ferriere post
office. ``Obviously most letters are for Ronaldinho or Ronaldo.''
	   The letters are given to the head of security of the Brazilian
team each morning. ``We haven't actually seen the players,'' said
Cueille.
	   That might change, because some smart fans have send their
letters by registered mail.
	   The French post office has gotten letters simply addressed to
``Brazil team, France.''
	   One registered letter from a young womena was addressed to:
``The most beautiful, the most sexy, the most wonderful of animals,
Mister Edmundo,'' Cueille said. ``And she stuck a nice flower on
the envelope.''

	   SOWERBY, England (AP) _ Charity begins at home for Linda Davis,
who is watching all 64 World Cup matches on television to raise
money for needy children in Romania.
	   Linda, whose husband John is the vicar at Sowerby, North
Yorkshire, is an avid soccer fan and was looking forward to the
World Cup.
	   Now she has an excuse to watch every match.
	   The 48-year-old York City fan struck the idea of trying to raise
money for a children's center in Bucharest, Romania, by getting
sponsored to watch every match.
	   ``I'm watching all the games in full where I can but if I have
to go out I video them and watch as though it were on live,'' she
said.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australians still shaking their sleepy
heads at the failure of their team to qualify for the World Cup are
trying to find some solace in the performance of Christian Vieri.
	   News media led bulletins with the ``Australian-trained'' Italian
striker's three goals to share the lead in the tournament with
Marcelo Salas.
	   Vieri moved to Sydney in 1977, when he was five, as father
Roberto was brought out as coach of leading club Marconi. They
stayed until 1988.
	   Meanwhile, Australians have been warned that staying up late to
watch the World Cup could be bad for their health. With games
starting most days at 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. Australian time, sleep
disorder specialist Dr. David Hillman has suggested fans ``sleep
through the boring bits.''
	   Hillman said night owl fans may begin to suffer coordination
impairment, irritability, even paranoia and mental illness.

Cyprus protests air space violations by Turkish warplanes With Turkey-Cyprus BY ALEX EFTY 
</HEADLINE>
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus on Thursday accused Turkey of
creating an ``artificial tension'' by sending warplanes over its
airspace.
	   ``The government denounces the provocative violation of the air
space of the Republic of Cyprus by Turkish military aircraft and is
taking the necessary diplomatic action,'' government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said.
	   On Wednesday, Cyprus had protested the visit by Turkish warships
to ports in the Turkish-occupied north of the island.
	   On Thursday, six Turkish F-16 fighters roared low over both the
Greek and Turkish sectors of the divided capital, Nicosia, and the
U.N. buffer zone splitting the rest of the island before landing at
the Lefkonico airbase in the north.
	   Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said in Ankara that the
warplanes were sent in retaliation for the brief visit to the Greek
Cypriot part of the island earlier in the week by six air force
planes of Greece.
	   Stylianides said the government is ``calmly watching the Turkish
attempts to create artificial tension.''
	   He said Cyprus has full respect for international law and
repeated the government's proposal for the demilitarization of the
island.
	   Cyprus has been unofficially divided into a Greek Cypriot
controlled south and the Turkish occupied north since Turkey
invaded in 1974 in the wake of an abortive coup by supporters of
union with Greece. The breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north
is only recognized by Ankara which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   This weeks's tit-for-tat show of force coincided with an appeal
by the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to both sides to avoid any
action likely to increase tension.
	   Tension has been rising since last December when Cyprus ordered
S-300 antiaircraft missiles from Russia, which are due for delivery
later in the summer.
	   Turkey threatened it will prevent their deployment, prompting a
Greek warning that it will come to the aid of Cyprus if it is
attacked. This has raised the specter of hostilities between the
two countries which are both NATO allies.

Gunmen storm governor's house, kill 12 bodyguards and a civilian 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The governor of a southwest Sudanese
province says he survived an attack on his house, where 12
bodyguards and a civilian were shot dead.
	   In a statement published in newspapers Thursday, Kuay Makwaj,
governor of Bahr el-Ghazal state, said gunmen stormed his house
Tuesday in Aweil, where they shot his bodyguards and a civilian.
	   Makwaj did not explain how he escaped unharmed, nor did he
provide other details.
	   Aweil is 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) southwest of Sudan's
capital, Khartoum, and 150 kilometers (93 miles) northwest of Bahr
el-Ghazal's capital, Wau.
	   The commander of pro-government forces in the state, Atier
Benjamin, said rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army carried
out the attack, the newspaper Akhbar al-Youm said.
	   In January, the SPLA mounted a major offensive against Wau and
claimed to have captured the town. The government denied the claim,
but cut off aid flights to Wau.
	   The flights have now resumed. Relief agencies have estimated
that nearly 380,000 people in Bahr el-Ghazal are short of food
because of the fighting.
	   The rebels, who draw their support from the south's mainly
Christian and animist population, have fought since 1983 for
autonomy from the Islamic north. An estimated 1.5 million people
have died in the fighting and ensuing famines.

Lisbon world's fair changes ticket prices to woo stay-away Portuguese 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Reacting to visitor figures far below
forecasts, world's fair officials Thursday announced new a pricing
policy, including a new family ticket allowing parents to take two
children free of charge.
	   Since the May 22 opening of Expo 98, daily attendance figures
have crept up from an average 32,000 in late May to 53,000 through
the first two weeks of June.
	   Organizers had initially predicted an average of over 100,000
visitors per day.
	   The pricing change will come into effect June 21, ending the
previous policy whereby children over four were charged half the
normal price of 5,000 escudos (dlrs 27) per day and 2,000 (dlrs 11)
for evening-only access.
	   The changes also addressed criticism that prices are beyond the
reach of many families in Portugal, one of the poorest members of
the European Union where the minimum monthly wage is about 56,000
escudos (dlrs 307).
	   But organizers insisted that the basic daily admission prices
are fair and will not be altered.
	   They have targeted a total of 8.5 million visitors, almost half
of them foreign, buying a total of 13 million entrance tickets.

Despite optimistic statements, Iraq reportedly stonewalled UN inspectors 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite Baghdad's claim of a
``breakthrough'' in U.N. arms inspections, Iraq is still refusing
to provide information on the key areas of missiles, biological
weapons and deadly VX nerve agents, the chief U.N. inspector
reported Thursday.
	   The report by chief inspector Richard Butler to the Security
Council casts doubt on claims that Iraq may soon be free from
sanctions, unless the Security Council softens its demand that
Baghdad first account for all long-range missiles and nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Iraq is apparently gambling that the Russia, France and China will
prevail over the United States and Britain and convince the council
to end the sanctions without complete verification that all illegal
weapons have been destroyed.
	   During Butler's meetings last week in Baghdad, the two sides
agreed on a two-month ``program of work'' by the inspectors, who
must report to the council whether Iraq has destroyed all illegal
weapons.
	   That is the main condition for ending sanctions imposed in 1990
after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
	   Following the meetings, Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tarek
Aziz, called the agreement a ``breakthrough'' which would ``prepare
the ground for the lifting of the economic embargo.''
	   Butler told reporters that ``if that work is done satisfactorily
... I believe we should be in a position'' to move toward the
lifting of sanctions.
	   But U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
cautioned that the two-month work program was ``not all
inclusive,'' and that some major issues would remain unresolved
even if it were completed satisfactorily.
	   For example, Butler's report said the Iraqis refused to allow
the issue of missile fuel to be included in the two-month program.
The inspectors say Iraq may still be holding propellant for
long-range missiles, raising questions whether all such weapons
have actually been accounted for as Baghdad claims.
	   More significantly, the report said Iraq ``refused ... to
clarify the extent of its attempts to produce the chemical warfare
agent VX.''
	   ``Iraq stated this matter was closed and that it was only ready
to discuss the evidence available to the commission of incorrect
declarations on VX,'' the report said.
	   On biological weapons, Iraq refused to provide additional
information on its program, saying it had been destroyed. But at
Baghdad's request, the commission agreed to another meeting of
technical experts, including Russian, French and Chinese.
	   The Iraqis also repeated their demand that the United Nations
stop using American U-2 surveillance planes due to Washington's
``hostile policy,'' the report said.
	   Butler told the Iraqis that the commission was also using French
aircraft and was prepared to discuss Russian planes too _ but
``supplemental to the U-2.'' Iraq also refused to discuss Iraqi
modifications of its air defense Volga missiles which the
commission believes could allow the Iraqis to use them as
long-range surface-to-surface missiles.
	   ``In virtually all instances, Iraq remained firm in its position
that no relevant documents were available,'' the report said. ``In
one instance, Iraq refused to provide documents it acknowledged
having in its possession.''

Five peacekeepers injured in mine blast in Abkhazia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ An armored personnel carrier struck a
road mine in the breakaway region of Abkhazia on Thursday, injuring
six Russian peacekeepers, officials said.
	   The mine was laid on a country road in the Gali district, the
site of recent fighting between Abkhazian separatists and militia
groups that support Georgia's central government.
	   The Interfax news agency said the peacekeepers suffered head
injuries, and one was in critical condition.
	   As usual, pro-Georgian forces and Abkhazian separatists accused
each other of planting the mine.
	   ``The Abkhazian allegations that the Georgian militia groups are
behind this are yet another provocation,'' said the leader of
Abkhazia's pro-Georgian government-in-exile, Tamaz Nadareishvili.
	   ``Maybe they did it themselves, to once again accuse the
Georgian side and compromise it,'' Nadareishvili said.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. The separatists drove out Georgian troops and
civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Violence has broken out sporadically since then, despite the
presence of Russian peacekeepers.
	   A Russian envoy was to travel to Abkhazia on Friday to mediate
talks between the republic's leader Vladislav Ardzinba and Georgian
presidential envoy Vasha Lordkipanidze.
	   ``I do not think the present situation at the Georgian-Abkhazian
talks is at a deadlock,'' said the Russian envoy, Boris Berezovsky.
	   Berezovsky, executive secretary of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, also insisted that a recent round of
negotiations between Georgian and Abkhazian representatives in
Moscow has made ``considerable progress,'' Interfax reported.
	   However, Georgian and Abkhazian representatives who took part in
the talks have said the negotiations have largely failed.
	   A key divisive issue is the status of some 38,000 refugees who
have fled the fighting, most of them ethnic Georgians. Georgia has
been pushing for the refugees' immediate, unconditional return.
	   Abkhazia has stalled, saying it needs time build new housing and
screen the returning refugees to ensure that they do not include
pro-Georgian militants.
	   On Wednesday, the United States, France, Germany and Russia
warned the Abkhazia government that its continued refusal to allow
the refugees to return would amount to ethnic cleansing.

Netanyahu: Israel is considering referendum on West Bank pullback on PLO's efforts to upgrade observer status at United Nations. Trims. No pickup 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quote at end from Palestinian planning minister
By KARIN LAUB
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday
he is looking into ways to hold a referendum on a West Bank troop
withdrawal, a step that would further delay a pullback, but
effectively silence those trying to prevent it.
	   Netanyahu also pledged that construction would begin soon on
6,500 homes for Jews in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   The Palestinians hope to set up a future capital in the city's
eastern sector and suspended negotiations with Israel in March 1997
after ground was broken for the project.
	   ``By 2000, you will see buildings, quite a few buildings
there,'' Netanyahu said of the area, referred to in Hebrew as Har
Homa and in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim.
	   Recent polls have suggested that two-thirds of Israelis support
a U.S. proposal for a 13 percent pullback in the West Bank.
	   Jewish settler leaders have said they would stage protests and
try to topple Netanyahu over such a withdrawal, which would bring
40 percent of the land under Palestinian rule.
	   Netanyahu on Thursday confirmed reports that he was examining
various ways of holding a referendum on a withdrawal.
	   ``We are checking the possibility,'' Netanyahu said.
	   But Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's senior aide, Nabil
Abourdeneh, said Israel's parliament already approved the 1995
interim peace accord, which calls for a gradual West Bank Bank
troop pullback.
	   ``It (a referendum) is a waste of time,'' Abourdeneh told The
Associated Press.
	   Netanyahu also demanded that the PLO cease efforts to upgrade
its observer status in the United Nations, saying such a move
violated the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements and would be a
``fatal blow'' to peacemaking.
	   Israel might respond by annexing parts of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, he said.
	   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath denied there was a
violation, saying that in the peace agreements, Israel recognized
the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people.
	   ``Israel has no right to interfere,'' he said.

Britain sets 3.60 pounds (dlrs 5.80) an hour minimum wage 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's Labor Party government Thursday
announced an hourly minimum wage of 3.60 pounds (dlrs 5.80),
fulfilling a key election promise but angering trade unions,
traditionally its supporters.
	   ``(It) ... will help some two million workers escape from
poverty pay without adverse effects on jobs or inflation,'' Trade
Secretary Margaret Beckett told the House of Commons.
	   She said two million workers would gain by the introduction of
the minimum wage next April. For 18-21 year olds the minimum will
be three pounds (dlrs 4.80), rising to 3.20 pounds (dlrs 5.10) an
hour in June 2000.
	   The 897,000-member Transport and General Workers Union, the
second largest in Britain, called the rate, recommended by a low
pay commission, ``endorsement of workplace poverty and a green
light to the bad employer.''
	   The opposition Conservative Party, which kept Britain the only
country in the European Union without a minimum wage through 18
years in power, criticized the move, but employers' organizations
said the level was ``workable.''
	   ``Overall it should not place too much pressure on inflation or
lead to major job losses, but it will inevitably have a significant
effect on some industries and in some regions,'' said Adair Turner,
director general of the Confederation of British Industry. ``Any
higher and we would be moving into more dangerous territory.''
	   On average, Britons earn 18,200 pounds (dlrs 29,670) a year,
according to government statistics. A minimum wage would affect
jobs, many held by women, in the hotel, catering and security
industries.

The rough is half the battle as U.S. Open gets under way AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with early play.
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ It didn't take long for The Olympic Club to
stop some players dead in their tracks Thursday at the U.S. Open.
	   Under overcast conditions with a chill in the air, Steve Pate
got the 98th Open started in fitting fashion _ a drive that
wandered right and was gobbled up by the wet, clinging rough.
	   But the rough was only half the battle in the early going of the
first round.
	   Colin Montgomerie played a nice chip to the par-5 first hole,
satisfied as he began walking toward the green when the ball rolled
to a stop. Then he froze as it kept rolling farther away, kept on
the fringe only by the thick collar.
	   Payne Stewart's approach on No. 2 barely cleared the bunker and
looked like it would stay on the fringe about 20 feet (6.10 meters)
below the cup. He gave his caddie his club, looked back at the
green and couldn't believe his eyes.
	   The ball trickled a few feet (a meter), then a few feet (a
meter) more. Before long, he was looking at a 20-yard (18.28-meter)
chip back to the green. He managed to save par.
	   With 42 players on the course, the bending, slanting fairways
were running firm and fast, but no one was going anywhere in a
hurry.
	   Pate made the turn in 1-under 34 with a birdie on No. 9.
Clarence Rose got to 2-under through five holes.
	   Tiger Woods, John Daly and Fred Couples were among those who
birdied No. 1, which played the easiest the last time the Open came
to Olympic. From there, trouble lurks.
	   On the eve of the Open, Justin Leonard wondered if the USGA's
answer to advanced equipment would be to make players carry only
nine clubs and walk barefoot.
	   That won't be the case, but even with 14 clubs in the bag,
Leonard and the rest of the field would do well to concentrate on
only a few of them.

Turkish authorities close torture victims' center in southeast 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish authorities have closed down a
rehabilitation center for torture victims just five days after its
inauguration in this southeastern city, human rights activists said
Thursday.
	   The center, sponsored by the Copenhagen-based International
Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims, was forced to close
Wednesday, the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey said in a
statement.
	   Some 15 policemen came to the center and ordered it closed,
claiming its director had failed to obtain proper authorization for
the opening on Saturday, it said.
	   The Turkish foundation said the center had the proper
authorization, and called the closing illegal.
	   ``They don't want any witnesses or human rights defenders in
southeast turkey,'' said Nazmi Gur of the Human Rights Association
in Ankara.
	   In Copenhagen, the council's secretary general, neurologist Inge
Genefke, deplored the closing and urged Danish lawmakers to react.
	   Government officials could not immediately be reached for
comment on the closing.
	   Most charges that Turkey is violating human rights are focused
on the southeast, where the military has been waging a 14-year-old
war against autonomy-seeking Kurdish rebels.
	   Torture is also said to occur in prisons and police stations
throughout the country. Turkey denies systematic rights violations,
and says that those suspected of abuses are brought to justice.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Reacting to visitor figures far below
forecasts, world's fair officials Thursday announced a new pricing
policy, including a new family ticket allowing parents to take two
children free of charge.
	   Since the May 22 opening of Expo 98, daily attendance figures
have crept up from an average 32,000 in late May to 53,000 through
the first two weeks of June.
	   Organizers had initially predicted an average of over 100,000
visitors per day.
	   The pricing change will come into effect June 21, ending the
previous policy whereby children over four were charged half the
normal price of 5,000 escudos (dlrs 27) per day and 2,000 (dlrs 11)
for evening-only access.
	   The changes also addressed criticism that prices are beyond the
reach of many families in Portugal, one of the poorest members of
the European Union where the minimum monthly wage is about 56,000
escudos (dlrs 307).
	   But organizers insisted that the basic daily admission prices
are fair and will not be altered.
	   They have targeted a total of 8.5 million visitors, almost half
of them foreign, buying a total of 13 million entrance tickets.

OAS court orders stay of Trinidad executions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ The Inter-American Court of Human
Rights ordered Trinidad and Tobago not to hang five convicted
killers and scheduled an August hearing on their cases.
	   Trinidad didn't immediately respond to the decision, which was
released late Wednesday.
	   With more than 20 convicted murderers on death row, Trinidad and
Tobago wants to start hangings before July 1.
	   It hasn't been able to comply with a ruling by the Privy Council
in London that no convict can be kept on death row for more than
five years because of lengthy defendant appeals to the human rights
court and the United Nations.
	   To speed up executions, Trinidad says it will pull out of the
Inter-American Convention on Human Rights _ and the human rights
court _ in 1999.
	   The court scheduled an Aug. 28 hearing on the cases of
Wenceslaus James, Anthony Briggs, Anderson Noel, Anthony Garcia and
Christopher Bethel.
	   A division of the Organization of American States, the court is
based in San Jose, Costa Rica.

German railway obtains French-made Thalys train as replacement 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Regrouping after its worst post-war
accident that took 100 lives two weeks ago, the German railroad
said Thursday it has temporarily obtained a French-made Thalys
train to daily cover its Cologne-Hamburg route.
	   The high-speed Thalys trains, that have also been running the
Cologne-Paris route since the end of the year, will depart Bonn
south of Cologne daily at 5:45 a.m. and arrive in Hamburg about
four hours later.
	   The return trip departs Hamburg at 5:30 p.m., a railway
spokesman said.
	   The train has been leased to cover the route until Germany's 59
first generation high-speed ICE trains, the type involved in the
accident, get wheel checks and replacements. That could be about
two weeks, a railway spokesman in Essen said
	   A cracked wheel tire on a first generation ICE train was blamed
for the June 3 accident in Eschede 50 kilometers (35 miles) north
of Hanover.
	   Second generation ICEs, of which the German railroad has 40,
have a solid steel wheel system without the rubber-buffered tires,
which can also be used on the first generation trains.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The Bosnian Serb president warned Thursday
that bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia should serve as a lesson to
Kosovo that prevention is better than cure in the volatile Balkans.
	   ``The flames of war in Bosnia have just been extinguished. But
everyone is truly worried by the appearance of a possible crisis in
Kosovo,'' said Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic during a
visit to Athens.
	   While refusing to make predictions, Plavsic said extremists such
as former Albanian President Sali Berisha were inciting the
Albanian majority in Kosovo to violence.
	   ``He is inflaming the appetites of the extremist Albanians
living on Serbian territory,'' Plavsic said.
	   She said that the borders of Serbia should not change _ an
indirect reference to Kosovo Albanians' call for independence _ but
added that ``the problem cannot be solved by police.''
	   Kosovo Albanians must be willing to discuss solutions and
compromises, respecting the human rights of the province's Serbian
minority, she said.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite Baghdad's claim of a
``breakthrough'' in U.N. arms inspections, Iraq is still refusing
to provide information on the key areas of missiles, biological
weapons and deadly VX nerve agents, the chief U.N. inspector
reported Thursday.
	   The report by chief inspector Richard Butler to the Security
Council casts doubt on claims that Iraq may soon be free from
sanctions, unless the Security Council softens its demand that
Baghdad first account for all long-range missiles and nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Iraq is apparently gambling that Russia, France and China will
prevail over the United States and Britain and convince the council
to end the sanctions without complete verification that all illegal
weapons have been destroyed.

Iran coach: We will treat US players same as others 
</HEADLINE>
By ANWAR FARUQI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) _ Though he expects his team to play
hard against the United States, Iran's World Cup coach said
Thursday his players will accord the same kind of courtesy to the
Americans as they would to other teams.
	   Because of the 20 years of bad blood between the two countries,
Sunday's game in Lyon has political significance _ especially
following U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's remarks
Wednesday that the United States was ready to start normalizing
ties with Iran.
	   Coach Jalal Talebi, who has a home in California where his
Iranian wife and three sons still live, said Albright's comments
were ``good news for us. I am really happy to hear that.''
	   Despite the relations between the two governments, Talebi said
his players would act no differently on the field. Asked if his
players would have a problem with standing for the American
national anthem, he said ``I can guarantee there is no problem with
that.''
	   Asked if players were hostile toward the American team, he said:
``100 percent, no.''
	   In Tehran, hard-line opponents of good ties with the United
States have demanded that the government instruct players not to
exchange T-shirts with the Americans after the game.
	   ``If an American player comes up to an Iranian player after the
game and wants to exchange T-shirts, I don't think we'll say no.
We'll be more than happy to do that,'' said Talebi.
	   While the game noteworthy politically, it's also crucial from a
competitive standpoint: The loser will be virtually eliminated from
making the next round.
	   Iran lost 1-0 to Yugoslavia and the United States fell 2-0 to
Germany in their opening matches. Talebi suggested the Iranians
would have been happy with a draw against Yugoslavia, but that a
win is needed against the Americans.
	   ``We will play harder in our next game because we need to win to
stay in the competition. With Yugoslavia, all we wanted was not to
lose,'' Talebi told reporters at a press conference he attended
with his top striker, Ali Daei.
	   ``We are going to go against the United States only to get our
three points,'' said Daei.
	   Talebi said he was not sure that midfielder Reza Shahroudi and
team captain and goalkeeper Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh would be able to
play Sunday. Both have injured legs and missed the game with
Yugoslavia.
	   Iran's backup goalkeeper, Nima Nakissa, is seven years younger
than the 32-year-old Abedzadeh. Nakissa earned only his eighth cap
against Yugoslavia, while Abedzadeh has 70.

Vatican reports another year in the black 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Thanks to good management and favorable
exchange rates, the Vatican said Thursday it recorded a 19 billion
lire (dlrs 11 million) surplus last year.
	   It was the fifth straight year in the black. Contributions from
dioceses worldwide _ sought since 1992 _ have been bolstering its
finances.
	   Last year, the contributions totaled dlrs 52 million, said
Monsignor Serbio Sebastiani, who runs the economic affairs
department of the Vatican.
	   Overall spending totaled 338 billion lire (dlrs 194 million),
compared to revenues of 357 billion lire (dlrs 205 million), he
said.
	   The Holy See employs 2,400 people. Income goes to pay for
Vatican Radio and the newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, as well as
diplomatic missions, administrations and other institutions like
the Vatican library.
	   Before the black years, the Vatican suffered 23 consecutive
years of losses.
	   The Vatican city-state reports finances separately. It realized
a greater surplus, of 38 billion lire (dlrs 22 million), the
prelate said. No overall figures were given.
	   Sebastiani said the surplus would fund a multi-level parking
garage and entrance hall modernization at the Vatican museums ahead
of jubilee year celebrations in 2000, when millions of extra
visitors are expected.
	   The city-state earns income from the museums and the sale of
stamps and coins.

With Russian Economy IMF delays Russia loan 
</HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund decided
Thursday to delay a dlrs 670 million loan to Russia for a week
until Russia takes action to shore up its battered economy.
	   An IMF spokesman issued a brief statement announcing the delay
of the executive board's expected action on the latest installment
from a dlrs 9.2 billion three-year support loan to Russia.
	   However, the official said without elaborating that the delay
``until next week'' was designed to ``allow the Russian authorities
time to complete implementing the actions necessary'' to secure the
payment.
	   The IMF wants Moscow to assure that broad tax code revisions
will become law. Other actions include passage of stalled
land-reform and budget laws as well as various tax increases,
including a boost in sales taxes.
	   On Wednesday, the IMF said its No. 2 official, Stanley Fischer,
would visit Moscow next week for talks with top officials on its
economic reform program and actions on an expanded aid program.
	   The IMF spokesman, who requested anonymity, did not immediately
indicate if a larger disbursement of funds was under consideration
as part of the postponement.
	   In Moscow, Russia's newly appointed special representative to
the IMF, said the country needs between dlrs 10 billion and dlrs 15
billion to shore up its financial markets, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The representative, Anatoly Chubais, didn't spell out where the
assistance should come from. He said, however, he would soon be
discussing Russia's financial difficulties with Fischer.
	   ``The situation in Russia right now is not a simple one,''
Chubais told Interfax.
	   Western investors said a dlrs 10 billion stabilization package
is crucial to helping the country's battered markets and shoring up
the ruble.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Openly acknowledging a quota system for the

overriding concern is to keep the Palestinian population of the
disputed city to no more than 30 percent.
	   The quota was described in a plan for Jerusalem's development

Netanyahu by a special committee for Jerusalem.
	   Palestinian leaders denounced the guidelines.
	   ``This is a racist approach, part of the ethnic cleansing policy
Israel is implementing against Arabs in east Jerusalem,'' said Ziad
Abu Ziad, a member of the Palestinian legislative council from
Jerusalem.
	   Palestinians accuse Israel of trying to keep down the number of
Arab residents in the city by restricting building permits,
demolishing homes built without licenses, and revoking Arabs'
residency permits.
	   The future of Jerusalem is to be negotiated in talks on a
permanent Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement that have not yet
begun, but are to conclude by May 1999.
	   The Palestinians want to establish a capital in east Jerusalem,
captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel says
it will never relinquish sovereignty over all of the city.
	   According to city planners, 174,400 Palestinians and 417,000
Jews lived in the city at the end of 1995. The Palestinians made up
29.5 percent of the population, up from 25.8 percent in 1967.
	   Citing a higher birthrate among Palestinians and a growing
number of Jews leaving Jerusalem, the planners said that by 2020,
Palestinians will make up 40 percent of the city's population,
unless the government intervenes.
	   If Jerusalem is to remain the united capital of Israel, ``It
will be necessary to aim for a target in which 70 percent of the
population will be Jews and 30 percent will be Arabs in 2020,'' the
report said.
	   The plan, which has been accepted in principle by Netanyahu,
calls for an expansion of Jerusalem's boundaries westward to
include the city's suburbs. The government would also invest
heavily in the city to create more jobs and build an additional
142,000 apartments to lure Jews back to Jerusalem.
	   Retired city officials have acknowledged in the past that an
unofficial quota of 28 percent Palestinians and 72 percent Jews has
served as the basis for all city master plans since 1967.
	   City officials on Thursday defended the quota, saying Jerusalem
is different from other cities because it is at the center of a
conflict.
	   ``New York doesn't have a problem of some people trying to
separate from the city,'' said municipal spokesman Hagai Elias.
``It's not a secret that the mayor's priority is to keep a united
Jerusalem, and if you don't have a Jewish majority, you don't have
a basis for that.''

German Ford back in production after three-day stop for supplies 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Ford's German subsidiary on Thursday
said its problem with undelivered door locks had been solved and
production of its Fiesta, Puma and Ka models in Germany, was back
in full swing.
	   The supplier Kierkert GmbH was back in operation after a 10-day
pause to resolve a software problem, a Ford statement said.
	   The supply problem caused Ford in Cologne to place 8,000 workers
on involuntary leave with pay since Monday in Germany, causing an
estimated loss of 100 million marks (dlrs 55 million), the company
said.
	   Some extra shifts will probably be scheduled to make up for some
of the losses, Ford said.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nearly 15,000 World Cup tickets and hundreds of
thousands of dollars in cash have been stolen from the Paris office
of an American travel agency, authorities said Thursday.
	   The theft was the latest incident to hit World Cup ticket sales
plagued by fraud or other illicit practices. The head of the world
soccer federation FIFA threatened punitive measures Thursday.
	   Georgia-based Prime Sport International offered ``no questioned
asked reward'' of 1 million francs (dlrs 166,000) to recover the
tickets that were stolen overnight.
	   It was not clear why the company had such a stockpile of
tickets. Authorities said the agency was under investigation for
illicit sale and distribution of tickets. Details were not
immediately available.
	   In what Prime Sport called ``a highly sophisticated raid,'' one
or two burglars had climbed the scaffolding outside the office in
the upscale 16th district of western Paris, a few blocks from the
Parc des Princes stadium.
	   The burglars broke the safe as well as the door, said police
officials, speaking on customary anonymity. Prime Sport reported
the theft and filed a complaint, officials said.
	   Along with the tickets, the thieves made off with 3.3 million
francs (dlrs 550,000) in cash, the company said in a statement.
	   The agency said the tickets for about 30 different matches
including the final, were ``useless to the thieves as they all bear
numbers and names.''
	   But it said anyone using the tickets could be ``tried as an
accomplice of the burglars.''
	   Police sources said the burglars also took access badges to get
into Saint-Denis stadium in Paris.
	   The news came as France Telecom, the country's main telephone
company, was launching an investigation into a report that one of
its workers leaked a phone number that allowed thousands of World
Cup tickets to be bought unfairly.
	   The tickets were among the 170,000 sold by the World Cup
organizing committee, CFO, on a first-come, first-served basis from
April 22 through May 8.
	   The CFO switchboard was so swamped that most callers had to dial
more than 500 times before getting through. But a France Telecom
worker gave a friend a special number that allowed direct access to
the switchboard, said the daily Le Parisien.
	   The friend, named only as Frederic, then used the number to skip
the line and buy about 400 tickets. It was not known how widespread
the problem was.
	   ``We became aware of a possible problem today and we will look
into the situation immediately,'' said Estelle Rozine, a France
Telecom spokeswoman.
	   At a daily briefing, Bruno Travade, communications director for
the CFO, confirmed that a ``technical'' phone number existed in
addition to the main switchboard number _ but said that number
didn't correspond to the one published by the newspaper.
	   The CFO said it would file legal charges if necessary.
	   The revelations came a day after three people _ including the
president of the French affiliate of ISL Worldwide, FIFA's
exclusive marketing partner _ were arrested in a separate
investigation into ticket fraud.
	   The arrests Wednesday were a response to the 12,000 Japanese
fans who were left ticketless for the World Cup.
	   The scandals drew ire from FIFA president Joseph Blatter.
	   ``This whole ticketing operation should be reviewed'' before the
next World Cup, he told France Info radio. The alleged fraud by
certain companies or associations is ``something that shocks us.''
	   In the meantime, he said, FIFA's disciplinary commission ``could
intervene with these associations and even ... sanction them,'' he
said.
	   Critics have said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.6 million tickets
printed, more than 962,000 were earmarked for supporters in the
host country, while commercial partners snapped up 436,000.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's leading capitalist reformer came bouncing
back into the government Thursday, and immediately held out an SOS
sign to the West for dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in aid.
	   Anatoly Chubais, who was recently fired for a second time as a
deputy prime minister, was brought back onto President Boris
Yeltsin's team and charged with securing new loans to stabilize its
economy.
	   Chubais is one of the most disliked and mistrusted men in
Russia, and his appointment enraged Yeltsin's critics in
parliament, who questioned the legality of the appointment.
	   But he is also one of the few figures in Russia whose economic
expertise is respected by Western bankers and leaders, and is the
first person Yeltsin seeks out when the economy is in trouble.
	   Chubais said he would meet the acting chairman of the
International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, on Monday to discuss
the possible conditions for an additional loan to Russia.
	   He will have an uphill battle. The IMF postponed plans Thursday
to act on a proposed dlrs 670 million credit outlay to Russia,
saying it wanted to wait until next week. Without elaborating, the
agency said Russia needed ``to complete implementing the actions
necessary'' to secure the credit.
	   Also Thursday, Russia offered between dlrs 2 billion and dlrs
2.5 billion in a 30-year Eurobond aimed at restructuring its
short-term debt. And Boris Fyodorov, the country's new tax chief,
said he had reached agreements with 13 to 15 oil companies to pay
back taxes.
	   In the wake of last month's crash in Russian financial markets,
the IMF is reportedly demanding that Russia slash its budget
deficit, improve tax collection and make its Central Bank more open
to scrutiny.
	   The Interfax news agency quoted Chubais as saying that Russia
would not accept loans ``at any price.''
	   But while the government had previously insisted it could shore
up the economy on its own, Chubais said Western aid was needed.
	   ``The situation is very difficult,'' he said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Reaction from the Duma, the Communist-dominated lower house of
Parliament, was predictably caustic.
	   ``This is our great Russian beggar,'' said the leader of the
Parliament's hard-line Agrarian faction, Nikolai Kharitonov.
	   At a demonstration outside Russia's main government building,
striking miners were joined by scientists furious over budget cuts
that have turned them and their programs into paupers.
	   Sergei Dembovsky, a physicist at the Russian Academy of
Sciences, spoke with disgust about Chubais' appointment.
	   ``I think it's a continuance of the same old policy of
thievery,'' he said. ``The situation will be even more tense. We
are approaching a social holocaust.''
	   Yeltsin, who has already fired and rehired Chubais twice, tried
to parry criticism. He said even though Chubais has been given back
his old title of deputy prime minister, the job is not technically
a Cabinet appointment and would be ``temporary.''
	   He also said the Duma's reaction was irrelevant.
	   ``For us, more important are the state, the current situation at
the world's financial markets, the value of today's ruble,'' the
president was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Chubais lost his job in March in a government shakeup. He was
quickly hired as chief executive of a huge utility, Unified Energy
Systems _ a job he said he will keep.
	   In the past, Chubais was responsible for carrying out Russia's
controversial privatization program. Many Russians believe he all
but gave away billions of dollars in state assets to cronies at
fire-sale prices.
	   In addition, critics consider him personally corrupt, especially
since he was demoted last year in a scandal over a dlrs 90,000
advance from a politically connected publisher for a book he was to
write with several other top government officials. The others were
fired.
	   A prosecutor recently said no charges would be filed in the
case.

	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   Daily Mail, London, on Louise Woodward verdict:
	   None of us were there. We can never be sure precisely how the
Eappen baby died. The English au pair Louise Woodward has always
protested her innocence. But yesterday seven judges of the supreme
court in the state of Massachusetts upheld the trial judge's
verdict of manslaughter and ruled by the narrowest of majorities
that the 279 days she had already served in jail was sufficient
sentence.
	   Some will say she is lucky to be free. Others will maintain that
she does not deserve to be branded a killer.
	   But our guess is most may well agree that, though the checks and
balances of the American legal process by which Ms. Woodward's fate
has been so meticulously determined are different to ours, justice
has been done.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Daily Telegraph (London) on soccer fans' violence:
	   Yesterday, we won and we lost. England beat Tunisia on the
football field according to the rules, and distinguished
themselves. Off the field, English fans beat up Tunisians, in
defiance of the police, and earned themselves ... the horrified
contempt of Europe.
	   One would like to think that there is no relationship between
the two phenomena _ that English football is an amiable popular
pastime and English football hooliganism is a weird aberration. And
of course it is true, numerically, that those fans who never attack
anybody hugely outnumber the bands of thugs who set out to break
heads. But there is, unfortunately, some relationship, in England,
between the football and the violence.
	   Perhaps the key to that relationship lies in that pronoun ``we''
_ and not just because the British nation encompasses much more
than England. The idea that the English football team are ``we''
for the English people has gone way beyond what is rational or even
what is enjoyable. ....
	    &UR; ___
	   Yomiuri Shimbun, Tokyo, on bilateral relations between Japan and
North Korea:
	   Disappointing messages have come from North Korea recently over
two bilateral issues: missing Japanese believed to have been
abducted by North Korean agents and a homecoming visit by the
Japanese-born spouses of North Koreans.
	   ... Japan must continue sending the message that unless
Pyongyang tackles these two major issues in good faith, it will be
difficult to discuss the normalization of bilateral ties and any
additional supply of food aid.
	   Japan repents the colonial rule of Korea before and during World
War II, and regards normalization talks as a requisite step for
settling war-related issues with the North. Through normalized
ties, peace and stability may be established in East Asia. The
nation, therefore, is not unwilling to extend food aid, but this
will only be possible if there is mutual trust that the two
countries will act in accordance with international rules.
	    &UR; ___
	   La Nacion, Buenos Aires, on school shootings in United States:
	   In Springfield, Oregon, a very serious criminal episode occurred
recently: a youth opened fire on a crowded high school cafeteria,
causing the death of three students and leaving 15 others seriously
wounded. ... In less than eight months, similar acts have occurred
in six schools across the United States, all in rural districts
where ``nothing ever happened'' to disturb the peace. The ages of
the attackers ranged between 11 and 16 years old. ... Any analysis
(of these attacks) should focus on _ and answer _ the question as
to why such aggression is unleashed in such a prosperous and
developed society (and) why an advanced society holds so firmly to
the right to have arms within reach.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on state election in Australia:
	   `Australia's Asian neighbors cannot but be dismayed by the
stunning 25 percent vote chalked up in the Queensland state
election by a party that `in reality, is about race, and it's about
guns,' according to opposition Labor Party leader Kim Beazley. ...
The world is waiting for the Commonwealth government's response to
the challenge. ...
	   (Prime Minister John Howard) demonstrates indecent eagerness to
bestow respectability on the egregious (One Nation party leader
Pauline) Hanson. Other straws in the unhealthy wind are his anxiety
to find excuses for Queensland voters and, even worse, (junior
coalition member) National Party approbation of the One Nation
platform. No government leader seems ready to grasp the racist
nettle, as Mr. Beazley has done. If this be the conservatives'
choice, they must, at least, pay heed to the likely consequences.

	   MONTREAL (AP) _ A commuter plane caught fire after takeoff, then
crash-landed and exploded Thursday at Mirabel airport near
Montreal, killing all 11 people aboard, authorities said.
	   The fire broke out minutes after the twin-engine turboprop left
Dorval, another Montreal-area airport, on a flight to Peterborough,
Ontario.
	   ``Once in the air, the pilot, in discussion with the tower,
advised them there was some smoke in the cockpit,'' said police
Cpl. Pierre Giguere. ``At that time, the plane was redirected to
Mirabel, where it crashed.''
	   Emergency vehicles were waiting and put out the fire ``as
quickly as humanly possible,'' but all nine passengers and two crew
members were killed, said Ray Monette, manager at Mirabel. The
airport is 30 miles (50 kilometers) northwest of Montreal.
	   ``The plane was on final approach _ engulfed in flames,''
Monette said. ``It would seem the pilot did succeed in landing the
plane. But then the aircraft exploded and veered off the runway.''
	   Federal investigators were examining the wreckage for clues as
to why the fire broke out.
	   The Metroliner commuter plane was owned by Quebec-based Propair,
which operates about 2,000 commuter and charter flights a year.
	   Brian Jenner, president of the association representing Quebec
air transporters, called Propair the ``cream of the crop'' among
carriers in the province. He said its safety record was good.
	   It was the worst plane crash in Canada since March 1989, when 24
people aboard an Air Ontario jet were killed near Dryden, Ontario.
	   Monette said it was the first fatal crash ever at Mirabel, which
was built in the 1970s to serve as Montreal's main airport but now
handles only charter and cargo flights because airlines and
passengers disliked its distance from the city.
	   Transport Minister David Collenette said Mirabel airport was the
scene of an emergency simulation exercise two weeks ago. Emergency
measures at the airport were deemed adequate, he said.

England's David Tapping takes first-round lead in Madeira 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MACHICO, Madeira (AP) _ David Tapping of England shot a
6-under-par 66 Thursday to take a two-shot lead after the first
round of the Madeira Island Open.
	   Tapping, 23, fired eight birdies on the Santo da Serra course to
emerge from his obscurity during the past 10 months when he missed
12 halfway cuts in 15 tournaments.
	   ``It was one of those days where I could do no wrong,'' Tapping
said.
	   Four players shared second place _ 1995 Madeira winner Santiago
Luna of Spain, England's Roger Winchester, Stephen Ames of Trinidad
and Tobago, and Germany's Thomas Gogele.
	   American Brian Nelson, Spaniard Francisco Cea, and England's
John Mellor and Steven Bottomley were level on 3-under.
	   South African Wayne Westner pulled out of the tournament after
slipping and hurting himself during Wednesday's Pro-Am. He is
expected to be laid up for six weeks.

East African defense ministers discuss further cooperation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Defense chiefs from the three-nation East
African Cooperation met Thursday to discuss strategy for military
cooperation to assure the security that is crucial to the region's
economic and social development.
	   The meeting of officials from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania
coincides with their first joint military exercise dubbed Exercise
Natural Fire 98, in which the United States Central Command is
playing a key role.
	   Kenya is the only one of the three EAC countries in the Tampa,
Florida-based USCETCOM's area of responsibility that runs from
Afghanistan through the Arabian Peninsula and the states of the
Persian Gulf, Egypt, Sudan and the Horn of Africa.
	   The defense officials said the joint training is evidence that
there are no military suspicions among their three nations.
	   But they said there were no plans at the moment to create a
regional defense force and that each country would keep its own
armed forces.
	   The East African Cooperation is the successor to the East
African Community, which was born at the time of independence from
Britain in the early 1960s but which dissolved in the late 1970s
because of political, economic _ and military _ problems.
	   In 1979, Tanzanian forces entered Uganda and helped overthrow
dictator Idi Amin Dada, after his army had entered Tanzania.
	   Tanzanian Defense Minister Edgar Diones Maokola-Majogo said the
joint exercises are intended to train troops and officers in
regional peacekeeping in line with the charters of the United
Nations and the Organization of African Unity.
	   Kenyan Gideon Ndambuki and Ugandan Amama Mbabazi were the other
officials present.
	   There are 1,250 Kenyans, 210 Ugandans, 255 Tanzanians and 450
U.S. troops participating in the joint exercises that runs from
June 3-27 in northwestern Kenya near Lake Turkana.
	   The defense chiefs said they planned to hold regular meetings
and that the next one would take place in October in the Ugandan
capital, Kampala.

Bjorkman wins on bleak day at Nottingham

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman advanced to
the quarterfinals of the Nottingham Open with a 6-2, 6-3 win over
Grant Stafford on Thursday.
	   Play was disrupted on a rainy day at Nottingham, with the first
match not finishing until late in the afternoon.
	   Bjorkman, the No. 2 seed, played no-frills tennis in slippery
conditions and took just 70 minutes to beat his South African
opponent.
	   Bjorkman, who is recovering from a virus, said he was looking
forward to Wimbledon.
	   ``The grass suits my game,'' he said. ``The first time I played
Wimbledon in 1994, I had a good run but since then I've played
really badly and haven't been able to show the form that I can do
on grass,'' he said.
	   ``If I get through the first round I could go all the way _ it's
very open this year.''

Third man charged in case of slain Russian journalist 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A third suspect was charged Thursday in the
apparent contract killing of a prominent journalist in the southern
Russian republic of Kalmykia, a news agency reported.
	   The sensational case has drawn attention from President Boris
Yeltsin, who dispatched a high-level aide to investigate, and had
previously led to the arrests of two people, one of them a former
aide to the Kalmyk president.
	   The third suspect, Vladimir Shanukov, was charged Thursday with
conspiracy to murder, ITAR-Tass reported. The agency said he had a
prior criminal record.
	   Larisa Yudina, editor of the Soviet Kalmykia Today newspaper,
was found dead June 8 in the regional capital of Elista with
multiple knife wounds and a fractured skull.
	   She was a prominent critic of Kalmyk President Kirsan
Ilyumzhinov, who is also president of the World Chess Federation,
FIDE, and announced plans recently to run for president of Russia
in 2000.

Parliament condemns communism in Poland as responsible for crimes 
</HEADLINE>

With BC-Poland-Communist Collaborators

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ After years of debate and resistance,
parliament on Thursday adopted a resolution condemning communism
and holding the former communist party responsible for its ``many
crimes and offenses.''
	   Still, the hard-won resolution, passed by a vote of 250-150 with
31 abstentions in the powerful lower chamber, or Sejm, was
considerably softer than Solidarity deputies wanted.
	   The compromise resolution underscores Poland's difficulty coming
to terms with four decades of communist rule, and the two
predominant and opposing views in Polish society of the
totalitarian past.
	   Solidarity lawmakers, who as pro-democracy activists in the
1980s were the main target of communist repression, have long
wanted an explicit declaration that would vindicate their
sacrifices and blame the communists. Ex-communists, including
President Aleksander Kwasniewski, on the other hand, reject any
statement that characterizes four decades of Polish history as a
mistake.
	   The Solidarity bloc's original draft included language declaring
the former communist party, the Polish United Workers Party, a
criminal organization and collectively condemning its members for
the totalitarian system's evils.
	   They backed down in a compromise with their junior coalition
partner, the Freedom Union, who said the wording generalized the
crimes and harmed people who were not directly responsible.
	   The ex-communist left opposed the resolution as
counterproductive, focusing on the past at the expense of reforms
needed to bring Poland into NATO and the European Union. Leftist
deputies walked out of parliament when the motion was introduced in
April to continue work in committee on a plan to redraw
administrative districts.
	   Solidarity politicians, however, say that a full reckoning with
the past is necessary before Poland can truly move ahead. Since
communism fell in 1989, no former leader has been convicted of
wrongdoing, leaving the wounds of the past open for many,
particularly former Solidarity activists.
	   The resolution said the former communist party was ``in the
highest degree, to the very end, responsible for the continuation
and the shape of the communist system in Poland, which is guilty of
many crimes and offenses.''
	   ``The system was maintained with force, lies and with the threat
of Soviet intervention and it served foreign interest.''
	   Communism was imposed on Poland in 1945 as World War II was
ending. Under orders from Russian liberators, Polish communist
officials' first act was to arrest and secretly execute thousands
of members of the Nazi resistance, the best of Poland's surviving
intelligentsia and considered a threat to communist doctrine.
	   The four decades of communist rule was marked by repeated bloody
quelling of social protests, notably in 1956, 1968, 1970 and 1976.
The last one was 1981 martial law, intended to crush Solidarity
democratic movement. Ultimately, the bloody crackdown galvanized
resistance, which continued until the weakened communists consented
to talks in 1989 aimed at bringing Solidarity into government.
	   Communist officials were ousted in elections that followed the
talks.
	   In the intervening years, attempts by Solidarity-controlled
governments to officially condemn communism took a backseat at
times to urgent reforms. The issue was stalled in
leftist-controlled legislatures from 1993-1997.
	   The Solidarity bloc made the resolution a priority when it won
control of parliament in September elections.

Regional body incapable of ending Sudan conflict, says minister With Eritrea-Ethiopia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The failure of a seven-nation African
group to resolve the Eritrea-Ethiopia conflict has cast doubts on
its ability to end a rebellion in Sudan's south, the country's
foreign minister says.
	   The Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, or IGAD, has
been trying to find a solution to the 15-year old civil war between
Sudan's Muslim government and Christian and animist rebels seeking
autonomy.
	   But the six-week border fighting between Eritrea and Ethiopia
``will cast its shadow on IGAD and its role in bringing peace to
southern Sudan,'' Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman said in comments
published Thursday.
	   IGAD's failure ``casts doubt on its ability to solve problems
between its members and others,'' Osman was quoted as saying in the
Al-Gumhouria newspaper.
	   The last round of IGAD-supported talks held in Kenya in May
failed to bring Sudan's warring sides closer on the autonomy issue.
Another round of peace talks was planned in August in the Ethiopian
capital, Addis Ababa, but that is unlikely to take place now.
	   The members of IGAD are Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan,
Somalia and Djibouti, where it is based. The organization works on
development projects in member nations.

UNDATED: likely consequences. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   The Australian, Sydney, Australia, on the Asian economic crisis:
	   World Bank vice-president Jean-Michel Severino, addressing a
summit in Melbourne, said the Asia region was entering a deep
recession, if not a depression, that was unavoidable and
potentially ``very long lasting.''
	   The utterance of even the prospect of an economic depression
garnered most attention. But the fact that his assessment began
with a joke at the expense of his own institution, and ended with a
realistic and frank discussion of the extent to which realistic of
the extent to which institutions such as the World Bank and
regional neighbors like Australia could work to avert such a
depression, gives some reason to hope that the prospects for
recovery are slim bit not impossible.
	   The immediate determinants of the future will be the actions of
Japan and China. China has a crucial influence over its smaller
Asian neighbors such as Thailand and Indonesia. For such nations
their way through the financial crisis is the best prospect of
avoiding further social instability. A currency devaluation by
China would make their task almost impossible.
	   Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee Hwa (has) stated that
neither Hong Kong nor China was likely to devalue its currency
(giving) rise for cautious optimism that the Chinese government and
Hong Kong administration authority recognize their pivotal roles in
averting a regional depression. Whether Japan has similarly been a
good neighbor is questionable _ the Japanese government's failure
to resolve its domestic economic problems recognized for months, is
already costing the region dearly.
	   To avert a depression and cement an economic recovery demands
not only an enormous monetary investment from neighbors ... but
also a commitment to reform throughout the region that embraces
individuals and institutions alike.

	   Liberation, Paris, on cannabis legalization
	   French medical authorities have just announced a verdict that is
bound to prompt endless analysis: a new study says `no' to ecstasy,
cocaine, heroin and alcohol, but `yes' to cannabis.
	   Of course, there's a little exaggeration here.
	   When inhaled in large quantities, hashish or marijuana cause
problems. But hardly more than candy or blood sausage, if we are to
read between the lines of the experts' report.
	   Drawn up by the best specialists in the field, this new hit
parade of risks will undoubtedly fuel the legalization debate.
	   The doctors' indulgence toward cannabis unveils a surprising
discrepancy between the scale of bans and that of sanitary risks.
	   Let's hazard a prediction: despite caution in government
circles, this news will soon make the anti-cannabis school's
position untenable.
	   Why waste police and judicial energy on a crusade when the
stakes are so small?
	    &UR; ___
	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on Mideast peace talks
	   One of the main features of the U.S. initiative to put the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks on track again is the call for a
freeze on all Israeli settlement activities, including their
expansion.
	   The Oslo accords, which Israel ceremonially commits itself to,
deferred the determination of the status of Arab Jerusalem to the
final status talks. If that is the case, why does Israel then
persist in its drive to colonize the Arab side of the city if not
to pre-empt the final status talks?
	   Recently, the Israeli interior ministry gave the green light for
the construction of dozens of housing units for Jewish settlers on
the Mount of Olives.
	   By expanding settlements, especially in Jerusalem, and with the
peace process at a standstill with no hope in sight, Netanyahu is
plainly pushing the Palestinians toward despair and hoping that
ultimately they'll resort to violence. And that would be his
pretext for abandoning the Oslo process altogether and with it any
hope of peace in the region.''

World Cup: Danes hold on for 1-1 draw 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Denmark got a first-half goal by Allan
Nielsen and survived a card-strewn battle with South Africa to get
a 1-1 draw Thursday, moving it within sight of the second round of
the World Cup.
	   The draw gave Denmark four points and moved it atop Group C
pending the outcome of Thursday night's match between France and
Saudi Arabia. The result left South Africa's hopes mathematically
alive, but little realistic chance.
	   Denmark ended the match playing nine-on-10 after Colombian
referee John Jairo Toro ejected Danish subsitutes Miklos Molnar in
the 67th and Morten Wieghorst in the 85th _ only three minutes
after the latter entered the game.
	   Alfred Phiri was ejected for two mintues after Molnar in a game
which in addition to the three reds saw seven yellows issued.
	   South Africa tied the match in the 53rd minute, but the second
half degenerated into series of fouls, leaving little opportunity
for serious chances.
	   Benny McCarthy scored South Africa's first World Cup goal in its
history when he ran onto Shaun Bartlett's backheel touch off a pass
from John Moshoeu.
	   McCarthy received the ball between Jes Hogh and Soren Colding
and rolled the ball between the legs of Danish keeper Peter
Schmeichel.
	   South Africa just missed the game winner in the first minute of
second-half injury time when Quinton Fortune blasted a ball from
the top of the penalty area off the crossbar.
	   Denmark dominated the first half but missed its chances to put
the game away in the first half, putting two balls off the right
post.
	   Nielsen volleyed Brian Laudrup's cross at the far post in the
13th minute to give Denmark the lead, deflecting it in off
goalkeeper Hans Vonk's hand.
	   Looking to help his country into the second round, Crown Prince
Frederik, heir to the Danish throne and oldest son of Queen
Margrethe II, was among the crowd at Stade Municipal.
	   Denmark came within centimeters of a second goal on a corner by
Martin Jorgensen, whose in-bending kick floated over Vonk and
banged off the far post.
	   The rebound came to Laudrup, who put a diving header from six
meters into the stomach of a sprawled Vonk.
	   Denmark hit the same post again in the 42nd when Ebbe Sand
ripped a right-footed shot from the top of the penalty area.
	   South Africa's best chance came in the 28th minute when McCarthy
sent in a rolling cross off a busted play through the goal box, but
an onrushing Helman Mkhalele couldn't get his foot to it to poke it
in.
	   The South Africans also failed to finish on a loose ball in the
penalty are in the 22nd when Piere Issa's one shot was blocked
before Jorgensen was able to dribble it out of danger.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   South Africa: Hans Vonk; Mark Fish, Pierre Issa, David Nyathi,
Lucas Radebe; Quinton Fortune, Helman Mkhalele, John Moshoeu;
Brendan Augustine (Alfred Phiri, 46th minute), Shaun Bartlett (Phil
Masinga, 79th), Benedict McCarthy.

Some 1.2 million salute Red Wings 
</HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Hockeytown never looked better _ or redder.
	   Police estimated that 1.2 millions fans jammed downtown Thursday
to honor the Detroit Red Wings, who swept the Stanley Cup
championship for a second straight year.
	   A cheering, flag-waving throng in red and white lined both sides
of Woodward Avenue as the parade traveled a one-mile
(1.6-kilometer) route toward a rally.
	   Vladimir Konstantinov and Sergei Mnatsakanov, the defenseman and
team masseur who were severely injured in a limousine accident six
days after last year's Cup victory, drew thunderous applause and
chants as they waved and gave the thumb's up sign while passing by
on a float.
	   Goaltender Chris Osgood, wearing a red T-shirt and riding in the
back of a red Jeep, carried the Cup and raised it over his head for
the crowd.
	   Coach Scotty Bowman, Michigan state Gov. John Engler and Detroit
Mayor Dennis Archer beamed and waved, and captain Steve Yzerman
hoisted the Conn Smythe trophy he won as the most valuable player
of the finals.
	   Stanley, a giant papier-mache octopus, rode on a flatbed truck.
His eight tentacles represent the number of victories it used to
take to win a Cup during the days of the six-team league.
	   Diane Dabish of Fraser, Michigan, took the day off from work
after camping along the parade route 16 1/2 hours before the
parade's 11:30 a.m. (1630 GMT) start.
	   ``Last year, I missed it, but this year I wasn't going to miss
it,'' she said.
	   Howard McLauchlan of Oakland Township arrived wearing a
4-foot-high makeshift Stanley Cup on his head and a Red Wings flag
as a cape. He shaved his beard to read Red Wing _ he ran out of
space for the `s.'
	   ``It's more than a team. It's part of Detroit and everybody's
one big happy family,'' he said.
	   Last year, for a similar salute after the Red Wings' first
championship in 42 years, the crowd reached 1 million.
	   Today, by 10:30 a.m. (1530 GMT), fans crammed behind barricades
along the parade route were 10-deep in places. As they waited for
the parade to begin, groups broke into cheers of ``Let's Go Red
Wings.''
	   Though this year's party in some ways promised to mirror last
year's, the Red Wings' route to repeating as champions was far
different.
	   First, there was the limo accident that injured Konstantinov and
Mnatsakanov.
	   Then, during the offseason, Detroit traded goaltender Mike
Vernon _ the MVP of last year's playoffs. And the club withstood
Sergei Fedorov's holdout in which he missed 59 games before
agreeing to a six-year, dlrs 38 million deal.
	   The Wings touted their latest title as a tribute to Mnatsakanov
and Konstantinov, who was once considered among the league's top
defensemen before the crash that left him watching Tuesday night's
clincher from a wheelchair.

	   The Bellingham Herald, Bellingham, Washington, on airport
luggage:
	   President Bill Clinton and Congress should force the Federal
Aviation Administration and the nation's airlines to accelerate
efforts to protect the flying public from terrorist bombings.
	   According to The Associated Press, many of the new dlrs 1
million bomb-detection machines installed last year at the nation's
largest airports aren't working properly. ...
	   Efforts to work the bugs out are being hampered by airlines'
reluctance to send all of their checked baggage through the
machines.
	   An FAA investigation also discovered that airlines and air
couriers are routinely ignoring new security procedures for
handling shipments.
	   The report found security so lax that 10 packages wrapped in
plastic and loaded with 50 pounds of pesticide slipped by an
airline personnel undetected in Miami three months ago and weren't
discovered until one burst as it was being loaded. ...
	   It's no secret that conventional X-ray machines can't detect
plastic explosives. That's why the federal government decided to
spend dlrs 68 million on equipment that can.
	   Until the new machines are working properly, and every piece of
luggage is screened, passengers and flight crews remain at risk.
...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, on Clinton's China policy:
	   Bill Clinton defends his China policy by presenting a false
choice. America can either isolate herself from the world's largest
country, he says, or pursue his brand of ``engagement.''
	   Here's Clintonian engagement. On the same day the president
called his China policy ``principled'' and ``pragmatic,'' witnesses
told a Senate committee the administration is ignoring evidence of
Chinese missile proliferation.
	   Former CIA official Gordon Oehler said officials are virtually
certain China sold Pakistan 34 nuclear-capable M-11 missiles in
late 1992. Under an international agreement, the kind Clintonites
normally relish, evidence of a missile sale would require Clinton
to cut off almost all high-tech trade.
	   Instead of accepting CIA findings, Oehler said, administration
officials quibbled with the evidence. Senior aides wanted clear
photographic proof by spy satellites. CIA analysts were ``very
discouraged to see their work was regularly dismissed,'' Oehler
said. ...
	   Engagement? How about appeasement? ...
	   Willful ignorance of China's missile trade doesn't convey
American values. It tells mainland China the U.S. values trade over
lawful international conduct and that Beijing won't be held
accountable for bad behavior. Such a policy is neither principled
nor pragmatic. It's dangerous.
	    &UR; ___
	   Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Haiti and drug
trafficking:
	   Like an immutable force of nature, the international illegal
drug trade tends to follow the line of least resistance.
	   Throughout most of the 1990s, an estimated 70 percent of the
cocaine that was intercepted en route from Colombia to the streets
of American cities had moved through Mexico. ...
	   But the federal government's intensified effort to secure the
boundary and increase the resources of the Border Patrol ... have
caused many cocaine traffickers to take the high seas instead of
using the overland route. ...
	   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, U.S. drug policy chief, said ... Haiti is
emerging as the key trans-shipment point for Colombia drugs
destined for South Florida. ... The stakes for impoverished and
rudderless Haiti couldn't be much higher.
	   With no functioning government and a fledgling civilian police
force, it needs all the help it can get from U.S. drug fighters to
prevent the cocaine cowboys from turning it into the Western
Hemisphere's pipeline-of-choice for illegal drugs.
	    &UR; ___
	   Hobbs Daily News-Sun, Hobbs, New Mexico, on Microsoft's
antitrust challenge:
	   Government plays a big part in business in this country.
	   ... It must be difficult for companies like Microsoft to
understand what they have done wrong to warrant that type of
attention of the government.
	   ... This is a democracy that should encourage business in our
country _ however small or large.
	   The government is placing itself in a tenuous position of trying
to roadblock business in this country. Our work ethic has come into
question when we are punished, instead of rewarded, for working
hard.
	   It is easy to blame big business for some of the country's
problems, and some of the blame is warranted.
	   But government has missed the mark on this question and should
back off and let the country get to work.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, on Charlton Heston and the NRA:
	   If Charlton Heston really wants to lead the National Rifle
Association back to what he calls the ``mainstream of American
life,'' he needs to work on its policies, not merely its image.
	   There's little chance of that, unfortunately. Heston, who was
elected president of the nation's largest gun owner's group last
weekend, shows no interest in bringing the NRA into a constructive
role in shaping how America should fight gun violence.
	   While the problem is deep-seated and not solvable by simplistic
remedies offered by either side in the gun debate, there are
mainstream measures that could reduce through time the ready
accessibility of guns to children and criminals without violating
legal gun owners' legitimate rights.
	   Heston and the NRA resist those moderate proposals. As long as
they do, the mainstream of American life, as Oregon lately has been
tragically reminded, has included too many innocent people being
shot by guns that are all too accessible to people who shouldn't
have them.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Protesters attacked riot police with
firebombs Thursday, injuring at least one officer and burning a
police car and a fire truck.
	   Teachers and left-wing groups had gathered in the city center to
protest the severe beating of a student Monday. A fringe group
broke away and threw firebombs at riot police and also set fire to
a television truck.
	   This is the latest in a series of a protests in the city center
against government privatization plans and education reforms that
require applicants for state teaching positions to take a
qualifying exam.
	   Last weekend teachers clashed repeatedly with riot police,
leaving three policemen and several protesters injured.

Regional body incapable of ending Sudan conflict, says minister With Eritrea-Ethiopia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The failure of a seven-nation African
group to resolve the Eritrea-Ethiopia conflict has cast doubts on
its ability to end a rebellion in Sudan's south, the country's
foreign minister says.
	   The Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, or IGAD, has
been trying to find a solution to the 15-year old civil war between
Sudan's Muslim government and Christian and animist rebels seeking
autonomy.
	   But the six-week border fighting between Eritrea and Ethiopia
``will cast its shadow on IGAD and its role in bringing peace to
southern Sudan,'' Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman said in comments
published Thursday.
	   IGAD's failure ``casts doubt on its ability to solve problems
between its members and others,'' Osman was quoted as saying in the
Al-Gumhouria newspaper.
	   The last round of IGAD-supported talks held in Kenya in May
failed to bring Sudan's warring sides closer on the autonomy issue.
Another round of peace talks was planned in August in the Ethiopian
capital, Addis Ababa, but that is unlikely to take place now.
	   The members of IGAD are Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan,
Somalia and Djibouti, where it is based. The organization works on
development projects in member nations.

Man executed in Chechnya for killing four 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The breakaway province of Chechnya carried out its
second execution in as many weeks Thursday, defying Russia's
moratorium on capital punishment, a Russian news agency reported.
	   Salan Bakharchiyev was put to death after being convicted in the
shooting deaths of four people, including one former and one
current government official, Interfax said.
	   His was the sixth execution carried out under orders of
Chechnya's Muslim court in the past year, including a man put to
death by firing squad last week.
	   Although capital punishment is still legal in Russia, President
Boris Yeltsin's government has imposed a moratorium while the
country considers whether to outlaw the practice. Russia has been
granted membership in the Council of Europe, whose charter forbids
capital punishment.
	   Although Russia still considers Chechnya one of its republics,
Chechens consider themselves fully independent following their
1994-96 war of secession.
	   Bakharchiyev was convicted of killing State Security Minister
Shamsudin Uvaisayev and former Foreign Minister Ruslan Chimayev,
along with two others, on May 15.

Asian rallies fail to impress European markets AP Business Writer

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. stocks dipped Thursday noon on Wall Street,
sharing European concern that Washington's intervention a day
earlier to prop up the yen may have limited effects.
	   ``The problems haven't been solved yet,'' said Jeremy Batstone,
a strategist at NatWest Stockbrokers in London.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto acknowledged as much,
saying Japan's economy will only improve with a government rescue
plan that is also able to deal with massive bad debts in his
country's banks.
	   Hashimoto also pledged to come up with a plan to solve the bad
loan crisis at Japan's banks.
	   ``Japan has fallen into a state of excessive lack of
confidence,'' Hashimoto said, just before he planned to meet with a
delegation of U.S. finance officials. ``These are very hard
times.''
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 5.98 at 8,823.48. at
noon.
	   Shares initially rose modestly on the London Stock Exchange,
Europe's biggest equity market, but the blue-chip Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index reversed course into negative
territory.
	   The pattern was similar across continental Europe. Big markets
in Paris and Frankfurt showed losses in the afternoon _ as did
smaller ones in Milan, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Zurich.
	   The sober dealings in the United States and Europe marked a
blunt contrast to Asia's euphoria. Asian traders pushed the
blue-chip Nikkei index in Tokyo up by 4.4 percent, and smaller
Asian markets showed even bigger gains.
	   ``The signs are that the Asian crisis is slowly coming under
control, and the initial fears have diminished,'' said Guenter
Burgold, a dealer at BHF Bank in Frankfurt. ``But intervention in
the past has always proven to be grasping at straws. The skepticism
remains.''
	   The U.S. and Japanese central banks intervened on Wednesday to
prop up the yen, which has suffered a recent sharp decline against
the dollar. A rally on Wall Street helped fuel the buying frenzy in
Asia.
	   ``This is exactly the type of thing that should happen,'' said
Jean-Michel Severino, a senior World Bank official.
	   Others were less optimistic.
	   ``This is definitely not a turning point in the crisis,'' said
Carlton Poon, head of research for Worldsec International Ltd. in
Hong Kong. ``The fundamentals in Asia continue to deteriorate,''
and the markets cannot sustain the gains.
	   On European currency markets early Thursday, the U.S. dollar
bought 136.91 yen _ roughly five yen less than the greenback was
worth late Wednesday in Tokyo.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average
jumped 646.16 points, or 4.39 percent, closing at 15,361.54.
	   Throughout Asia, other markets showed huge gains, with key
indices up by 6.4 percent in Hong Kong, 8.1 percent in Bangkok, 6.6
percent in Manila, 7.1 percent in Seoul and 5 percent in Jakarta.

URGENT
EDS: ADDS quotes, Buckley substitution in 88th minute for South
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Denmark got a first-half goal by Allan
Nielsen and survived a card-strewn battle with South Africa to get
a 1-1 draw Thursday, moving it within sight of the second round of
the World Cup.
	   The draw gave Denmark four points and moved it atop Group C
pending the outcome of Thursday night's match between France and
Saudi Arabia. The result left South Africa's hopes mathematically
alive, but little realistic chance.
	   ``It's not finished for us. We have the possibility to
advance,'' South Africa coach Philippe Troussier said. He said his
team failed to take advantage of the 10 against nine situation at
the end.
	   ``I think we deserved to score one more goal,'' Troussier said.
	   Denmark ended the match playing nine-on-10 after Colombian
referee John Jairo Toro ejected Danish substitutes Miklos Molnar in
the 67th and Morten Wieghorst in the 85th _ only three minutes
after the latter entered the game.
	   Denmark coach Bo Johansson refused to comment on the referee,
and said his team must play much better against France in next
week's final Group C match.
	   ``Sometimes we play well and sometimes we don't,'' he said.
	   Alfred Phiri was ejected two minutes after Molnar in a game
which in addition to the three reds saw seven yellows issued.
	   South Africa tied the match in the 53rd minute, but the second
half degenerated into series of fouls, leaving little opportunity
for serious chances.
	   Benni McCarthy scored South Africa's first World Cup goal in its
history when he ran onto Shaun Bartlett's backheel touch off a pass
from John Moshoeu.
	   McCarthy received the ball between Jes Hogh and Soren Colding
and rolled the ball between the legs of Danish keeper Peter
Schmeichel.
	   South Africa just missed the game winner in the first minute of
second-half injury time when Quinton Fortune blasted a ball from
the top of the penalty area off the crossbar.
	   Denmark dominated the first half but missed its chances to put
the game away, putting two balls off the right post.
	   Nielsen volleyed Brian Laudrup's cross at the far post in the
13th minute to give Denmark the lead, deflecting it in off
goalkeeper Hans Vonk's hand.
	   Looking to help his country into the second round, Crown Prince
Frederik, heir to the Danish throne and oldest son of Queen
Margrethe II, was among the crowd at Stade Municipal.
	   Denmark came within centimeters of a second goal on a corner by
Martin Jorgensen, whose in-bending kick floated over Vonk and
banged off the far post.
	   The rebound came to Laudrup, who put a diving header from six
meters into the stomach of a sprawled Vonk.
	   Denmark hit the same post again in the 42nd when Ebbe Sand
ripped a right-footed shot from the top of the penalty area.
	   South Africa's best chance came in the 28th minute when McCarthy
sent in a rolling cross off a busted play through the goal box, but
an onrushing Helman Mkhalele couldn't get his foot to it to poke it
in.
	   The South Africans also failed to finish on a loose ball in the
penalty are in the 22nd when Piere Issa's one shot was blocked
before Jorgensen was able to dribble it out of danger.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC;

Groundwork laid in bid to combat child labor 
</HEADLINE>
By PHILIP WALLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Governments have laid the groundwork for a new
international convention aimed at stamping out the worst forms of
child labor, the International Labor Organization said Thursday.
	   At their annual conference, the ILO's 174 member states
completed preliminary discussions on the accord designed to
eliminate children's involvement in dangerous work, prostitution,
pornography and drug trafficking.
	   The text of the proposed convention is expected to be adopted at
next year's ILO conference.
	   Governments, employers and workers' groups also formally voted
during this year's conference, attended by more than 3,000
delegates, to approve a declaration aimed at wiping out forced
labor and other abuses.
	   Although the declaration merely recommits governments to
observing principles already enshrined in seven core ILO labor
conventions, 43 nations and organizations abstained. Some 273 votes
were cast in favor and no-one voted against.
	   Countries including Egypt, Lebanon and Pakistan are concerned
the declaration could be used for protectionist trade purposes,
said ILO spokesman Michel Barton.
	   It is seen as reaffirming the credibility of the ILO, which has
been singled out by the United States in its campaign to reform the
United Nations.
	   The United States, which pressed for the declaration's approval,
insisted it had nothing to do with protectionist policies.
	   ``If we believed it was an exercise that would lead to
protectionism, we would have opposed it,'' said a senior U.S.
Department of Labor official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, who addressed the conference
last week, said it was ``vitally important'' to a strengthened
trading system that workers' rights are protected.
	   Last month, President Bill Clinton told the World Trade
Organization ministerial conference the global trading system and
the WTO should become more attentive to environmental and labor
issues.
	   ILO Director-General Michel Hansenne, of Belgium, said it is
``high time for the ILO to give itself the means to address the
social consequences of the globalization of the economy.''
	   All countries who have not ratified the seven core conventions
will be asked to provide follow-up reports on their progress
towards ratification.
	   The principles addressed by the declaration include freedom of
association, including the right to collective bargaining, the
elimination of forced or compulsory labor, ``the effective
abolition of child labor, and the elimination of discrimination in
respect of employment and occupation.''
	   Meanwhile, a committee which met during the conference
criticized Myanmar, formerly Burma, and Sudan for ``continued
failure to implement ratified conventions,'' an ILO statement said.
	   In the case of Myanmar, the committee noted ``severe and
longstanding violations of fundamental and trade union rights.''
	   In the case of Sudan, the committee heard evidence of slavery
and related practices, the statement said.
	   Committee members urged Sudan to undertake a ``serious attempt''
to eliminate the practices, it added.
	   The ILO is the oldest U.N. agency stemming from the 1919
creation of the former League of Nations.

German opposition party says 3,000 to 6,000 neo-Nazis in military 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's main opposition Social Democrats
on Thursday criticized Defense Minister Volker Ruehe for not doing
enough to discourage right-wing extremism in the military.
	   Presenting their report on right-wing extremism in the military,
the Social Democrats rejected suggestions that the military was a
haven for neo-Nazis.
	   But they said there were cases of ``brown niches,'' or groups of
extremists. They put the number of soldiers with right-wing
tendencies at 3,000-6,000 of Germany's 340,000-strong military.
	   Germany's main parties presented their findings Thursday at the
close of a three-month parliamentary investigation into right-wing
extremism in the military. The hearings were prompted by repeated
incidents of homemade videos showing soldiers engaging in neo-Nazi
activities, and the disclosure in December that a known neo-Nazi
had given a speech at the officers' academy in Hamburg in 1985.
	   Members of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative-centrist
coalition said in their own summary that the hearings had been
``superfluous and unnecessary'' and ``brought no new information on
the situation in the army.''
	   ``Other than a damaging public debate over the military, the
committee hearings achieved nothing,'' the summary said.
	   It referred to a military counter-espionage report from March
that the coalition said proved there were only 88 troops with
radical rightist links in the military at that time.
	   That was ``not sufficiently large enough to justify accusing
soldiers of the Bundeswehr of being especially susceptible to
radical rightist ideas,'' the summary said.
	   Walter Kolbow the SPD's top committee representative denied his
party had waged a campaign against the troops, but that the
hearings had been needed to counter international attention aroused
by reports of neo-Nazis in the German military.
	   The Social Democrats based their estimate of the number of
extremists on testimony from the constitutional protection office
and the army's Social Science Institute.

Cyprus protests air space violations by Turkish warplanes BY ALEX EFTY 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: INCORPORATES Turkey-Cyprus
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkey on Thursday sent six warplanes to
northern Cyprus in a show of force against similar action by
Greece, and Cyprus accused Turkey of creating ``artificial
tension.''
	   The six F-16 fighters roared low over both the Greek and Turkish
sectors of the divided capital, Nicosia, and the U.N. buffer zone
splitting the rest of the island before landing at an airbase in
the north. Three of the aircraft returned to Turkey hours later.
	   The move was in retaliation to the landing of four Greek F-16s
and two cargo planes at southern Greek Cypriot side on Tuesday.
	   ``Greece has exhibited its offensive intentions directed against
Turkey,'' Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said during a visit
to Romania on Thursday.
	   ``It is out of the question for Turkey not to respond to that.''
His remarks were carried by Anatolia agency. But Yilmaz stressed
that Turkey had no desire for a war in Cyprus.
	   The Greek jets, which landed near Paphos town within the
framework of a five-year joint defense agreement between Greek
Cypriots and Greece, also have since returned.
	   ``The government denounces the provocative violation of the air
space of the Republic of Cyprus by Turkish military aircraft and is
taking the necessary diplomatic action,'' the Cypriot government
spokesman, Christos Stylianides, said.
	   He said the government is ``calmly watching the Turkish attempts
to create artificial tension.''
	   Cyprus has been unofficially divided into a Greek Cypriot south
and Turkish occupied north since Turkey invaded in 1974 in the wake
of an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. The
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is only recognized by
Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   On Wednesday, Cyprus had protested the visit by Turkish warships
to ports in the Turkish-occupied north of the island.
	   International efforts led by the United States and the United
Nations to reunify the island remain deadlocked because of Turkish
Cypriot demands to be recognized as a separate entity.
	   Turkey's Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit assured Turkish Cypriots
that they were under the protection of Turkey.
	   ``Northern Cyprus will live either on its own or united with
Turkey,'' Ecevit said. ``There is no need for our Turkish Cypriot
brothers to worry.''
	   Private NTV television said Turkey also was planning to send a
cargo plane full of staff officers.
	   The tit-for-tat show of force coincided with an appeal by the
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to both sides to avoid any action
likely to increase tension.
	   Tension has been rising since last December when Cyprus ordered
S-300 antiaircraft missiles from Russia, which are due for delivery
later in the summer.
	   Turkey threatened it will prevent their deployment, prompting a
Greek warning that it will come to the aid of Cyprus if it is
attacked. This has raised the specter of hostilities between the
two countries which are both NATO allies.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ULRICHEN, Switzerland (AP) _ Markus Zberg outsprinted fellow
Swiss rider Niki Aebersold in a tight finish Thursday to win the
third stage of the Tour de Suisse.
	   Zberg took 3 hours 33 minutes 9 seconds to cover the 159.1
kilometers (98.9 miles) from Aigle to the finishing line at
Ulrichen's military airfield. Daniele Nardello of Italy took third
place.
	   Italy's Davide Rebellin, who won the second stage Wednesday with
a 41-second advantage over his nearest rivals, retained his overall
lead.
	   The top ten placings were unchanged after Thursday's mass sprint
finish in Ulrichen, with France's Laurent Jalabert remaining in
second place.
	   Giro d'Italia runner-up Pavel Tonkov of Russia broke away 18
kilometers (11.2 miles) before the stage finish.
	   Tonkov built up a 33-second lead before being caught by the main
peloton 11 kilometers (6.9 miles) later.
	   Friday's fourth stage of 208.8 kilometers (129.8 miles) will
take racers over the Alps from Oberwald to Varese, over the border
in Italy.
	   The 10-stage race finishes next Thursday in the Swiss capital,
Bern.

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ After 41 years living quietly along the
Atlantic coast southeast of Buenos Aires, Dinko Sakic, commander of
Croatia's deadliest World War II camp, returned to his native land
to face charges of wartime atrocities.
	   Wearing a brown jacket with another jacket flung over his
shoulders, possibly concealing handcuffs, the 76-year-old Sakic was
escorted off the Croatian Airlines Boeing 737 plane that brought
him from Frankfurt, Germany to a waiting police van.
	   Police said he was being driven straight to jail, where he will
await trial.
	   Earlier Thursday, Sakic had arrived in Frankfurt from Buenos
Aires, accompanied by three Croatian police officers.

Eds: FIXES spelling of `deregulating' in graf 2
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Starting Friday, Italian phone numbers will be a
little longer.
	   Italy's phone company, Telecom Italia, is requiring area codes
even for local calls. The longer numbers will allow for more lines
and enable Telecom to conform to new EU rules deregulating the
phone market, the company said.
	   For example, to make a call within Rome, you now need to dial
06, the city's area code, before the number. To call the Italian
capital from abroad you need to dial the country code, 39, as
before, then 06.
	   If you forget the new codes, you'll still get through, but only
until Dec. 31, 1998, when Telecom makes the changes final.

Red cards come out as Denmark-South Africa tie offered for stolen tickets; WILL be UPDATED with France-Saudi Arabia AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with Denmark-South Africa result, reward
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ On the day World Cup tickets went missing, red
cards were rediscovered.
	   Colombian referee John Jairo Toro ejected three players in
Thursday's 1-1 draw between Denmark and South Africa. Only four red
cards had been issued in the tournament's 20 previous games
combined.
	   Toro also issued seven yellow cards, seemingly becoming the
first referee at France '98 to take to heart FIFA's dictate that
rough play _ especially tackles from behind _ be severely punished.
	   Allan Nielsen scored in the first half for Denmark, and Benni
McCarthy netted South Africa's first-ever World Cup goal in the
second. The victory put Denmark in first place in Group C, pending
Thursday night's France-Saudi Arabia match.
	   Denmark finished the match nine-on-10 after Toro ejected
substitutes Miklos Molnar in the 67th and Morten Wieghorst in the
85th _ only three minutes after the latter entered the game. South
Africa's Alfred Phiri was expelled two minutes after Molnar.
	   Among the crowd at Stade Municipal in Toulouse was Crown Prince
Frederik, heir to the Danish throne, who no doubt obtained his
ticket through proper channels. There were others who resorted to
different means.
	   The Paris office of an American travel agency discovered
Thursday morning that, during the night, someone climbed the
scaffolding outside its building, got inside, broke into the safe
and stole nearly 15,000 tickets and hundreds of thousands of
dollars in cash.
	   In addition to the tickets, the burglars also took access badges
to get into the Stade de France, the centerpiece stadium of the
World Cup. The Georgia-based agency, Prime Sport International,
offered a ``no questions asked reward'' of 1 million francs (dlrs
166,000) for recovery of the tickets.
	   Wayward tickets and absent tickets have been a concern for
organizers since the World Cup began last week. An international
ticket fraud scandal has led to three arrests, and on Thursday
organizers asked France Telecom to launch an investigation into
reports that a confidential phone number allowed thousands to
unfairly buy huge numbers of tickets.
	   The daily Le Parisien reported that a special phone number _
leaked within France Telecom _ gave privileged callers direct
access to the central switchboard handling ticket sales. The paper
cited a person identified only as Frederic, a communications
student, who used the number to snap up more than 400 tickets.
	   An estimated 12,000 Japanese fans have been left ticketless by
the ticket fraud scandal, but there was no word as to whether
Frederic or the travel agency burglars were trying to sell their
tickets to any of the disgruntled visitors from Tokyo.
	   Thursday also brought a tearful apology from temperamental
striker, Faustino Asprilla, who asked to be reinstated to
Colombia's World Cup team.
	   ``I want to offer my apologies to the president (of the
Colombian Soccer Federation), his executive committee, the head
coach, my teammates, and, of course, the Colombian people,''
Asprilla said, reading a prepared statement.
	   Asprilla was kicked off the team after saying that coach Hernan
Dario Gomez ``disrespected'' him when he took him out of Colombia's
1-0 loss to Romania on Monday with five minutes remaining. The
furor has caught the attention of Colombian President Ernesto
Samper, who has also tried to persuade Gomez to reconsider his
decision.
	   ``If our head coach considers my being here important, I'm
willing to follow, enthusiastically and with discipline, all World
Cup rules, as I've always done,'' Asprilla said.
	   Gomez said he's studying the situation, but admitted he ``liked
what Faustino had to say.''
	   ``But I don't know what the decision will be,'' Gomez said.
``The truth is, those are nice words by Faustino.''
	   Meanwhile, in Marseille, where three days of fans violence
surrounded Monday's England-Tunisia game, authorities planned
increased security for Saturday's match between the Netherlands and
South Korea.
	   Some 2,000 regular police will be on weekend duty, along with
some 200 Anti-Criminal Brigade forces patrolling the city center.
Riot police also will be posted about town.
	   But, under pressure from cafe owners, authorities relented on a
weekend alcohol ban in Marseille and agreed to allow drinks to be
sold until midnight.

Kournikova beats Graf for place in semifinals
Eds: Updates with injury not serious, Kournikova quotes; will be
<TEXT>
	   EASTBOURNE, England (AP) _ In a victory of the new guard over
the old, 17-year-old Anna Kournikova overcame an angry Steffi Graf
in three sets Thursday to reach the semifinals of the Wimbledon
warmup tournament at Eastbourne.
	   Kournikova, a Wimbledon semifinalist last year, needed just over
two hours to beat the seven-time Wimbledon champion 6-7 (4-7), 6-3,
6-4.
	   The sixth-seeded Russian fell during the seventh game of the
final set and, after the match, was taken to a hospital for X-rays
on her right hand. No damage was found and she was declared fully
fit.
	   Kournikova's win follows other victories this year over Monica
Seles and Martina Hingis.
	   ``It's one of the best matches I've played,'' she said. ``It was
a great match. She fought and I did everything possible, and even
though I lost the first set I was still confident. She's one of the
greatest players ever, so obviously I feel good about myself going
into Wimbledon.''
	   The second-seeded Graf, playing in just her fourth tournament
since undergoing knee surgery a year ago, was infuriated by several
line calls.
	   After being broken to go down 5-4 in the final set, Graf spent
the entire changeover complaining to tournament director Brenda
Perry. She refused to shake hands with the chair umpire at the end
of the match.
	   ``There were too many bad calls,'' Graf said. ``I expect a few,
especially on grass, but not that many. It's frustrating because
you have a professional approach and you expect that from the
umpire as well. I was asking for the lines-people to be changed,
and I can't recall ever doing that before.
	   ``They didn't do a good job, and I didn't do a good job either.
I didn't take enough risks. I didn't really go enough to the net. I
was tentative and sometimes didn't really go for my forehand, and I
didn't really step into the ball. I had my chances and didn't take
them.''
	   The match produced high quality tennis, especially in the final
set, with both players rallying superbly and hitting spectacular
winners from all parts of the court.
	   In a battle of big forehands, it was Kournikova who impressed
most with a number of passes that skimmed the lines.
	   Graf was let down by her serve, with three of her seven
double-faults coming on break point.
	   Graf's first double-fault gave Kournikova a break for 3-1 in the
second set, another a break for 2-1 in the third and the last one
allowed the young Russian to serve for the match.
	   ``She really went for some great shots,'' Graf said. ``She came
in, she took more risks than I did, she approached very well. She
really played a good match.''
	   With only five matches on grass this year, Graf is still happy
with her preparations for Wimbledon.
	   ``Even though I'm not so happy about losing, I have a couple
more days to practice what I really need,'' she said. ``I think I'm
ready.''
	   In another quarterfinal, Natasha Zvereva downed Magui Serna 7-6
(7-5), 6-2.

Netanyahu call for stiff punishment for convicted arms dealer 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's prime minister said Thursday that he
personally ordered the arrest of an Israeli man convicted of
selling weapons components to Iran, prompting the convict's family
to charge the case was a result of American pressure.
	   Netanyahu said he hoped Nachum Manbar, who faces life in prison
for treason, would receive a stiff punishment when he is sentenced
July 15.
	   Manbar was found guilty Wednesday for illegally selling chemical
and biological weapon components to Iran for dlrs 16 million.
	   In July 1994, the U.S. State Department said Manbar and two of
his companies violated a U.S. trade embargo against Iran, and
Manbar was barred from the United States.
	   Israeli newspapers reported last year that U.S. officials asked
netanyahu to stop Manbar's activities and the CIA provided new
information to Israel on Manbar's links with Iran.
	   ``It seems to me that the trial was a result of American
pressure on Israel, based on claims that Israel was breaking their
embargo on Iran,'' Manbar's brother Zvi told Israel's Channel 2 TV.
	   Manbar was secretly arrested upon returning to Israel for a
visit in March 1997 and his trial was held behind closed-doors
except for the verdict hearing Wednesday. Sections of the court
decision were classified.
	   Netanyahu said Thursday that he could not recall such a harmful
and serious crime against the state.
	   ``From the moment I was convinced that there was a serious case,
I gave the order to arrest him during one of his visits to Israel.
I hope he pays a heavy price for the terrible deeds he committed,''
Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Manbar's lawyer Amnon Zichroni, one of the country's top
criminal defense attorneys, blasted the premier for his remarks,
saying they only served to harm his client.
	   ``The comments by the prime minister harm the case and are
against the law. The prime minister as a political figure cannot
give orders or advise on a legal matter,'' Zichroni said.
	   Manbar had denied any wrongdoing in his trial and in his defense
said he had coordinated his activities regarding Iran with Israel
security agents.

Cyprus protests air space violations by Turkish warplanes BY ALEX EFTY 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: INCORPORATES Turkey-Cyprus
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ In a show of force against similar action
by Greece, Turkey on Thursday sent six warplanes to northern
Cyprus, prompting Cyprus to accuse Turkey of creating ``artificial
tension.''
	   The six F-16 fighters roared low over both the Greek and Turkish
sectors of the divided capital, Nicosia, and the United Nations
buffer zone splitting the rest of the island, before landing at an
airbase in the north. Three of the aircraft returned to Turkey
hours later.
	   The move was in retaliation to the landing of four Greek F-16s
and two cargo planes at southern Greek Cypriot side on Tuesday.
	   ``Greece has exhibited its offensive intentions directed against
Turkey,'' Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said during a visit
to Romania on Thursday.
	   ``It is out of the question for Turkey not to respond to that,''
accordin to the Anatolia agency that carried his remarks.
	   Yilmaz, however, stressed that Turkey had no desire for a war in
Cyprus.
	   The Greek jets, which landed near Paphos town within the
framework of a five-year joint defense agreement between Greek
Cypriots and Greece, also have since returned.
	   ``The government denounces the provocative violation of the air
space of the Republic of Cyprus by Turkish military aircraft and is
taking the necessary diplomatic action,'' said Cypriot government
spokesman Christos Stylianides.
	   He said the government is ``calmly watching the Turkish attempts
to create artificial tension.''
	   Cyprus has been unofficially divided into a Greek Cypriot south
and Turkish occupied north since Turkey invaded in 1974 in the wake
of an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. The
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is only recognized by
Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   On Wednesday, Cyprus protested the visit by Turkish warships to
ports in the Turkish-occupied north of the island.
	   International efforts led by the United States and the United
Nations to reunify the island remain deadlocked because of Turkish
Cypriot demands to be recognized as a separate entity.
	   Turkey's Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit assured Turkish Cypriots
that they were under the protection of Turkey.
	   ``Northern Cyprus will live either on its own or united with
Turkey,'' Ecevit said. ``There is no need for our Turkish Cypriot
brothers to worry.''
	   Private NTV television said Turkey also planned to send a cargo
plane full of staff officers.
	   The show of force coincided with an appeal by the U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to both sides to avoid any action
likely to increase tension.
	   Tension has been rising since last December when Cyprus ordered
S-300 antiaircraft missiles from Russia, which are due for delivery
later in the summer.
	   Turkey threatened it will prevent their deployment, prompting a
Greek warning that it will come to the aid of Cyprus if it is
attacked. This has raised the specter of hostilities between the
two countries, which are both NATO allies.

Politician's trip to Mir scaled back 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In another sign of the deep money troubles
grounding Russia's space program, Mission Control announced
Thursday that it will cut short a prominent politician's visit to
the Mir space station.
	   Yuri Baturin, a former Defense Council Secretary and
presidential advisor, had been scheduled to spend three weeks on
the orbiting station in August. He will now spend just 13 days, the
Interfax news agency reported, citing Mission Control.
	   Critics call the mission a wasteful junket, while supporters
argue that sending a well-known politician into orbit could provide
publicity and possibly win more funds for the struggling space
program.
	   Yeltsin dismissed Baturin as secretary of the powerful Defense
Council last year and fired him from his remaining post of
presidential aide earlier this year.
	   However, the mission was not canceled, and Baturin said the
dismissals would make it possible to concentrate on his
preparations.
	   Baturin, 48, is a physicist by training. He is set to blast off
to the station on Aug. 2 or 3, accompanied by two new cosmonauts,
Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev.
	   Interfax said a final decision on Baturin's trip will be made
two weeks before launch to ensure that funding is available.

Four famous paintings stolen in 1969 were found in United States 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Four famous paintings _ including a
Titian _ stolen in 1969 from Brukenthal Museum in Sibiu,
Transylvania and now likely worth millions of dollars were found in
the United States, officials said Thursday.
	   ``This is an extraordinary event,'' said Alexandru Lungu,
director of the Brukental museum.
	   A Foreign Ministry listed the paintings and their value as:
``Man with skull,'' by an anonymous Dutch painter, worth dlrs
250,000; ``Ecce Homo'' by Titian, valued at just dlrs 20,000; ``Man
with pipe standing at the window,'' by Frans van Mieris, worth dlrs
25,000 and ``Portrait of a woman with a King Charles spaniel,' by
Rosalba Carriera, worth dlrs 1,500.
	   Lungu said the paintings were last officially valued 50 years
ago and were now worth much more.
	   The Brukenthal Museum is in Sibiu, 225 kilometers (141 miles)
northwest of Bucharest, and has a valuable collection of thousands
of paintings, mostly Italian, Flemish and Dutch artists from the
16th to 18th centuries.
	   In 1969, eight paintings were stolen from the museum by
unidentified thieves. The other four paintings, which have not been
found, are ``Cleopatra's death'' by Anton van Dyck, ``Portrait of
an'' by Cristoph Amberger, ``Man with a fur coat'' by a 16th
century German anonymous painter and ``Portrait of a man'' by Jorg
Brew.
	   Recently, an American citizen who bought the four paintings
which have now been recovered was told by art experts they are
stolen and wanted by Interpol.
	   He brought them immediately to the U.S. Customs Service in
Miami, Florida. He asked police to not make his name public.

Eds: UPDATES with Sakic in Zagreb, taken straight to jail, changes
By SNJEZANA VUKIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ After 41 years living quietly along the
Atlantic coast southeast of Buenos Aires, the commander of
Croatia's deadliest World War II camp returned Thursday to his
native land to face charges of wartime atrocities.
	   Wearing a brown jacket with another jacket flung over his
shoulders, Dinko Sakic, 76, was escorted off the Croatian Airlines
Boeing 737 plane that brought him from Frankfurt, Germany to a
waiting police van.
	   Police said he was being driven straight to jail, where he will
await trial.
	   Earlier Thursday, Sakic arrived in Frankfurt from Buenos Aires,
accompanied by three Croatian police officers.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Apparently moving away from their
long-held policy of peaceful resistance to Serbia's harsh rule,
Kosovo Albanian leaders have called for organizing village defenses
against Serbian forces.
	   The move was seen Thursday as a bid to recapture public support
that has swung to the Kosovo Liberation Army and gain some control
over the militants, who are leading an armed struggle for
independence from Serbia.
	   It also was indicative of a growing rift between the Kosovo
Albanians' pacifist president, Ibrahim Rugova, whom the West has
supported, and other Kosovo Albanian politicians as fighting in the
province continues.
	   Representatives of five Kosovo political parties, including
Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo, met Wednesday in Tirana,
Albania, with Bujar Bukoshi, the prime minister of the province's
government-in-exile.
	   Afterward, Bukoshi, who lives in Germany, said the government
would appoint its own people in Kosovo villages to organize
defenses against Serbia's anti-insurgency campaign.
	   He said the government would use all its resources to help
ethnic Albanians defend themselves. Asked if that included military
resources, Bukoshi repeated twice: ``All the resources.''
	   The government collects money from Kosovo Albanians working
abroad and funnels it back to Kosovo.
	   Top officials of Rugova's party in Pristina, the provincial
capital of Kosovo, indicated their disapproval of the plan Thursday
by refusing to comment.
	   Adem Demaci, a veteran fighter for Kosovo Albanian rights who
has spent 26 years in Yugoslav jails and now heads an opposition
party, said he welcomed the proposal as long as it meant aiding the
KLA and not trying to start a new defense force.
	   ``We have a resistance that is working and working very well,''
he said. Bukoshi ``is late if he wants to create something new.''
	   But whether the KLA would agree to surrender its authority and
work with the government was unknown.
	   In interviews this week, the guerrilla army's new spokesman
dismissed Rugova as defeatist and said all Albanian politicians in
Kosovo should line up behind the KLA.
	   Others felt the move could help harness a military force that
has been operating without any political control.
	   Baton Haxhiu, a journalist with the Albanian-language Koha
Ditore newspaper in Pristina, said the government plan, if
successful, would ``direct the Albanian strength and manpower on
the ground into legitimate institutions.
	   ``It's the only way some semblance of control and order can come
to a situation where you have anarchy among people in the cut-off
areas,'' he added.
	   The growing support for militants in the secessionist province
of southern Serbia comes amid a Serb campaign that has driven some
60,000 people from their homes since March. More than 300 people
have died in clashes between Serbs and militants.
	   Serb and Albanian sources reported fighting Thursday near the
village of Iglarevo, some 35 kilometers (21 miles) west of
Pristina, on the main east-west artery.
	   Serb sources said Albanian militants attacked a police patrol
with automatic weapons and rocket launchers, killing one officer
and wounding five others.
	   Albanian sources, meanwhile, claimed more Serb shelling of
villages near the Albanian border and said Serb forces were
shipping in reinforcements.
	   The Yugoslav army has been trying to seal that border to close
an escape route for Kosovo Albanian militants and stop them from
smuggling in arms and supplies.
	   But there were signs the traffic was moving elsewhere.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center reported that a Yugoslav army border
patrol opened fire on a group of armed Albanians trying to enter
Kosovo from Macedonia.

World Cup: Danes hold on for 1-1 draw 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with more quotes; Optional upcoming.
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Denmark got a first-half goal by Allan
Nielsen and survived a card-strewn battle with South Africa to get
a 1-1 draw Thursday, moving it within sight of the second round of
the World Cup.
	   The draw gave Denmark four points and moved it atop Group C
pending the outcome of Thursday night's match between France and
Saudi Arabia. The result left South Africa's hopes mathematically
alive, but little realistic chance.
	   ``It's not finished for us. We have the possibility to
advance,'' South Africa coach Philippe Troussier said.
	   Denmark ended the match playing nine-on-10 after Colombian
referee John Jairo Toro ejected Danish substitutes Miklos Molnar in
the 67th and Morten Wieghorst in the 85th _ only three minutes
after the latter entered the game.
	   Denmark coach Bo Johansson refused to comment on the referee,
and said his team must play much better against France in next
week's final Group C match.
	   ``You have all seen what happened. I don't want to say anything
about about it,'' a smiling Johannson said. ``If we ever think we
know how a game will be, we should remember this game.''
	   Alfred Phiri was ejected two minutes after Molnar in a game
which in addition to the three reds saw seven yellows issued.
	   The flood of red cards nearly matched the four issued in the
first 20 games and came only a day after FIFA president Sepp
Blatter criticized referees for not being tough enough, saying if
necessary he would personally remind officials of the rules.
	   South Africa tied the match in the 53rd minute, but the second
half degenerated into series of fouls, leaving little opportunity
for serious chances.
	   Benni McCarthy scored South Africa's first World Cup goal in its
history when he ran onto Shaun Bartlett's backheel touch off a pass
from John Moshoeu.
	   McCarthy received the ball between Jes Hogh and Soren Colding
and rolled it between the legs of Danish keeper Peter Schmeichel.
	   South Africa just missed the game winner in the first minute of
second-half injury time when Quinton Fortune blasted a ball from
the top of the penalty area off the crossbar.
	   ``I think we deserved to score one more goal,'' Troussier said.
``In the last 25 minutes we really wanted it. We really wanted to
win this game.''
	   Denmark dominated the first half but missed its chances to put
the game away, putting two balls off the right post.
	   Nielsen volleyed Brian Laudrup's cross at the far post in the
13th minute to give Denmark the lead, deflecting it in off
goalkeeper Hans Vonk's hand.
	   Looking to help his country into the second round, Crown Prince
Frederik, heir to the Danish throne and oldest son of Queen
Margrethe II, was among the crowd at Stade Municipal.
	   Denmark came within centimeters of a second goal on a corner by
Martin Jorgensen, whose in-bending kick floated over Vonk and
banged off the far post.
	   The rebound came to Laudrup, who put a diving header from six
meters into the stomach of a sprawled Vonk.
	   Denmark hit the same post again in the 42nd when Ebbe Sand
ripped a right-footed shot from the top of the penalty area.
	   South Africa's best chance came in the 28th minute when McCarthy
sent in a rolling cross off a busted play through the goal box, but
an onrushing Helman Mkhalele couldn't get his foot to it to poke it
in.
	   The South Africans also failed to finish on a loose ball in the
penalty are in the 22nd when Piere Issa's one shot was blocked
before Jorgensen was able to dribble it out of danger.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   South Africa: Hans Vonk; Mark Fish, Pierre Issa, David Nyathi

	   MONTREAL (AP) _ A commuter plane caught fire after take-off,
then crash-landed and exploded Thursday at Mirabel airport near
Montreal, killing all 11 people aboard, authorities said.
	   The fire broke out minutes after the twin-engine turboprop left
Dorval, another Montreal-area airport, on a flight to Peterborough,
Ontario.
	   ``Once in the air, the pilot, in discussion with the tower,
advised them there was some smoke in the cockpit,'' said police
Cpl. Pierre Giguere. ``At that time, the plane was redirected to
Mirabel, where it crashed.''
	   Emergency vehicles were waiting and put out the fire ``as
quickly as humanly possible,'' but all nine passengers and two crew
members were killed, said Ray Monette, manager at Mirabel. The
airport is 30 miles (50 kilometers) northwest of Montreal.
	   ``The plane was on final approach _ engulfed in flames,''
Monette said. ``It would seem the pilot did succeed in landing the
plane. But then the aircraft exploded and veered off the runway.''
	   Federal investigators were examining the wreckage for clues as
to why the fire broke out.
	   Constable Gilles Deziel, a police officer who inspected the
crash site, said the plane was on its roof, about 150 feet (45
meters) from the runway.
	   ``Maybe three-quarters of the plane was all burned and all
black,'' he said. ``It appeared to be missing one wing and probably
a motor.''

Cronje and Rhodes save the day for South Africa 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Jonty Rhodes and Hansie Cronje saved the day for
South Africa with a defiant middle-order partnership after
England's Dominic Cork had the visitors in early trouble at Lord's
Thursday.
	   Cork sent South Africa crashing to 46 for four after a fine
spell of seam and swing bowling before Cronje and Rhodes came to
the crease.
	   The pair shared an 89 run partnership in 79 minutes to steer the
side to a more respectable 135 for four at stumps on a
rain-affected first day of the second test.
	   But it was an England mistake which allowed Rhodes to stay at
the crease.
	   Former skipper Mike Atherton dropped a chance at second slip off
the last ball of Dean Headley's first over when Rhodes was 10.
South Africa was precariously poised at 59 for four at that stage.
	   Rhodes, South Africa's inform batsman, continued from where he
left off in Edgbaston, where he scored 95 and a fine unbeaten 47.
	   His 54-ball innings included a hooked six off Cork and seven
other boundaries and completely overshadowed his captain's presence
at the other end.
	   Cronje, struggling to find form, took almost an hour to reach
double figures but once settled in, was happy playing second fiddle
to his junior partner.
	   Cronje played a typical captain's innings in what is South
Africa's 50th test since their readmission to international
cricket.
	   His 38 runs came in 90 minutes.
	   The pair took 24 in Headley's three overs and 28 in Cork's last
four as he finished a 14-over spell.
	   Just two and a half hours of play was possible after the start
was delayed by nearly two hours.
	   Cork, 26, was simply unplayable until the fifth wicket pair
joined to resurrect a sagging innings. Cork claimed 4-19 before tea
in a 44-ball spell either side of a 75-minute stoppage for rain.
	   He fully vindicated Alec Stewart's decision to send South Africa
in under extremely overcast conditions.
	   Bowling from the Nursery end, from where he destroyed the West
Indies with 7-43 on his test debut in 1995, he made batting look a
nightmare.
	   Playing and missing was the order of the early afternoon as Cork
removed Gary Kirsten and Jacques Kallis in his first three overs
and then Adam Bacher (22) and Daryll Cullinan (16) in the space of
seven balls.
	   It has been a dream return to test cricket for Cork, who spent
16 months out of the England squad until his recall for the first
test. He vindicated his selection with 5-93.
	   In the dismissal of the match so far, Cork, systematically
removed No.3 batsman Kallis. He softened the former Middlesex
opener with two unplayable outswingers. Kallis then played down the
wrong line, expecting an inswinger, but a straight ball took out
his off stump.
	   Recalled after a two-test absence, opening batsmen Adam Bacher
appeared to have settled in comfortably when he misjudged an
outswinger to present Stewart with the first of his two catches.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Nearly 15,000 World Cup tickets and hundreds of
thousands of dollars in cash have been stolen from the Paris office
of an American travel agency, authorities said Thursday.

soccer federation FIFA threatened punitive measures Thursday.
	   Georgia-based Prime Sport International offered ``no questions

tickets that were stolen overnight. It also promised to reimburse

Eds: UPDATES to LEDE with Solana comment on Kosovo situation,
By MATTI HUUHTANEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana on
Thursday praised the alliance's display of air power over Albania
and Macedonia earlier this week, and said no further military
action was planned for now.
	   ``The objective was to show the capacity to project air (power)
to the region at short notice, and we were able to do that. It was
a great success,'' Solana told a news conference.
	   ``We don't have any plans for any (further) exercises of this
type at this moment,'' he added.
	   On Monday, NATO flew 80 warplanes over Albania and Macedonia,
hoping that might prod Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
curtail his police and armed forces aggressions in Kosovo province,
located near the Albanian border.
	   Strife between Serbs and ethnic Albanians, who make up about 90
percent of the Kosovo population, has mounted as residents press
for political autonomy and Serbia, responding to what it perceives
to be a separatist movement, has cracked down.
	   More than 300 people, mostly civilians, have died in the area
since March. Thousands have fled their homes, the refugees often
fleeing across national borders.
	   On Tuesday, Russia extracted a promise from Milosevic to resume
peace talks with the moderate leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
Solana said he hoped the meeting would help calm tensions in the
region.
	   ``We will be prepared to help the international community if
necessary to back up what (measures) are necessary to take,''
Solana said, adding, however, that ``something very important was
missing'' from the Moscow agreement.
	   ``That important thing that was missing was the withdrawal of
paramilitary forces from the region ... and the possibility of some
type of international mediation,'' Solana said.
	   Solana said he did not expect Kosovo to flare up into a crisis
like the 1992-1995 Bosnian war.
	   ``If action is necessary, I'm sure that we will have the
appropriate legal basis to act,'' Solana said. ``The countries that
do not allow that to happen will have to bear the responsibility.''
	   Solana stopped briefly in Helsinki amid a tour of the three
former Soviet and now independent Baltic republics. Earlier
Thursday, in Riga, he urged Latvia to approve legal amendments
easing citizenship requirements for its large Russian minority.
	   Latvia's Foreign Ministry said that the NATO chief also assured
them that the alliance remained open to the Baltic to join the
alliance, despite Moscow's concerns.
	   Since gaining independence after 50 years of Soviet occupation,
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have made NATO membership a top
foreign policy goal, as a vital security guarantee. However, the
militaries of all three Baltic states still fall short of NATO
standards.

Chief of Staff reportedly accuses Netanyahu of lying 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's military chief of staff has reportedly
accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of lying to the public
when the premier downplayed reports of silencing the chief of staff
during a recent Cabinet meeting.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman called the report inaccurate.
	   Netanyahu and Lt. Gen. Amnon Shahak started out on shaky terms
when Netanyahu took office two years ago and their relationship has
dwindled ever since.
	   At Sunday's Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu reportedly cut short
Shahak's military intelligence briefing on the Palestinians, saying
the armed forces chief had overstepped his role by reporting on
political matters.
	   Several versions of the exchange were reported by Israeli
military and political correspondents before Netanyahu said the
reports had been exaggerated.
	   Netanyahu told reporters that the Cabinet had been discussing a
possible international conference on the Mideast peace process
Egypt is keen on organizing and that the matter was political and
not related to military briefings.
	   But Israel's Channel 2 reported Thursday that Shahak had been
briefing the Cabinet on sensitive intelligence material related to
discussions by Arab leaders to hold a Summit condemning Israel,
when Netanyahu abruptly silenced him.
	   Channel 2 said Shahak wrote Netanyahu that the Cabinet protocol
reflected the above version of events and not as the premier had
told reporters.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak said ``the report is inaccurate
and not serious.''
	   Shahak, a charismatic general who helped formulate peace deals
with the Palestinians under the previous Labor government, leaves
his post in two weeks and is expected to become a major player in
Israeli politics and a possible challenger to Netanyahu in the 2000
elections.

World Cup: US players not thinking politics AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES (AP) _ Forget the ayatollah, forget the
shah, forget the hostages. American players are a lot more
interested in points than politics.
	   ``We want to win the game for all the right reasons, the three
points,'' Eric Wylnalda said Sunday's World Cup matchup against
Iran. ``From their perspective, I can't comment.''
	   While there are many rivalries and grudge matches in sports, its
rare for one team's backers to denounce their opponent as ``The
Great Satan,'' the term Iran has used for the United States since
the Islamic Revolution in 1979. In an effort to avoid trouble,
French police have stepped up security at the U.S. camp, adding
additional plainclothes officers.
	   And while some teams get into a war of words, the Iranian
government has gotten into a war of films, upset by a French
television broadcast of ``Not Without My Daughter,'' a 1991 movie
based on the true story of an American woman who escaped Iran with
her daughter against the wishes of her Iranian husband.
	   ``It's a good movie,'' U.S. defender Alexi Lalas said Thursday,
speaking tongue-in-cheek about the film, which got negative
reviews. ``Sally Field did a tremendous job in that movie. I've
seen it several times myself.''
	   Then Lalas turned serious.
	   ``If they've been insulted by a movie that's being shown,
they've got bigger problems,'' he said. ``That means nothing to
us.''
	   Sunday's game has bigger political implications for Iran's
government, which often denounces the United States. For the teams,
it has equal importance.
	   Both lost their openers _ the United States 2-0 to Germany and
Iran 1-0 to Yugoslavia. Either would be eliminated by a loss.
	   ``We have a lot of pressure, much more than we had against
Germany,'' captain Thomas Dooley said. ``We had almost none against
Germany.''
	   U.S. coach Steve Sampson is toying with major changes to his
lineup. Tab Ramos and Frankie Hejduk, both second-half subs against
Germany, will start. It's possible he may alter his 3-6-1 formation
and start two forwards.
	   And with Iran starting a much shorter team than Germany, he may
use Lalas or Marcelo Balboa to increase his team's height and add
muscle.
	   ``I don't look at it too much in the politics,'' Balboa said.
``It's another game. We have to play our game, get our result in
order for us to advance.''
	   The average age of the U.S. roster was 10 when the hostage
crisis at the U.S. embassy in Tehran began in 1979.
	   ``I don't remember much about it at all,'' Ernie Stewart said.
``I knew there was a situation.''
	   In a coincidence, Iran coach Jalal Talebi once coached at
Foothill Junior College in Los Altos Hills, Calif., where Sampson
played and was an assistant coach _ though at a different time.
Talebi says during the 1994 World Cup he met Sampson, then an
assistant to Bora Milutinovic.
	   Sampson didn't remember.
	   `You meet a lot of people with Bora,'' he said.
	   Iran's players say they plan to make a special gesture to the
U.S. team in a sign of friendship, and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has called for a movement toward re-establishing
diplomatic relations between the United States and Iran.
	   ``Before the game, we're going to shake hands, and afterwards
we're going to exchange shirts,'' Wynalda said. ``That should be a
good example for the world.''
	   Still, Iranian exiles have made anonymous threats to disrupt the
game, and an Iranian fan shouted Wednesday at Lalas during a trip
to Lyon.
	   ``Just some punk who wanted to say he cussed me out,'' Lalas
said.
	   U.S. players seem to think the game won't aggravate the
relationship between the nations, even though it could be physical.
Iran had 30 fouls in its opener against Yugoslavia.
	   ``I think all of us understand the implications of the game and
we're excited about it,'' Wynalda said. ``It's an opportunity for
the sport of soccer to bring two nations together. It's the beauty
of the World Cup.''

Kosovo political leaders move to reclaim support for militants reports of fighting Thursday. No pickup. Changes byline.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Apparently moving away from their
long-held policy of peaceful resistance to Serbia's harsh rule,
Kosovo Albanian leaders have called for organizing village defenses
against Serbian forces in the separatist province.
	   The move was seen Thursday as a bid to recapture public support
that has swung to the Kosovo Liberation Army and to gain some
control over the militants who are leading an armed struggle for
independence from Serbia.
	   It also was indicative of a growing rift between the Kosovo
Albanians' pacifist president, Ibrahim Rugova, whom the West has
supported, and other Kosovo Albanian politicians.
	   The growing support for the KLA comes amid a Serb campaign that
has driven some 60,000 people from their homes since March. More
than 300 people have died.
	   Serb and Albanian sources reported fighting Thursday near the
village of Iglarevo, some 35 kilometers (21 miles) west of the
provincial capital Pristina, on the main east-west artery.
	   In nearby Tirana, Albania, on Wednesday, representatives of five
Kosovo political parties, including Rugova's Democratic League of
Kosovo, met with Bujar Bukoshi, prime minister of the province's
government-in-exile.
	   Afterward, Bukoshi, who lives in Germany, said the government
would appoint people in Kosovo villages to organize defenses
against Serb attacks. He said the government would use all its
resources to help ethnic Albanians defend themselves. Asked if that
included military resources, Bukoshi repeated twice: ``All the
resources.''
	   The government collects money from Kosovo Albanians working
abroad and funnels it back to Kosovo.
	   Top officials of Rugova's party in Pristina indicated their
disapproval of the plan Thursday by refusing to comment.
	   Adem Demaci, a veteran fighter for Kosovo Albanian rights who
has spent 26 years in Yugoslav jails and now heads an opposition
party, said he welcomed the proposal as long as it meant aiding the
KLA and not trying to start a new defense force.
	   ``We have a resistance that is working and working very well,''
he said. Bukoshi ``is late if he wants to create something new.''
	   But whether the KLA would agree to surrender its authority and
work with the government was unknown.
	   In interviews this week, the guerrilla army's new spokesman
dismissed Rugova as defeatist and said all Albanian politicians in
Kosovo should line up behind the KLA.
	   Others felt the move could help harness a military force that
has been operating without any political control.
	   Baton Haxhiu, a journalist with the Albanian-language Koha
Ditore newspaper in Pristina, said the government plan, if
successful, would ``direct the Albanian strength and manpower on
the ground into legitimate institutions.
	   ``It's the only way some semblance of control and order can come
to a situation where you have anarchy among people in the cut-off
areas,'' he said.
	   Meantime, Serb sources said Albanian militants attacked a police
patrol with automatic weapons and rocket launchers, killing one
officer and wounding five others.
	   Albanian sources claimed more Serb shelling of villages near the
Albanian border and said Serb forces were bringing reinforcements.
The Yugoslav army has been trying to seal the Albanian border to
close an escape route for Kosovo Albanian militants and stop them
from smuggling in arms and supplies.
	   But there were signs the traffic was moving elsewhere.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center reported a Yugoslav army border patrol
opened fire on a group of armed Albanians trying to enter from
neighboring Macedonia.

Iran coach: We will treat US players same as others 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: FIXES T-shirts to jerseys in 6th graf
By ANWAR FARUQI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) _ Though he expects his team to play
hard against the United States, Iran's World Cup coach said
Thursday his players will accord the same kind of courtesy to the
Americans as they would to other teams.
	   Because of the 20 years of bad blood between the two countries,
Sunday's game in Lyon has political significance _ especially
following U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's remarks
Wednesday that the United States was ready to start normalizing
ties with Iran.
	   Coach Jalal Talebi, who has a home in California where his
Iranian wife and three sons still live, said Albright's comments
were ``good news for us. I am really happy to hear that.''
	   Despite the relations between the two governments, Talebi said
his players would act no differently on the field. Asked if his
players would have a problem with standing for the American
national anthem, he said ``I can guarantee there is no problem with
that.''
	   Asked if players were hostile toward the American team, he said:
``100 percent, no.''
	   In Tehran, hard-line opponents of good ties with the United
States have demanded that the government instruct players not to
exchange jerseys with the Americans after the game.
	   ``If an American player comes up to an Iranian player after the
game and wants to exchange T-shirts, I don't think we'll say no.
We'll be more than happy to do that,'' said Talebi.
	   While the game noteworthy politically, it's also crucial from a
competitive standpoint: The loser will be virtually eliminated from
making the next round.
	   Iran lost 1-0 to Yugoslavia and the United States fell 2-0 to
Germany in their opening matches. Talebi suggested the Iranians
would have been happy with a draw against Yugoslavia, but that a
win is needed against the Americans.
	   ``We will play harder in our next game because we need to win to
stay in the competition. With Yugoslavia, all we wanted was not to
lose,'' Talebi told reporters at a press conference he attended
with his top striker, Ali Daei.
	   ``We are going to go against the United States only to get our
three points,'' said Daei.
	   Talebi said he was not sure that midfielder Reza Shahroudi and
team captain and goalkeeper Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh would be able to
play Sunday. Both have injured legs and missed the game with
Yugoslavia.
	   Iran's backup goalkeeper, Nima Nakissa, is seven years younger
than the 32-year-old Abedzadeh. Nakissa earned only his eighth cap
against Yugoslavia, while Abedzadeh has 70.

Kournikova beats Graf for place in semifinals
Eds: Updates with other quarterfinals suspended
<TEXT>
	   EASTBOURNE, England (AP) _ In a victory of the new guard over
the old, 17-year-old Anna Kournikova overcame an angry Steffi Graf
in three sets Thursday to reach the semifinals of the Wimbledon
warmup tournament at Eastbourne.
	   Kournikova, a Wimbledon semifinalist last year, needed just over
two hours to beat the seven-time Wimbledon champion 6-7 (4-7), 6-3,
6-4.
	   The sixth-seeded Russian fell during the seventh game of the
final set and, after the match, was taken to a hospital for X-rays
on her right hand. No damage was found and she was declared fully
fit.
	   Kournikova's win follows other victories this year over Monica
Seles and Martina Hingis.
	   ``It's one of the best matches I've played,'' she said. ``It was
a great match. She fought and I did everything possible, and even
though I lost the first set I was still confident. She's one of the
greatest players ever, so obviously I feel good about myself going
into Wimbledon.''
	   The second-seeded Graf, playing in just her fourth tournament
since undergoing knee surgery a year ago, was infuriated by several
line calls.
	   After being broken to go down 5-4 in the final set, Graf spent
the entire changeover complaining to tournament director Brenda
Perry. She refused to shake hands with the chair umpire at the end
of the match.
	   ``There were too many bad calls,'' Graf said. ``I expect a few,
especially on grass, but not that many. It's frustrating because
you have a professional approach and you expect that from the
umpire as well. I was asking for the lines-people to be changed,
and I can't recall ever doing that before.
	   ``They didn't do a good job, and I didn't do a good job either.
I didn't take enough risks. I didn't really go enough to the net. I
was tentative and sometimes didn't really go for my forehand, and I
didn't really step into the ball. I had my chances and didn't take
them.''
	   The match produced high quality tennis, especially in the final
set, with both players rallying superbly and hitting spectacular
winners from all parts of the court.
	   In a battle of big forehands, it was Kournikova who impressed
most with a number of passes that skimmed the lines.
	   Graf was let down by her serve, with three of her seven
double-faults coming on break point.
	   Graf's first double-fault gave Kournikova a break for 3-1 in the
second set, another a break for 2-1 in the third and the last one
allowed the young Russian to serve for the match.
	   ``She really went for some great shots,'' Graf said. ``She came
in, she took more risks than I did, she approached very well. She
really played a good match.''
	   With only five matches on grass this year, Graf is still happy
with her preparations for Wimbledon.
	   ``Even though I'm not so happy about losing, I have a couple
more days to practice what I really need,'' she said. ``I think I'm
ready.''
	   In another quarterfinal, Natasha Zvereva downed Magui Serna 7-6
(7-5), 6-2.
	   Third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Serena Williams were
level 4-6, 6-4 when rain forced the match to be postponed until
Friday.

Indian defense honchos, industry close ranks to face sanctions 
</HEADLINE>
By NEELESH MISRA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's nuclear guru and its
tough-talking defense minister sat with captains of industry
Thursday to discuss ways around economic sanctions imposed after
last month's nuclear tests.
	   ``We have to find (an) adequate response to these challenges,''
Press Trust of India quoted Defense Minister George Fernandes as
saying at a meeting of top defense ministry officials and members
of the Confederation of Indian Industry, a leading industry group.
	   The United States has completed paperwork for sanctions to be
imposed against India and rival neighbor Pakistan, which followed
with its own tests two weeks later. A formal announcement is
expected this week.
	   Assistant Secretary Karl Inderfurth, who heads the State
Department's South Asia bureau, said in Washington on Tuesday that
the sanctions ``will hurt.''
	   Analysts say the worst impact could be on India's six-year
economic reform program, which opened up the mostly
government-owned sectors of the economy to competition and tried to
rid domestic industry of decades of sloth.
	   The United States is the largest foreign direct investor in
India, the industry ministry said in its annual report for 1997-98
released Thursday. It is also India's largest trading partner, and
a strong implementation of the sanctions regime could cut off the
country from crucial transfer of technology and aid for
infrastructure and development projects.
	   A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, head of the Defense Research and Development
Organization and often described as the father of India's nuclear
program, said New Delhi was ready to cope with the denial of
technology to the country's defense establishment and industry.
	   Kalam said India had for years been denied technology for the
development of its Prithvi and Agni missiles, which experts see as
the mainstay of its nuclear delivery system, but its scientists had
nonetheless carried on with the projects.
	   The Agni missile is the centerpiece of India's dlrs 300 million
missile program and is believed to have a range of 1,550 miles
(2,500 kilometers). The Prithvi, a short-range ballistic missile,
can hit targets within 95 miles (150 kilometers) and has been
tested 16 times.
	   ``We have successfully come out of the challenges and we even
have our own supercomputers, which were denied to us,'' Kalam said
at the meeting.
	   Fernandes announced that seven defense laboratories would be
opened up to private industry for partnership in the research,
production and marketing of military equipment.
	   The domestic industry's role in defense design and production
would then increase to 30 percent from the current 10 percent,
Kalam said.

Free Trade Area of the Americas: groundwork laid for return to Miami 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Negotiators on Thursday laid the
groundwork for September's launch of formal talks on a Free Trade
Area of the Americas, a bold plan to create the biggest duty-free
zone on Earth.
	   Meeting in Buenos Aires, nine working groups made headway on
preliminary draft chapters toward a proposed accord that would link
the economies of 34 Western democracies by 2005.
	   ``The negotiations were surprisingly smooth,'' Jorge Campbell,
Argentina's secretary for international economic relations, said on
the second of two days of planned talks.
	   Negotiators reported fewer-than-expected problems in creating an
early framework for negotiations that are to address such topics as
investment, agriculture, government procurement, intellectual
property rights, and services.
	   As much as anything, the negotiators talked about how to talk _
and what role ``civil society'' _ the private sector _ might play
in seeking a Free Trade Area from Alaska to Argentina's Tierra del
Fuego.
	   ``The issue of civil society will be difficult,'' Campbell
predicted.
	   He cited the lack of precedent of a private sector role in free
trade negotiations, and the different relationships between civil
societies and their governments throughout the Americas.
	   Four years ago in Miami, U.S. President Clinton stood with 33
fellow Western Hemisphere leaders and announced the ambitious goal
of joining nearly 800 million people and economies totaling dlrs 9
trillion.
	   Formal negotiations to create this zone will begin in September
in Miami, but the absence of so-called ``fast track'' authority for
Clinton lingered in the shadows of the preliminary talks _ much as
it did at April's Second Summit of the Americas, in Chile.
	   Fast track requires the U.S. Congress to approve or reject
outright _ with no amendments _ trade treaties negotiated by the
executive branch.
	   But the issue has bogged down amid debate over whether to
include labor and environmental issues within fast-track powers, an
effort generally opposed by the Republican majority in the U.S.
Congress.
	   The lack of fast track ``isn't good for ... Latin American
countries in particular,'' said Jose Alfredo Graca Lima, a
Brazilian negotiator. ``On the other hand, we don't want to see a
fast track conditioned on labor and environmental terms.''
	   His comments echoed those of Argentine Foreign Minister Guido de
Tella, who opened discussions Wednesday by warning that the talks
could falter if Clinton fails to receive fast-track power next
year.
	   Others have sounded more upbeat, including a Canadian negotiator
who reported finding ``strong willingness to reach agreement and
move forward'' by the working groups here.
	   ``Fast track is a black cloud hanging over our heads, but it
hasn't started raining yet,'' said Kathryn McCallion, the Canadian.
``There will be a drop dead date, but we still have a lot of work
to do before that.''
	   Already, skeptics have suggested the time for the United States
to seize the free-trade initiative may have passed, with Latin
American countries forming other economic alliances instead _ among
each other and with markets in Asia and Europe.

World War II crimes suspect arrives home for trial 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with quotes from Croatian officials.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ More than 50 years after fleeing the
ruins of Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet state, the commander of
its most notorious death camp returned home under police escort
Thursday to await trial on atrocity charges.
	   Dinko Sakic, 76, spent half a century living quietly on the
Atlantic coast southeast of the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires,
before a manhunt started in April following a TV interview in which
he admitted being commander at Jasenovac camp, but denied mass
murder was committed there.
	   His trial is expected to polarize Croatia, which in 1991
declared independence from Yugoslavia and relived World War II
enmities by battling the Serbs _ Jasenovac's major victims _ to
secure their fledgling state.
	   Wearing a brown jacket, with another jacket over his shoulders
possibly concealing handcuffs, Sakic was hustled from the Croatian
Airlines Boeing 737 that brought him from Frankfurt, Germany to a
waiting police van just meters (yards) from the plane and driven
straight to Zagreb's Remetinac jail.
	   Ivan Damjanovic, chief supervisor of that jail, said Sakic would
undergo medical examination before being taken to his cell.
	   On Friday, he said, Sakic goes before an investigative judge,
where he can choose either to speak out or remain silent on a
Zagreb court's investigation of him for suspected war crimes in
Jasenovac and a nearby World War II camp at Gradiska.
	   Actual charges must be brought within six months, Damjanovic
said.
	   A court subpoena issued in April accused Sakic of committing
``grave and fatal'' criminal acts. He faces a maximum penalty of 20
years in jail if tried and convicted.
	   The court said tens of thousands of people were detained,
tortured and killed in the camps in the execution of the regime's
racial laws.
	   Croats largely welcomed the establishment of Croatia's Nazi
regime in 1941 as an incarnation of centuries-old dreams for an
independent state. However, many also fought alongside
anti-fascists.
	   President Franjo Tudjman was among those Communist partisans in
World War II. But he has found it difficult to be open about the
wartime past, and his state often seems to encourage nationalism
that harks back to the 1940s.
	   His government is blocking the return of Serbs who fled en masse
at the end of the Croatian war in 1995, raising the specter of
ethnic discrimination.
	   The overwhelming majority of those killed at Jasenovac were
Serbs. Victims also included Jews, Gypsies and Croats who opposed
the Ustasha puppet state.
	   A diehard handful of six or seven ultranationalists sang Ustasha
songs outside the airport terminal as Sakic landed and handed out
leaflets condemning Croatia for extraditing him from Argentina.
	   The exact number of Jasenovac victims has never been
ascertained, but the U.S. Justice Department cited documents
captured from Nazis in 1945 as saying that at least 120,000 people
perished there.
	   Tudjman has put the figure at about 35,000, while Serbs say the
number was beyond 500,000.
	   Sakic acknowledged that he ran Jasenovac in 1942-4 in an April
interview with an Argentine television channel, but denied any
wrongdoings.
	   ``Nothing happened there,'' he said in the interview, his first
public appearance since going to Argentina in 1947. ``There was a
typhus epidemic (at Jasenovac), but no cremation ovens.''
	   Sakic's interview prompted an outcry for his arrest and
Argentina agreed to extradite him to Croatia.

World Cup: US players not thinking politics AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ Forget the ayatollah,
forget the shah, forget the hostages. American players are a lot
more interested in points than politics.
	   ``We want to win the game for all the right reasons, the three
points,'' Eric Wylnalda said Sunday's World Cup matchup against
Iran. ``From their perspective, I can't comment.''
	   While there are many rivalries and grudge matches in sports, its
rare for one team's backers to denounce their opponent as ``The
Great Satan,'' the term Iran has used for the United States since
the Islamic Revolution in 1979. In an effort to avoid trouble,
French police have stepped up security at the U.S. camp, adding
additional plainclothes officers.
	   And while some teams get into a war of words, the Iranian
government has gotten into a war of films, upset by a French
television broadcast of ``Not Without My Daughter,'' a 1991 movie
based on the true story of an American woman who escaped Iran with
her daughter against the wishes of her Iranian husband.
	   ``It's a good movie,'' U.S. defender Alexi Lalas said Thursday,
speaking tongue-in-cheek about the film, which got negative
reviews. ``Sally Field did a tremendous job in that movie. I've
seen it several times myself.''
	   Then Lalas turned serious.
	   ``If they've been insulted by a movie that's being shown,
they've got bigger problems,'' he said. ``That means nothing to
us.''
	   Sunday's game has bigger political implications for Iran's
government, which often denounces the United States. For the teams,
it has equal importance.
	   Both lost their openers _ the United States 2-0 to Germany and
Iran 1-0 to Yugoslavia. Either would be eliminated by a loss.
	   ``We have a lot of pressure, much more than we had against
Germany,'' captain Thomas Dooley said. ``We had almost none against
Germany.''
	   U.S. coach Steve Sampson is toying with major changes to his
lineup. Tab Ramos and Frankie Hejduk, both second-half subs against
Germany, will start. It's possible he may alter his 3-6-1 formation
and start two forwards.
	   And with Iran starting a much shorter team than Germany, he may
use Lalas or Marcelo Balboa to increase his team's height and add
muscle.
	   ``I don't look at it too much in the politics,'' Balboa said.
``It's another game. We have to play our game, get our result in
order for us to advance.''
	   The average age of the U.S. roster was 10 when the hostage
crisis at the U.S. embassy in Tehran began in 1979.
	   ``I don't remember much about it at all,'' Ernie Stewart said.
``I knew there was a situation.''
	   In a coincidence, Iran coach Jalal Talebi once coached at
Foothill Junior College in Los Altos Hills, Calif., where Sampson
played and was an assistant coach _ though at a different time.
Talebi says during the 1994 World Cup he met Sampson, then an
assistant to Bora Milutinovic.
	   Sampson didn't remember.
	   `You meet a lot of people with Bora,'' he said.
	   Iran's players say they plan to make a special gesture to the
U.S. team in a sign of friendship, and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has called for a movement toward re-establishing
diplomatic relations between the United States and Iran.
	   ``Before the game, we're going to shake hands, and afterwards
we're going to exchange shirts,'' Wynalda said. ``That should be a
good example for the world.''
	   Still, Iranian exiles have made anonymous threats to disrupt the
game, and an Iranian fan shouted Wednesday at Lalas during a trip
to Lyon.
	   ``Just some punk who wanted to say he cussed me out,'' Lalas
said.
	   U.S. players seem to think the game won't aggravate the
relationship between the nations, even though it could be physical.
Iran had 30 fouls in its opener against Yugoslavia.
	   ``I think all of us understand the implications of the game and
we're excited about it,'' Wynalda said. ``It's an opportunity for
the sport of soccer to bring two nations together. It's the beauty
of the World Cup.''

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Riot police clashed with telephone
workers who launched a strike Thursday to protest the dlrs 1.9
billion sale of a controlling stake in the government telephone
company.
	   One demonstrator was arrested for allegedly assaulting a police
officer, and at least two officers were hurt, police said.
	   Amid threats of sabotage to telephone lines, police reported
severed telephone cables in suburban Rio Piedras and the northern
coastal town of Arecibo. Earlier, police had said the Rio Piedras
outage was caused by a small bomb.
	   Some 6,400 unionized Puerto Rico Telephone Company employees
walked off the job, fearing layoffs once private investors, led by
telecommunications giant GTE Corporation, buy 50 percent plus one
share of the company.
	   The sale is the centerpiece of Gov. Pedro Rossello's
privatization program and must be approved by the legislature.
Senators were expected to vote Thursday.
	   Protests erupted across this Caribbean island.
	   In San Juan, police shoved protesters and struck some with
batons when strikers tried to block access to telephone company
headquarters. Elsewhere, hundreds of flag-waving, chanting
strikers, government workers and students brought traffic to a
halt.
	   ``The government is anti-worker!'' declared Leticia Malpica, a
secretary at the government Economic Development agency, who held a
commonly-seen sign that read, ``Rossello Dictator.''
	   In Ponce, Puerto Rico's second-largest city, Mayor Rafael
Cordero Santiago gave city workers the day off to join the picket
lines.
	   ``These people are risking everything, their mortgages, car
payments, tuitions, and if we don't have the dignity to support
them, we deserve the total repudiation of the Puerto Rican
people,'' Cordero said.
	   Telephone company president Carmen Ana Culpeper warned of
outages. During a work stoppage in October, hundreds of customers
lost telephone service because of severed fiber-optic cables.
	   ``The network is huge and unfortunately, many of the employees
know where to cut it,'' Culpeper said.
	   Rossello's government says the state cannot compete successfully
in a newly-opened Puerto Rican market. Despite labor protests and
appeals to the ``national patrimony,'' it has sold hotels and a
shipping company, and has courted private investment in the power
industry.
	   It also offered telephone employees 3 percent of company stock
with an option to buy another 3 percent. Secretary of State Norma
Burgos warned the offer could be withdrawn if strikers persist.
	   Despite the noisy protests, not everyone supported the strikers.
Miguel Colon, a maintenance supervisor, watched one protest outside
the state-owned cellular phone company and said he thought the
public will accept the sale.
	   ``I think eventually we'll get better service and the
competition will be good for Puerto Rico,'' he said. ``I don't
think this (strike) will do anything. The company is already
sold.''

42 Dubliners arrested, charged with dealing drugs 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Police arrested 42 suspected drug dealers
Thursday in their biggest-ever crackdown on the Irish capital's
thriving heroin trade.
	   All 42 later appeared individually in courts to be charged with
possessing and supplying drugs in Dublin, where illegal drugs are
commonplace in working-class housing estates. All were ordered held
without bail for a week.
	   The dawn arrests followed month-long surveillance by the police
National Drugs Unit as part of an investigation dubbed Operation
Clean Streets.
	   Dublin, a city of 1.1 million, is home to more than 8,000 heroin
addicts and street deals are done openly on main thoroughfares on
the city's tough north side.
	   The government introduced strong anti-racketeering powers two
years ago to help shut down operations by the city's crime
godfathers, with some success.

Three doctors guilty of misconduct after deaths of 29 children during surgery 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The General Medical Council on Thursday found
three doctors guilty of serious professional misconduct after 29
children and babies died during surgery at a western England
hospital between 1988 and 1995.
	   The council, Britain's disciplinary body for the medical
profession, ruled that heart surgeon James Wisheart, 59, and John
Roylance, 67, be struck off the medical register, which means they
can no longer practice medicine in Britain. A second heart surgeon,
Janardan Dhasmana, 58, was banned from carrying out heart surgery
on children for three years.
	   ``A parent placing a child in a doctor's care must have
confidence that the doctor will put the child's best interests
before any other,'' Sir Donald Irvine, the council's president said
in announcing the council's ruling.
	   ``A doctor who fails to live up to the expectation will
seriously undermine not only his or her relationship with that
particular patient or parent, but the confidence of all patients in
doctors,'' he said.
	   Parents whose children died in operations at the hospital said
that the doctors' punishments were too light.
	   ``The hearing was a farce. They struck off the two doctors who
are retired and left Mr. Dhasmana, who is still practicing, to
carry on working,'' said Tracey Clarke, whose 11-month-old daughter
Melissa died at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, 119 miles (180
kilometers) west of London, following surgery.
	   The council launched an inquiry, which concluded in May, on 53
operations on children and babies carried out at the infirmary
during the seven year period which left 29 children and babies dead
and four brain damaged.
	   The inquiry found that the two surgeons performed childrens'
heart operations without sufficient regard to their safety. It also
found that Roylance, former chief executive of the United Bristol
Healthcare National Health Service Trust, failed to stop the
surgeons operating even when colleagues were concerned about the
number of fatalities.
	   Health Secretary Frank Dobson told the House of Commons that he
had ordered a public inquiry into the deaths.

Iran prepare for historic soccer battle with United States 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ For millions of die-hard Iranian soccer
fans, defeating the United States in a preliminary World Cup match
would be as good as winning the soccer tournament itself.
	   When Iran's soccer team takes on the United States Sunday in a
first-round match at the World Cup finals in France, Iran will come
to a halt as millions of fans will watch the tournament's most
hyped game on television.
	   ``This match concerns the country's national pride,'' said Iraj
Ghadimi, a Tehran shopkeeper. Hospitals have been put on alert,
cafes have set up television screens and universities have
postponed exams.
	   U.S.-Iran soccer fever is even taking precedence over justice:
The trial of the Tehran mayor on corruption charges was adjourned
until after Sunday's match.
	   ``I cannot hide my sentiments about the match, I pray that Iran
wins,'' said Iraj Ghadimi, who owns a home appliance shop in
Tehran's main bazaar. ``It doesn't matter if they lose against
Germany, but this match concerns the country's national pride.''
	   Soccer has always been one of the most loved sport in Iran but
the match at Lyon has taken on an added significance given Iran's
love-hate relationship with America.
	   Political enmity against Americans has been branded in the
psyches of Iranians since the 1979 Islamic revolution that
proclaimed the United States the ``Great Satan.'' But many Iranians
never truly hated Americans, and have largely welcomed moderate
President Mohammad Khatami's calls for cultural and sports
exchanges with the United States.
	   ``For the first time after a 20-year enmity the representatives
of the two countries are confronting each other in healthy
battle,'' said Bijan Shariati, 26, a Tehran University student.
	   ``The ice between Iran and the United States is melting away and
if such meetings continue, it will dissolve,'' he said.
	   There has been no government comment on the match. But the
significance of playing against a country that has done its best to
isolate Iran is not lost on Iranians.
	   ``We want to beat them in this battle ... watched by millions,
and it will uphold our dignity and compensate years of humiliation
by the United States,'' said Asad, a 48-year-old schoolteacher who
didn't want his second name used.
	   ``I think the best way to display our power is to win,'' he
said.
	   Across Tehran and other cities, cafes and restaurants have
installed television sets to attract customers. Security has been
stepped up to control crowds, jubilant or otherwise.
	   A hearing in the landmark corruption trial of Tehran mayor
Gholamhossein Karbaschi was postponed from Sunday to Thursday to
prevent a conflict with the match.
	   Hospitals are bracing to treat weak-hearted fans if all doesn't
go well for Iran. Or even if it does. Three people were treated for
heart attacks after Iran qualified for the World Cup finals in
November. Many people had suffered cuts, bruises and sprained
ankles when they jumped in excitement.
	   Despite being absent from international soccer for the past 20
years, Iran takes the game very seriously. More than 100,000
Iranians showed up at every match Iran played at home during the
qualifying rounds.
	   In the past weeks, shops have reported skyrocketing sales of
nuts and crackers, apparently to be munched during nail-biting
matches.
	   ``Before the World Cup began, I bought several kilograms
(pounds) of pistachios, almonds and walnuts and I have not missed a
single match since the beginning,'' said Ghadimi, the appliance
seller.
	   Schools and some universities postponed examinations scheduled
to be held during the month-long tournament.
	   Some community centers in Tehran had planned to set up
television sets during Iran's games against Yugoslavia, the United
States and Germany, but canceled the shows fearing rowdiness.
	   The matches are broadcast live on Iran's state-run television,
but with a 10-second delay to enable censors to edit out anything
considered un-Islamic or offensive to the Islamic regime.
	   Shots picked up by French cameras of women wearing thin summer
dresses, hooligans and banners by Iranian opposition groups are
blocked and replaced with footage of fans from other matches.

World Cup: FIFA stops announcing players undergoing drug testing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ In a change in policy halfway through
the first round of the World Cup, FIFA has stopped announcing which
players undergo drug testing after each match.
	   FIFA official Faouzi Mahjoub said Thursday the policy change
came in a directive Wednesday.
	   ``Only the teams must know the names of the players,'' he said.
	   Previously, the names of the two players from each team tested
after each match were announced at the FIFA post-match news
conference.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the policy change.
Mahjoub only said it came from ``above'' and pointed his thumb in
the air.
	   Entering Thursday's South Africa-Denmark clash, none of the drug
tests conducted have turned out positive.

Chief weapons inspector: Iraq was stonewalling 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS detail on videotaped meetings
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite Baghdad's claim of a
``breakthrough'' in U.N. arms inspections, Iraq is still refusing
to provide information on missiles, biological weapons and the
chemical warfare agent VX, the chief U.N. inspector said Thursday.
	   Richard Butler's report to the Security Council casts doubt on
claims that Iraq may soon be free from sanctions _ unless the
Security Council softens its demand that Baghdad first account for
all long-range missiles and nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Iraq is apparently gambling that Russia, France and China will
prevail over the United States and Britain and persuade the council
to end the sanctions without complete verification that all illegal
weapons have been destroyed.
	   During Butler's meetings last week in Baghdad, the two sides
agreed on a two-month ``program of work'' by the inspectors, who
must report to the council whether Iraq has destroyed all illegal
weapons.
	   That is the main condition for ending sanctions imposed in 1990
after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
	   Following the meetings, Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq
Aziz, called the agreement a ``breakthrough'' that would ``prepare
the ground for the lifting of the economic embargo.''
	   Butler told reporters that ``if that work is done satisfactorily
... I believe we should be in a position'' to move toward the
lifting of sanctions.
	   U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Iraqis videotaped the three meetings, apparently to show them to
sympathetic governments to reinforce their case that Baghdad is
fully cooperating.
	   As a result, they said, many of Aziz's remarks appeared to be
directed at an outside audience, including his frequent references
to the suffering of Iraqi civilians because of sanctions.
	   U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, also
cautioned that some major issues would remain unresolved even if
the two-month program were completed satisfactorily.
	   For example, Butler's report said the Iraqis refused to allow
the issue of missile fuel to be included in the program. The
inspectors say Iraq may still be holding propellant for long-range
missiles, raising questions whether all such weapons have actually
been accounted for, as Baghdad claims.
	   More significantly, the report said Iraq ``refused ... to
clarify the extent of its attempts to produce the chemical warfare
agent VX.''
	   On biological weapons, Iraq refused to provide additional
information on its program. But at Baghdad's request, the
commission agreed to another meeting of technical experts,
including Russian, French and Chinese.
	   ``In virtually all instances, Iraq remained firm in its position
that no relevant documents were available,'' the report said. ``In
one instance, Iraq refused to provide documents it acknowledged
having in its possession.''

Some 1.2 million salute Red Wings

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Hockeytown never looked better _ or redder.
	   Police estimated that 1.2 millions fans jammed downtown Thursday
to honor the Detroit Red Wings, who swept the Stanley Cup
championship for a second straight year.
	   A cheering, flag-waving throng in red and white lined both sides
of Woodward Avenue as the parade traveled a one-mile
(1.6-kilometer) route toward a rally.
	   Vladimir Konstantinov and Sergei Mnatsakanov, the defenseman and
team masseur who were severely injured in a limousine accident six
days after last year's Cup victory, drew thunderous applause as
their float passed
	   ``The Red Wings to me are all what life is all about,'' coach
Scotty Bowman said. ``It's sharing and caring and believing.''
	   At the rally, Konstantinov waved and smiled as he was assisted
across the stage. Mnatsakanov, wiping away tears, gave the
thumbs-up sign when wheeled into the plaza.
	   ``I know we all pray that they continue to get better, so that
one day they can lead a normal life,'' general manager Ken Holland
said. ``But they are special, special people.''
	   Added Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer: ``You made us believe in
finding a way, whatever the odds are.''
	   Goaltender Chris Osgood, wearing a red T-shirt and riding in the
back of a red Jeep, carried the Cup and raised it for the crowd.
Captain Steve Yzerman hoisted the Conn Smythe trophy he won as the
most valuable player of the finals.
	   Stanley, a giant papier-mache octopus, rode on a flatbed truck.
His eight tentacles represent the number of victories it used to
take to win a Cup during the days of the six-team league.
	   Howard McLauchlan of Oakland Township arrived wearing a
4-foot-high (1.22-meter-high) makeshift Stanley Cup on his head and
a Red Wings flag as a cape. He shaved his beard to read Red Wing _
he ran out of space for the `s.'
	   ``It's more than a team. It's part of Detroit and everybody's
one big happy family,'' he said.
	   Last year, for a similar salute after the Red Wings' first
championship in 42 years, the crowd reached 1 million.
	   Today, by 10:30 a.m. (1530 GMT), fans crammed behind barricades
along the parade route were 10-deep in places. As they waited for
the parade to begin, groups broke into cheers of ``Let's Go Red
Wings.''
	   Though this year's party in some ways promised to mirror last
year's, the Red Wings' route to repeating as champions was far
different.
	   First, there was the limo accident. Then, during the offseason,
Detroit traded goaltender Mike Vernon, the MVP of last year's
playoffs. And the club withstood Sergei Fedorov's holdout in which
he missed 59 games before agreeing to a six-year, dlrs 38 million
deal.
	   The Wings touted their latest title as a tribute to Mnatsakanov
and Konstantinov, who was once considered among the league's top
defensemen before the crash that left him watching Tuesday night's
clincher from a wheelchair.

Report: Daimler-Benz to build ultra-luxury Maybach car 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz has firm plans to build the
ultra-luxury Maybach car, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   Meanwhile, Daimler said that it planned to start building 40,000
to 50,000 under two-ton pickup trucks a year.
	   While a production site for the trucks was still not decided,
Daimler said a plant in the Brandenburg state of Ludwigsfelde in
eastern Germany offered the best possibilities, but that producing
it in neighboring Poland was also possible.
	   According to Daimler, about 410,000 small delivery trucks were
sold in western Europe last year, and the market is expected to
expand to 500,000 by the year 2000.
	   Citing sources from Daimler-Benz in Stuttgart later, the
Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper said the company board also expects
to get the Mercedes Maybach project going this month.
	   The company plans to build the about 500,000 mark (dlrs 280,000)
limousines at a plant in southern Baden-Wuerttemberg state next to
an existing Mercedes plant, the report said.
	   The research and development department of Daimler-Benz is
already working feverishly on plans for the Maybach, and talks have
already been conducted with possible suppliers, the report said.
	   While no comment from Daimler-Benz was available on the report,
its chairman Juergen Schrempp said last month that the company
would decide within the next few weeks whether to revive the name
of the Maybach, a pre-war model it once built.
	   ``If our analyses show that the Maybach can earn a sufficient
return on capital employed ... the luxury market will be defined by
a car that bears the star'' of Mercedes, he said.
	   The new Maybach is to have a top speed of 250 kilometers an hour
(155 mph), and at 5.77 meters (18.9 foot) in length it would be
exactly 56 centimeters (22 inches) longer than a Mercedes 600,
according to Abendblatt.

Eds: AMs; UPDATES with Paris measures, details on English fan's
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Marseille officials pressured by cafe owners
slightly eased tough alcohol restrictions Thursday for a weekend
World Cup match, but authorities in Paris and other cities were
ratcheting up their rules to prevent new violence.
	   Meanwhile, authorities in the southern city of Montpelllier
arrested an English fan linked to three days of clashes in
Marseille in which 50 people were injured and 80 detained.
	   The suspect, identified by English police as one of about 50
troublemakers from their country, was to be transferred to the
southern port.
	   The actions by French authorities were aimed at bringing a halt
to violence by a few hundred rowdy fans, most of them from England,
who were tarnishing the image of the country's World Cup attracting
1 million foreigners from June 10 to July 12.
	   Officials in a number of cities imposed alcohol restrictions and
either canceled or scaled back plans for the nation's annual
Festival of Music on Sunday, usually a carnival-style celebration
of music in the streets.
	   Marseille authorities planned increased security for Saturday's
match between the Netherlands and South Korea.
	   But regional Prefect Jean-Paul Proust relented on a strict
alcohol ban announced earlier, under pressure from cafe and
restaurant owners who said the measures were ``anti-business.''
	   Proust agreed Thursday to allow alcohol to be sold an hour
later, until midnight, and said cafes and restaurants could remain
open until 4 a.m.
	   Carry-out alcoholic drink remain strictly forbidden throughout
the weekend, starting Friday night.
	   Some 2,000 regular police are to be activated for weekend duty.
Their ranks will be bolstered by some 200 police of the
Anti-Criminal Brigade patrolling in groups in the city center, the
prefecture said. Riot police also are to be posted about town.
	   In Paris, officials announced Thursday that possession and
consumption of alcohol would be banned on the streets around the
Parc des Princes stadium in western Paris on match days.
	   Bars in the area would be ``asked to close'' on those days, the
police statement said.
	   Alcohol is also banned around the large World Cup viewing
screens built outside City Hall, near the Eiffel Tower and three
other locations in the capital, the statement said.
	   Police surveillance of ``at-risk fans,'' train stations,
transport and tourist sites would be increased, the statement said,
without giving figures. Festival of Music shows on the
Champs-Elysees were banned.
	   The southwestern city of Toulouse was bracing for England's next
match, with Romania on Monday.
	   But one of the measures, a fence being built to separate the
crowd at Municipal Stadium, was drawing fire. Some said it was the
kind of security risk in which 96 Liverpool fans were trampled to
death in England's 1989 Hillsborough stadium incident.
	   ``There was no trouble at the game itself in Marseille. I cannot
think of any justification for bringing back fences,'' said David
Mellor, head of England's Football Task Force.
	   About 1,000 English fans were already reported in France's
fourth-largest city, prompting officials to postpone the music
festival until July 11.
	   Officials also considered closing bars early and forgoing large
TV screens like the one on a Marseille beach where ticketless
English fans and local youths fought Monday afternoon.
	   In the northern city of Lens, where England is to play Colombia
on Friday, June 26, officials were boosting police presence and
canceled city events including a music festival.

Study finds possible link to high blood pressure in blacks 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Hold for release at 2000 GMT.
By DAVID KOENIG
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ Healthy blacks don't react as strongly as whites
to a chemical that helps the body handle stress, according to a
study that could help explain why blacks are more likely to have
high blood pressure.
	   Many doctors have long blamed poor diet and lifestyle choices
for the prevalence of high blood pressure. But the study, published
Thursday in Hypertension, a journal of the American Heart
Association, offers a physiological possibility.
	   ``Hypertension is probably caused by several factors,'' said Dr.
Julio A. Panza, lead researcher. ``Other studies have reported that
blacks have increased sensitivity to salt.''
	   The researchers at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute
said that blacks aren't as strongly affected as whites by the
chemical nitric oxide, which helps blood vessels relax and carry
more blood to muscles during mental stress.
	   Panza said more research is needed into the role of nitric oxide
_ his study used only 12 blacks and 14 whites. But he is optimistic
it will lead to earlier identification of people likely to develop
high blood pressure and maybe the development of drugs to treat it.
	   High blood pressure is a leading risk factor for heart disease,
heart attacks, stroke and diabetes. Yet, doctors are able to
pinpoint the cause of high blood pressure in only about one in 10
patients.
	   A doctor with the American Heart Association said the study is
significant because none of the test subjects had high blood
pressure.
	   That hints strongly at some physiological difference between
blacks and whites, said Dr. Roxanne Rodney, associate director of
nuclear cardiology at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and an
associate professor at Columbia University in New York.
	   ``Most of the previous work has been done with medicines, diet
and exercise,'' Ms. Rodney said. ``Those factors are all important,
but I think we need to get beyond that and see if there are actual
cellular differences.''
	   Not only are blacks about 40 percent more likely than whites to
have high blood pressure, they also tend to develop it earlier and
more severely.
	   ``This study is certainly in line with the theory that something
is going on in blacks that leads to tighter blood vessels,'' said
University of Maryland researcher Dr. Elijah Saunders. He also
believes environmental factors, including stress from poverty,
might explain the prevalence of high blood pressure in blacks.
	   Ms. Rodney worried that blacks might interpret the study as
meaning they are destined to develop high blood pressure.
	   ``Even though there might be tendencies, you can definitely
lower your blood pressure by exercise, not eating a high-fat diet
and not smoking,'' she said.
	   In the study, Panza and his colleagues at the heart institute
measured forearm blood flow in blacks and whites working on math
problems. Blood flow increased more than twice as much in whites as
the stress was increased by giving the test subjects harder
problems.
	   Panza repeated the experiment after giving the subjects a drug
that cuts the body's production of nitric oxide, the body's own
mechanism for handling stress.
	   Whites' blood flow dropped sharply, but blacks' blood flow
hardly changed, indicating less reaction to nitric oxide, he said.
	   Panza said further study is needed to understand why blacks
might not respond as much to nitric oxide.

Pate surges to early lead at U.S. Open trim; will be UPDATED when Pate finishes round AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Pate at 2-under, other early action; EDITS to
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ The U.S. Open is rough enough, but Steve
Pate showed Thursday in the first round that there's room to
recover.
	   Pate, whose first tee shot of the tournament signaled an ominous
start when the rough gobbled it up, answered with four birdies
under overcast skies and was at 2-under through 15 holes.
	   Tiger Woods overcame a bogey on the fourth hole with consecutive
birdies and also got to 2-under through six holes, along with Glen
Day and Kirk Triplett.
	   Staying there figured to be the hard part.
	   The slightest mistake led to bogey _ or worse _ at The Olympic
Club, which seemed to pick up speed after three days of sunshine.
	   Only four others managed to get to 2-under in the early going,
and it didn't take long for them to give it back.
	   Mark Calcavecchia started with two birdies and a par, then
followed with a bogey, double bogey and another bogey. Scott
Verplank made eagle on the par-5 first hole but fell back to
1-under. Chris DeMarco had an eagle on the 288-yard (263-meter)
seventh hole but also gave back the stroke.
	   And Clarence Rose? He bogeyed five straight holes starting on
No. 7 and fell to 3-over.
	   Fred Couples and Colin Montgomerie were the only players who
made it through the first nine holes without a bogey.
	   Couples, a two-time winner on the U.S. PGA Tour this year and a
runner-up at the Masters, birdied the first hole and followed with
seven pars, the kind of steady play that Olympic will demand.
	   Montgomerie, a two-time runner-up at the U.S. Open, scrambled
for par on the first two holes but bore down after that and was
1-under at the turn.
	   A light fog hugged the foothills surrounding Olympic, an eerie
sight as the toughest test in golf got under way. And it didn't
take long for some players to stop dead in their tracks.
	   Montgomerie played a nice chip to the par-5 first hole,
satisfied as he began walking toward the green when the ball rolled
to a stop. Then he froze as it kept rolling farther away, kept on
the fringe only by the thick collar.
	   Payne Stewart's approach on No. 2 barely cleared the bunker and
looked like it would stay on the fringe about 20 feet (6.10 meters)
below the cup. He gave his caddie his club, looked back at the
green and couldn't believe his eyes.
	   The ball trickled a few feet (a meter), then a few feet a meter)
more. Before long, he was looking at a 20-yard (18.28 meters) chip
back to the green. He managed to save par.
	   Stewart, Masters champion Mark O'Meara and Fuzzy Zoeller were
among those at 1-under on the front nine.
	   Defending champion Ernie Els and Justin Leonard, one of the
favorites this week because of his grinding style of play, had
afternoon tee times.
	   Of the 69 players on the course, only 14 were under par.
	   Andrew Magee proved that chopping through the first few holes
did not mean the day was a lost cause. He was 3-over through four
holes, then reeled off four birdies over the next five holes to
make the turn at 1-under 34.
	   But trouble is always lurking around the bending, slanting
fairways of Olympic, and in the rough that is even more difficult
because of the morning moisture.
	   He bogeyed two of the next four to slip back over par.
	   With those conditions, equipment was the least of anyone's
worries.
	   On the eve of the Open, Leonard wondered if the USGA's answer to
advanced equipment would be to make players carry only nine clubs
and walk barefoot.
	   That won't be the case, but even with 14 clubs in the bag,
Leonard and the rest of the field would do well to concentrate on
only a few of them.
	   A 3-wood or low iron will come in handy off the tee, anything to
keep the ball out of the 5-inch rough that frames the tight
fairways.
	   The wedge is a must, if only to get the ball back into play if
it rolls through the slanted fairways into the thick stuff.
	   ``You just stick the long wedge behind it and hit it as hard as
you can,'' said England's Lee Westwood.
	   David Duval did just that Thursday on the second hole, a swing
so mighty he kept only his left hand on the club after impact. He
was 1 over at the turn.
	   Olympic is straightforward, even though nearly every fairway
bends around the cypresses and Monterrey pines, dips into valleys
or climbs toward sloped greens that are guarded by fluffy sand
bunkers.

World Cup: Arab spectators at venue with high hopes 
</HEADLINE>
By ADNAN MALIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ A group of two dozen Saudi and other
Arab fans made a cheering entry into Stade de France on Thursday
night, determined to show Saudi Arabian players that they had
supporters among the 80,000 fans at the match with France.
	   Only a few dozen Saudis appeared to have come to watch the World
Cup match, which appeared to be flooding overwhelmingly with French
fans.
	   The Saudis and other Arabs, including citizens from Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates and Lebanon, arrived draped with green
bandannas on their heads and a Saudi flag rapped round their
shoulders and waist.
	   After losing to Denmark 1-0 in the opening match on Friday,
Saudi Arabia had to beat France to keep alive its chance of
qualifying for the second round. France was the overwhelming
favorite.
	   Jumana, a 22-year-old Saudi student at American University in
Paris, said, ``We are here to support the Saudi team in the good
and the bad times.''
	   ``I hope they will win this match,'' said Jumana, her face
painted with green and white. She wanted to be identified only by
her first name.
	   Turki al-Essa, an 18-year-old student living in France, said the
match would be ``more difficult'' than the one against Denmark.
	   ``But, I am very hopeful that Saudi Arabia will work some wonder
and win the match today,'' he said.
	   However, Haifa, a 22-year-old Saudi student, said that while she
was hoping the best for Saudi Arabia, she was skeptical about their
chances of winning.
	   ``Let's hope they don't make a fool of themselves like they did
before,'' said Haifa, who was willing to be identified only by her
first name.
	   Saleh Abul-Judayal, an 18-year-old Saudi law student who flew in
from London to watch Saudi matches, said, ``I hope it's worth the
trouble taken to come here.''
	   ``I already watched the first disaster. I hope they don't repeat
it because it could be their last,'' said Abul-Judayal.
	   Nawwaf, another soccer-mad Saudi who also wanted to be
identified by only his first name, said of the loss to Denmark, ``I
think they tried their best but their inexperience clearly marred
their play.''

<TEXT>
	   ROSMALEN, Netherlands (AP) _ The Heineken Open grass court
tennis championships have been dogged by bad weather all week, but
Thursday was the worst day of all with no play possible.
	   Organizers abandoned play for the day at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) when
confronted by a persistent downpour.
	   The delay means Friday will see the men's second round and
women's quarterfinals, with players facing two matches in a day as
men's quarterfinals and women's semifinals are also scheduled.
	   If top-seeded Australian Patrick Rafter defeats Russian Andrei
Medvedev he will then go on to play Dutchman Sjeng Schalken or
Frenchman Guillaume Raoux.
	   The doubles tournaments have been moved indoors to a sports hall
in the nearby town of Vught.

NATO chief lauds Balkan flyovers, no further action planned 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ NATO's display of air power over
Albania and Macedonia earlier this week was successful and no
further military action was planned, the alliance's top official
said Thursday.
	   ``The objective was to show the capacity to project air (power)
to the region at short notice, and we were able to do that. It was
a great success,'' NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said.
	   ``We don't have any plans for any (further) exercises of this
type at this moment,'' he added.
	   On Monday, NATO flew 80 warplanes over Albania and Macedonia,
hoping that might prod Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
curtail his police and armed forces aggressions in Kosovo province,
located near the Albanian border.
	   Strife between Serbs and ethnic Albanians, who make up about 90
percent of the Kosovo population, has mounted as residents press
for political autonomy and Serbia responds with a crackdown.
	   More than 300 people, mostly civilians, have died in the Kosovo
area since March. Thousands have fled their homes, the refugees
often fleeing across national borders.

Will the real Boris Yeltsin please stand up? 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Communist Party parliament deputy has formally
asked Russia's general procurator to investigate whether President
Boris Yeltsin has been replaced by a ``double,'' a newspaper
reported.
	   In an interview with the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets published
Thursday, deputy Alexander Saly said he has found the president's
appearance and actions suspicious ever since his 1996 re-election.
	   ``The difference between the pre-election Yeltsin and the
post-election Yeltsin simply jumps out at you,'' Saly said,
according to the paper.
	   He gave the following examples. Since his second inauguration,
the president has thrown out most of his old cronies and installed
new staffers, Saly said. He used to hide his left hand, which is
missing two fingers, but now he displays freely.
	   And finally, Yeltsin's daughter has become the president's
official ``image'' maker _ to advise the ``new'' Yeltsin in how to
walk and talk like the original, Saly suggested.
	   Saly, who is a member of the lower house of parliament's
committee on elections, said he has support within his party for
his request. However, he acknowledged that the support from the
Communist Party leadership has not been particularly vocal.
	   Moskovsky Komsomolets did not say when Saly had filed the formal
request, or whether the general procurator, Russia's top
investigator, has responded.
	   The newspaper did not refrain from editorializing on the report,
saying that such an incident is ``possible only in Russia.''
	   ``Of course there are more than a few people in this world who
see flying saucers everyday, who contact the spirit world, who try
to catch ghosts in their hands...'' the paper wrote. ``But usually,
they are not deputies in the State Duma who write legislation and
take part in the country's political life.''
	   No one answered the telephone at Saly's parliament office late
Thursday. A duty officer at the general procurator's office said he
had no information about the report.

Security Council fails to resolve Iraq spare parts issue 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite warnings of ``serious
consequences'' for Iraq's people, the Security Council failed
Thursday to resolve differences over a resolution authorizing dlrs
300 million in spare parts for Iraq's oil industry.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador rejected the draft resolution entirely
and called for an end to the oil-for-food program by late November.
Experts from the 15 council members were meeting late Thursday to
try to resolve differences.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended in March that the
council let Iraq buy the parts with revenues from oil-for-food
sales to boost capacity to meet the new U.N.-authorized export
ceiling.
	   But the recommendation has been held up for weeks because the
United States wanted to attach conditions. Washington wanted to
link the spare parts deal to changes in the oil-for-food program to
make it last automatically as long as economic sanctions remain
against Iraq.
	   A draft resolution was introduced by Britain, Portugal and
Sweden on Wednesday which sponsors said did not extend the program
indefinitely. But Iraq's ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon insisted the
language implied an open-ended program.
	   ``Iraq rejects the whole draft resolution outright,'' Hamdoon
said. ``The effort is being done by some council members to try to
keep it an ongoing nature.''
	   Hamdoon said Iraq wanted the current phase of the oil-for-food
program, which ends Nov. 24, to be the last. ``The immediate
alternative should be... a total lifting of the embargo on Iraq,''
he said.
	   Iraq has been barred from freely exporting oil since 1990 when
the council imposed sanctions after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait. In
1996, the council approved the oil-for-food program, which enables
Baghdad to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food, medicine and
humanitarian goods.
	   Iraq was allowed to sell dlrs 2 billion worth of oil every six
months,. But the ceiling was raised this year to dlrs 5.2 billion.
	   In Baghdad, Denis Halliday, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator
for Iraq, said further delays in the spare parts would ``have
serious consequences for the whole program.''
	   But U.N. officials in New York, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said low oil prices make it unlikely that Iraq will
benefit from the increased ceiling, regardless of the spare parts.
	   If Iraq can pump 1.6 million barrels a day at a price of dlrs 10
a barrel, it would earn only dlrs 2.88 billion over six months _
well below the dlrs 5.2 billion ceiling. One-third of the dlrs 2.88
would have to go to war victims and U.N. expenses.
	   Industry experts say Iraq could raise its daily output to 1.8
million or 1.9 million barrels if the spare parts are delivered.
That would still make little difference without a sharp rise in
world oil prices, analysts say.

World Bank approves loan for Malaysia Precede KUALA LUMPUR 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The World Bank approved a dlrs 300 million
loan Thursday to Malaysia to help stimulate its faltering economy
and deal with the social consequences of the financial crisis in
Asia.
	   A statement by the bank said the loan would provide the
Malaysian government ``with the necessary budget flexibility to
maintain spending on social sectors _ namely education and health _
while increasing spending on targeted programs for the poor in
rural and urban areas.''
	   The bank's director for Malaysia, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said in
the past few decades Malaysia had achieved substantial economic
growth and poverty reduction.
	   ``We want to help Malaysia protect those gains by improving
economic conditions, stimulating growth, and extending assistance
to those most vulnerable to the effects of the regional economic
crisis,'' he said.
	   Unlike several of its neighbors, Malaysia has not needed to ask
the International Monetary Fund for a rescue package but its
currency, the ringgit, is feeling the effects of the crisis that
hit Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea last year.
	   Analysts say Malaysia is applying the same tough economic
austerity measures to its economy that the IMF has ordered for
these three countries.
	   The loan is the first by the bank for Malaysia in four years.
Malaysia is expected to seek another dlrs 700 million credit from
the bank before the end of the year.
	   The contraction of Malaysia's economy by 1.8 percent in the
first quarter of 1998 could result in massive job losses and
200,000 people could be pushed below the poverty level, the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama said.
	   The bank considers people who have to live on less than dlrs 1 a
day as beneath the poverty level.
	   Despite gloomy forecasts, Malaysia announced Thursday it would
spend an additional 7 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.8 billion) this year
to help complete some massive infrastructure projects.

World Cup: Platini, Blatter blamed for red tide With Sports-Soccer-Denmark-South Africa 
</HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ When FIFA president Sepp Blatter said
referees should get tougher, he probably didn't mean this tough.
	   Players on both sides of the card-strewn Denmark-South Africa
match Thursday condemned Colombian referee John Jairo Toro for
issuing seven yellow and three red cards in the 1-1 draw, but they
blamed Blatter and World Cup organizing committee chairman Michel
Platini.
	   ``I think what they said was ridiculous,'' Danish defender Marc
Rieper said regarding comments from Blatter and Platini on
Wednesday that World Cup referees were not being tough enough.
	   ``Referees have been very good so far and it is a very stupid
comment that he (Platini) has made,'' Rieper said. ``I don't know
if he is trying to ruin the tournament that he made himself and
kill the football game.''
	   South Africa's Benni McCarthy even defended Morten Wieghorst,
who was ejected for bumping the young Ajax striker from behind and
knocking him to the ground.
	   ``The guy hardly even touched me,'' McCarthy said. ``The referee
went out of his way to give him a red card and I am sure that was a
very silly _ a stupid _ decision from the referee.''
	   Wieghorst, who entered the game in the 82nd and was sent off in
the 85th, also couldn't believe the decision.
	   ``It was my first foul. I'd been in the game two minutes,'' he
said. ``I must say I thought he was going to put it (the red card)
back. I tried to tell him he was pulling the wrong card by mistake,
but he was having none of it.''
	   South African captain Lucas Radebe agreed that the rain of cards
wrecked the match.
	   ``I thought the referee was a bit harsh in his decisions. He
made people scared to even go out and tackle. I think he made a
mess-up of the game,'' Radebe said.
	   Blatter Wednesday rejected claims that reminding referees of
directives including the dismissal for tackles from behind would
prompt referees to brandish red cards indiscriminately.
	   Blatter also said referees should clamp down on time wasting,
particularly by goalkeepers.
	   Toro Rendon waved four yellow cards for time wasting _ including
one for Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.
	   ``If calling referees to their duties and reminding them of
their instructions puts them under pressure, they are not in the
right place here,'' Blatter said.
	   South Africa's French coach, Philippe Troussier disagreed.
	   ``The referees are under pressure,'' he said. ``The referee
today took his hardest shot. I think it was too hard.''

Report: Egyptian embassy tells Hamas leader he can enter Egypt 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Egypt has told Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed
Yassin it will give him a visa, ending his two-week wait in Sudan,
the official news agency reported Thursday.
	   The Egyptian Embassy in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, notified
Jamal Issa, the radical Islamic group's Sudan representative, that
``Egypt welcomes and is ready to receive Sheik Ahmed Yassin next
Monday,'' the Sudan News Agency, SUNA, reported.
	   The report could not be immediately confirmed in Cairo.
	   Egypt had so far refused to give Yassin a visa on the ground
that Israel should first announce officially that it will allow
Yassin into Gaza Strip.
	   It was not clear what prompted Egypt to relent even though
Israel has not made public any decision.
	   David Bar-Illan, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
policy adviser, told The Associated Press in Jerusalem Thursday
that ``as of this afternoon the prime minister said no decision had
yet been made.''
	   Yassin can go to the Strip only through road border crossings in
Egypt.
	   Given its good relations with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and his Palestinian Authority, Egypt would prefer that Yassin does
not get stuck in its territory.
	   Hamas, which opposes Arafat's peace agreements with Israel, has
carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings against Israelis
since 1994 in attempts to wreck the accords.
	   The 64-year old, quadriplegic Yassin and two aides came to
Khartoum on May 29 after a 14-week trip to Islamic countries during
which he has raised millions of dollars and pledges of support for
Hamas. He asked for a transit Egyptian visa about a week later.
	   Some Israeli legislators are known to oppose his return, but
others in the government think Yassin poses more of a threat abroad
than in Gaza, where his activities can be monitored by the
Palestinian Authority.
	   Yassin was freed from an Israeli jail last fall in exchange for
the freedom of two Israeli spies captured in Jordan during a
bungled assassination attempt against another Hamas leader.

Norway to withdraw most peacekeepers from Lebanon after 20 years 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway will withdraw most of its U.N.
peacekeepers from Lebanon after 20 years in the Middle East because
of problems recruiting enough volunteers for the small Nordic
country's broad international commitments, the defense minister
said Thursday.
	   Defense Minister Dag Jostein Fjaervoll said the number of
Norwegians serving in the United Nation's UNIFIL force would be cut
to about 200 from the current level of about 600 soldiers.
	   ``We don't have enough applicants to cover the needs of all our
international commitments and we have been forced to evaluate our
priorities for the future. We have had to recognize that we cannot
maintain a battalion level force in UNIFIL,'' he said.
	   Norway first sent troops to the UNIFIL peacekeeping unit in
southern Lebanon in 1978, following an Israeli invasion. Norway
also gained respect in the Middle East for brokering a 1993 peace
accord between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization.
	   According to the Oslo newspaper Aftenposten, U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan wrote to Norway last month asking them to leave
the troops in place. The best Norway could do was leave 200
soliders, Fjaervoll said.
	   ``Now it is up to the United Nations to decide what role we will
have in the future,'' Fjaervoll said.
	   Norway, a country of 4.4 million people, has 1,500 troops
committed to U.N. operations worldwide, many of them in Bosnia.
However, due to contract disputes, low unemployment during an
economic boom and declining prestige of being a peacekeeper, the
country has run into difficulty recruiting volunteers.
	   While it was unclear what country might replace Norway's troops,
Fjaervoll last month said one possibility would be a joint Baltic
peacekeeping force being built up by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

Prospects for NATO treaty, Italian government, brighten 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The prospects of Italy approving the enlargement of
NATO _ and of the government's survival _ brightened Thursday.
	   The leader of the hard-line Communists, on whom Premier Romano
Prodi's government depends, suggested his party's opposition to
NATO enlargement would not bring down the government.
	   ``Confidence in the government is not in question,'' said the
party leader, Fausto Bertinotti.
	   Without a parliamentary majority, the government could lose a
vote of confidence and would have to step down.
	   But Bertinotti's Communist Refoundation party has split with the
center-left governing coalition before without permanent ill
effects. The party opposes Italy's presence in the alliance.
	   Francesco Cossiga, a former president, suggested Thursday the
small group of independent centrist deputies he leads may come to
Prodi's support.
	   ``I believe that this government will continue to have
confidence,'' he told reporters.
	   A vote on the treaty is scheduled for early next week.

<TEXT>
	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Pounded by an overnight barrage of more
than 60 rockets and artillery shells, thousands of villagers
abandoned their homes in northern Guinea-Bissau and headed Thursday
for the Senegalese border.
	   The intense assault was directed on the villages of Ingore and
Bula, just kilometers (miles) south of the Senegalese border, as
Guinea-Bissau's loyalist forces launched a new attack on the
capital of Bissau.
	   Renegade soldiers fighting to dislodge President Joao Bernardo
Vieira vowed to retaliate.
	   Dozens of homes in Ingore were wrecked in the overnight blitz
that ended Thursday morning while at least as many people were
killed, refugees fleeing the area said.
	   ``The bombing started at 10 o'clock and went all night,'' said
Cheika Lo, a local businessman. ``All I could think of was how to
get out of there.''
	   Lo and several hundred other villagers from Ingore and Bula
poured across the Senegalese border, which military authorities
opened briefly for the refugees after sealing it the day before.
	   Hundreds of other villagers were still headed toward Senegal, Lo
said.
	   It was not clear who launched the attack, although the
Senegalese army _ fighting on behalf of Guinea-Bissau's president _
had been firing artillery in recent days across the border.
	   Since former military chief of staff Brig. Anumane Mane launched
a mutiny from a military garrison in Bissau against loyalist forces
on June 7, the former Portuguese colony on Africa's western tip has
been descending into a civil war with regional side-effects.
	   The Senegalese army has sided with Vieira, sending troops and
artillery fire across the border. Senegal wants to dislodge
separatist Senegalese guerrillas who have bases in Guinea-Bissau
and who are accused of being allies of the mutineers.
	   Mamadou Sane, a self-declared spokesman for the separatists, the
Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance, on Thursday denied the
group had a stake in the fighting and called for a negotiated end
to hostilities.
	   Troops from the Republic of Guinea, south of Guinea-Bissau, have
also joined the fray on the side of the Bissau loyalists.
	   Fighting in the capital resumed Thursday morning after a brief
lull as a peace envoy was snubbed by Mane's renegade force.
	   The city has been pounded by heavy artillery and mortar fire
since the fighting began, and more than three-quarters of the city
of 300,000 has fled, according to witnesses and aid groups.
	   The rebels rejected the mediation of Gambian Foreign Minister
Mohamed Sedat Jobe, who traveled to Bissau by boat to act as a
go-between for the warring factions.
	   The mutineers, who insisted they would only negotiate through
their own chosen mediator, instead launched an attack of their own,
capturing a radio transmitter near Bissau.
	   In a clandestine broadcast, rebel spokesman Maj. Manuel De
Santos Gomes said the mutineers ``are sure of our victory'' in
their quest to oust Vieira.
	   ``We are regrouping our forces and planning an offensive on
Bissau once the civilians have all left,'' he said in the
broadcast, monitored in the Senegalese border town of Mpak.
	   The renegade soldiers accuse Vieira of corruption and demand he
step down.
	   ``This is not a coup d'etat, this is a military action for
justice,'' the rebel spokesman said in his broadcast.
	   Loyalist troops backed by the Senegalese army, meanwhile,
claimed to have the renegade forces on the run. They launched a new
attack Thursday in the nearly deserted capital, where proposed
peace talks fell apart.
	   In an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro published
Thursday, Vieira said he would never agree to a proposed meeting
with the mutineers.
	   ``If I'll negotiate with the mutineers on the French ship?
Never!'' the president was quoted as saying.

Elections official says St. Vincent and the Grenadines vote was fair 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP) _ St. Vincent and the Grenadines'
top elections official has rejected claims by the opposition party
that Monday's parliamentary election was rigged.
	   ``The statements made about the elections not being free and
fair are groundless,'' Supervisor of Elections Selwyn Jones said
Wednesday.
	   The opposition Unity Labor Party won 4,300 more votes than the
New Democratic Party of Prime Minister James Mitchell, but
Mitchell's party won more districts to secure a 8-7 majority in
Parliament.
	   Labor Party leader Vincent Beache claimed Mitchell, who has led
the government for 14 years, helped organize bribery of voters.
Beache demanded new elections in six months.
	   Mitchell denied the fraud accusations.
	   On Wednesday, he appointed two candidates to Cabinet posts even
though they had lost in their districts. Sinclair Thomas will
become the Caribbean country's health minister, while Carl Joseph
will be attorney general.
	   The Unity Labor Party had seen Monday's vote as its best chance
in years of unseating Mitchell. During their campaigns, its
candidates had decried the country's 45 percent unemployment and
promised to attract new industries.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Corn and soybean futures were mostly higher
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid continued fears hot,
dry weather await Midwestern crops this summer. Wheat futures
finished slightly lower.
	   Prolonged heat could damage the crops. However, the National
Weather Service's long-range forecast, which was released after
trading had ended, predicted most of the upper Midwest and northern
Plains will remain wet in July, a forecast that was likely to cause
a retreat on Friday.
	   Wheat for July delivery rose 1-4 cent to dlrs 2.83 3-4 a bushel,
while other contract months retreated; July corn rose 1 cent to
dlrs 2.45 1-2 a bushel; July oats fell 1 1-4 cents to dlrs 1.20 3-4
a bushel; November soybeans rose 1-4 cent to dlrs 5.99, while the
July contract rose 5 1-2 cents to dlrs 6.31 a bushel.

World Cup: Maldini already thinking of Austria 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ A dominating victory over Cameroon. The
lead atop Group B. Christian Vieri sharing the World Cup scoring
lead with three goals in two matches.
	   It's not enough for Italian coach Cesare Maldini.
	   ``We have achieved nothing. We must win the next match against
Austria before celebrating qualification for the second round,''
Maldini said Thursday as the Azzurri returned to its training camp
north of Paris following their 3-0 victory over Cameroon in
Montpellier.
	   Italy's victory, following a 2-2 draw against Chile in the group
opener, touched off celebrations in several Italian cities and kept
nearly 25 million Italians captivated in front of their
televisions.
	   ``Italians love this team,'' Maldini said.
	   Veteran striker Roberto Baggio and midfielder Luigi Di Biagio,
nursing bruises suffered in Wednesday's match, did not train
Thursday.
	   However team Dr. Andrea Ferretti said both players will be ready
for the match against Austria, scheduled for Tuesday at St. Denis
outside Paris.
	   Italy, with four points from two matches, will want a victory
over Austria to secure first place in its group and avoid a
second-round clash against certain the Group A winner _ Brazil.
	   ``Austria is a tough team. Austrian players are athletically
very strong and well trained. They proved this by scoring
equalizers in second-half injury time both against Cameroon and
Chile,'' Maldini said.
	   Di Biagio, who scored Italy's opening goal against Cameroon,
severely bruised his right thigh during a tackle by Rymond Kalla.
Di Biagio said the African defender deserved the red card issued by
Australian referee Edward Lennie.
	   ``He (made) a late criminal tackle. He deserved the
punishment,'' Di Biagio said. ``I did not feign injury to have him
sent off.''
	   Cameroon fans jeered Di Biagio as he returned to the field after
being treated by medical personnel.
	   Maldini said he was happy that Alessandro Del Piero, bothered by
a thigh strain, proved fit in his 25 minutes after coming on to
replace Roberto Baggio.
	   ``He's growing form and confidence. My policy is to start fit
players, in good form,'' Maldini said.
	   Maldini also praised Vieri, who with Chilean Marcelo Salas
shares the World Cup scoring lead.
	   ``Vieri's deeds are no surprise to me. He has been with me since
I coached the under-21 team. He has no fears, is aggressive.''
	   Italian players will get Friday afternoon off after training
session in the morning.

World Cup: Jamaican prime minister visits Reggae Boyz 
</HEADLINE>
By TYM GLASER
<TEXT>
	   CHAUMONT, France (AP) _ Jamaica's Prime Minister P.J. Patterson
visited the national soccer team's adopted home in France Thursday
and lauded the people of this town about 270 kilometers (165
miles), southeast of Paris.
	   ``I just want to thank the people for their graciousness, warmth
and hospitality,'' Patterson said at a news conference in the
prefecture.
	   ``There is no better spot than beautiful Chaumont for our base
camp in France,'' he said.
	   When asked if Kingston and Chaumont could become sister cities,
Patterson said the Jamaican capital, with a population of 1.2
million, would seek a French city of similar size to pair with.
Chaumont only has 28,000 residents.
	   ``However, we are certain the citizens of Chaumont want to
travel the world and see other beautiful places and we can't think
of a better place than Jamaica,'' Patterson said.
	   Earlier Thursday, Patterson and his delegation _ which includes
Sport Minister Portia Simpson Miller and opposition representative
Babsy Grange, lunched with the national team at their chateau in
Arc-en-Barrois.
	   Simpson Miller and Patterson both delivered passionate addresses
to the Reggae Boyz who went down 3-1 to Croatia on Sunday and face
the might of Argentina this Sunday in Paris.
	   ``The whole world is watching you,'' Patterson said. ``You have
done us proud so far and we expect you to do even better against
Argentina.''

Marseille, Paris, Toulouse prepare security for matches

Eds: UPDATES with official saying Toulouse fences undecided
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Marseille officials pressured by cafe owners
slightly eased tough alcohol restrictions Thursday for a weekend
World Cup match, but authorities in Paris and other cities were
ratcheting up their rules to prevent new violence.
	   Meanwhile, authorities in the southern city of Montpelllier
arrested an English fan linked to three days of clashes in
Marseille in which 50 people were injured and 80 detained.
	   The suspect, identified by English police as one of about 50
troublemakers from their country, was to be transferred to the
southern port.
	   The actions by French authorities were aimed at bringing a halt
to violence by a few hundred rowdy fans, most of them from England,
who were tarnishing the image of the country's World Cup attracting
1 million foreigners from June 10 to July 12.
	   Officials in a number of cities imposed alcohol restrictions and
either canceled or scaled back plans for the nation's annual
Festival of Music on Sunday, usually a carnival-style celebration
of music in the streets.
	   Marseille authorities planned increased security for Saturday's
match between the Netherlands and South Korea.
	   But regional Prefect Jean-Paul Proust relented on a strict
alcohol ban announced earlier, under pressure from cafe and
restaurant owners who said the measures were ``anti-business.''
	   Proust agreed Thursday to allow alcohol to be sold an hour
later, until midnight, and said cafes and restaurants could remain
open until 4 a.m.
	   Carry-out alcoholic drink remain strictly forbidden throughout
the weekend, starting Friday night.
	   Some 2,000 regular police are to be activated for weekend duty.
Their ranks will be bolstered by some 200 police of the
Anti-Criminal Brigade patrolling in groups in the city center, the
prefecture said. Riot police also are to be posted about town.
	   In Paris, officials announced Thursday that possession and
consumption of alcohol would be banned on the streets around the
Parc des Princes stadium in western Paris on match days.
	   Bars in the area would be ``asked to close'' on those days, the
police statement said.
	   Alcohol is also banned around the large World Cup viewing
screens built outside City Hall, near the Eiffel Tower and three
other locations in the capital, the statement said.
	   Police surveillance of ``at-risk fans,'' train stations,
transport and tourist sites would be increased, the statement said,
without giving figures. Festival of Music shows on the
Champs-Elysees were banned.
	   The southwestern city of Toulouse was bracing for England's next
match, with Romania on Monday.
	   But one of the measures, tentative plans for fences to separate
the crowd at Municipal Stadium, was drawing fire. Bruno Travarde,
spokesman for the World Cup's French organizers, said authorities
had yet to decide whether to erect the barriers and that it was up
to the local police prefect.
	   Some said the fences were the kind of security risk in which 96
Liverpool fans were trampled to death in England's 1989
Hillsborough stadium incident.
	   ``There was no trouble at the game itself in Marseille. I cannot
think of any justification for bringing back fences,'' said David
Mellor, head of England's Football Task Force.
	   About 1,000 English fans were already reported in France's
fourth-largest city, prompting officials to postpone the music
festival until July 11.
	   Officials also considered closing bars early and forgoing large
TV screens like the one on a Marseille beach where ticketless
English fans and local youths fought Monday afternoon.
	   In the northern city of Lens, where England is to play Colombia
on Friday, June 26, officials were boosting police presence and
canceled city events including a music festival.

33 governments sign telecommunications emergency pact 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAMPERE, Finland (AP) _ Representatives from 33 governments
signed a pact Thursday to streamline customs procedures for
importing essential telecommunications equipment, like mobile
phones, to sites of disasters and accidents.
	   The aim is to save lives by saving time.
	   ``This convention is absolutely essential to emergency
operations,'' said Larry Roeder, head of the U.S. delegation.
``It's a partnership, a team effort to save lives.''
	   Rescue work is often hampered by red tape at national borders,
delaying aid teams reaching accident spots.
	   ``The importance of the convention is that it allows us and
nongovernmental organizations to freely move telecommunications
equipment across borders,'' said John Rushby from the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees. ``It will ease the work on the ground.''
	   In addition to the 33 countries that signed the agreement in
Tampere, 170 kilometers (105 miles) north of Helsinki, dozens more
pledged their commitment but did not have the authority to sign,
said Finnish Development Aid Minister Pekka Haavisto.
	   ``We consider this agreement a major breakthrough in
international rescue work and 33 signatories is a good start,''
Haavisto told reporters.
	   The United States was expected to sign the convention by the
next U.N. General Assembly scheduled this fall, said Roeder from
the State Department.
	   The agreement, hammered out at a three-day meeting that ended
Thursday, has to be ratified by signatories before it becomes
legally binding. However, many nations were expected to adopt the
guidelines immediately.
	   ``We are in a cyclone area, and see nothing but good in this
agreement,'' said Chelsea Denny from the Ministry for
Telecommunications in Barbados. ``Our government will definitely
sign it.''
	   Sri Lanka also was expected to sign, said Rohan Samarajiva, from
the telecommunications regulatory commission in Colombo.
	   ``Countries that are close to each other, like Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh and India, have to share resources when it comes to
telecommunications in disasters,'' Samarajiva said.
	   ``This convention will allow us to obtain help in a systematic
way from people who have the resources when we have trouble,'' he
added.
	   Since 1970, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and other disasters
have caused damage estimated at 120 billion dollars, killing an
average of 100,000 people a year as well as leaving millions
homeless, relief agencies said.
	   ``The sad fact is that red tape often hinders rescue work, and
this document has the potential to help,'' said Dominique Loye,
from the International Committee of the Red Cross. ``But let's wait
and see how the signatories implement the document.''

World Cup: France leads Saudi Arabia 1-0 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Theirry Henry scored in the 36th
minute to give France a 1-0 halftime lead over Saudi Arabia on
Thursday, a game that featured the fourth red card of the day.
	   Saudi defender Mohammed al-Khlaiwi was ejected in the 19th
minute for a tackle on Bixente Lizarazu as the French defender
raced after the ball down the left sideline. The tackle looked
spectacular because of the speed of Lizarazu, who tumbled and
nearly landed on a bird settled on the grass beyond the end line.
	   Al-Khlaiwi's red card, issued by Mexican referee Arturo Brizio
Carter, came one day after FIFA president Sepp Blatter said
referees should crack down on fouls and follow a pre-tournament
dictate that rough play _ especially foul tackles from behind _ be
severely punished. Three players were ejected in Denmark's 1-1 draw
with South Africa earlier Thursday.
	   A victory would secure France a berth in the second round with
one first-round match remaining. A defeat would eliminate Saudi
Arabia from second-round contention.
	   Henry's goal, his second in the tournament, came after a nice
exchange between Zinedine Zidane and Lizarazu, with Zidane
supplying the final pass for an unmarked Henry to slot the shot
past goalkeeper Mohammed al-Daeyea.
	   With a one-man advantage for most of the half, France could have
easily led by two or more. Zidane pulled his shot badly to the left
with no one but the goalkeeper in front of him in the 28th minute,
and al-Daeyea made a nice save in the 31st minute on David
Trezeguet, who had entered the game one minute earlier after
Christophe Dugarry pulled up with an apparent hamstring injury.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's leading capitalist reformer came bouncing
back into the government Thursday, and immediately held out an SOS
sign to the West for dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in aid.
	   Anatoly Chubais, who was recently fired for a second time as a
deputy prime minister, was brought back onto President Boris
Yeltsin's team and charged with securing new loans to stabilize its
economy.
	   Chubais is one of the most disliked and mistrusted men in
Russia, and his appointment enraged Yeltsin's critics in
parliament, who questioned the legality of the appointment.
	   But he is also one of the few figures in Russia whose economic
expertise is respected by Western bankers and leaders, and is the
first person Yeltsin seeks out when the economy is in trouble.
	   Chubais said he would meet the acting chairman of the
International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, on Monday to discuss
the possible conditions for an additional loan to Russia.
	   He will have an uphill battle. The IMF postponed plans Thursday
to act on a proposed dlrs 670 million credit outlay to Russia,
saying it wanted to wait until next week. Without elaborating, the
agency said Russia needed ``to complete implementing the actions
necessary'' to secure the credit.
	   Russia took a number of measures Thursday to address the crisis.
The country sold dlrs 2.5 billion in a 30-year Eurobond aimed at
restructuring its short-term debt. Boris Fyodorov, the country's
new tax chief, said he had reached agreements with 13 to 15 oil
companies to pay back taxes.
	   And Premier Sergei Kiriyenko held a late-night meeting with
Russia's most powerful businessmen, the so-called oligarchs, to
gather their support and ideas on resolving the crisis.

World Cup: Denmark and South Africa draw 1-1 in ``strange match'' 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional; UPDATES with further quotes, details.
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ After Benni McCarthy scored the first
World Cup goal in South African history, he warned there could be
more to come.
	   ``Now I'm in a scoring mood,'' the 20-year-old Ajax Amsterdam
striker said Thursday after helping South Africa earn its first
World Cup point in a 1-1 draw with favored Denmark. ``I'm going to
go into the next match confident. Hopefully I'll get another one or
two. We're going to try to make Africa proud.''
	   The caustic match against the Danes didn't make anyone proud.
Colombian referee John Jairo Toro issued three red cards: two to
Denmark and one to South Africa in the second half, leaving only 19
players on the field at the final whistle.
	   He also showed seven yellow cards, including four for
time-wasting, after FIFA president Sepp Blatter complained this
week that referees were too lax.
	   McCarthy's 53rd-minute goal offset a 13th minute volley by Allan
Nielsen and set up a rollicking finish before the howling, capacity
crowd at the Stade Municipal that included Danish Crown Prince
Frederik, heir to the throne and oldest son of Queen Margrethe II.
	   The draw left Denmark with four points and atop Group C pending
the outcome of Thursday night's France-Saudi Arabia match in
Saint-Denis. Despite the excitement of the draw, it left South
Africa in third place and with little chance of advancing.
	   Both coaches refused to comment directly on the officiating,
with Bo Johansson of Denmark calling it a ``strange match.''
	   ``You have all seen what happened. I don't want to say anything
about it,'' a smiling Johannson said. ``If we ever think we know
how a game will be, we should remember this game.''
	   South African coach Philippe Troussier noted South Africa,
despite a minus-three goal differential, could still make the
second round.
	   ``It's not finished for us,'' he said, adding his team should
have taken advantage when it had 10 players to nine for Denmark at
the end.
	   ``I think we deserved to score one more goal,'' Troussier said.
``In the last 25 minutes we really wanted it, we really wanted to
win this game.''
	   Toro Rendon's strict refereeing threw the game into disarray in
the second half after McCarthy tied the score.
	   Danish substitute Miklos Molnar was sent off in the 67th minute
after knocking over South African captain Lucas Radebe. The crowd
jeered the decision, and Radebe returned to the pitch a minute
later.
	   Then Toro Rendon showed the red card to South African substitute
Alfred Phiri two minutes later for elbowing Thomas Helveg in the
face, drawing more derision from the crowd. An anguished Phiri wept
in his shirt before slowly walking off.
	   In the 85th minute, another Danish substitute, Morten Wieghorst,
went off for bumping McCarthy from behind and knocking him to the
ground. It was the second red card of the tournament for the
derided tackle-from-behind after FIFA officials promised a
crackdown.
	   Despite having a man advantage, South Africa was unable to get a
game-winner. Quinton Fortune came closest, blasting a shot off the
crossbar from outside the penalty area in the first minute of
second-half injury time.
	   Toro Rendon was loudly jeered as he left the field.
	   McCarthy, who said before the tournament he wanted to be
remembered for scoring an important goal, recorded his country's
first World Cup score after John Moshoeu fed Shaun Bartlett, who
backhealed the ball between Jens Hogh and Soren Colding.
	   McCarthy took the ball and put a left-footed shot from 10 meters
between the legs of Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.
	   Nielsen's goal in the 13th minute gave Denmark the start it
wanted. Brian Laudrup and Martin Jorgensen combined to beat Nyathi
on the right side, and Laudrup sent a cross that Nielsen volleyed
just before the ball hit the ground and sent it in off goalkeeper
Hans Vonk's hand.
	   The Danes also hit the left post behind Vonk twice in the first
half _ once on a looping corner by Jorgensen, followed by Laudrup's
header into Vonk's belly, and later on Ebbe Sand's right-footed
shot from the top of the penalty area.
	   South Africa's best chance came in first half came in the 28th
minute when McCarthy sent a rolling cross through the goal box that
an onrushing Helman Mkhalele could not reach with his left foot.

soccer federation FIFA threatened punitive measures Thursday.
	   Prime Sport International offered ``no questions asked reward''

	   PARIS (AP) _ On the day World Cup tickets went missing, red
cards were rediscovered.
	   Colombian referee John Jairo Toro ejected three players and
issued seven yellow cards in Thursday's 1-1 draw between Denmark
and South Africa. Only four red cards had been issued in the
tournament's 20 previous games combined.
	   Toro's tough stand came one day after FIFA president Sepp
Blatter and World Cup organizing committee chairman Michel Platini
said referees weren't following a pre-tournament dictate that rough
play _ especially foul tackles from behind _ be severely punished.
	   ``I thought the referee was a bit harsh in his decisions,''
South African captain Lucas Radebe said. ``He made people scared to
even go out and tackle. I think he made a mess-up of the game.''
	   Allan Nielsen scored in the first half for Denmark, and Benni
McCarthy netted South Africa's first-ever World Cup goal in the
second. The victory put Denmark in first place in Group C, pending
Thursday night's France-Saudi Arabia match.
	   Denmark finished the match nine-on-10 after Toro ejected
substitutes Miklos Molnar in the 67th and Morten Wieghorst in the
85th _ only three minutes after the latter entered the game. South
Africa's Alfred Phiri was expelled two minutes after Molnar.
	   Wieghorst was defended even by the player he fouled, McCarthy.
	   ``The guy hardly even touched me,'' McCarthy said. ``The referee
went out of his way to give him a red card and I am sure that was a
very silly _ a stupid _ decision from the referee.''
	   Danish defender Marc Rieper said Blatter and Platini's comments
were ``ridiculous.''
	   ``I don't know if he (Platini) is trying to ruin the tournament
that he made himself and kill the football game,'' Rieper said.
	   Among the crowd at Stade Municipal in Toulouse was Crown Prince
Frederik, heir to the Danish throne, who no doubt obtained his
ticket through proper channels. There were others who resorted to
different means.
	   The Paris office of an American travel agency discovered
Thursday morning that, during the night, someone climbed the
scaffolding outside its building, got inside, broke into the safe
and stole nearly 15,000 tickets and hundreds f thousands of dollars
in cash.
	   In addition to the tickets, the burglars also took access badges
to get into the Stade de France, the centerpiece stadium of the
World Cup. The Georgia-based agency, Prime Sport International,
offered a ``no questions asked reward'' of 1 million francs (dlrs
166,000) for recovery of the tickets.
	   Wayward tickets and absent tickets have been a concern for
organizers since the World Cup began last week. An international
ticket fraud scandal has led to three arrests, and on Thursday
organizers asked France Telecom to launch an investigation into
reports that a confidential phone number allowed thousands to
unfairly buy huge numbers of tickets.
	   The daily Le Parisien reported that a special phone number _
leaked within France Telecom _ gave privileged callers direct
access to the central switchboard handling ticket sales. The paper
cited a person identified only as Frederic, a communications
student, who used the number to snap up more than 400 tickets.
	   Thursday also brought a tearful apology from temperamental
striker, Faustino Asprilla, who asked to be reinstated to
Colombia's World Cup team.
	   ``I want to offer my apologies to the president (of the
Colombian Soccer Federation), his executive committee, the head
coach, my teammates, and, of course, the Colombian people,''
Asprilla said, reading a prepared statement.
	   Asprilla was kicked off the team after saying that coach Hernan
Dario Gomez ``disrespected'' him when he took him out of Colombia's
1-0 loss to Romania on Monday with five minutes remaining. The
furor has caught the attention of Colombian President Ernesto
Samper, who has also tried to persuade Gomez to reconsider his
decision.
	   Gomez said he's studying the situation, but admitted he ``liked
what Faustino had to say.''
	   ``But I don't know what the decision will be,'' Gomez said.
``The truth is, those are nice words by Faustino.''
	   Meanwhile, in Marseille, where three days of fans violence
surrounded Monday's England-Tunisia game, authorities planned
increased security for Saturday's match between the Netherlands and
South Korea.
	   Some 2,000 regular police will be on weekend duty, along with
some 200 Anti-Criminal Brigade forces patrolling the city center.
Riot police also will be posted about town.
	   But, under pressure from cafe owners, authorities relented on a
weekend alcohol ban in Marseille and agreed to allow drinks to be
sold until midnight.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Families of Argentine soldiers
who died in the Falkland Islands war will hold a memorial at the
site where a warship carrying 100 fighters was sunk.
	   On Thursday, the families flew out of Buenos Aires and headed
for Ushuaia, 1,515 miles (2,370 kilometers) south. From Ushuaia,
the group will travel by boat to the area 150 miles (240
kilometers) off the Argentine coast. They will bring floral
bouquets to be dropped near the site.
	   The ship, the General Belgrano, was sunk by British forces in
1982 when Argentina and Great Britain fought a 74-day war over the
islands.

World Cup: Denmark and South Africa draw 1-1 in ``strange match'' grafs; RESTORES lineups. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS style on referee's name to Toro in 12th, 14th, 17th
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ After Benni McCarthy scored the first
World Cup goal in South African history, he warned there could be
more to come.
	   ``Now I'm in a scoring mood,'' the 20-year-old Ajax Amsterdam
striker said Thursday after helping South Africa earn its first
World Cup point in a 1-1 draw with favored Denmark. ``I'm going to
go into the next match confident. Hopefully I'll get another one or
two. We're going to try to make Africa proud.''
	   The caustic match against the Danes didn't make anyone proud.
Colombian referee John Jairo Toro issued three red cards: two to
Denmark and one to South Africa in the second half, leaving only 19
players on the field at the final whistle.
	   He also showed seven yellow cards, including four for
time-wasting, after FIFA president Sepp Blatter complained this
week that referees were too lax.
	   McCarthy's 53rd-minute goal offset a 13th minute volley by Allan
Nielsen and set up a rollicking finish before the howling, capacity
crowd at the Stade Municipal that included Danish Crown Prince
Frederik, heir to the throne and oldest son of Queen Margrethe II.
	   The draw left Denmark with four points and atop Group C pending
the outcome of Thursday night's France-Saudi Arabia match in
Saint-Denis. Despite the excitement of the draw, it left South
Africa in third place and with little chance of advancing.
	   Both coaches refused to comment directly on the officiating,
with Bo Johansson of Denmark calling it a ``strange match.''
	   ``You have all seen what happened. I don't want to say anything
about it,'' a smiling Johannson said. ``If we ever think we know
how a game will be, we should remember this game.''
	   South African coach Philippe Troussier noted South Africa,
despite a minus-three goal differential, could still make the
second round.
	   ``It's not finished for us,'' he said, adding his team should
have taken advantage when it had 10 players to nine for Denmark at
the end.
	   ``I think we deserved to score one more goal,'' Troussier said.
``In the last 25 minutes we really wanted it, we really wanted to
win this game.''
	   Toro's strict refereeing threw the game into disarray in the
second half after McCarthy tied the score.
	   Danish substitute Miklos Molnar was sent off in the 67th minute
after knocking over South African captain Lucas Radebe. The crowd
jeered the decision, and Radebe returned to the pitch a minute
later.
	   Then Toro showed the red card to South African substitute Alfred
Phiri two minutes later for elbowing Thomas Helveg in the face,
drawing more derision from the crowd. An anguished Phiri wept in
his shirt before slowly walking off.
	   In the 85th minute, another Danish substitute, Morten Wieghorst,
went off for bumping McCarthy from behind and knocking him to the
ground. It was the second red card of the tournament for the
derided tackle-from-behind after FIFA officials promised a
crackdown.
	   Despite having a man advantage, South Africa was unable to get a
game-winner. Quinton Fortune came closest, blasting a shot off the
crossbar from outside the penalty area in the first minute of
second-half injury time.
	   Toro was loudly jeered as he left the field.
	   McCarthy, who said before the tournament he wanted to be
remembered for scoring an important goal, recorded his country's
first World Cup score after John Moshoeu fed Shaun Bartlett, who
backhealed the ball between Jens Hogh and Soren Colding.
	   McCarthy took the ball and put a left-footed shot from 10 meters
between the legs of Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.
	   Nielsen's goal in the 13th minute gave Denmark the start it
wanted. Brian Laudrup and Martin Jorgensen combined to beat Nyathi
on the right side, and Laudrup sent a cross that Nielsen volleyed
just before the ball hit the ground and sent it in off goalkeeper
Hans Vonk's hand.
	   The Danes also hit the left post behind Vonk twice in the first
half _ once on a looping corner by Jorgensen, followed by Laudrup's
header into Vonk's belly, and later on Ebbe Sand's right-footed
shot from the top of the penalty area.
	   South Africa's best chance came in first half came in the 28th
minute when McCarthy sent a rolling cross through the goal box that
an onrushing Helman Mkhalele could not reach with his left foot.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   South Africa: Hans Vonk; Mark Fish, Pierre Issa, David Nyathi

Norway to withdraw most peacekeepers from Lebanon after 20 years 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway will withdraw most of its U.N.
peacekeepers from Lebanon after 20 years in the Middle East because
of problems recruiting enough volunteers, the defense minister said
Thursday.
	   Defense Minister Dag Jostein Fjaervoll said the number of
Norwegians serving in the United Nation's UNIFIL force would be cut
to about 200 from the current level of 600 soldiers.
	   ``We don't have enough applicants to cover the needs of all our
international commitments and we have been forced to evaluate our
priorities for the future. We have had to recognize that we cannot
maintain a battalion level force in UNIFIL,'' he said.
	   Norway, a country of 4.4 million people, has 1,500 troops
committed to U.N. operations worldwide, many of them in Bosnia.
However, due to contract disputes, low unemployment during an
economic boom and declining prestige of being a peacekeeper, the
country has run into difficulty recruiting volunteers.
	   Norway first sent troops to the UNIFIL peacekeeping unit in
southern Lebanon in 1978, following an Israeli invasion. Norway
also gained respect in the Middle East for brokering a 1993 peace
accord between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization.
	   According to the Oslo newspaper Aftenposten, U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan wrote to Norway last month asking them to leave
the troops in place. The best Norway could do was leave 200
soldiers, Fjaervoll said.

Yemen to raise oil prices in line with economic reforms 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen will raise the prices of gasoline,
kerosene and cooking gas by about 40 percent starting Friday, an
official at the state-run Yemen Oil Company said Thursday.
	   The hikes are in line with the requirements by the International
Monetary Fund to end subsidies on petroleum products and other
commodities like flour and sugar by the end of 1998.
	   The oil company official said one gallon (3.8 liters) of
gasoline will cost 133 riyals (dlr 1), up from 95 riyals (69 cents)
and one gallon (3.8 liters) of kerosene will sell for 57 riyals
(41.8 cents), up from 42 riyals (30 cents).
	   Cooking gas bottles will cost 200 riyals (dlrs 1.5), up from 150
riyals (dlrs 1.1), said the official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The government raised the price of petroleum products by 25
percent last July.
	   Some gas stations implemented the new prices late Thursday.
Police was put on alert in case of protests, a security official
said under customary condition of anonymity.
	   Monthly salaries of civil servants range between 1,880 riyals
(dlrs 142) and 26,500 riyals (dlrs 200).
	   The increase in oil prices was scheduled for January, but was
never carried out because of conflicts over political and economic
policies between the former Prime Minister Faraj Bin Ghanem and
President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the real power in this impoverished
country.
	   Bin Ghanem, who spent less than one year in office, was replaced
by Abdel-Karim al-Iryani's in May.
	   The government has already cut back other subsidies and stepped
up privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the
reforms.
	   The IMF's other recommendations for rebuilding the economy
include floating Yemen's currency, the riyal and a cut in public
spending.
	   To help Yemen recover from the effects of the 1994 civil war,
the World Bank has approved a dlrs 80 million credit to support its
economic reform program.
	   Yemen currently produces 380,000 barrels of oil a day, earning
31 billion riyals (dlrs 235 million) a year from exports.

APEC ministers to push for freer trade 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific rim ministers will focus on
liberalizing trade in an attempt to solve the financial crisis that
is damaging Asian economies, a Malaysian official said Thursday.
	   The economic downturn had created a resurgence toward
protectionism in Asia, said Adlan Yahaya Uddin, executive director
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation secretariat.
	   Adlan said the trend should be countered by a public relations
campaign promoting economic and trade liberalization.
	   ``As far as APEC is concerned ... greater liberalization is the
solution'' to the economic crisis, Adlan told reporters, based on a
meeting of trade officials from 18 nations.
	   Trade ministers and officials from APEC member countries will
meet in the Malaysian city of Kuching from Monday to prepare for
the Kuala Lumpur APEC summit in November.
	   Senior officials met Thursday for a two-day session to prepare
for the ministerial-level meeting, which is expected to focus on
quickly liberalizing trade in nine priority areas.
	   A top U.S. official said Japan would face intense pressure to
produce an acceptable package of liberalization measures and to
quickly restore order to its economy.
	   ``(Japan's) got to deregulate; they've got to increase access;
they've got to make the recovery, region wide, work,'' said the
official who asked not to be named.
	   While APEC meetings normally focus on trade issues, this meeting
is likely to be overshadowed by Asia's economic crisis, which has
gripped much of the region since last year.
	   Effects of the Asian crisis have sent tremors through the U.S.,
whose trade with APEC countries is twice as large as with Europe,
the U.S. official said, adding that exports to APEC countries were
``down and down sharply.''
	   ``If Asia is hurting it will impact the U.S. It must,'' the
official said.
	   The nine sectors in which negotiators want to lower trade
barriers are environmental goods and services, medical equipment,
chemicals, energy, forest products, fish, gems and jewelry, toys,
and electronic commerce.
	   The plan, launched at the November Vancouver APEC meeting, is
known as the Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization process. It is
an effort to speed progress toward APEC's goal of free trade for
all countries by 2020.
	   Earlier this month in Singapore, APEC ministers agreed to reduce
testing requirements for imported telecommunication and information
equipment and in Kuching, ministers are expected to submit their
plans for achieving freer trade in the remaining sectors.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru, which are slated for admission in
November, have sent their ministers as observers.

French striker tears hamstring 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ French striker Christophe Dugarry
tore a right hamstring and had to be carried off the field of
Thursday night's World Cup game against Saudi Arabia.
	   Team officials would not comment on Dugarry's prospects for
continuing to play in the tournament, but it seemed unlikely he
would be available for the remaineder of France '98.
	   Dugarry appeared to injured the leg when he lifted his right leg
to settle a high ball. He immediately grabbed the back of his leg.
	   David Trezeguet, 20, replaced Dugarry in the 30th minute and
immediately added to the overwhelming French attack, creating
several chances.
	   The injury added to the woes of coach Aime Jacquet, who already
had to do without starting striker Stephane Guivarc'h for
Thursday's match against Saudi Arabia.
	   Guivarc'h strained his right knee strain against South Africa on
June 12 and is hoped to return to recover in time for Wednesday's
last Group C match against Denmark.

World Cup: Asprilla apologizes, asks to be taken back 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: ADDS Asprilla comments, grafs 10-11, 16-19.
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A teary Faustino Asprilla apologized Thursday for
comments that led to his dismissal from Colombia's World Cup team,
and asked for a second chance.
	   Head coach Hernan Dario Gomez said he's studying the situation,
admitting he liked what Asprilla had to say.
	   The popular but mercurial Asprilla was dismissed Wednesday for
publicly criticizing Gomez. He left the team's hotel in La Tour du
Pin, south of Paris, and was staying in the French capital with his
agent.
	   ``I want to offer my apologies to the president (of the
Colombian Football Federation), his executive committee, the head
coach, my teammates, and, of course, the Colombian people,''
Asprilla said reading a prepared statement.
	   ``If our head coach considers my being here important, I'm
willing to follow, enthusiastically and with discipline, all World
Cup rules, as I've always done,'' he said.
	   Gomez told Colombia's Radio Caracol he was not ruling out
readmitting Asprilla and that he'll study the striker's apology.
	   ``But I don't know what the decision will be,'' he said. ``The
truth is, those are nice words by Faustino.''
	   Asprilla was dismissed from the team Wednesday after publicly
criticizing Gomez. He claimed Gomez had a group of ``preferred''
players and that the coach had ``disrespected'' him when he took
him out of the Colombia's 1-0 loss to Romania on Monday with five
minutes remaining.
	   ``He took himself out of the team with his behavior,'' Gomez
said in explaining his decision.
	   Asprilla later said he had done everything he could to come
back.
	   ``I don't know what the head coach thinks. I've done everything
I could to come back. I practically got on my knees because I love
the team,'' he told Colombian radio station RCN.
	   Asprilla's departure was supported by Alvaro Fina, Colombian
Football Federation president, who said that ``unfortunately, he
had to be removed from the team. There is a limit for everything,
and this time he went over the limit.''
	   The announcement of Asprila's banishment from the team caused
shock waves in Colombia, where President Ernesto Samper even tried
to persuade Gomez to reconsider his decision.
	   ``I personally talked to him. He stressed what 'Tino' represents
to the world, to the country, and to the hopes of Colombians to
advance to the second round,'' Fina said.
	   But neither Fina nor Gomez yielded.
	   Nor did Asprilla, who said he had done nothing wrong.
	   ``I'm not a conformist player. I said what was bothering me and
I maintain it was unfair,'' Asprilla told RCN radio. ``This had
never happened in Colombia. I'm always the first one to pay for the
mess.''
	   Gomez said Asprilla disobeyed a team rule prohibiting players
from discussing team matters in public.
	   ``There is such a rule, but I'm not sure I can't speak my mind.
No one should be kicked out for that. I have the right to speak
out. I say what I feel,'' Asprilla told RCN.

Labor Party lawmakers approve bill to free imprisoned terrorists 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Northern Ireland
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After several days of bitter debate, lawmakers on
Thursday approved plans to grant early paroles to convicted
Northern Ireland terrorists on a divisive 215-116 vote.
	   The Labor Party government of Prime Minister Tony Blair, which
commands a strong majority in the House of Commons, was never in
danger of losing the vote, the key hurdle towards the bill becoming
law later this month. But Blair had sought cross-party support from
the opposition Conservatives and Northern Ireland's Protestant
lawmakers.
	   Instead 107 Conservatives voted against the bill. So did the
Ulster Unionists, whose leaders support the Belfast agreement. Two
other Protestant parties that oppose the compromise peace accord
also voted against the bill.
	   The agreement _ reached April 10 and ratified by voters May 22
in both parts of Ireland _ specified that Northern Ireland's
truce-observing gangs should have more than 400 imprisoned members
released by mid-2000.
	   In a separate section, the agreement said those outlawed groups
_ the Irish Republican Army on the Irish Catholic side, the Ulster
Defense Association and Ulster Volunteer Force on the British
Protestant side _ should also disarm under international
supervision by mid-2000.
	   The Conservatives' chief Northern Ireland spokesman, Andrew
Mackay, complained that the proposed law didn't explicitly link
paroles with disarmament.
	   He said as the bill stood, ``every single terrorist prisoner
could be released in Northern Ireland with not one gun being
decommissioned and not one ounce of Semtex (commercial explosive)
being handed in.''
	   But Northern Ireland Security Minister Adam Ingram, closing the
debate for the government, said requiring a specific link between
paroles and disarmament would violate the agreement's intentionally
flexible terms.
	   ``The agreement was negotiated in good faith and will be
implemented in good faith,'' Ingram said.
	   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble had lobbied for his
10-strong Commons team all to vote in favor of the bill. But in a
sign of the chronic disunity afflicting Northern Ireland's largest
party, Trimble did not attend Thursday's vote, nor did his three
most loyal deputies.
	   In their absence six Ulster Unionist dissidents led by Jeffrey
Donaldson, who similarly defied Trimble by whipping up Protestant
opposition in the May 22 referendum, all voted no.
	   The bill faces possible amendment June 29 in the upper House of
Lords before becoming law. Parliamentary authorities on Thursday
postponed that Lords debate from June 25, because Northern Ireland
voters will be selecting a new legislature that day.
	   The 108-seat Assembly, from which a 12-member administration of
Protestants and Catholics is to be drawn, is the cornerstone of the
Belfast agreement.

Pate surges to early lead at U.S. Open AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Pate's finish, quotes
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ The Olympic Club usually has the last word
at the U.S. Open.
	   Tiger Woods, Steve Pate and several other early starters all
gave Olympic their best shot on Thursday early in the first round
of the Open, and nearly all of them wound up taking one on the
chin.
	   With more than half of the field on the course, only Stewart
Cink and Ted Oh managed to get to 3-under. Of those who got to
2-under, they didn't stay there long.
	   ``That's the nature of this tournament,'' said Olin Browne, who
had six straight bogeys but managed to salvage a 3-over 73. ``Every
shot requires precision.''
	   Woods, out to prove he can win on U.S. Open courses that require
supreme accuracy off the tee, had consecutive birdies on the tough
five-hole stretch on the front nine and grimaced as two other
birdie attempts grazed the cup.
	   He was at 2-under through eight and belted a 3-wood into the
fairway on No. 9 and had a 40-footer (12 meters) for birdie.
	   Four putts later, he stood on the 10th tee, back at even-par and
trying to put a double bogey behind him. He then bogeyed 12 and 13
to fall to 2 over.
	   Pate had it even worse.
	   He took advantage of two surprising birdies _ a chip-in on the
par-3 third hole that would have scurried across the green into the
rough had it not banged into the stick and into the hole, and a
long putt on the ninth.
	   Pate was at 2-under going into the 609-yard (554-meter) 16th
hole when he had trouble finding the fairway, which always spells
disaster at the Open.
	   He hooked into the rough, hacked a wedge out and then hit his
long iron into the greenside bunker. After needing two tries to get
out, he saved bogey with a 15-footer (4 1/2 meters).
	   Pate went right into the rough on No. 17, almost an automatic
bogey on the par 4 that measures 468, to fall back to even. Then he
went back to the left rough on the closing hole, hit into two
bunkers, missed a short downhill putt and walked off with a double
bogey for 72.
	   ``Hit the fairway and you'll be fine,'' Browne said. ``Don't hit
the fairway and you're DOA.''
	   Pate brushed past reporters without comment.
	   A round of 72 figures to be good enough to stay in the thick of
things throughout the tournament. Browne, who tied for fifth at
Congressional last year, was pleased with his 73.
	   It could have been worse _ Browne had six straight bogeys
starting on the fifth hole, four of them three-putts.
	   ``I was looking for a plank out there,'' Browne said. ``I got on
a bogey train.''
	   With Olympic, it seemed like it was only a matter of time.
	   Cink became the first player to reach 3-under with a birdie at
the par-5 first hole, which played the easiest when the Open was
last played at Olympic, and consecutive birdies on Nos. 5 and 6.
	   Oh, who played the Los Angeles Open as a 16-year-old in 1993,
joined him at 3-under with a birdie on the par-3 eighth. Kirk
Triplett made the turn with a bogey-free 33 and remained 2-under
through 10 holes.
	   After the par-5 opener at Olympic, one of the toughest
five-holes stretches in championship golf await.
	   Triplett, Couples and Colin Montgomerie were the only players to
avoid bogey on the front nine. Couples made the turn in 34 and was
1-under through 10 holes until consecutive bogeys put him at
1-over.
	   Montgomerie scrambled for pars on the first two holes and also
turned in 34. He had two bogeys and a birdie and was even through
15.
	   The slightest mistake led to bogey _ or worse _ at The Olympic
Club, which seemed to pick up speed after three days of sunshine.
	   The rough, already penalizing at 5 inches (13 cms), was wet and
clinging from morning moisture and failed to dry up immediately.
The fairways seem to have even more roll, and the greens were
faster than any of the practice rounds.
	   ``Someone fiddled with his course,'' Browne said.
	   And Olympic certainly toyed with its challengers.
	   Mark Calcavecchia started with two birdies and a par, then
followed with a bogey, double bogey and another bogey. Scott
Verplank made eagle on the par-5 first hole and was 2-under through
four holes until losing four strokes on the next two holes.
	   Clarence Rose started with four pars and two birdies, then
bogeyed the next five holes.
	   A light fog hugged the foothills surrounding Olympic, an eerie
sight as the toughest test in golf got under way. And it didn't
take long for some players to stop dead in their tracks.
	   Montgomerie played a nice chip to the par-5 first hole,
satisfied as he began walking toward the green when the ball rolled
to a stop. Then he froze as it kept rolling farther away, kept on
the fringe only by the thick collar.
	   Payne Stewart's approach on No. 2 barely cleared the bunker and
looked like it would stay on the fringe about 20 feet (6 meters)
below the cup. He gave his caddie his club, looked back at the
green and couldn't believe his eyes.
	   The ball trickled a few feet, then a few feet more. Before long,
he was looking at a 20-yard (18-meter) chip back to the green. He
managed to save par.
	   David Duval, the co-runnerup with Couples at the Masters, was at
5-over with three holes to play. Jim Furyk, another favorite
because of his accuracy off the tee, missed the first two fairways.
He was at 1 over through 15.

<TEXT>
	   MACHICO, Madeira (AP) _ David Tapping of England shot a
6-under-par 66 Thursday to take a two-shot lead after the first
round of the Madeira Island Open.
	   Tapping, 23, fired eight birdies on the Santo da Serra course to
emerge from his obscurity during the past 10 months when he missed
12 halfway cuts in 15 tournaments.
	   ``It was one of those days where I could do no wrong,'' Tapping
said.
	   Four players shared second place _ 1995 Madeira winner Santiago
Luna of Spain, England's Roger Winchester, Stephen Ames of Trinidad
and Tobago, and Germany's Thomas Gogele.
	   American Brian Nelson, Spaniard Francisco Cea, and England's
John Mellor and Steven Bottomley were level on 3-under.
	   South African Wayne Westner pulled out of the tournament after
slipping and hurting himself during Wednesday's Pro-Am. He is
expected to be laid up for six weeks.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India continued to defiantly defend its
nuclear tests, warning that economic sanctions announced Thursday
by the United States were ``coercive'' and would rebound on
Washington.
	   ``Coercive measures such as these interfering with the free flow
of trade, investment and technology are unjustified and
counterproductive,'' India's Foreign Office spokesman K.C. Singh
said.
	   The international sanctions against India are expected to cost
it dlrs 2.5 billion in international bank loans annually, the
United States said. Pakistan, which also conducted nuclear tests,
is expected to lose an estimated dlrs 1.5 billion in loans.
	   The total of dlrs 4 billion reflects the average annual
borrowing from international financial institutions of ``non-basic
human needs'' requests by the two countries.
	   ``We consider it regrettable that these impediments have been
placed in the way of the growing economic cooperation between India
and the U.S.,'' the foreign ministry spokesman said.
	   The sanctions were announced by President Bill Clinton after
India carried out five underground nuclear tests last month,
provoking rival Pakistani tests.
	   Analysts say their worst impact could be on India's six-year
economic reform program, which opened up mostly government-owned
sectors to competition and tried to rid domestic industry of
decades of sloth.
	   But the Confederation of Indian Industry, a leading industry
group, said it hoped the private sector would not be affected by
the sanctions and trade and investment links between the United
States and India would remain strong.
	   The United States is the largest foreign direct investor in
India, the industry ministry said in an annual report for 1997-98
released Thursday.
	   The United States also is India's largest trading partner, and
there are fears a tough implementation of the sanctions could cut
off the country from crucial transfer of technology and aid for
infrastructure and development projects.
	   But India's nuclear official A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and its
tough-talking Defense Minister George Fernandes, who sat with
captains of industry Thursday to discuss ways around the sanctions,
shrugged off the possibility.
	   Kalam, head of the Defense Research and Development
Organization, said New Delhi was ready to cope with the denial of
technology to the country's defense establishment and industry.

Security Council appeals for return to order in Guinea-Bissau 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council appealed Thursday to
the international community to support Gambian mediation efforts in
Guinea-Bissau after the country's breakaway military faction
rejected peace talks.
	   Assistant Secretary-General Ibrahim Fall briefed the 15 council
envoys Thursday on the chaotic situation in the West African
country, whose capital Bissau has been pounded by heavy artillery
and mortar fire since fighting began June 7.
	   More than three-quarters of the city's population of 300,000 has
fled, according to witnesses and aid groups.
	   ``The council appeals to the international community to help
Guinea-Bissau in this difficult moment and naturally supports
politically the mediation being conducted by the minister of
foreign affairs of Gambia,'' council President Antonio Monteiro of
Portugal said.
	   Monteiro said the United Nations and key member states were
urging other countries in the region to give their support to the
mediation ``and we hope very much in the next hours the fighting
could be over and constitutional order re-established in this
country.''
	   Rebel spokesman Maj. Manuel De Santos Gomes said the mutineers
rejected the mediation of Gambian Foreign Minister Mohamed Sedat
Jobe, who traveled to Bissau by boat to act as a go-between for the
warring factions.
	   Government soldiers backed by troops from the Republic of Guinea
have pinned down the rebels around the military garrison in Bissau
and the international airport, bombarding what they called final
pockets of resistance.

World Cup: France beats Saudi Arabia 4-0 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ France became the second team to
qualify for the World Cup second round Thursday, beating Saudi
Arabia 4-0 in a game that featured two red cards.
	   It was a bittersweet victory for the French, who lost striker
Christophe Dugarry to a torn hamstring and had its most talented
player, Zinedine Zidane, ejected as part of a wave of red cards
that hit the tournament Thursday. Zidane will be automatically
suspended for France's next match against Denmark, a game that
could decide seeding for the second round.
	   With the defeat, Saudi Arabia became the first team to be
eliminated from contention for the second round. The Saudis lost to
Denmark 1-0 last week, while France beat South Africa 3-0.
	   Theirry Henry scored in the 36th and 77th minutes; substitute
David Trezeguet, who took Dugarry's place, netted in the 68th; and
Bixente Lizarazu in the 85th. The first two goals came when the
French were playing 11-on-10, following Saudi defender Mohammed
al-Khlaiwi's ejection the 19th minute.
	   Al-Khlaiwi's red card was given for a tackle on Lizarazu as the
French defender raced after the ball down the left sideline. The
tackle looked spectacular because of the speed of Lizarazu, who
tumbled and nearly landed on a bird settled on the grass beyond the
end line.
	   Zidane was expelled for stepping on Fuad Amin's hip after he
tackled the Saudi midfielder in the 70th minute.
	   The tough stand from Mexican referee Arturo Brizio Carter, who
also issued four yellow cards for seemingly minor offenses, came
one day after FIFA president Sepp Blatter and World Cup organizing
committee chairman Michel Platini said referees weren't following a
pre-tournament dictate that rough play _ especially foul tackles
from behind _ be severely punished. Three players were ejected and
seven yellow cards issued in Denmark's 1-1 draw with South Africa
earlier Thursday.
	   Henry's first goal came after a nice exchange between Zidane and
Lizarazu, with Zidane supplying the final pass for an unmarked
Henry to slot the shot past goalkeeper Mohammed al-Daeyea.
	   With the Saudis a man down, it was inevitable that France would
score again. It happened when al-Daeyea let Lilian Thuram's cross
go through his hands, allowing Trezeguet to put home the easy
header.
	   Henry outraced the Saudi defense and put his shot off the near
post for his second goal, his third of the tournament, and
Lizarazu's score was set up with a nice touch pass from Fabien
Barthez.
	   Dugarry tore his hamstring in the 30th minute when he pulled up
lame trying to play the ball near the Saudi penalty area. France
also played without striker Stephane Guivarc'h, who has a right
knee strain.

World Cup: Denmark, South Africa draw 1-1 in ``strange match'' 7.

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ After Benni McCarthy scored the first
World Cup goal in South African history, he warned there could be
more to come.
	   ``Now I'm in a scoring mood,'' the 20-year-old Ajax Amsterdam
striker said Thursday after helping South Africa earn its first
World Cup point in a 1-1 draw with favored Denmark. ``I'm going to
go into the next match confident. Hopefully I'll get another one or
two. We're going to try to make Africa proud.''
	   The caustic match against the Danes didn't make anyone proud.
Colombian referee John Jairo Toro issued three red cards: two to
Denmark and one to South Africa in the second half, leaving only 19
players on the field at the final whistle.
	   He also showed seven yellow cards, including four for
time-wasting, after FIFA president Sepp Blatter complained this
week that referees were too lax.
	   McCarthy's 53rd-minute goal offset a 13th minute volley by Allan
Nielsen and set up a rollicking finish before the howling, capacity
crowd at the Stade Municipal that included Danish Crown Prince
Frederik, heir to the throne and oldest son of Queen Margrethe II.
	   The draw left Denmark with four points and in second place in
Group C, two points behind France, which beat Saudi Arabia 4-0
Thursday night. It also left South Africa in third place and with
little chance of advancing.
	   For South Africa to get to the second round it must beat Saudi
Arabia on Wednesday, have France beat Denmark, and hope it can
overcome its four-goal deficit to the Danes in goal differential.
Denmark needs only a draw against France or anything less than a
South African victory to advance.
	   Both coaches refused to comment directly on the officiating,
with Bo Johansson of Denmark calling it a ``strange match.''
	   ``You have all seen what happened. I don't want to say anything
about it,'' a smiling Johannson said. ``If we ever think we know
how a game will be, we should remember this game.''
	   South Africa coach Philippe Troussier noted South Africa,
despite a minus-three goal differential, could still make the
second round.
	   ``It's not finished for us,'' he said, adding his team should
have taken advantage when it had 10 players to nine for Denmark at
the end.
	   ``I think we deserved to score one more goal,'' Troussier said.
``In the last 25 minutes we really wanted it, we really wanted to
win this game.''
	   Toro's strict refereeing threw the game into disarray in the
second half after McCarthy tied the score.
	   Danish substitute Miklos Molnar was sent off in the 67th minute
after knocking over South African captain Lucas Radebe. The crowd
jeered the decision, and Radebe returned to the pitch a minute
later.
	   Then Toro showed the red card to South African substitute Alfred
Phiri two minutes later for elbowing Thomas Helveg in the face,
drawing more derision from the crowd. An anguished Phiri wept in
his shirt before slowly walking off.
	   In the 85th minute, another Danish substitute, Morten Wieghorst,
went off for bumping McCarthy from behind and knocking him to the
ground. It was the second red card of the tournament for the
derided tackle-from-behind after FIFA officials promised a
crackdown.
	   Despite having a man advantage, South Africa was unable to get a
game-winner. Quinton Fortune came closest, blasting a shot off the
crossbar from outside the penalty area in the first minute of
second-half injury time.
	   Toro was loudly jeered as he left the field.
	   McCarthy, who said before the tournament he wanted to be
remembered for scoring an important goal, recorded his country's
first World Cup score after John Moshoeu fed Shaun Bartlett, who
backheeled the ball between Jens Hogh and Soren Colding.
	   McCarthy took the ball and put a left-footed shot from 10 meters
between the legs of Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.
	   Nielsen's goal in the 13th minute gave Denmark the start it
wanted. Brian Laudrup and Martin Jorgensen combined to beat David
Nyathi on the right side, and Laudrup sent a cross that Nielsen
volleyed just before the ball hit the ground and sent it in off
goalkeeper Hans Vonk's hand.
	   The Danes also hit the left post behind Vonk twice in the first
half _ once on a looping corner by Jorgensen, followed by Laudrup's
header into Vonk's belly, and later on Ebbe Sand's right-footed
shot from the top of the penalty area.
	   South Africa's best chance came in first half came in the 28th
minute when McCarthy sent a rolling cross through the goal box that
an onrushing Helman Mkhalele could not reach with his left foot.

Netanyahu receives plan to expand Jerusalem's borders spokesman

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Government planners on Thursday submitted a
development program for Jerusalem that would expand the city
westward, boost investment and seek to keep the Jewish population
at 70 percent of the total.
	   Citing a higher birthrate among Palestinians and a growing
number of Jews leaving Jerusalem, the plan, submitted to Prime
Ministers Benjamin Netanyahu, warned that by 2020, the Palestinians
will make up 40 percent of the city's population, unless the
government intervenes.
	   The plan seeks to attract more Jews to the city by building some
142,000 homes and investing heavily in job creation.
	   ``There is an effort to attract as many Jewish residents as
possible by increasing the industrial base to maintain the present
balance of the population.'' said David Bar-Illan, a senior advisor
to Netanyahu.
	   Bar-Illan said that while the plan contained target population
figures, this was not intended as a quota and that no one eligible
for residency would be kept out of the city.
	   However Palestinians have long complained that Israel is trying
to keep down the number of Arab residents in the city by
restricting building permits, demolishing homes built without
licenses, and revoking Arabs' residency permits.
	   Responding to the new Jerusalem plan, Ziad Abu Ziad, a member of
the Palestinian Legislative Council said ``This is a racist
approach, part of the ethnic cleansing policy Israel is
implementing against Arabs in east Jerusalem.''
	   Amir Cheshin, a long-time advisor to former Jerusalem mayor
Teddy Kollek has acknowledged that since Israel captured east
Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war, the city's master
plan has been aimed at preserving the population balance of 28
percent Arabs and 72 percent Jews.
	   According to city planners, 174,400 Palestinians and 417,000
Jews lived in the city at the end of 1995. The Palestinians made up
29.5 percent of the population, up from 25.8 percent in 1967.
	   The future of Jerusalem is to be negotiated in talks on a
permanent Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement that have not yet
begun, but are to conclude by May 1999.
	   The Palestinians want to establish a capital in east Jerusalem,
but Israel says it will never relinquish sovereignty over all of
the city.
	   Planners said a key development guideline was that ``The
relative size of the Jewish and non-Jewish populations in the city
should be maintained.''
	   If Jerusalem is to remain the united capital of Israel, ``It
will be necessary to aim for a target in which 70 percent of the
population will be Jews and 30 percent will be Arabs in 2020,'' the
report said.
	   The plan, which has been accepted in principle by Netanyahu,
calls for an expansion of Jerusalem's boundaries westward to
include the city's suburbs.
	   On a related issue, the development plan said that 325,000
people lived in east Jerusalem, 48 percent of them Jews. This
appeared to be a change from just a few years ago when city
officials said the number of Jews living in the eastern sector was
slightly larger than the number of Palestinians.

11 killed in plane crash near Montreal executive, full name of aircraft type. No pick up.

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ A commuter plane carrying a team of General
Electric engineers caught fire after take-off, then exploded
Thursday while attempting an emergency landing at Mirabel airport
near Montreal, killing all 11 people aboard.
	   The dead included two crewmen and nine employees of General
Electric's Canadian affiliate, authorities said.
	   The fire broke out minutes after the twin-engine turboprop left
Dorval, another Montreal-area airport, on a charter flight to
Peterborough, Ontario.
	   ``Once in the air, the pilot, in discussion with the tower,
advised them there was some smoke in the cockpit,'' said police
Cpl. Pierre Giguere. ``At that time, the plane was redirected to
Mirabel, where it crashed.''
	   Emergency vehicles were waiting and put out the fire ``as
quickly as humanly possible,'' but too late to save those on board,
said Ray Monette, manager at Mirabel. The airport is 30 miles (50
kilometers) northwest of Montreal.
	   ``The plane was on final approach _ engulfed in flames,''
Monette said. ``It would seem the pilot did succeed in landing the
plane. But then the aircraft exploded and veered off the runway.''
	   The identities of the passengers were not released immediately,
but General Electric said they were engineers who designed
hydroelectric turbines. Their duties were split between GE plants
in Lachine, Quebec, and Peterborough.
	   ``This is something that all of us in the company are greatly
saddened by,'' said General Electric Canada's chairman, Bob
Gillespie. ``It will be something that we will have to remember and
live with for a very long time.''
	   Federal investigators were examining the wreckage for clues as
to why the fire broke out. It was believed to have started in the
left engine.
	   Constable Gilles Deziel, a police officer who inspected the
crash site, said the plane was on its roof, about 150 feet (45
meters) from the runway.
	   ``Maybe three-quarters of the plane was all burned and all
black,'' he said. ``It appeared to be missing one wing and probably
a motor.''
	   The Fairchild Metroliner commuter plane was owned by
Quebec-based Propair, which operates about 2,000 charter flights a
year. General Electric was one of the airline's regular customers.
	   Brian Jenner, president of the association representing Quebec
air transporters, called Propair the ``cream of the crop'' among
carriers in the province. He said its safety record was good.
	   The plane's pilot was identified as Jean Provencher, 35, who was
Propair's chief pilot and had 15 years experience.
	   It was the worst plane crash in Canada since March 1989, when 24
people aboard an Air Ontario jet were killed near Dryden, Ontario.
	   Monette said it was the first fatal crash ever at Mirabel, which
was built in the 1970s to serve as Montreal's main airport but now
handles only charter and cargo flights because airlines and
passengers disliked its distance from the city.
	   Transport Minister David Collenette said Mirabel airport was the
scene of an emergency simulation exercise two weeks ago. Emergency
measures at the airport were deemed adequate, he said.
	   Asked if the response to Thursday's crash was adequate,
Collenette responded: ``Yes, absolutely.''

World Cup: Colombia's coach Gomez will quit after France '98 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LA TOUR DU PIN, France (AP) _ Colombia's head coach Hernan Gomez
blasted club officials in his native country as ``ignorant'' and
said Thursday he is ``fortunate'' to be leaving the team after the
World Cup.
	   Gomez had stated previously he would quit after the Cup, but
said recently he was considering staying on through 1999.
	   But that was before the controversy surrounding forward Faustino
Asprilla exploded. Gomez dismissed Asprilla Wednesday for publicly
criticizing the coach, and officials from various Colombian clubs,
unhappy with Gomez's handling of the situation, demanded that a
foreign coach be hired.
	   ``The club presidents know nothing about me, judging from their
ignorant comments,'' an angry Gomez said after Thursday's practice
for Monday's match against Tunisia.
	   Colombia lost its first match 1-0 against Romaina. After
Tunisia, it plays England on June 26.
	   Gomez said that by quitting, he was defending other Colombian
coaches.
	   ``I'm not doing it for me, because, fortunately, I'm on the way
out. But these ignorant people who talk about the need of hiring a
veteran foreign coach'' are insulting all Colombian head coaches,
he said.
	   Gomez had said in a recent interview he was considering staying
on to guide the team through the 1999 Copa America and the Olympic
qualifying. But the Asprilla matter and the executives' reaction
changed all that.
	   ``I've spent 11 years with the team. The road ends here and I
will not go on,'' he said.

World Cup: France blazes past Saudi Arabia; Zidane sent off to Djorkaeff on fourth goal 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS quotes; CORRECTS style on referre's name, changes assist
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ France joined Brazil in the second
round of the World Cup Thursday, beating Saudi Arabia 4-0 with a
joyful blend of bubbly soccer that hid the misery of yet another
French injury and the expulsion of star Zinedine Zidane.
	   Thierry Henry symbolized France's happy-go-lucky style with two
opportunistic goals. The Monaco winger has now scored half of
France's six goals, tying him for the World Cup's scoring lead.
	   ``I'm truly satisfied with my players,'' said French coach Aime
Jacquet.
	   ``They have a long way to go in the competition,'' Saudi coach
Carlos Alberto Parreira said of the French.
	   But a torn right hamstring suffered by Christophe Dugarry and
Zidane's expulsion for kicking an opponent warned there could be
doom ahead for the host nation.
	   Saudi Arabia was already down to 10 men because of a red card
when Zidane set Bixente Lizarazu free in the 36th minute. The
lightning quick left back perfectly passed it into the goalmouth,
where Henry coolly knocked it home for the opening strike.
	   In the 68th minute, substitute David Trezeguet added an
insurance goal, capitalizing on a rare error from goalkeeper
Mohammed Al-Dayea, who let a simple cross from Lilian Thuram slip
through his hands, offering the simplest of headers for the
20-year-old striker.
	   Henry, another 20-year old, scored his second in the 77th
minute, running on to a bad defensive clearance and beating
al-Dayea with a low right-footed shot.
	   To top off another sparkling performance, Lizarazu collected a
delicate backheel from Youri Djorkaeff in the 85th minute and set
the 80,000 strong crowd at the Stade de France chanting again with
goal No. 4.
	   Starting forward Dugarry however, had to be carried off with a
torn right hamstring, threatening the rest of his World Cup
campaign. Fellow forward Stephane Guivarc'h already had to sit out
Thursday's game with a strained right knee.
	   And Zidane will miss at least next Wednesday's first-round
closer against Denmark after Mexican referee Arturo Brizio sent him
off in the 70th minute for putting his studs in the hip of Saudi
captain Fuad Amin as they fell over one another during a challenge.
	   After the 1-1 draw between Denmark and South Africa, France now
leads Group C with 6 points, 2 ahead of the Scandinavians. Saudi
Arabia became the first team to be eliminated from second-round
contention.
	   Saudi Arabia started defensively and was so overpowered from the
start. In the 19th minute, Mohammed al-Khilaiwi was outrun by
blazing Lizarazu on the left and his late kick at the Frenchman's
leg was a first red card of the game.
	   ``We tried to break out of defense, but there was just no way to
stop the French team,'' said Parreira. ``We were demoralized.''
	   French coach Aime Jacquet made some surprising changes to the
lineup, sidelining Inter Milan star Djorkaeff and selecting Bernard
Diomede's qualities as a winger instead to keep the front of attack
as wide open as possible.
	   It worked like a dream with wave after wave coming from each
wing, either from Henry on the right or Diomede on the left.

World Cup: Injury will force Jordanov to miss match with Nigeria 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LE COUDRAY, France (AP) _ Ivaylo Jordanov's has re-aggravated an
injury to his left abductor muscle and will miss Bulgaria's Group D
match with Nigeria on Friday, coach Hristo Bonev said Thursday.
	   ``He has some problems so I prefer to save him for the next
match instead of substituting him five minutes into the game,''
Bonev said.
	   For the past several months, the 30-year-old Sporting Lisbon
defender has been troubled by the abdominal muscle ailment.
	   ``My pain was even greater than usual after the match with
Paraguay because of the hard pitch in Montpellier,'' Jordanov said
regarding the 0-0 draw.
	   Bonev did not immediately reveal who would replace Jordanov. But
in the last open practice session before the match with Nigeria,
29-year-old Gosho Ginchev, who plays for the Turkish side Antalya,
took Jordanov's place in the first squad.
	   Another player who appeared on the first team was Emil
Kostadinov, who replaced Compostella striker Luboslav Penev.
	   The latter change fueled speculation that the 30-year-old
attacker would get his wish to play again at the Parc des Princes
stadium in Paris where his two goals against France in 1993
clinched a spot for Bulgaria in the 1994 World Cup in the United
States.
	   Kostadinov entered the match in with 20 minutes remaining in the
match with Paraguay.

Red cards come out as Denmark-South Africa tie AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with France-Saudi Arabia; TRIMS
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ On the day World Cup tickets went missing, red
cards were rediscovered.
	   Five players were shown the red card and 11 saw yellow Thursday
as referees followed orders to crack down on rough play _ or
seemingly anything that looked like it.
	   ``The guy hardly even touched me,'' said South Africa's Benni
McCarthy, showing sympathy for Morten Wieghorst after the Danish
midfielder was ejected for a foul. ``The referee went out of his
way to give him a red card and I am sure that was a very silly _ a
stupid _ decision from the referee.''
	   Colombian referee John Jairo Toro ejected three players and
issued seven yellow cards in a 1-1 draw between Denmark and South
Africa.
	   Mexican Arturo Brizio pulled the red out of his pocket twice and
the yellow four times in France's 4-0 victory over Saudi Arabia, a
result which earned the French a second-round berth and made the
Saudis the first team to be eliminated from second-round
contention.
	   Only four red cards had been issued in the tournament's 20
previous games combined.
	   The tough stands came one day after FIFA president Sepp Blatter
and World Cup organizing committee chairman Michel Platini said
referees weren't following a pre-tournament dictate that rough play
_ especially foul tackles from behind _ be severely punished.
	   ``I thought the referee was a bit harsh in his decisions,''
South African captain Lucas Radebe said. ``He made people scared to
even go out and tackle. I think he made a mess-up of the game.''
	   At Saint-Denis, Theirry Henry scored in the 36th and 77th
minutes, his second and third goals of the tournament; substitute
David Trezeguet netted in the 68th; and Bixente Lizarazu in the
85th. The first two goals came when France was playing 11-on-10,
following Saudi defender Mohammed al-Khilaiwi's ejection the 19th
minute.
	   But the victory was bittersweet for the French, who lost striker
Christophe Dugarry to a torn hamstring and had its most talented
player, Zinedine Zidane, ejected as part of a wave of red cards.
Zidane will be automatically suspended for France's next match
against Denmark, a game that likely will decide seeding for the
second round.
	   France also played without striker Stephane Guivarc'h, who has a
right knee strain.
	   At Toulouse, Allan Nielsen scored in the first half for Denmark,
and Benni McCarthy netted South Africa's first-ever World Cup goal
in the second.
	   Denmark finished the match nine-on-10 after Toro ejected
substitutes Miklos Molnar in the 67th and Wieghorst in the 85th _
only three minutes after the latter entered the game. South
Africa's Alfred Phiri was expelled two minutes after Molnar.
	   Danish defender Marc Rieper said Blatter and Platini's comments
were ``ridiculous.''
	   ``I don't know if he (Platini) is trying to ruin the tournament
that he made himself and kill the football game,'' Rieper said.
	   Among the crowd at Stade Municipal in Toulouse was Crown Prince
Frederik, heir to the Danish throne, who no doubt obtained his
ticket through proper channels. There were others who resorted to
different means.
	   The Paris office of an American travel agency discovered
Thursday morning that, during the night, someone climbed the
scaffolding outside its building, got inside, broke into the safe
and stole nearly 15,000 tickets and hundreds f thousands of dollars
in cash.
	   In addition to the tickets, the burglars also took access badges
to get into the Stade de France, the centerpiece stadium of the
World Cup. The Georgia-based agency, Prime Sport International,
offered a ``no questions asked reward'' of 1 million francs (dlrs
166,000) for recovery of the tickets.
	   Wayward tickets and absent tickets have been a concern for
organizers since the World Cup began last week. An international
ticket fraud scandal has led to three arrests, and on Thursday
organizers asked France Telecom to launch an investigation into
reports that a confidential phone number allowed thousands to
unfairly buy huge numbers of tickets.
	   Thursday also brought a tearful apology from temperamental
striker, Faustino Asprilla, who asked to be reinstated to
Colombia's World Cup team.
	   ``I want to offer my apologies to the president (of the
Colombian Soccer Federation), his executive committee, the head
coach, my teammates, and, of course, the Colombian people,''
Asprilla said, reading a prepared statement.
	   Asprilla was kicked off the team after saying that coach Hernan
Dario Gomez ``disrespected'' him when he took him out of Colombia's
1-0 loss to Romania on Monday with five minutes remaining. The
furor has caught the attention of Colombian President Ernesto
Samper, who also tried to persuade Gomez to reconsider his
decision.
	   Gomez said he's studying the situation, but admitted he ``liked
what Faustino had to say.''
	   ``But I don't know what the decision will be,'' Gomez said.
``The truth is, those are nice words by Faustino.''
	   Meanwhile, in Marseille, where three days of fans violence
surrounded Monday's England-Tunisia game, authorities planned
increased security for Saturday's match between the Netherlands and
South Korea.
	   Some 2,000 regular police will be on weekend duty, along with
some 200 Anti-Criminal Brigade forces patrolling the city center.
Riot police also will be posted about town.
	   But, under pressure from cafe owners, authorities relented on a
weekend alcohol ban in Marseille and agreed to allow drinks to be
sold until midnight.

Chief weapons inspector: Iraq was stonewalling 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with details of the inspection plan,
timetable; ADDS date of experts' meeting in penultimate graf
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite Baghdad's claim of a
``breakthrough'' in U.N. arms inspections, Iraq is still refusing
to provide information on missiles, biological weapons and the
chemical warfare agent VX, the chief U.N. inspector said Thursday.
	   Richard Butler's report to the Security Council, based on his
talks in Baghdad last week, casts doubt on claims that Iraq may
soon be free from sanctions _ unless the council softens its demand
that Baghdad first account for all long-range missiles and nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Iraq is apparently gambling that Russia, France and China will
prevail over the United States and Britain and persuade the council
to end the sanctions without complete verification that all illegal
weapons have been destroyed.
	   During the talks, the two sides agreed on a two-month ``program
of work'' by the inspectors. The program calls among other things
for Iraq to clarify by July 21 where it supposedly destroyed 500
mustard gas artillery shells in 1991.
	   It also provides for experts from both sides to meet in Baghdad
early next month to review results of chemical analyses of soil
samples taken from sites were the Iraqis say illegal weapons were
destroyed.
	   U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Iraqis videotaped the three meetings with Butler and his team,
apparently to show them to sympathetic governments to reinforce
their case that Baghdad is fully cooperating.
	   As a result, they said, many of the remarks appeared to be
directed at an outside audience, including his frequent references
to the suffering of Iraqi civilians because of sanctions.
	   The inspectors must report to the council whether Iraq has
destroyed all illegal weapons. That is the main condition for
ending sanctions imposed in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein
invaded Kuwait.
	   Following last week's meetings, Iraq's deputy prime minister,
Tariq Aziz, called the agreement a ``breakthrough'' that would
``prepare the ground for the lifting of the economic embargo.''
	   Butler told reporters that ``if that work is done satisfactorily
... I believe we should be in a position'' to move toward the
lifting of sanctions.
	   U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, also
cautioned that some major issues would remain unresolved even if
the two-month program were completed satisfactorily.
	   For example, Butler's report said the Iraqis refused to allow
the issue of missile fuel to be included in the program. The
inspectors say Iraq may still be holding propellant for long-range
missiles, raising questions whether all such weapons have actually
been accounted for, as Baghdad claims.
	   More significantly, the report said Iraq ``refused ... to
clarify the extent of its attempts to produce the chemical warfare
agent VX.''
	   On biological weapons, Iraq refused to provide additional
information on its program. But at Iraq's request, the commission
agreed to another meeting of technical experts, including Russian,
French and Chinese, on July 11 in Baghdad to review material on
biological weapons which the Iraqis have already submitted.
	   ``In virtually all instances, Iraq remained firm in its position
that no relevant documents were available,'' the report said. ``In
one instance, Iraq refused to provide documents it acknowledged
having in its possession.''

Stewart holds early lead at U.S. Open AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Stewart at 66; UPDATES with quotes
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Payne Stewart was one of the few players
who had reason to celebrate Thursday at the U.S. Open.
	   Stewart made only one bogey in the first round, and put on a
remarkable finish with three straight birdies for a 4-under-par 66
and the early lead at The Olympic Club.
	   Stewart was the first player to break par today. John Daly saved
par from a greenside bunker on the 18th hole to shoot 1-under 69.
	   Stewart's birdie binge started on the par-5 16th. The key was
No. 17 _ at 468 yards (425 meters) and only a par 4, the toughest
hole at Olympic. Stewart hit a 2-iron from the first cut of rough
into about 30 feet (9 meters) then did a little dance when the putt
dropped for birdie.
	   ``4-3-3 is really unheard of on those last three holes,''
Stewart said. ``It really was spectacular.''
	   He'll get no argument from the rest of the field, which gave
Olympic its best shot.
	   Colin Montgomerie and Andrew Magee finished at even-par 70,
while Chris DiMarco got up-and-down 10 times from off the green in
his round of 71.
	   ``I tried to limit my mistakes. I was patience, which was key,''
Montgomerie said.
	   Most of the time, Olympic has the last word.
	   Tiger Woods was among those who threatened to put together a
nice round _ anything around par is suitable at U.S. Open courses
that punish everyone with deep rough.
	   Woods, out to prove he can win on U.S. Open courses that require
supreme accuracy off the tee, had consecutive birdies on the tough
five-hole stretch on the front nine and grimaced as two other
birdie attempts grazed the cup.
	   He was at 2-under through eight and belted a 3-wood into the
fairway on No. 9 and had a 40-footer (12 meters) for birdie.
	   Four putts later, he stood on the 10th tee, back at even-par and
trying to put a double bogey behind him. He then bogeyed 12 and 13,
and had consecutive bogeys again starting on No. 16.
	   Woods, who played the final 10 holes at 6-over, finished at 74.
He has now shot better than par twice in 10 rounds at the U.S.
Open.
	   Stewart Cink and Ted Oh were the first two players to get to
3-under. That vanished when Oh took a double bogey on No. 11, and
Cink dropped shots on the ninth and 11th holes.
	   Steve Pate was so steamed after his round that he left without
comment. Pate was at 2-under going into the 609-yard (554-meter)
16th hole when he had trouble finding the fairway, which always
spells disaster at the Open.
	   He hooked into the rough, hacked a wedge out and then hit his
long iron into the greenside bunker. After needing two tries to get
out, he saved bogey with a 15-footer (4 1/2 meters).
	   Pate went right into the rough on No. 17, almost an automatic
bogey on the par 4 that measures 468, to fall back to even. Then he
went back to the left rough on the closing hole, hit into two
bunkers, missed a 3-foot (0.9-meter) downhill putt and walked off
with a double bogey for 72.
	   ``It's incredible what the USGA can do to limit scoring,'' said
Colin Montgomerie, who never got over par in his round of 70. ``The
pin positions out there are on the limit. You couldn't see them
putting them in that position, yet they did.''
	   After the par-5 opener at Olympic, one of the toughest
five-holes stretches in championship golf await.
	   Kirk Triplett, Fred Couples and Montgomerie were the only
players to avoid bogey on the front nine among the early starters.
Couples made the turn in 34 and was 1-under through 10 holes until
consecutive bogeys put him at 1-over. He saved bogey on 18 from
about 12 feet (3 1/2 meters) to finish at 72.
	   The slightest mistake led to bogey _ or worse. The rough,
already penalizing at 5 inches (13 cms), was wet and clinging from
morning moisture and failed to dry immediately. The fairways seem
to have even more roll, and the greens were faster than any of the
practice rounds.
	   ``Someone fiddled with his course,'' said Olin Browne, who
overcame six straight bogeys to finish at 3-over 73.
	   Mark Calcavecchia started with two birdies and a par, then
followed with a bogey, double bogey and another bogey. He finished
with 73.
	   Clarence Rose started with four pars and two birdies, then
bogeyed the next five holes and wound up with a 75.
	   The sun tried to break through just as some of the late starters
began to tee off. Among them were defending champion Ernie Els and
Justin Leonard, one of the favorites this week because of his
grinding style.
	   Stewart's 66 was posted not long after they started, giving them
something to shoot for. Olympic already had whipped a majority of
the field, giving them something to avoid.

World Cup: Injury will force Iordanov to miss match with Nigeria 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: REPEATING to CORRECT style on Iordanov's name.
<TEXT>
	   LE COUDRAY, France (AP) _ Ivaylo Iordanov's has aggravated an
injury to his left abductor muscle and will miss Bulgaria's Group D
match with Nigeria on Friday, coach Hristo Bonev said Thursday.
	   ``He has some problems so I prefer to save him for the next
match instead of substituting him five minutes into the game,''
Bonev said.
	   For the past several months, the 30-year-old Sporting Lisbon
defender has been troubled by the abdominal muscle ailment.
	   ``My pain was even greater than usual after the match with
Paraguay because of the hard pitch in Montpellier,'' Jordanov said
regarding the 0-0 draw.
	   Bonev did not immediately reveal who would replace Jordanov. But
in the last open practice session before the match with Nigeria,
29-year-old Gosho Ginchev, who plays for the Turkish side Antalya,
took Jordanov's place in the first squad.
	   Another player who appeared on the first team was Emil
Kostadinov, who replaced Compostella striker Luboslav Penev.
	   The latter change fueled speculation that the 30-year-old
attacker would get his wish to play again at the Parc des Princes
stadium in Paris where his two goals against France in 1993
clinched a spot for Bulgaria in the 1994 World Cup in the United
States.
	   Kostadinov entered the match in with 20 minutes remaining in the
match with Paraguay.

Deadlock unbroken in Ethiopian-Eritrean peace talks

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ African leaders failed Thursday to break
a deadlock between Ethiopia and Eritrea and end a nearly 6-week
border conflict that has cost hundreds of lives.
	   Ethiopia insists that Eritrea withdraw from disputed areas
before peace talks begin.
	   Eritrea has refused, claiming it is rightfully on land defined
by boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
Ethiopia claims the territory under new boundaries established when
Eritrea regained independence in 1993.
	   After separate closed-door meetings with Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki in
their capitals, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu said the
impasse had not been resolved.
	   ``We are not at that point yet,'' he said.
	   Nonetheless, the Organization of African Unity delegation was
``feeling optimistic'' because the first round of shuttle diplomacy
went well.
	   ``We have got information that we didn't have before,''
Bizimungu said.
	   OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said after the first
meeting with Meles, the delegation brought a ``message of concern
on behalf of Africa and the message of Africa's desire to see a
peaceful end to this very tragic and very unfortunate conflict.''
	   The OAU leaders planned to return to Addis Ababa for another
round of negotiations, then fly back to Asmara on Friday, said
Saidou Ouedraogo, spokesman for delegation leader Blaise Compaore,
president of Burkina Faso.
	   In a proposal outlined to the OAU delegation, Isaias called for
demilitarization of conflict zones within a month, monitored by
foreign observers and representatives of both sides. Troops would
be pulled out of the hotly contested Badme region first.
	   The U.N. Cartographic Section, or other appropriate body, would
have six months to demarcate the boundary between the neighboring
countries ``in accordance with existing colonial border treaties,''
under the Eritrean plan.
	   The Ethiopians refused to comment on the negotiations.
	   The countries' border conflict that broke out in early May has
claimed hundreds of lives on three fronts and in air attacks. In a
first sign that the two leaders may be willing to compromise, they
agreed under U.S.-Italian pressure on Sunday to halt air strikes.
	   Ground fighting has subsided since June 11.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian

World Cup: Injury will force Iordanov to miss match with Nigeria

<TEXT>
	   LE COUDRAY, France (AP) _ Ivaylo Iordanov's has aggravated an
injury to his left abductor muscle and will miss Bulgaria's Group D
match with Nigeria on Friday, coach Hristo Bonev said Thursday.
	   ``He has some problems so I prefer to save him for the next
match instead of substituting him five minutes into the game,''
Bonev said.
	   For the past several months, the 30-year-old Sporting Lisbon
defender has been troubled by the abdominal muscle ailment.
	   ``My pain was even greater than usual after the match with
Paraguay because of the hard pitch in Montpellier,'' Jordanov said
regarding the 0-0 draw.
	   Bonev did not immediately reveal who would replace Jordanov. But
in the last open practice session before the match with Nigeria,
29-year-old Gosho Ginchev, who plays for the Turkish side Antalya,
took Jordanov's place in the first squad.
	   Another player who appeared on the first team was Emil
Kostadinov, who replaced Compostella striker Luboslav Penev.
	   The latter change fueled speculation that the 30-year-old
attacker would get his wish to play again at the Parc des Princes
stadium in Paris where his two goals against France in 1993
clinched a spot for Bulgaria in the 1994 World Cup in the United
States.
	   Kostadinov entered the match in with 20 minutes remaining in the
match with Paraguay.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ As America's U.N. envoy, Richard Holbrooke
will need all his negotiating skills to cope with potential
firestorms from Kosovo to South Asia at a time when U.S. leverage
over old foes and reluctant allies is waning.
	   Holbrooke, architect of the 1995 agreement that ended the 3
1/2-year Bosnian war, was named U.N. ambassador Thursday,
succeeding Bill Richardson who will take over as energy secretary.
	   The 57-year-old Holbrooke, who served as assistant secretary of
state for European affairs in the Clinton Administration and
assistant secretary for Asian affairs in the Carter administration,
will be the most seasoned diplomat to represent America at the
United Nations since Thomas Pickering, the U.S. envoy here during
the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
	   After negotiating the Bosnia accord, Holbrooke served as special
U.S. envoy on Cyprus, a Mediterranean island divided between rival
Greek and Turkish communities.
	   Experienced diplomats of other member states say success at the
United Nations _ where envoys deal simultaneously with a range of
issues and many different players _ is quite different from
handling bilateral negotiations on single issues.
	   ``As I found when I came here, it is important to listen to what
others have to say,'' British Ambassador John Weston said Thursday.
``And very often, that is the secret to getting things done in the
U.N.''
	   Holbrooke will be arriving at a critical period. Numerous crises
are looming:
	   _ In Kosovo, fighting between Serbs and ethnic Albanians
threatens to engulf region, triggering a wider Balkan war and
unraveling the very peace Holbrooke put together in Bosnia.
	   _ In Cyprus, Turkey is threatening military action if the Greek
Cypriot government takes delivery of surface-to-air missiles, which
a Russian company plans to deliver by mid-August.
	   _ Nuclear tests last month by India and Pakistan have undermined
the fabric of nuclear nonproliferation agreements and raised the
specter of nuclear conflict in South Asia.
	   _ A showdown is brewing with Iraq over economic sanctions, which
had been the cornerstone of U.S. security policy in the Persian
Gulf.
	   _ Washington's inability to revive the moribund Arab-Israeli
peace process is making it difficult to fend off pressure from the
Arabs and Europeans for a stronger international role in mediation.
	   Those are just the major ones. No effective security policy has
been developed to cope with instability in Africa, where any number
of local conflicts could explode into crisis.
	   Similar crises are smouldering in Georgia, Afghanistan and
Tajikistan. U.S. influence has been compromised by the intractable
problem of the more than dlrs 1 billion the United States owes in
back dues to the United Nations.
	   The high-watermark of U.S. influence at the United Nations was
reached in 1990, when the Bush Administration persuaded the
Security Council to endorse military action to drive Iraqi invaders
from Kuwait.
	   Since then, however, Washington has been less successful in
mustering support in the Security Council for a robust response to
crises.
	   U.S. efforts to threaten military action against Iraq over U.N.
weapons inspections fell flat. Washington had to rely on
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to negotiate a way out of the impasse
and convince the Iraqis to open sensitive sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   If U.N. inspectors report significant progress by October in
accounting for Iraq's illegal arms, Russia, France and China will
exert strong pressure within the Security Council to wrap up
inspections and lift sanctions, with or without Saddam in power.
	   Russia has resisted British and American efforts in the Security
Council to threaten military force to halt the fighting in Kosovo.
China too is playing a more assertive role in the council, taking
positions closer to the Russians than the Americans on several
major issues.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ More than 50 years after fleeing the
ruins of Croatia's Nazi puppet state, the commander of its most
notorious death camp returned home Thursday to await trial on
atrocity charges.
	   Dinko Sakic, who lived quietly along Argentina's Atlantic coast
for more than four decades, was escorted off a plane that brought
him from Frankfurt, Germany, to a waiting police van.
	   He was driven straight to jail, where he will undergo a medical
examination before being taken to his cell, said Ivan Damjanovic,
chief jail supervisor.
	   Sakic is scheduled to appear before an investigative judge on
Friday. Actual charges must be brought within six months,
Damjanovic said.
	   His trial is expected to polarize Croatia, which in 1991
declared independence from Yugoslavia and relived World War II
enmities by battling the Serbs _ the camp's major victims _ to
secure the fledgling state.
	   The trial will bring a long, unexamined past into the public eye
and reopen debate about whether the Croats supported their World
War II Nazi regime or opposed it.
	   Sakic is accused of crimes against humanity and international
law for actions carried out in the early 1940s, when he commanded
the Jasenovac concentration camp, known later as the ``Auschwitz of
the Balkans.''
	   Exact numbers for the thousands of people who died there are not
known. Figures range from 35,000 to 500,000.
	   A court subpoena issued in April accused Sakic of committing
``grave and fatal'' criminal acts. The court said tens of thousands
of people were detained, tortured and killed in Jasenovac and the
nearby camp at Gradiska.
	   If convicted, Sakic faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in jail.
	   The overwhelming majority of those killed at Jasenovac were
Serbs. Victims also included Jews, Gypsies and Croats who opposed
the Ustasha puppet state.
	   Croats largely welcomed the establishment of Croatia's Nazi
regime in 1941 as an incarnation of centuries-old dreams for an
independent state. However, many also fought alongside
anti-fascists.
	   A small group of ultranationalists sang Ustasha songs outside
the airport terminal as Sakic's plane landed and handed out
leaflets condemning Croatia for his extradition from Argentina.
	   Sakic came to Argentina's attention in an April 6 interview with
a Buenos Aires television station. In the interview, Sakic admitted
he was commander of the Jasenovac camp but said prisoners were not
killed under his command.
	   The interview prompted an outcry for his arrest, and Argentina
agreed to extradite him to Croatia.
	   Sakic also said he has traveled openly, on a passport using his
real identity, to a number of countries, including the United
States.
	   He said he even met with Croatian president Franjo Tudjman
during the president's 1994 visit to Buenos Aires.

Swiss central bank says US freeze of assets unlikely 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Serves as 2nd Ld-Writethru for some points
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Responding to threats from a U.S. lawyer,
Switzerland's central bank pledged Thursday to fight any legal
action in the United States over its wartime handling of Nazi gold.
	   Holocaust victims and their heirs have already sued
Switzerland's three largest commercial banks, and Michael Hausfeld,
one of their U.S. lawyers, has raised the specter of following up
with a class-action suit against Swiss National Bank.
	   Swiss National Bank President Hans Meyer repeated Thursday that
U.S. courts have no jurisdiction over the central bank of another
sovereign state.
	   Asked what leverage an American court might have over
Switzerland, he said U.S. authorities could freeze Swiss assets in
the United States.
	   He said this was unlikely to happen, but said the bank _ which
reportedly has dlrs 24 billion worth of gold stored in the United
States _ is ``provisionally'' prepared. The government has no
active plans to withdraw the gold, he emphasized.
	   Recent studies have found that the bank, charged with
maintaining the gold backing for the neutral country's currency
during the war, accepted gold looted from Nazi-occupied countries
and Third Reich victims.
	   The Swiss commercial banks that have been sued have been working
with Jewish organizations and plaintiffs on a ``global settlement''
of claims by Holocaust victims.
	   But Jean-Pierre Roth, vice president of the Swiss National Bank,
said the bank would refuse to ``enter into negotiations concerning
an out-of-court settlement.''
	   He said the bank had already acknowledged that it ``may have
unwittingly acquired gold originating from concentration camps.''
	   ``We regret most profoundly that the National Bank became
involved in the horrors of the Holocaust in this way by the
confusions of the war,'' he said.
	   During World War II, Switzerland needed increasing amounts of
gold to meet the rising demand for the Swiss franc, which was then
the only internationally acceptable currency on the European
continent.
	   Roth said historians have failed to explain fully the challenges
faced by the central bank of a small neutral country surrounded by
Nazi Germany and its allies.
	   He said Switzerland was forced into closer dealings with the
Nazis in part because of the U.S. government's freezing of Swiss
assets _ including gold deposits _ during the war.

World Cup: France blazes past Saudi Arabia; Zidane sent off 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ France joined Brazil in the second
round of the World Cup Thursday, beating Saudi Arabia 4-0 with a
joyful blend of bubbly soccer that hid the misery of yet another
French injury and the expulsion of star Zinedine Zidane.
	   Thierry Henry symbolized France's happy-go-lucky style with two
opportunistic goals. The Monaco winger has now scored half of
France's six goals, tying him for the World Cup's scoring lead.
	   ``I have to say we missed far too many chances,'' said French
coach Aime Jacquet, after Les Bleus pounced on the Saudi defense
throughout the game, ceaselessly creating danger from both sides.
	   The Saudis were overwhelmed.
	   ``They have a long way to go in the competition,'' said Saudi
coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said of the French.
	   But a torn right hamstring suffered by Christophe Dugarry, who
will be out for at least two weeks, and Zidane's expulsion for
kicking an opponent warned there could be doom ahead for the host
nation.
	   ``All would be great if not for Dugarry's injury. All would be
great if not for Zidane's expulsion,'' Jacquet said. ``He will pay
for it. His gesture had to be punished. We have been talking to our
playing about this for a long time. They must stay calm. They must
show self-control.''
	   Saudi Arabia was already down to 10 men because of a red card
when Zidane set Bixente Lizarazu free in the 36th minute. The
lightning quick left back perfectly passed it into the goalmouth,
where Henry coolly knocked it home for the opening strike.
	   In the 68th minute, substitute David Trezeguet added an
insurance goal, capitalizing on a rare error from goalkeeper
Mohammed Al-Dayea, who let a simple cross from Lilian Thuram slip
through his hands, offering the simplest of headers for the
20-year-old striker.
	   Henry, another 20-year-old and Trezeguet's best friend, scored
his second in the 77th minute, running on to a bad defensive
clearance and beating al-Dayea with a low right-footed shot.
	   To top off another sparkling performance, Lizarazu collected a
delicate backheel from Youri Djorkaeff in the 85th minute and set
the 80,000 strong crowd at the Stade de France chanting the
Marseillaise with goal No. 4.
	   Starting forward Dugarry however, had to be carried off with a
torn right hamstring, threatening the rest of his World Cup
campaign. Fellow forward Stephane Guivarc'h already had to sit out
Thursday's game with a strained right knee.
	   And Zidane will miss at least next Wednesday's first-round
closer against Denmark after Mexican referee Arturo Brizio sent him
off in the 70th minute for putting his studs in the hip of Saudi
captain Fuad Amin as they fell over one another during a challenge.
	   After the 1-1 draw between Denmark and South Africa, France now
leads Group C with 6 points, 2 ahead of the Scandinavians. Saudi
Arabia became the first team to be eliminated from second-round
contention.
	   ``We have to win the next one, too,'' Jacquet said. ``It's our
law of soccer and we will not start calculating now.''
	   Saudi Arabia started defensively and was so overpowered from the
start. In the 19th minute, Mohammed al-Khilaiwi was outrun by
blazing Lizarazu on the left and his late kick at the Frenchman's
leg was the first red card of the game.
	   Brizio's tough stand came one day after FIFA president Sepp
Blatter and World Cup organizing committee chairman Michel Platini
said referees weren't following a pre-tournament dictate that rough
play _ especially foul tackles from behind _ be severely punished.
	   While Jacquet thought Zidane's red card was justified, Parreira
was upset about al-Khilaiwi's ejection.
	   ``This decision, which I don't think was a right decision for
the referee, made the game easy for the French,'' Parreira said.
``It was a very strict (red card).''
	   After that, France never let up.
	   ``We tried to break out of defense, but there was just no way to
stop the French team,'' Parreira said. ``We were demoralized.''

33 governments sign telecommunications emergency pact

<TEXT>
	   TAMPERE, Finland (AP) _ Representatives from 33 governments
signed a pact Thursday to streamline customs procedures for
importing essential telecommunications equipment, like mobile
phones, to sites of disasters and accidents.
	   The aim is to save lives by saving time.
	   ``This convention is absolutely essential to emergency
operations,'' said Larry Roeder, head of the U.S. delegation.
``It's a partnership, a team effort to save lives.''
	   Rescue work is often hampered by red tape at national borders,
delaying aid teams reaching accident spots.
	   ``The importance of the convention is that it allows us and
nongovernmental organizations to freely move telecommunications
equipment across borders,'' said John Rushby from the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees. ``It will ease the work on the ground.''
	   In addition to those who signed the agreement in Tampere, 170
kilometers (105 miles) north of Helsinki, dozens more countries
pledged their commitment but did not have the authority to sign,
said Finnish Development Aid Minister Pekka Haavisto.
	   ``We consider this agreement a major breakthrough in
international rescue work and 33 signatories is a good start,''
Haavisto said.
	   The United States was expected to sign the convention by the
next U.N. General Assembly scheduled this fall, said Roeder from
the State Department.
	   The agreement, hammered out at a three-day meeting that ended
Thursday, has to be ratified by signatories before it becomes
legally binding. However, many nations were expected to adopt the
guidelines immediately.
	   ``We are in a cyclone area, and see nothing but good in this
agreement,'' said Chelsea Denny from the Ministry for
Telecommunications in Barbados. ``Our government will definitely
sign it.''
	   Since 1970, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and other disasters
have caused damage estimated at dlrs 120 billion, killing an
average of 100,000 people a year as well as leaving millions
homeless, relief agencies said.
	   ``The sad fact is that red tape often hinders rescue work, and
this document has the potential to help,'' said Dominique Loye,
from the International Committee of the Red Cross. ``But let's wait
and see how the signatories implement the document.''

Nigerian military rulers continue freeing political prisoners 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military rulers took another
step to appease critics Thursday by announcing the release of six
more political prisoners four days after eight well-known detainees
were granted freedom.
	   Arthur Nwankwo, a respected writer and pro-democracy activist
was among the latest six to be released from prisons across this
sprawling West African country.
	   Nwankwo was freed without warning from a detention center in
Enugu, eastern Nigeria and returned home to the commercial hub of
Lagos to an emotional family welcome, several radio stations
reported.
	   Human rights lawyer Ebun Olu Adegboruwa was among the others
being released Thursday, the government said in a statement given
to the press. Four were reportedly trade union leaders whose names
were not immediately available.
	   It was not clear by late Thursday whether all of the six had
returned home. No reason was given for the latest announced
releases.
	   Adegboruwa's release followed a plea earlier in the day from a
major rights group, the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights,
which said the lawyer had fallen seriously ill in prison.
	   Since he took power on June 8, Nigeria's new military ruler,
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has sent mixed messages to activists and
opponents of his predecessor, Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   On Monday, Abubakar received praises from critics for releasing
nine jailed figures, including Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, 62,
Nigeria's head of state from 1976-1979 who was a vocal opponent of
Abacha's rule before being jailed in 1995. All nine had returned
home by Thursday.
	   However, the nation's best-known detainee, Moshood Abiola,
apparent winner of 1993's nullified presidential election, remained
behind bars.
	   Only a week ago, the military regime squelched a pro-democracy
demonstration with teargas and bullets fired in the air.
	   On Wednesday, the country's five state-approved political
parties called for a series of political reforms, including the end
of army meddling in civilian politics.
	   The parties were largely viewed as puppets of military rule
under Abacha's reign and in April unanimously nominated him for
president.

Earnings rise at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Lehman AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ANDREW FRASER
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Co. and Lehman
brothers Holdings Inc., two big Wall Street securities firms,
posted profit gains in their fiscal second quarters that widely
surpassed analysts' optimistic expectations.
	   Morgan Stanley said profits rose 45 percent in the quarter
ending May 31, while Lehman said its profits were up 168 percent.
Both attributed the gains to across-the-board strength in their
various business segments. The profit increases mirror a 70 percent
gain reported earlier by Goldman Sachs and Co.
	   The results, released Thursday, continue an uninterrupted flow
of healthy profits for Wall Street firms as the strong economy and
rush by Americans to save more money through mutual funds
repeatedly push the stock market to new records.
	   Big Wall street investment banks also are benefiting from low
interest rates that are fueling corporate bond sales, a flood of
corporate mergers that are generating hefty advisory business, and
stock sales by companies whose values have risen with the bull
market.
 &UR; Morgan Stanley
	   The company earned dlrs 854 million, or dlrs 1.37 per diluted
share compared with dlrs 590 million, or 94 cents per diluted
share, in the same period a year ago. Revenues after interest
expenses and provisions for loan losses rose 31 percent to dlrs 4.6
billion from dlrs 3.5 billion.
	   The results beat the dlrs 1.16 per share analysts had expected,
according to a survey by Zacks Investment research. Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter shares rose 68 3/4 cents to dlrs 79.62 1/2 in early
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
	   Securities profits, which include brokerage and investment
banking, rose 70 percent to dlrs 530 million. Investment banking
led the gains with a 70 percent increase in revenues, driven by
fees from advising companies on mergers and strong bond and stock
underwritings.
	   Asset management profits rose 5 percent to dlrs 157 million,
reflecting continued growth in assets under management.
	   Profits from the company's credit card business rose 29 percent
to dlrs 167 million. The company said an increase reflects the sale
of its Prime Option credit card portfolio that helped lower its
loan losses.
 &UR; Lehman Brothers
	   Lehman earned dlrs 324 million, or dlrs 2.12 per diluted share,
in the three months ending May 31, compared with dlrs 121 million,
or 95 cents per diluted share, during the same period a year ago.
Net revenues, which excludes interest expenses, rose 72 percent to
dlrs 1.47 billion from dlrs 854 million a year ago.
	   The results beat Wall Street's expectations of dlrs 1.69 per
share, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research. But
Lehman's stock fell 18 3/4 cents to dlrs 75.31 1/4 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
	   The company said the gains reflected its successful focus on
higher margin businesses, such as advising on corporate mergers,
trading stocks, and selling and trading corporate bonds.
	   Revenues from investment banking _ which includes fees from
advising companies on mergers and acquisitions as well as revenues
from stock and bond underwriting _ increased 81 percent to dlrs 495
million.
	   Revenues from trading, the buying and selling of securities for
the company's own account, rose 80 percent to dlrs 588 million.
Revenues from commissions rose 36 percent to dlrs 124 million.

World Cup: France blazes past Saudi Arabia; Zidane sent off 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: optional
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Joy and agony are never far apart at
the World Cup. But they rarely are so intertwined.
	   French stomachs were sent churning with every which way as
goals, injury, victory and expulsion kept colliding in Thursday's
4-0 victory over Saudi Arabia.
	   France joined Brazil in the second round of the World Cup with a
win, which featured a youthful blend of bubbly soccer that hid the
misery of yet another French injury _ this one to Christophe
Dugarry _ and the expulsion of Zinedine Zidane, the team's best
player.
	   ``All would be great if not for Dugarry's injury. All would be
great if not for Zidane's expulsion,'' French coach Aime Jacquet
said. ``He will pay for it. His gesture had to be punished. We have
been talking to our playing about this for a long time. They must
stay calm. They must show self-control.''
	   In the 68th minute, a strike from 20-year-old David Trezeguet
set 80,000 French patriots at Stade de France screaming with
delight, giving les Bleus a second goal on the way to a true
drubbing of the Saudis.
	   Two minutes later, the vital key in the French ambition to lift
the World Cup was sent off for putting his studs in the side of
Saudi captain Fuad Amin. Zidane will automatically miss at least
one game because of the red card, one of five issued in two games
Wednesday as referees answered an order to crack down on fouls.
	   ``I didn't deserve this,'' Zidane said. ``I did not mean to hurt
the man. I just fell on him.''
	   Despair was also all around in the 29th minute, when striker
Dugarry was carried off with a torn hamstring, yet another casualty
in France depleted strikeforce.
	   Six minutes later, Thierry Henry brought deliverance with
France's first goal, the first of two in the game for the Monaco
winger who now has scored half of France's six goals and is tied
for the World Cup scoring lead.
	   ``I have to say we missed far too many chances,'' said French
coach Aime Jacquet, after Les Bleus pounced on the Saudi defense
throughout the game, ceaselessly creating danger from both sides.
	   The Saudis were overwhelmed.
	   ``They have a long way to go in the competition,'' said Saudi
coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said of the French.
	   Saudi Arabia was already down to 10 men because of a red card
when Zidane set Bixente Lizarazu free in the 36th minute. The
lightning quick left back perfectly passed it into the goalmouth,
where Henry coolly knocked it home for the opening strike.
	   In the 68th minute, substitute David Trezeguet added an
insurance goal, capitalizing on a rare error from goalkeeper
Mohammed Al-Dayea, who let a simple cross from Lilian Thuram slip
through his hands, offering the simplest of headers for the
20-year-old striker.
	   Henry, another 20-year-old and Trezeguet's best friend, scored
his second in the 77th minute, running on to a bad defensive
clearance and beating al-Dayea with a low right-footed shot.
	   To top off another sparkling performance, Lizarazu collected a
delicate backheel from Youri Djorkaeff in the 85th minute and set
the 80,000 strong crowd at the Stade de France chanting the
Marseillaise with goal No. 4.
	   Starting forward Dugarry however, had to be carried off with a
torn right hamstring, threatening the rest of his World Cup
campaign. Fellow forward Stephane Guivarc'h already had to sit out
Thursday's game with a strained
	   After the 1-1 draw between Denmark and South Africa, France now
leads Group C with 6 points, 2 ahead of the Scandinavians. Saudi
Arabia became the first team to be eliminated from second-round
contention.
	   ``We have to win the next one, too,'' Jacquet said. ``It's our
law of soccer and we will not start calculating now.''
	   Saudi Arabia started defensively and was so overpowered from the
start. In the 19th minute, Mohammed al-Khilaiwi was outrun by
blazing Lizarazu on the left and his late kick at the Frenchman's
leg was the first red card of the game from Mexican referee Arturo
Brizio.
	   Brizio's tough stand came one day after FIFA president Sepp
Blatter and World Cup organizing committee chairman Michel Platini
said referees weren't following a pre-tournament dictate that rough
play _ especially foul tackles from behind _ be severely punished.
	   Parreira was upset over al-Khilaiwi's ejection.
	   ``This decision, which I don't think was a right decision for
the referee, made the game easy for the French,'' Parreira said.
``It was a very strict (red card).''
	   After that, France never let up.
	   ``We tried to break out of defense, but there was just no way to
stop the French team,'' Parreira said. ``We were demoralized.''

Stewart takes U.S. Open lead with 66 AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES; will be updated with later finishers
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Bobby Jones, who won the U.S. Open four
times, said golf is a match against Old Man Par, and that certainly
was the case in Thursday's first round at The Olympic Club.
	   Par was a very good score on the treacherous Lake Course, and
Payne Stewart won that battle with a sensational
birdie-birdie-birdie finish for a 4-under-par 66, three strokes
ahead of John Daly.
	   Of the first 60 players in the 156-man field to finish, they
were the only two who broke par.
	   ``You know coming here that par is going to be a really good
score,'' Stewart said. ``I took advantage of some breaks out there
today, and that's what you have to do in the U.S. Open.''
	   Among his breaks were a 12-foot (3 1/2-meter) putt to save par
on No. 5 and a 15-foot (4 1/2-meter) par-saver on the ninth hole.
He also made all three of his closing birdies from out of the rough
when he was fortunate enough to get good lies.
	   ``I was lucky I never got into the really deep stuff,'' Stewart
said.
	   Tiger Woods, meanwhile, found out once again that a key to the
U.S. Open is staying away from Old Man Double Bogey.
	   Cruising along at 2-under par through eight holes and tied for
the lead, Woods put his drive on No. 9 smack in the middle of the
fairway and plopped his second shot on the green, 40 feet (12
meters) from the pin.
	   Four putts later, he had a double bogey _ his fourth in the last
two years at the Open. What started out as a round that could have
been very low on the very difficult Lake Course ended up being a
74, eight strokes behind Stewart.
	   Only one player _ Jack Fleck in 1955 _ trailed by more than
eight strokes after the first round of the U.S. Open and came back
to win.
	   ``I'm not in that bad of shape,'' Woods insisted. ``I'll go to
the range and go out tomorrow and see what I can do.''
	   He can go out knowing that when Fleck rallied from the record
nine-stroke deficit in 1995 it was right here at The Olympic Club.
	   Woods was not the only big-name player who struggled. Jim Furyk
also shot a 74 and David Duval had a 75. Fred Couples and Lee
Westwood were both at 73. PGA Championship winner Davis Love III,
who is struggling with a bad back, shot a 41 on the back nine to
finish with a 78.
	   Colin Montgomerie, whose games seems a perfect fit for The
Olympic Club, closed with two birdies in the final six holes for a
70 along with Andrew Magee and Masters champion Mark O'Meara.
	   Defending champion Ernie Els, British Open winner Justin Leonard
and Casey Martin, the first player to ride in a cart at the Open,
were among those just beginning their rounds when Stewart finished
his.
	   Stewart played like he did in 1989, when he won the PGA
Championship, and in 1991, when he won the U.S. Open.
	   Wearing his trademark knickers, he raised his putter in triumph
and punched his right fist through the air when a 12-foot (3
1/2-meter) birdie fell into the cup on the final hole.
	   ``It really was spectacular,'' Stewart said of his finish.
``Four, three, three is pretty much unheard of on those last three
holes.''
	   No one had made a birdie on the 468-yard (426-meter) 17th hole
when Stewart rolled in a 45-foot (13.5-meter) putt that seemed to
take forever to wiggle its way across the green.
	   Stewart, who has won only once on the PGA Tour since the 1991
U.S. Open, stared in disbelief when the ball disappeared into the
cup. Then, he did a wiggling dance of his own to celebrate.
	   ``That hole is a par 5,'' Stewart said after he needed a driver
and a 2-iron to get to the green. ``On the scorecard it says I made
a birdie, but that was an eagle in my mind.''
	   The U.S. Golf Association, which came into the Open threatening
to ban high-tech clubs, didn't have to take the driver out of
Daly's bag. The course did it for them.
	   Playing with no driver because the 6,797-yard (6,185-meter)
course is so short, Daly turned the front nine at 2-over par, then
shot a 32 on the back side.
	   ``I'm going to tape it up and leave it in the trunk and take out
a 3-wood again tomorrow,'' Daly said, who compared giving up his
driver to giving up drinking.
	   ``The fairways are just too narrow here,'' he said, adding that
if the greens get any harder, ``it would take us nine hours to play
a round.''
	   Woods, who finished 10 strokes behind Els last year, made three
costly double bogeys in that Open at Congressional Country Club. He
also had trouble with big-number holes at the British Open and the
PGA Championship in the final three major championships last year
played 10 holes a total of 24 strokes over par.
	   Woods started strongly, rolling a birdie putt in the left side
door on No. 1. After a bogey on No. 4, he made consecutive birdies
on Nos. 5 and 6.
	   Beside the four-putt on No. 9, he had a three-putt for a bogey
on No. 13, missing a 4-footer (1.2 meters) for par and another
three-putt at No. 16.

Netanyahu receives plan to expand Jerusalem's borders spokesman 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Government planners on Thursday submitted a
development program for Jerusalem that would expand the city
westward, boost investment and seek to keep the Jewish population
at 70 percent.
	   Citing a higher birthrate among Palestinians and a growing
number of Jews leaving Jerusalem, the plan warned that by 2020, the
Palestinians will make up 40 percent of the city's population,
unless the government intervenes.
	   The plan, submitted to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, seeks
to attract more Jews to the city by building some 142,000 homes and
investing heavily in job creation.
	   ``There is an effort to attract as many Jewish residents as
possible by increasing the industrial base to maintain the present
balance of the population.'' said David Bar-Illan, a senior advisor
to Netanyahu.
	   Bar-Illan said that while the plan contained target population
figures, this was not intended as a quota and that no one eligible
for residency would be kept out of the city.
	   However, Palestinians have long complained that Israel is trying
to keep down the number of Arab residents in the city by
restricting building permits, demolishing homes built without
licenses, and revoking Arabs' residency permits.
	   Responding to the new Jerusalem plan, Ziad Abu Ziad, a member of
the Palestinian Legislative Council said ``This is a racist
approach, part of the ethnic cleansing policy Israel is
implementing against Arabs in east Jerusalem.''
	   Amir Cheshin, a longtime advisor to former Jerusalem mayor Teddy
Kollek. has acknowledged that since Israel captured east Jerusalem
from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war, the city's master plan has
been aimed at preserving the population balance of 28 percent Arabs
and 72 percent Jews.
	   According to city planners, 174,400 Palestinians and 417,000
Jews lived in the city at the end of 1995. The Palestinians made up
29.5 percent of the population, up from 25.8 percent in 1967.
	   The future of Jerusalem is to be negotiated in talks on a
permanent Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement that have not yet
begun, but are to conclude by May 1999.
	   The Palestinians want to establish a capital in east Jerusalem,
but Israel says it will never relinquish sovereignty over all of
the city.
	   Planners said a key development guideline was that ``the
relative size of the Jewish and non-Jewish populations in the city
should be maintained.''
	   If Jerusalem is to remain the united capital of Israel, ``It
will be necessary to aim for a target in which 70 percent of the
population will be Jews and 30 percent will be Arabs in 2020,'' the
report said.
	   The plan, which has been accepted in principle by Netanyahu,
calls for an expansion of Jerusalem's boundaries westward to
include the city's suburbs.

By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Bobby Jones, who won the U.S. Open four
times, said golf is a match against Old Man Par, and that certainly
was the case in Thursday's first round at The Olympic Club.
	   Par was a very good score on the treacherous Lake Course, and
Payne Stewart won that battle with a sensational
birdie-birdie-birdie finish for a 4-under-par 66, three strokes
ahead of John Daly and Jesper Parnevik.
	   Of the first 60 players in the 156-man field to finish, they
were the only two who broke par.
	   ``You know coming here that par is going to be a really good
score,'' Stewart said. ``I took advantage of some breaks out there
today, and that's what you have to do in the U.S. Open.''
	   Among his breaks were a 12-foot (3 1/2-meter) putt to save par
on No. 5 and a 15-foot (4 1/2-meter) par-saver on the ninth hole.
He also made all three of his closing birdies from out of the rough
when he was fortunate enough to get good lies.
	   ``I was lucky I never got into the really deep stuff,'' Stewart
said.
	   Tiger Woods, meanwhile, found out once again that a key to the
U.S. Open is staying away from Old Man Double Bogey.
	   Cruising along at 2-under par through eight holes and tied for
the lead, Woods put his drive on No. 9 smack in the middle of the
fairway and plopped his second shot on the green, 40 feet (12
meters) from the pin.
	   Four putts later, he had a double bogey _ his fourth in the last
two years at the Open. What started out as a round that could have
been very low on the very difficult Lake Course ended up being a
74, eight strokes behind Stewart.
	   Only one player _ Jack Fleck in 1955 _ trailed by more than
eight strokes after the first round of the U.S. Open and came back
to win.
	   ``I'm not in that bad of shape,'' Woods insisted. ``I'll go to
the range and go out tomorrow and see what I can do.''
	   He can go out knowing that when Fleck rallied from the record
nine-stroke deficit in 1995 it was right here at The Olympic Club.
	   Woods was not the only big-name player who struggled. Jim Furyk
also shot a 74 and David Duval had a 75. Fred Couples and Lee
Westwood were both at 72. PGA Championship winner Davis Love III,
who is struggling with a bad back, shot a 41 on the back nine to
finish with a 78.
	   Colin Montgomerie, whose games seems a perfect fit for The
Olympic Club, closed with two birdies in the final six holes for a
70 along with Andrew Magee and Masters champion Mark O'Meara.
	   Defending champion Ernie Els, British Open winner Justin Leonard
and Casey Martin, the first player to ride in a cart at the Open,
were among those just beginning their rounds when Stewart finished
his.
	   Stewart played like he did in 1989, when he won the PGA
Championship, and in 1991, when he won the U.S. Open.
	   Wearing his trademark knickers, he raised his putter in triumph
and punched his right fist through the air when a 12-foot (3
1/2-meter) birdie fell into the cup on the final hole.
	   ``It really was spectacular,'' Stewart said of his finish.
``Four, three, three is pretty much unheard of on those last three
holes.''
	   No one had made a birdie on the 468-yard (426-meter) 17th hole
when Stewart rolled in a 45-foot (13.5-meter) putt that seemed to
take forever to wiggle its way across the green.
	   Stewart, who has won only once on the PGA Tour since the 1991
U.S. Open, stared in disbelief when the ball disappeared into the
cup. Then, he did a wiggling dance of his own to celebrate.
	   ``That hole is a par 5,'' Stewart said after he needed a driver
and a 2-iron to get to the green. ``On the scorecard it says I made
a birdie, but that was an eagle in my mind.''
	   The U.S. Golf Association, which came into the Open threatening
to ban high-tech clubs, didn't have to take the driver out of
Daly's bag. The course did it for them.
	   Playing with no driver because the 6,797-yard (6,185-meter)
course is so short, Daly turned the front nine at 2-over par, then
shot a 32 on the back side.
	   ``I'm going to tape it up and leave it in the trunk and take out
a 3-wood again tomorrow,'' Daly said, who compared giving up his
driver to giving up drinking.
	   ``The fairways are just too narrow here,'' he said, adding that
if the greens get any harder, ``it would take us nine hours to play
a round.''
	   Woods, who finished 10 strokes behind Els last year, made three
costly double bogeys in that Open at Congressional Country Club. He
also had trouble with big-number holes at the British Open and the
PGA Championship in the final three major championships last year
played 10 holes a total of 24 strokes over par.
	   Woods started strongly, rolling a birdie putt in the left side
door on No. 1. After a bogey on No. 4, he made consecutive birdies
on Nos. 5 and 6.
	   Beside the four-putt on No. 9, he had a three-putt for a bogey
on No. 13, missing a 4-footer (1.2 meters) for par and another
three-putt at No. 16.

College coach puts on putting lesson for Friendly's lead 
</HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AGAWAM, Massachusetts (AP) _ Heather Daly-Donofrio, an LPGA
rookie who also coaches golf at Yale, gave a lesson in playing wet
greens on Thursday.
	   She shrugged off the puddles, sloshy ground and hazy sky to
shoot a 5-under-par 67 for the first-round lead in the LPGA
Friendly's Classic. Val Skinner shot a 68 and the group at 69
included Christy Erb, Charlotta Sorenstam, Marilyn Lovander, Amy
Fruhwirth and Ji Hyun Suh.
	   Several recent days of rain had deadened the bounce on the
fairways at the Crestview County Club. But Daly-Donofrio said her
ball speed was easier to control on the damp greens.
	   Starting on the back nine, she was even par after a bogey at No.
11 and a birdie at No. 12. She picked up three strokes in the
middle of her round with birdies on Nos. 17, 1 and 2. Birdies on
Nos. 5 and 7 gave her the lead.
	   ``For me, I had a perfect round of golf,'' said Daly-Donofrio,
28, who began playing at age 15 and took her first lesson at 20.
	   She added a word of caution: ``I've had good rounds before and
then gone out and totally blown up the next day.''
	   Her best finish in her first season was 47th in the Michelob
Light Classic.
	   She said Thursday she has been working with her own instructor
on putting and recently switched her brand of club. But she said
her biggest gains this season have probably been in her
concentration.
	   ``You get beat up a lot out here. Any time you get beat up, you
get tougher mentally,'' she said.
	   She intends to keep coaching the women's team at Yale and just
agreed to another contract for three years. Few players on the tour
choose to work another regular job, but she said her time on the
road gives her a chance for more recruiting for her team.
	   Still, Skinner marveled aloud at Daly-Donofrio's ability to hold
down two such jobs. ``I think she's a genius,'' she said.
	   Skinner would have tied for the lead, if not for a drive on her
last hole that strayed more than 75 feet (23 meters) off the
fairway and cost her a bogey.
	   Friendly's classic opened under a shadow, with its future
uncertain. The sponsor, Friendly's restaurant and ice cream
company, has indicated that it can't carry the event without help
from another sponsor next year.

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A Brazilian air force captain is set to
become the first South American to be sent into outer space on a
NASA mission three years from now, the Brazilian Space Agency said
Thursday.
	   Marcos Cesar Pontes, 35, is scheduled to begin a battery of
medical tests next week at the Johnson Space Center in Houston,
Texas. If he receives a clean bill of health, he will return to the
space center in August to start a two-year training program.
	   He is scheduled to make his first flight into space around 2001
as part of a team that will help build the International Space
Station, said Regina Celia Franca, spokeswoman for the Brazilian
Space Agency.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A woman arrested after a clash between
soldiers and leftist rebels says Mexican government agents tortured
her and accused her of working with rebel forces.
	   Erika Zamora Pardo, 21, said in a statement that after her
arrest on June 7, she was blindfolded, stripped, prodded by
electricity and forced to sign a confession saying she belonged to
a rebel organization, the daily La Jornada reported Thursday.
	   The government has alleged that Zamora and a man arrested after
the raid in western Guerrero state were members of the
Revolutionary Army of the Insurgent People _ a recent offshoot of
the Popular Revolutionary Army, which took up arms in 1996 to
demand political and social reform.
	   Eleven people died in the raid on a schoolhouse in El Charco, 70
miles (110 kilometers) east of Acapulco. The government alleged
they were rebels.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Arrest warrants were issued Thursday for
three officials of International Business Machines Corp.'s Mexican
unit and 19 former city officials accused of helping IBM win an
illegal contract for a computer system.
	   IBM de Mexico officials conspired to win a dlrs 27.7 million
contract to manage Mexico City criminal files without putting it
out for a public bid, City Attorney General Samuel Del Villar said.
	   The computer system, a database, has since failed, he said.
	   None of the IBM or former city officials were in custody, Del
Villar said.
	   City judicial police searched the offices of IBM de Mexico to
seek documents involving an alleged fraud against the capital's
attorney general's office.
	   IBM has denied any wrongdoing, saying that the system met
contract requirements and was priced fairly.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ A military court is trying three
soldiers on charges of violating human rights of Indians along the
country's Atlantic coast, the army said Thursday.
	   In a news release, the army did not give the names or ranks of
those being tried, nor did it describe the case, but military
sources said the defendants could face imprisonment of up to five
years.
	   The military said a complaint was filed June 12 by residents of
the community of Bihmuna.
	   ___
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The government's human rights
ombudsman called Thursday for a purge of military officers
suspected of links to international drug trafficking.
	   Valladares said the suspicions of military involvement with drug
trafficking has corroded the army's credibility, causing youths to
avoid military service.
	   Valladares' comments come as civilian police are hunting for Lt.
Col. Wilfredo Leva Cabrera, deputy commander of an infantry
battalion in northern Honduras, who is charged with kidnapping and
killing seven businessmen whose bodies were discovered last week.
	   Prosecutors say the case is related to drug trafficking.
	   ___
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ About 3,000 doctors and professors
protested low funding of hospitals and universities on Thursday,
but officials said a slump in oil prices has left the government
strapped for funds.
	   ``Conditions in the hospitals make it almost impossible to treat
patients with serious medical needs,'' said Dr. Yuri Prieto. He
held up photos of public hospital bathrooms with flooded floors, a
10-foot (3-meter) hole in the ceiling above a patient's bed and a
hallway littered with medical waste.
	   Educators also complained about dilapidated university buildings
and the government's failure to pay overdue benefits.
	   Labor Minister Maria Bernardoni de Govea said officials can't
boost spending. The price of Venezuelan oil hit a 12-year low this
week, part of a slump that has forced a dlrs 1.6 billion cut in
this year's national budget.

Daly gives up driver and it pays off AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ John Daly has taken another vow of
abstinence. And, for one round at least, it seems to be paying off
in the U.S. Open.
	   Playing without a driver in his bag, golf's longest hitter
stayed out of the deep rough at The Olympic Club on Thursday to
shoot a 1-under 69 that moved him into contention after the first
round of the Open.
	   ``I've basically given up the driver,'' Daly said. ``I'd rather
shoot low scores than worry about getting it in the fairway all the
time.''
	   Daly, in his best opening round in nine Opens, used course
management he would never before have thought possible in coming
back from 2-over on the front nine with three birdies on the back.
	   Patience, something Daly has never been known for, was the key.
The golfer who in the past had stormed off golf courses in midround
when things weren't going well, kept grinding away this time and
was rewarded with a score that kept him within striking distance.
	   ``I don't get mad like I used to,'' Daly said. ``That's a
miracle in itself.''
	   On narrow fairways lined with thick, wet rough, Daly hit 3-woods
and 2-irons off the tee, keeping the ball in play and giving him a
chance to hit greens.
	   After shooting 37 on the front nine, he hit an 8-iron shot
within 8 feet (2 1/2 meters) on 10 for a birdie, and the same club
to 30 feet (9 meters) to get back to even par with a birdie on 12.
A third 8-iron, this one to 15 feet (4 1/2 meters) on 15, got him
under par and Daly got up-and-down out of the sand on 18 to stay
that way.
	   ``I stayed very patient and made some things happen on the back
nine,'' Daly said.
	   Last year at Congressional, Daly opened with a 77 and walked off
the course the next day after playing 27 holes in 10-over.
	   But he was fighting the shakes from alcohol withdrawal at that
time, after going through rehabilitation and quitting drinking
again. He's been sober ever since, with cigarettes, chocolate and
sodas his biggest remaining addictions.
	   ``Last year you had the nerves of a major championship plus you
add the shakes and it was very difficult,'' Daly said.
	   Daly was in one of the early pairings of the day, with Fred
Couples and Frank Nobilo. Couples shot a 72, while Nobilo had to
birdie the last hole to come in at 76.
	   Daly pointed to Nobilo as an example of a golfer who stayed in
his game mentally even when he wasn't playing well.
	   ``He's still in the tournament because of that,'' Daly said. ``I
learn a lot from guys like that. I wish I had learned it earlier in
my career. He could have shot 82, 83 but he just kept grinding
away.''
	   Daly benefited from a couple of breaks, getting some good lies
when he did go into the rough and having a ball bounce off a tree
on No. 11 back into the fairway.
	   Still, the Daly of past years probably would not have had much
chance on a course where precision and course management account
for more than distance and driving ability.
	   ``Three or four years ago if this tournament was held here I
would have hit drivers on every hole. I probably wouldn't have
broken 80,'' Daly said. ``There's a big change there.''
	   Not that he doesn't get the urge to put the driver back in the
bag once in awhile. Daly quit using it a few tournaments ago, even
though it meant giving up a shot at a huge bonus offered by
Callaway Golf for a golfer who uses its equipment to lead in
driving distance.
	   ``On a few holes I was thinking like I did when I was dry for
four and a half years and was trying to think why I should be
drinking,'' he said. ``Now I'm trying to think how I should be
using my driver out there.''

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A Brazilian air force captain is set to
become the first South American to be sent into outer space on a
NASA mission three years from now, the Brazilian Space Agency said
Thursday.
	   Marcos Cesar Pontes, 35, is scheduled to begin a battery of
medical tests next week at the Johnson Space Center in Houston,
Texas. If he receives a clean bill of health, he will return to the
space center in August to start a two-year training program.
	   He is scheduled to make his first flight into space around 2001
as part of a team that will help build the International Space
Station, said Regina Celia Franca, spokeswoman for the Brazilian
Space Agency.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A woman arrested after a clash between
soldiers and leftist rebels says Mexican government agents tortured
her and accused her of working with rebel forces.
	   Erika Zamora Pardo, 21, said in a statement that after her
arrest on June 7, she was blindfolded, stripped, prodded by
electricity and forced to sign a confession saying she belonged to
a rebel organization, the daily La Jornada reported Thursday.
	   The government has alleged that Zamora and a man arrested after
the raid in western Guerrero state were members of the
Revolutionary Army of the Insurgent People _ a recent offshoot of
the Popular Revolutionary Army, which took up arms in 1996 to
demand political and social reform.
	   Eleven people died in the raid on a schoolhouse in El Charco, 70
miles (110 kilometers) east of Acapulco. The government alleged
they were rebels.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Arrest warrants were issued Thursday for
three officials of International Business Machines Corp.'s Mexican
unit and 19 former city officials accused of helping IBM win an
illegal contract for a computer system.
	   IBM de Mexico officials conspired to win a dlrs 27.7 million
contract to manage Mexico City criminal files without putting it
out for a public bid, City Attorney General Samuel Del Villar said.
	   The computer system, a database, has since failed, he said.
	   None of the IBM or former city officials were in custody, Del
Villar said.
	   City judicial police searched the offices of IBM de Mexico to
seek documents involving an alleged fraud against the capital's
attorney general's office.
	   IBM has denied any wrongdoing, saying that the system met
contract requirements and was priced fairly.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ A military court is trying three
soldiers on charges of violating human rights of Indians along the
country's Atlantic coast, the army said Thursday.
	   In a news release, the army did not give the names or ranks of
those being tried, nor did it describe the case, but military
sources said the defendants could face imprisonment of up to five
years.
	   The military said a complaint was filed June 12 by residents of
the community of Bihmuna.
	   ___
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The government's human rights
ombudsman called Thursday for a purge of military officers
suspected of links to international drug trafficking.
	   Leo Valladares said the suspicions of military involvement with
drug trafficking has corroded the army's credibility, causing
youths to avoid military service.
	   Valladares' comments come as civilian police are hunting for Lt.
Col. Wilfredo Leva Cabrera, deputy commander of an infantry
battalion in northern Honduras, who is charged with kidnapping and
killing seven businessmen whose bodies were discovered last week.
	   Prosecutors say the case is related to drug trafficking.
	   ___
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ About 3,000 doctors and professors
protested low funding of hospitals and universities on Thursday,
but officials said a slump in oil prices has left the government
strapped for funds.
	   ``Conditions in the hospitals make it almost impossible to treat
patients with serious medical needs,'' said Dr. Yuri Prieto. He
held up photos of public hospital bathrooms with flooded floors, a
10-foot (3-meter) hole in the ceiling above a patient's bed and a
hallway littered with medical waste.
	   Educators also complained about dilapidated university buildings
and the government's failure to pay overdue benefits.
	   Labor Minister Maria Bernardoni de Govea said officials can't
boost spending. The price of Venezuelan oil hit a 12-year low this
week, part of a slump that has forced a dlrs 1.6 billion cut in
this year's national budget.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Brant Brown hit three home runs and drove in five
runs Thursday, and Henry Rodriguez finally broke out of his hitting
slump with a two-run homer as the Chicago Cubs beat the
Philadelphia Phillies 12-5.
	   Fans saluted Brown's ``hat trick'' by throwing hats onto the
field after Brown's third homer, a two-run shot in the bottom of
the eighth. It was the sixth three-homer game in the majors this
season and the second one this week for the Cubs _ Sammy Sosa hit
three Monday _ and it came exactly two years after Brown's only
other multi-homer game.
	   Jeremi Gonzalez (6-5) overcame a four-run, five-hit first
inning. He allowed nine hits and five runs in six innings, and went
3-for-3 with an RBI.
	   Terry Mulholland got the last seven outs for his second save.
	   Mark Portugal (2-2) gave up 10 hits and seven runs over 5 2-3
innings for the loss.
 &UR; Marlins 3, Braves 2
	   In Atlanta, Craig Counsell and Todd Zeile had run-scoring
singles in the eighth inning and Florida broke an 11-game road
losing streak.
	   Tom Glavine (9-3) failed to join teammate Greg Maddux as the
NL's second 10-game winner, knocked out with one out in the eighth
when the Marlins strung together three singles to overcome a 2-1
deficit.
	   Kirt Ojala (1-0) pitched the seventh and Antonio Alfonseca got
three outs for his second save.
	   Florida starter Ryan Dempster, who entered the game 0-2 with a
10.20 ERA, pitched well for the second game in a row after giving
up 16 earned runs in the first eight innings of his major league
career. He worked six innings, allowing five hits and both runs.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 4, Reds 2 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Arizona achieved its first three-game sweep at
the expense of baseball's oldest professional team.
	   Brian Anderson (5-6), Arizona's first pick in the expansion
draft, allowed only two hits over seven shutout innings and scored
twice with aggressive baserunning.
	   The Diamondbacks have only one other sweep in their first
season, taking a two-game series in Florida on May 20-21.
	   The Reds have lost five straight and 13 of 16. During the
five-game slide, Cincinnati has scored nine runs and committed
eight errors, pushing its major league-leading total to 71.
	   Devon White had three hits for Arizona. Scott Klingenbeck (1-2)
took the loss.

	   MOCHICO, Portugal (AP) _ David Tapping of England shot a
6-under-par 66 Thursday to take a two-shot lead after the first
round of the Madeira Island Open.
	   Tapping, 23, fired eight birdies on the Santo da Serra course to
emerge from his obscurity during the past 10 months when he missed
12 halfway cuts in 15 tournaments.
	   ``It was one of those days where I could do no wrong,'' Tapping
said.
	   Four players shared second place _ 1995 Madeira winner Santiago
Luna of Spain, England's Roger Winchester, Stephen Ames of Trinidad
and Tobago, and Germany's Thomas Gogele.
	   American Brian Nelson, Spaniard Francisco Cea, and England's
John Mellor and Steven Bottomley were level on 3-under.
	   South African Wayne Westner pulled out of the tournament after
slipping and hurting himself during Wednesday's Pro-Am. He is
expected to be laid up for six weeks.

	   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) _ Aaron Sele became the American League's
first 10-game winner and the Texas Rangers took advantage of
Oakland starter Tom Candiotti's wildness to end a three-game losing
streak with a 3-2 victory Thursday.
	   Sele (10-4) allowed six hits in 6 2-3 innings. The right-hander
issued a career-high seven walks and hit a batter, but hung on to
give the Rangers a badly needed boost. Texas starters were 1-5 with
a 7.58 ERA in their previous seven games.
	   Sele reached 10 victories earlier than any pitcher in Rangers
history. Kevin Brown won his 10th game on June 20, 1992.
	   John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 20th save.
	   Candiotti (4-9) lost his fifth consecutive start, allowing three
runs and four hits in five innings. He walked six, had two wild
pitches and an error as the A's had their four-game winning streak
snapped.

Airline replaces tobacco company as Canadian GP sponsor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Air Canada replaced Player's as title sponsor of
the Canadian Grand Prix on Thursday, giving the Formula One motor
race the non-tobacco sponsor it needed for its long-term survival.
	   Federal health minister Allan Rock was quick to applaud the
five-year agreement, effective next season.
	   ``Today's announcement should send a strong signal of
encouragement about the willingness of non-tobacco companies to
step forward and associate themselves with sponsored events,'' Rock
said in a statement released in Ottawa. ``Air Canada should be
congratulated for this very positive step.''
	   The future of the race was thrown in doubt last year when a bill
was tabled to severely limit tobacco sponsorship of sports and
cultural events.
	   Rock softened the bill with an amendment in June that would
allow a five-year transition period to phase out tobacco
advertising.
	   The International Automobile Federation (FIA) has its own plans
to phase out tobacco sponsorships, but the 16-race Formula One
series remains heavily involved with the tobacco industry.
	   Formula One officials have insisted they would remove races from
countries that introduce strict anti-tobacco legislation in favor
of Asian countries with less severe regulations.
	   Only one of the 11 teams, Stewart Ford, does not carry a tobacco
logo on its cars.

Britain gives muted welcome mixed with digust to au pair's return

Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Friday's British newspapers;
UPPICKS graf 14 pvs
By AUDREY WOODS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Vowing to clear her name, Louise Woodward
returned home Thursday to muted celebration in her hometown village
and increasing grumbling nationwide about the heroine's status some
awarded the woman convicted of killing an infant boy.
	   The tabloid Mirror took it to extremes with the headline ``First
Class Child Killer,'' referring to the former au pair's mode of
airline flight from the United States.
	   But ordinary citizens, too, expressed reservations about her
celebrity status coming at a dreadful price.
	   One caller in a Sky-TV phone-in labeled the hoopla ``absolutely
disgusting,'' and others noted that no matter what view people
might hold of the 20-year-old's guilt or innocence, the death of
8-month-old Matthew Eappen should not be overshadowed.
	   Ms. Woodward herself, in her first public comment since
November, also mentioned the loss of the child entrusted to her
care.
	   ``I feel great sorrow for the death of baby Matthew,'' she said,
nervously facing hordes of reporters at a news conference at nearby
Manchester Airport. ``But like I've said time and time again, I had
nothing to do with his death.''
	   In the north England village of Elton, yellow ribbons fluttered
from trees and lampposts and residents expressed great joy, but
there was little outward celebration on the mostly deserted
streets.
	   Citizens remembered all too well the criticism that rained down
after their raucous champagne celebration when a Massachussets
judge freed Ms. Woodward in November.
	   It all contrasted with the overwhelmingly enthusiastic support
offered Ms. Woodward after her conviction in October, when most
national newspapers waged campaigns to win her freedom and 93
percent of the respondents to a Sky poll said her trial was unfair.
	   Many newspapers did not even mention her impending return on
their front pages Thursday.
	   Ms. Woodward's arrival back in Britain followed Tuesday's ruling
by a Massachusetts high court that a lower-court judge acted within
his power when he reduced her second-degree murder conviction to
manslaughter and sentenced her to the 279 days she had served since
her arrest.
	   At her news conference, the former au pair said she did not
receive a fair trial and predicted she eventually would be cleared
of killing young Matthew by violently shaking him and slamming his
head against a hard surface. He died Feb. 9, 1997.
	   In Elton, members of the Justice for Louise campaign committee
said the low-key nature of Ms. Woodward's homecoming after two
years did not signify any weakening of the community's support.
	   The British press covered Ms. Woodward's homecoming with
reserve, for the most part relegating the story to inside pages
without giving her a hero's welcome.
	   ``Is Louise innocent or just an Oscar winning actress?'' asked a
headline in the tabloid Sun, which had campaigned on her behalf
during her trial.

Coming home: Golota eyes fight in Poland 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Andrew Golota is one victory from returning home
for a fight in Poland.
	   If Golota beats Corey Sanders in Atlantic City, New Jersey on
July 21, the heavyweight gets to face Tim Witherspoon on Sept. 4 in
Wroclaw.
	   ``Fighting in front of my family and friends in Poland means
more to me than fighting for a world championship,'' Golota said.
``It's my dream come true.''
	   The two fights were announced Thursday at the Polish Consulate.
	   Despite a record of 30-3, with 27 knockouts, Golota is most
known for his losses. He was twice disqualified for low blows to
Riddick Bowe in bouts he was winning. Then he was stopped in the
first round by Lennox Lewis in a WBC title fight.
	   Golota, a 30-year-old who fights out of Chicago, wants to change
his image and establish himself as a contender. He insists the
pressure of the moment cost him any chance against Lewis.
	   ``It wasn't me in that fight,'' Golota said. ``I froze and got
beat. This is a big challenge for me. I will win the fight.''
	   Since losing to Lewis last October, the 6-foot-4 (1.9-meter),
242-pounder (109-kilogram) has knocked out two opponents who did
not pose much challenge. He knocked out Eli Dixon in the sixth
round in April and stopped Jack Basting in the third round in May.
	   Trainer Lou Duva insists the fight with Sanders will provide a
stiffer test.
	   ``It's a very important fight for Andrew Golota because he wants
to fight at home in Poland,'' Duva said. ``He must first take care
of business.''
	   Sanders, 23, has a 16-5 record, with 10 knockouts. He figures
Golota will be looking past him.
	   ``It's going to help me,'' he said. ``He's going to be thinking
ahead and be pressed to get back home. I wonder if he'll be
thinking about it when I'm pounding on his head. All I'm going to
be thinking about is knocking him out.''
	   Witherspoon (46-7, with 31 KOs) will be in Golota's corner
during the Sanders fight, offering support to the man he hopes will
be his opponent. He also wants to show he can still fight at age
40.
	   ``People who think I don't have it, or are not in my corner, are
just putting wood on the fire,'' he said.
	   But first things first. Golota must beat Sanders before Poland
becomes part of the itinerary.
	   ``The toughest fight is Corey Sanders,'' Duva said. ``Because
without it, there is no Witherspoon. If we don't win that fight, we
have nothing at all.''

Jones, Greene and Slaney going for rarities at nationals AP Track Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Maurice Greene will attempt a rare double in
the men's sprints at the USA Championships this weekend. Marion
Jones will do him one better, trying for a double in the women's
sprints while also going for a long jump victory.
	   And Mary Slaney will bid to outdo them both.
	   No man has swept the 100 and 200 meters at the national
championships since Kirk Baptiste in 1985.
	   The last woman to win both dashes was Gwen Torrence in 1995, but
the only woman to win all three of Jones' events was Stella Walsh,
who did it four times, the first in 1930 and the last in 1948.
	   Slaney, who a year ago was barred from the championships after a
test allegedly showed a high level of testosterone to
epitestosterone, is seeking a sweep in the women's 1,500 and 5,000
meters, something that never has been done.
	   ``There have been very few athletes who compete, who do well
nationally, at my age,'' Slaney, 39, said. ``The pool of athletes
my age has got to be pretty small.''
	   Slaney never was accused of illegal drug use last year, but the
International Amateur Athletic Federation, the world governing body
of the sport, suspended her after the test. Then, just before she
was to run in the championships, USA Track and Field barred her.
	   The suspensions cost her a year of competition, tainted her
reputation and left her bitter.
	   ``I'm not looking for vindication,'' Slaney said. ``What I'm
looking for is to run well, to do well at what I do and feel good
about it.''
	   Slaney, considered the best woman's distance runner in U.S.
history, holds four American records, including 3 minutes, 57.12
seconds for the 1,500.
	   Her schedule at the championships calls for a 1,500 semifinal
Friday night, the opening day of the meet at Tad Gormley Stadium,
the 5,000 final Saturday night and the 1,500 final Sunday.
	   ``She's going to run the 5,000 Saturday, and if she's fine,
she'll run the 1,500 Sunday,'' her husband, Richard Slaney, said.
	   Greene's double also will be dependent on how well he performs
in the 100, the first of his two finals, his coach, John Smith,
said.
	   His schedule calls for the 100 quarterfinals and semifinals
Friday night, the 100 final and 200 quarterfinals Saturday night,
and the 200 semifinals and final Sunday.
	   Greene, 23, is concentrating mostly on breaking the world record
of 9.84 in the 100, held by 1996 Olympic gold medalist Donovan
Bailey of Canada.
	   ``I hope the 100 will be broken before we leave New Orleans,''
said Greene, who ran 9.86 in beating Bailey and winning at last
year's World Championships at Athens, Greece, and ran a wind-aided
9.79 at last month's Prefontaiune Classic at Eugene, Oregon.
	   Jones, 22, who has firmly committed to competing in the 100, 200
and long jump, also has been flirting with world records.
	   In only her second full year on the outdoor circuit, she already
has run the 100 in 10.71, making her the No. 2 all-time performer
behind Florence Griffith Joyner's record of 10.49; the 200 in
21.76, not far from Griffith Joyner's mark of 21.34.
	   Meanwhile, there will be several key absentees for various
reasons, including Michael Johnson, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Gail
Devers, Torrence, Dan O'Brien and Randy Barnes
	   Friday's program includes nine finals _ the men's javelin, long
jump, 20K race walk, discus and 5,000, and the women's hammer
throw, 10K walk, pole vault and 10,000.

Tiger four-putts as Olympic greens take their toll AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ The throngs that followed Tiger Woods
around The Olympic Club could only look on in stunned silence.
	   For eight holes, Woods teased their expectations, striping the
ball down the narrow fairways and throwing iron shots close to
pins. He was tied for the early lead at 2-under going into No. 9
and could easily have been the sole leader had putts on the
previous two holes not hung on the lip.
	   Then the greens at Olympic struck back.
	   Beneath the hole on No. 9, Woods hit his birdie putt within 2
feet (0.6 meters) of the cup. He tried to jam it in the right side
of the cub and it lipped out and spun down the green. It took two
more shots to get it in the hole.
	   Stung by the four-putt, Woods went on to shoot a 4-over 74.
	   ``It was one of those putts that either goes in the bottom or 8
feet (2 1/2 meters) by,'' said Woods, who three-putted two other
holes. ``I was surprised they had the pin in that tough a position
the first day.''
	   Disaster lurked everywhere on the first day of the U.S. Open,
where excruciatingly narrow fairways, thick rough and tiny greens
combined to make every hole an adventure.
	   But it was the tabletop-like surfaces and pin positions that
were more suited to a Sunday than the first round that had players
muttering to themselves.
	   ``If the greens were much harder, the course would be
impossible,'' John Daly said after shooting a 69.
	   Pins were put on ledges and tucked behind sand traps as the
United States Golf Association sought to make sure there would be
no opening barrage of birdies in the national championship.
	   It led to situations such as one Stuart Appleby found himself in
after hitting his second shot within 20 feet (6 meters) of the hole
on the short par-4 seventh hole.
	   The Australian ran his first put up a ridge to the back tier
where the pin was located. But he hit it a bit too hard and the
putt kept going, all the way off the green and into the first cut
of fringe.
	   The only thing that saved Appleby from a three-putt was the fact
he had to hit his fourth shot with a sand wedge instead of a
putter.
	   ``It's pretty brutal out there,'' said Fred Couples, who was
watching from the seventh fairway.
	   Colin Montgomerie, who shot an even-par 70, said it was the pin
positions, and not necessarily the greens, that caused the most
problems.
	   ``I couldn't see them putting the pins in some of these
positions. It's scary,'' Montgomerie said. ``That's why the scores
are so high. It's incredible the way the USGA can limit scoring.
There was not one pin that was a gift.''
	   The pins might have been where they were because the greens at
The Olympic hadn't dried out as much as the USGA wanted them to
this week. After a few days of sunshine and warm weather, fog
shrouded the course Thursday morning and cool conditions kept the
greens soft and receptive.
	   That could change as the week goes on. If the sun shines on the
weekend, the greens could firm up to where it will take a very
delicate touch to stop the ball.
	   ``If these greens get any firmer, it will take us nine hours to
play,'' Daly warned.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ African leaders failed Thursday to break
a deadlock between Ethiopia and Eritrea and end a nearly 6-week
border conflict that has cost hundreds of lives. Ethiopia insists
that Eritrea withdraw from disputed areas before peace talks begin.
Eritrea has refused, claiming it is rightfully on land defined by
boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
Ethiopia claims the territory under new boundaries established when
Eritrea regained independence in 1993. After separate closed-door
meetings with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Eritrean
President Isaias Afwerki in their capitals, Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu said the impasse had not been resolved. The
countries' border conflict that broke out in early May has claimed
hundreds of lives on three fronts and in air attacks.
(ERITREA-ETHIOPIA)
	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Thousands of villagers fled an overnight
barrage of rockets and artillery shells in northern Guinea-Bissau
and headed for the Senegalese border Thursday. The intense assault
was directed at Ingore and Bula, villages just miles (kilometers)
south of the Senegalese border, as Guinea-Bissau's loyalist forces
launched a new attack on the capital, Bissau. Renegade soldiers
fighting to dislodge President Joao Bernardo Vieira vowed to
retaliate. It was not clear who launched the attack, although the
Senegalese army _ fighting on Vieira's behalf _ had been firing
artillery across the border in recent days. Guinea-Bissau, a former
Portuguese colony on Africa's western tip, has been descending into
civil war since former military chief of staff Brig. Anumane Mane
launched a mutiny from a Bissau garrison June 7. Senegal's army has
sent troops and artillery fire across the border, and troops from
the Republic of Guinea, south of Guinea-Bissau, have been fighting
for the loyalists. (GUINEA-BISSAU)
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ More than 50 years after fleeing the
ruins of Croatia's Nazi puppet state, the commander of its most
notorious death camp returned home Thursday to await trial on
atrocity charges. Dinko Sakic, who lived quietly along Argentina's
Atlantic coast for more than four decades, was escorted off a plane
that brought him from Frankfurt, Germany, and driven straight to
jail, said Ivan Damjanovic, chief jail supervisor. Sakic is
scheduled to appear before an investigative judge on Friday. Sakic
is accused of crimes against humanity and international law for
actions carried out in the early 1940s, when he commanded the
Jasenovac concentration camp, known later as the ``Auschwitz of the
Balkans.'' Exact numbers for the thousands of people who died there
are not known. Figures range from 35,000 to 500,000. (WAR
CRIMES-CROATIA).
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq is still refusing to provide
information on missiles, biological weapons and the chemical
warfare agent VX, the chief U.N. weapons inspector said Thursday.
Richard Butler's report to the Security Council, based on his talks
in Baghdad last week, casts doubt on claims that Iraq may soon be
free from sanctions _ unless the council softens its demand that
Baghdad first account for all long-range missiles and nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons. The sanctions were implemented
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Diplomatic sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Iraq is apparently gambling that
Russia, France and China will prevail over the United States and
Britain and persuade the council to end the sanctions without
complete verification that all illegal weapons have been destroyed.
(UN-IRAQ).
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Government planners on Thursday submitted a
development program for Jerusalem that would expand the city
westward, boost investment and seek to keep the Jewish population
at 70 percent. Citing a higher birthrate among Palestinians and a
growing number of Jews leaving Jerusalem, the plan warned that by
2020, the Palestinians will make up 40 percent of the city's
population, unless the government intervenes. The plan, submitted
to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, seeks to attract more Jews to
the city by building some 142,000 homes and investing heavily in
job creation. Ziad Abu Ziad, a member of the Palestinian
Legislative Council, criticized the plan, saying ``This is a racist
approach, part of the ethnic cleansing policy Israel is
implementing against Arabs in east Jerusalem.'' (ISRAEL-JERUSLEM)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks edged lower Thursday as the sluggish,
indecisive tone of recent months quickly returned to the market
after this week's huge gyrations. In a sharp contrast to Monday's
207-point tumble and Wednesday's 164-point rebound, the Dow Jones
industrial average fell 16 points to 8,813, never straying as much
as 40 points in either direction all day. Broader indicators also
posted small losses despite a strong day in Asia, where stocks
rallied sharply following Wednesday's move by the Federal Reserve
to bolster the sagging Japanese yen. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's leading capitalist reformer came bouncing
back into the government Thursday, and immediately held out an SOS
sign to the West for dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in aid.
Anatoly Chubais, who was recently fired for a second time as a
deputy prime minister, was brought back onto President Boris
Yeltsin's team and charged with securing new loans to stabilize its
economy. Chubais is one of the most disliked and mistrusted men in
Russia, and his appointment enraged Yeltsin's critics in
parliament, who questioned the legality of the appointment. But he
is also one of the few figures in Russia whose economic expertise
is respected by Western bankers and leaders, and is the first
person Yeltsin seeks out when the economy is in trouble.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Under intense pressure following a U.S. move to
prop up the plunging yen, Japanese leaders scrambled Thursday to
explain how they plan to bring the world's second largest economy
out of its deepest recession in 50 years. Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, in an hour-long nationally televised news conference,
said the nation's economic health would improve after the
government implements its latest stimulus plan. He also pledged
that his government would come up with a plan to clean up the
problem of bad loans at the nation's banks. In meetings scheduled
for Friday and Saturday, Japan is expected to outline for
international finance officials its plans for finally cleaning up
the mountain of bad loans at the nation's banks. (JAPAN-ECONOMIC
CRISIS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. trade deficit soared to a record dlrs
14.5 billion in April as the Asian financial crisis battered
American exporters, pushing down sales of everything from
commercial aircraft to farm products. The Commerce Department
reported Thursday that the April deficit was 9.5 percent higher
than the March imbalance of dlrs 13.2 billion, the previous record.
While imports declined a slight 0.9 percent in April after hitting
an all-time high the month before, U.S. exports fell even more
sharply, dropping 2.6 percent as the deepening recessions in many
Asian markets cut into U.S. sales. The widening trade deficit has
been the major impact on the U.S. economy from the currency crisis
that struck Asia a year ago. (US-ECONOMY)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia announced Thursday it
would spend an additional 7 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.8 billion) this
year to help boost its economy. Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
made the announcement in a speech at the annual convention of the
ruling United Malays National Organization. International Trade and
Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz told the UMNO women's group that the
spending would stimulate the economy and spur development. The
Southeast Asian nation's economy shrank by 1.8 percent in the first
quarter of this year, compared with 6.9 percent growth in 1997.
Malaysian stocks rose sharply after Anwar made the announcement,
and the key index closed 4.6 percent higher at 471.82 points.
(MALAYSIA-ECONOMY BOOST)
	   DETROIT (AP) _ For General Motors dealers, the strikes that are
choking off their supply of new cars and trucks couldn't come at a
worse time. ``We're into the summer selling season, the hottest
time of the year,'' said Clint Davis, sales manager of
King-Chamberlain Oldsmobile-GMC in Loveland, Colorado. His
dealership is running low on its best-selling models, highly
profitable GMC pickups and sport utility vehicles. While most GM
dealers across the country still have several weeks' supply of new
vehicles on their lots, deliveries of new cars and trucks have
nearly ended. By Thursday, 21 GM assembly lines in the United
States, Canada and Mexico had been idled or slowed by the strikes
at two parts plants in Flint, Michigan. With an additional 88 parts
plants affected, nearly 89,000 GM workers have been idled by the
strike. That's in addition to the 9,200 striking workers in Flint,
Michigan. (US-GM-STRIKES)

Eds: Contains items on Sade, a man who faked his death three times,
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A judge ordered an arrest warrant for
singer Sade after she failed to appear at a hearing on reckless
driving charges.
	   Resident Magistrate William Campbell issued the warrant
Wednesday after Sade's lawyer, Clive Mullings, said his client had
previous engagements out of the country.
	   Sade is charged with leading police on a high-speed chase last
year in Montego Bay, Jamaica's northwest coast resort, and letting
loose a hail of expletives when police finally caught up.
	   She pleaded innocent to reckless driving and using abusive
language with police and could be fined no more than dlrs 200.
	   Last year, Sade won a stay of trial after a policeman failed to
show up in court.
	   Her hits include ``Smooth Operator'' and the Grammy
Award-winning ``No Ordinary Love.''
	   ___
	   WARRENTON, Virginia (AP) _ A man was sentenced to two years in
prison for faking his death three times to beat drunken driving
charges.
	   Peter C. Gentry, a 41-year-old financial planner, got caught
after a police officer who made one of the drunken driving arrests
spotted him running a stop sign after Gentry had supposedly died.
	   Gentry was sentenced on Wednesday.
	   He was first arrested in 1991, but an official-looking death
certficate sent to authorities said he had died in a Los Angeles
auto crash, and the case was dismissed.
	   In 1994, he was arrested again and sent in another death
certificate.
	   A year later, Gentry was again arrested and supposedly died this
time of ``denzor hemorrhagic fever'' in Africa. There is no such
disease.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With a No. 1 album on the pop charts, rapper DMX
could be the next big rap star. His recording label promoted him as
a successor to the late Tupac Shakur.
	   Now DMX, aka Earl Simmons, is the latest rap star to run afoul
of the law, accused of raping a woman he met at the club Harlem
Nights last Friday night.
	   The 29-year-old woman, a stripper at the club, told police that
Simmons, 27, invited her to a party at a Bronx apartment early
Saturday morning.
	   But there was no party, she said. According to a criminal
complaint, Simmons allegedly raped and sodomized her.
	   Simmons, who lives in Mount Vernon, is charged with rape,
sodomy, sexual abuse and unlawful imprisonment. He is free on dlrs
10,000 bail and is due back in Bronx Criminal Court on Monday.
	   His attorney, Murray Richman, said Thursday, ``There is just no
truth to these allegations. We do not even know this person. And he
was not at the club that night. He was never at that apartment.''
	   Richman would not say where Simmons was Friday night. The club
has no telephone listing.
	   Simmons has a criminal record dating to 1988, including arrests
for drug-related offenses, fare beating and larceny.
	   ___
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Houston Woods got a real jolt as he
was drinking his first cup of coffee: A meteorite crashed through
his roof and lodged in his bed springs.
	   At least he thinks it was a meteorite.
	   Specialists at Cumberland Science Museum agree. But they're
sending the tennis-ball-sized object, which looks like a lump of
coal, to the Smithsonian Institution for analysis.
	   Woods said he and his wife heard a loud explosion Saturday
morning. The wayward object had crashed through the roof and
bedroom ceiling.
	   A neighbor who works at the museum said the lump has a thin,
black layer common to objects that enter Earth's atmosphere.
	   ``I have no reason to believe this thing isn't a meteorite. If
somebody's trying to pull one over on us, they're doing a pretty
good job,'' said Louis Levine, collections manager and program
specialist at the science museum.
	   It wasn't the only apparent meteor fragment to crash to Earth.
Scientists say two more fell around the same time in eastern New
Mexico, including one that smashed through a barn roof in Portales,
New Mexico. Scientists at the University of New Mexico and Sandia
National Laboratories plan to study at least one of the samples.
	   ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ It looks like Frank Sinatra's heirs have
agreed to do it his way.
	   No one who was mentioned in Sinatra's will took advantage of the
first opportunity to challenge it in court Thursday. A lawyer for
the estate's executors credits a no-contest clause in the will with
being a ``substantial deterrent'' to any challenges.
	   ``Anyone knows if they want to challenge the will they better
succeed because if they fail they are going to disinherit
themselves completely,'' said lawyer Andrew Garb.
	   Sinatra died last month. He left his widow, Barbara, two homes,
other property and up to dlrs 3.5 million. His children, who had
already been given rights to much of Sinatra's lucrative music
catalog, received dlrs 200,000 each plus undivided interests in a
Beverly Hills office building.
	   His heirs have up to four months to challenge the will. Garb
said the lack of any initial objection is a sign that a challenge
is unlikely.

Watchdog says Cambodian logging company plans illegal exports 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Cambodian logging company close to
Co-Premier Hun Sen plans to illegally export millions of dollars of
high quality timber to Thailand with the help of officials in Laos,
an environmental watchdog group said Friday.
	   Global Witness, a private organization based in the United
Kingdom, said that 100,000 cubic meters of logs from the
northeastern Cambodian province of Stung Treng will be exported to
Laos to disguise its origin. It will then be re-exported to
Thailand, which bans most Cambodian log imports.
	   Cambodia has officially banned logging for export, but the
practice continues on a large scale under the protection of senior
government and military officials. Often the deals are disguised as
the export of wood cut down before the ban.
	   Global Witness said the deal to export the wood, worth dlrs 50
million at world market prices, was authorized by the Laotian
government and at a senior level in the Cambodian government.
	   It said the company exporting the wood, Pheapimex-Fuchan, is
headed by Choeng Sopheap, described as a close confidante of
Co-Premier Hun Sen, Cambodia's top leader.
	   ``Pheapimex-Fuchan is an example of all that is wrong with
forestry in Cambodia,'' said Global Witness in a press release
received in Bangkok.
	   ``They enjoy the protection of Hun Sen, they cut what they like
and it seems that no one has the power to do anything about it.''
	   Cambodia has come under fire by foreign donors for poor
management of dwindling forests. The forests, which three decades
ago were said to have covered 70 percent of the country, now cover
about 40 percent.
	   Several international aid donors have suspended some assistance
programs to Cambodia because of its failure to seriously tackle
illegal logging.
	   Global Witness quoted local loggers as saying that Pheapimex
will pay dlrs 50 per cubic meter to the Laotian government for
passage of its logs. The group said it had heard allegations that
up to 30 percent of profits were destined for officials in the
Forestry Department in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital.
	   ``We have written to the Thai Prime Minister and Foreign
Ministers to notify them of this illegal deal,'' said Global
Witness.
	   ``Laos is deliberately flouting their commitment to prevent
illegal log imports from Cambodia, and both Cambodia and Laos will
try to dupe Thailand into believing the logs are from Laos.''
	   It said Thailand ``is currently alone amongst Cambodia's
neighbors in honoring their commitments to prevent illegal log
imports from Cambodia across their land border.''
	   The only activity of Global Witness is to research and report on
Cambodian logging. It has released a series of detailed
investigative reports in the past few years.

Red cards waved like flags at World Cup 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The red tide that so many predicted finally has
come ashore at the World Cup. They're not blaming El Nino _ they're
blaming El Presidente.
	   One day after FIFA president Sepp Blatter and French organizing
committee chairman Michel Platini criticized referees for not being
tough enough, particularly on tackles from behind and time wasting,
five red cards were issued in two games Thursday _ one more than
was shown in the first eight days and 20 games of the tournament.
	   ``I think what they said was ridiculous,'' Danish defender Marc
Rieper said following Denmark's 1-1 draw with South Africa, a match
that saw three ejections and seven cautions.
	   ``Referees have been very good so far and it is a very stupid
comment that he (Platini) has made,'' Rieper said. ``I don't know
if he is trying to ruin the tournament that he made himself and
kill the football game.''
	   Two more ejections and four more yellows followed in France's
4-0 victory over Saudi Arabia Thursday night, a win which
guaranteed the host nation passage into the second round and made
the Saudis the first team to be eliminated.
	   But France's victory, which sparked some street celebrations in
and around Paris, came with a price. Forward Christophe Dugarry
tore his right hamstring in the first half and is likely gone for
the rest of the tournament.
	   Nigeria looked to join France and Brazil in the second round
Friday, facing Bulgaria in a Group D match in Paris where a victory
would guarantee advancement. Spain hoped to recover from its
opening 3-2 loss to the Nigerians when it met Paraguay in
Saint-Etienne.
	   Colombian referee John Jairo Toro tossed three players out of
Denmark-South Africa game in Toulouse, the most controversial of
which came when he expelled Danish defender Morten Wieghorst for
bumping forward Benni McCarthy in the back and knocking him down.
	   ``The guy hardly even touched me,'' McCarthy said. ``The referee
went out of his way to give him a red card and I am sure that was a
very silly _ a stupid _ decision from the referee.''
	   Wieghorst entered the game in the 82nd and left in the 85th.
	   ``It was my first foul. I'd been in the game two minutes,'' he
said. ``I must say I thought he was going to put it (the red card)
back. I tried to tell him he was pulling the wrong card by mistake,
but he was having none of it.''
	   Before Weighorst, Danish substitute Miklos Molnar left in the
67th, two minutes before South African midfielder Alfred Phiri.
	   ``I thought the referee was a bit harsh in his decisions,''
South African captain Lucas Radebe said. ``He made people scared to
even go out and tackle. I think he made a mess-up of the game.''
	   The ejections made Denmark struggle through the second half
after it dominated the first 45 minutes.
	   Regardless, the draw gave the Danes four points and put them in
second place in Group C, two behind France. They need only a draw
against the French in their final group game on Wednesday to clinch
a place in the final 16.
	   South Africa's situation was more grave. It needs a victory over
Saudi Arabia, France to beat the Danes and must overcome the
four-goal deficit in goal differential to Denmark.
	   The Danes got their goal when Allan Nielsen volleyed a cross
from Brian Laudrup in the 13th minute. Martin Jorgensen hit the
post with a corner in the 18th minute, and Ebbe Sand put a shot
from the top of the penalty area off the same post in the 42nd.
	   The missed opportunities cost the Scandinavians.
	   McCarthy finished off a series of touches from John Moshoeu and
Shaun Bartlett in the 53rd, slipping the ball between the legs of
Danish keeper Peter Schmeichel for South Africa's first World Cup
goal, and the Bafana Bafana nearly pulled the upset when Quinton
Fortune blasted a shot off the crossbar in the first minute of
second-half injury time.
	   In Saint-Denis, the French capitalized on their man advantage
after Mohammed al-Khilaiwi was expelled in the 19th minute, getting
goals from Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet to jump out to a 2-0
lead over the Saudis.
	   But even after Zinedine Zidane was sent off in the 70th for
stepping on Saudi captain Fuad Amin, the French added two more: a
second by Henry and a finale by Bizente Lizarazu.
	   ``I didn't deserve this,'' Zidane said of his ejection. ``I did
not mean to hurt the man. I just fell on him.''
	   Zidane's apology had no more effect than those of the four
players that preceded him off the field Thursday.
	   At least Faustino Asprilla had hope. The Colombian striker read
a prepared statement Thursday, saying he was sorry for publicly
criticizing coach Hernan Dario Gomez on Wednesday regarding his
substitution in the 1-0 loss to Romania. Asprilla was dismissed
from the team by Gomez, but his mea culpa may cause the coach to
reconsider.
	   ``But I don't know what the decision will be,'' Gomez said.
``The truth is, those are nice words by Faustino.''

World Cup: Denmark and South Africa draw 1-1 in ``strange match'' 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Call it a World Cup initiation, or
perhaps hazing, for South Africa.
	   In a match that had everything _ an historic goal, three red
cards, seven yellows and frantic action _ the World Cup debutante
rallied to draw 1-1 with favored Denmark on Thursday and slightly
scramble the Group C World Cup standings.
	   The draw left Denmark with a good chance to advance to the
second round, while South Africa, a 3-0 loser to France in its
World Cup debut last week, needs a dominating victory in its final
first-round game and lots of help.
	   Before a howling Stade Municipal crowd that included Danish
Crown Prince Frederik, heir to the throne and oldest son of Queen
Margrethe II, South Africa finished the game playing 10-on-nine and
with two chances to win.
	   Striker Benni McCarthy scored the first World Cup goal in South
African history, a 53rd minute strike that offset Allan Nielsen's
13th minute header for Denmark.
	   Then Colombian referee John Jairo Toro handed out two red cards
to Denmark and one to South Africa. Those accompanied seven
cautions, including four for time-wasting, after FIFA president
Sepp Blatter complained this week that referees were too lax.
	   Denmark coach Bo Johansson refused to comment directly on the
officiating in what he called a ``strange match.''
	   ``If we ever think we know how a game will be, we should
remember this game,'' a smiling Johansson said.
	   But South African coach Philippe Troussier and several players
said Toro blew the game.
	   ``The referees are under pressure. The referee today took his
hardest shot. I think it was too hard,'' Troussier said.
	   Toro's casual issuance of cards threw the game into disarray
after McCarthy tied the score.
	   Danish substitute Miklos Molnar was sent off in the 67th minute
after knocking over South African captain Lucas Radebe. Then Toro
showed the red card to South African substitute Alfred Phiri two
minutes later for elbowing aside Thomas Helveg. An anguished Phiri
wept in his shirt before slowly walking off.
	   In the 85th minute, another Danish substitute, Morten Wieghorst,
went off for bumping McCarthy from behind and knocking him down. It
was the second red card of the tournament for the illegal tackle
after FIFA officials promised a crackdown.
	   Both McCarthy and Wieghorst thought the call was too harsh.
	   ``I tried to tell him he was pulling the wrong card by mistake,
but he was having none of it,'' Wieghorst said.
	   With a man advantage, South Africa had the better chances but
was unable to convert. Quinton Fortune came closest with a blast
off the crossbar from outside the penalty area one minute into
injury time.
	   The crowd jeered Toro lustily as he left the field.
	   McCarthy, who said before the tournament he wanted to be
remembered for scoring an important goal, recorded his country's
first World Cup goal, finishing a series of touched from John
Moshoeu and Shaun Bartlett. His left-footed strike from 10 meters
slipped between the legs fo Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.
	   Nielsen's goal in the 13th minute gave Denmark the start it
wanted. Brian Laudrup and Martin Jorgensen combined to beat David
Nyathi on the right side, and Nielsen volleyed Laudrup's cross off
goalkeeper Hans Vonk's hand before reaching the net.
	   The Danes also hit the right post behind Vonk twice in the first
half _ once on a looping corner by Jorgensen, followed by Laudrup's
header into Vonk's belly, and later on Ebbe Sand's right-footed
shot from the top of the penalty area.

Protesters clash with police in Guyana 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Dozens of protesters smashed shop
windows and clashed with Guyana police Thursday in a reprise of the
racial violence that swept this South American country in December
and January.
	   Police fired tear gas canisters and automatic rifles into the
air to try to break up the crowd.
	   About 200 demonstrators broke windows and threw stones at police
in a commercial district in Georgetown. More than 20 were arrested
and charged with unlawful assembly.
	   The violence erupted over a breakdown in power-sharing talks
between the opposition People's National Congress and President
Janet Jagan's People's Progressive Party.
	   The opposition party, which is backed by Guyanese of African
descent, claims the Dec. 15 elections were rigged by Jagan's party,
which has its power base among the East Indian ethnic majority. An
audit by the 15-member Caribbean Community economic bloc on June 2
said the vote was fair.
	   Demonstrators on Thursday chanted anti-government slogans and
hurled insults at police.
	   Most businesses in downtown Georgetown closed.
	   Many people, including a 3-month-old baby overcome by tear gas,
were treated at local hospitals for injuries during the clashes.
	   ``This is clearly a failure of the political process,'' said
Rupert Roopnarine, leader of the Working People's Alliance, a
smaller opposition party.
	   The election touched off a month of rioting and looting in
Guyana.

New UN envoy will have to hit the ground running 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ As America's U.N. envoy, Richard Holbrooke
will need all his negotiating skills to cope with potential
firestorms from Kosovo to South Asia at a time when U.S. leverage
over old foes and reluctant allies is waning.
	   Holbrooke, architect of the 1995 agreement that ended the 3
1/2-year Bosnian war, was named U.N. ambassador Thursday,
succeeding Bill Richardson who will take over as energy secretary.
	   The 57-year-old Holbrooke, who served as assistant secretary of
state for European affairs in the Clinton Administration and
assistant secretary for Asian affairs in the Carter administration,
will be the most seasoned diplomat to represent America at the
United Nations since Thomas Pickering, the U.S. envoy here during
the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
	   After negotiating the Bosnia accord, Holbrooke served as special
U.S. envoy on Cyprus, a Mediterranean island divided between rival
Greek and Turkish communities.
	   Experienced diplomats of other member states say success at the
United Nations _ where envoys deal simultaneously with a range of
issues and many different players _ is quite different from
handling bilateral negotiations on single issues.
	   ``As I found when I came here, it is important to listen to what
others have to say,'' British Ambassador John Weston said Thursday.
``And very often, that is the secret to getting things done in the
U.N.''
	   Holbrooke will be arriving at a critical period. Numerous crises
are looming:
	   _ In Kosovo, fighting between Serbs and ethnic Albanians
threatens to engulf region, triggering a wider Balkan war and
unraveling the very peace Holbrooke put together in Bosnia.
	   _ In Cyprus, Turkey is threatening military action if the Greek
Cypriot government takes delivery of surface-to-air missiles, which
a Russian company plans to deliver by mid-August.
	   _ Nuclear tests last month by India and Pakistan have undermined
the fabric of nuclear nonproliferation agreements and raised the
specter of nuclear conflict in South Asia.
	   _ A showdown is brewing with Iraq over economic sanctions, which
had been the cornerstone of U.S. security policy in the Persian
Gulf.
	   _ Washington's inability to revive the moribund Arab-Israeli
peace process is making it difficult to fend off pressure from the
Arabs and Europeans for a stronger international role in mediation.
	   No effective security policy has been developed to cope with
instability in Africa, where any number of local conflicts could
explode into crisis.
	   Similar crises are smouldering in Georgia, Afghanistan and
Tajikistan. U.S. influence has been compromised by the intractable
problem of the more than dlrs 1 billion the United States owes in
back dues to the United Nations.
	   The high-watermark of U.S. influence at the United Nations was
reached in 1990, when the Bush Administration persuaded the
Security Council to endorse military action to drive Iraqi invaders
from Kuwait.
	   Since then, however, Washington has been less successful in
mustering support in the Security Council for a robust response to
crises.
	   U.S. efforts to threaten military action against Iraq over U.N.
weapons inspections fell flat. Washington had to rely on
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to negotiate a way out of the impasse
and convince the Iraqis to open sensitive sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   If U.N. inspectors report significant progress by October in
accounting for Iraq's illegal arms, Russia, France and China will
exert strong pressure within the Security Council to wrap up
inspections and lift sanctions, with or without Saddam in power.
	   Russia has resisted British and American efforts in the Security
Council to threaten military force to halt the fighting in Kosovo.
China too is playing a more assertive role in the council, taking
positions closer to the Russians than the Americans on several
major issues.

Iran prepares for historic soccer battle with United States that loser of Sunday's game will be eliminated.

By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ For millions of die-hard Iranian soccer
fans, defeating the United States at the World Cup would be as good
as winning the whole tournament.
	   ``I cannot hide my sentiments. ... I pray that Iran wins,'' Iraj
Ghadimi, who owns a home appliance shop in Tehran's main bazaar,
said of Sunday's game, the loser of which will be eliminated.
``This match concerns the country's national pride.''
	   Along with wrestling, soccer has always been the most loved
sport in Iran. But the battle in Lyon, France, has taken on added
significance given Iranians' love-hate relationship with Americans.
	   The country's preoccupation with the upcoming match is evident
everywhere. Hospitals are preparing to treat weak-hearted fans if
all doesn't go well for Iran _ or even if it does: Three people
were treated for heart attacks after Iran qualified for the World
Cup in November. Many others suffered cuts, bruises and sprained
ankles from jumping in excitement.
	   U.S.-Iran soccer fever is even taking precedence over justice:
The trial of the Tehran mayor on corruption charges was adjourned
until after Sunday's match.
	   Political enmity with the United States has been branded in the
psyches of Iranians since the 1979 Islamic revolution that
proclaimed the United States the ``Great Satan.''
	   But many Iranians never truly hated Americans, and have largely
welcomed moderate President Mohammad Khatami's calls for cultural
and sports exchanges with the United States.
	   On Wednesday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that
the United States was ready to start normalizing ties with Iran.
President Bill Clinton followed her speech by saying he is
convinced Iran is ``changing in a positive way'' that could lead to
a reconciliation and a return to normal relations.
	   ``For the first time after a 20-year enmity, the representatives
of the two countries are confronting each other in healthy
battle,'' Bijan Shariati, 26, a Tehran University student, said of
Sunday's match.
	   Despite being absent from international soccer for the past 20
years, Iranians take the game very seriously: More than 100,000
fans showed up at every match Iran played at home during the
qualifying rounds.
	   Across Tehran and other cities, cafes and restaurants have
installed television sets to attract customers and security has
been increased to control crowds, jubilant or otherwise.
	   Some universities even postponed examinations scheduled to be
held during the monthlong tournament, while shops have reported
skyrocketing sales of nuts and crackers, apparently to be munched
during nail-biting matches.
	   One recent afternoon, a group of teen-age girls crowded a
newspaper kiosk to buy sports papers, and chanted the names of
Iranian players.
	   Among the most popular are Ali Daei, Karim Bagheri and Khodadad
Azizi: Their pictures are plastered on walls and on windshields of
vehicles.
	   The matches are broadcast live on Iran's state-run television,
but with a 10-second delay to enable censors to edit out anything
considered un-Islamic or offensive to the Islamic regime.
	   Shots picked up by French cameras of hooligans, women wearing
thin summer dresses, and banners by Iranian opposition groups are
blocked and replaced with footage from other matches.
	   The government has not commented on the upcoming contest with
the United States. Still, the significance of clashing for the
first time in decades with a country that has done its best to
isolate Iran is not lost on people here.
	   Though he expects his team to play hard against the United
States, Iran's World Cup coach said Thursday in France that his
players are not hostile toward the Americans and would treat them
like any other competitors.
	   Coach Jalal Talebi, who has a home in California, also said his
players would have no problem standing for the American national
anthem.
	   There were brief fears Wednesday that Iran would pull out of the
soccer championships, angered by the showing of the film ``Not
Without My Daughter'' on French television. The American movie
portrays Iranians as boorish and obsessed with Islamic religious
customs.
	   Meanwhile Thursday, the leading Iranian exiled opposition group
claimed that a Tehran intelligence official had come to France
bearing files of opponents so they could be arrested as hooligans
during World Cup matches.
	   At a news conference, the Mujahedeen Khalq claimed that Tehran
authorities were ``sparing no effort'' to keep Iranians from
attending matches.
	   The Iranian Embassy did not immediately respond to the
allegations.

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Dominican President Leonel
Fernandez, arriving in Haiti, expressed hopes for a new era of
cooperation between the traditionally hostile neighbors on the
island of Hispaniola.
	   ``We have lived difficult moments in the course of history,''
Fernandez said when he arrived Thursday on the first full
presidential visit by a Dominican leader in 62 years. ``The moment
has come to unite our forces to restore the faith and trust of our
peoples in the construction of a better future.''
	   He flew on a Dominican air force helicopter from Santo Domingo
to Port-au-Prince, underscoring the short distance but huge
cultural, political, and economic gulf that separates the
countries.
	   Diplomats from both countries have been working on agreements
regarding drug trafficking, trade and tourism for Preval and
Fernandez to sign. Despite U.S. encouragement, the two sides failed
to reach a drug-fighting pact, said Haitian charge d'affaires Guy
Lamothe.
	   Agreements on migration and tourism _ of more immediate
importance to the two Caribbean countries _ also were bogged down.
	   ``Our peoples are condemned to living on the same island,''
Haitian tourism undersecretary Maryse Pennet told The Associated
Press. ``Even if all of the accords aren't signed, we have begun a
dialogue.''
	   Officials could not agree on the thorniest problem: how to
regulate tens of thousands of Haitians who cross the loosely
controlled border seeking jobs, many as badly treated sugar cane
cutters.
	   More than 500,000 Haitians live at least part time in Dominican
Republic, a nation of 8 million people.
	   An agreement to sell the two countries as one tourist
destination was criticized by the Dominican Association of Hotel
and Restaurant Owners, which cited Haiti's political instability
and underdeveloped tourism industry.
	   Preval and Fernandez did plan to sign trade agreements. After
the United States, Haiti is the Dominican Republic's largest export
market.
	   Officially, Dominican exports topped dlrs 29 million last year,
while Haiti sent dlrs 1 million of goods to the Dominican Republic.
The figures probably are closer to dlrs 50 million in Dominican
exports to Haiti and 5 million in the other direction, according to
Alexandre.
	   Fernandez is the first Dominican president to stay overnight in
Haiti since 1936, when dictator Rafael Trujillo came to sign a
border agreement. Animosities go back to Haitian attempts to annex
the Dominican Republic and an 1822-1844 occupation.

Chief weapons inspector says Iraq still withholding key information 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite an agreement which Iraq hailed as
a ``breakthrough,'' Baghdad is still withholding key information it
must provide before economic sanctions can be lifted, the chief
U.N. inspector has reported.
	   But diplomatic sources said Iraq is apparently gambling that
Russia, France and China will prevail over the United States and
Britain and persuade the Security Council to end the sanctions
without complete verification that all illegal weapons have been
destroyed.
	   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iraq's
gamble puts the burden on the United States to decide whether it
can accept less than complete verification or resist growing
pressure to bring the eight-year sanctions to a close.
	   Last week, Iraq and the chief inspector, Richard Butler, reached
agreement on a two-month inspection program to determine whether
Baghdad has destroyed all long-range missiles and chemical and
biological weapons.
	   That is the main condition for the Security Council to lift
sanctions imposed in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait, touching off the Gulf War.
	   U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Iraqis videotaped the three meetings with Butler and his team.
	   As a result, they said, many of Aziz's remarks appeared to be
directed at an outside audience, including his frequent references
to the suffering of Iraqi civilians because of sanctions.
	   Following the meetings, Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq
Aziz, called the agreement a ``breakthrough'' that would ``prepare
the ground for the lifting of the economic embargo.''
	   After the meetings, Butler told reporters that ``if that work is
done satisfactorily ... I believe we should be in a position'' to
move toward the lifting of sanctions.
	   But U.N. officials cautioned against interpretations that the
inspection program was near an end. They noted that Butler had
emphasized that Iraq must cooperate fully with the plan _ something
the United Nations maintains Baghdad has not always done.
	   In a report Thursday to the Security Council, Butler said ``in
virtually all instances, Iraq remained firm in its position that no
relevant documents (on illegal weapons) were available.''
	   ``In one instance, Iraq refused to provide documents it
acknowledged having in its possession,'' he added.
	   Furthermore the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
also noted that some major issues would remain unresolved even if
the two-month program were completed satisfactorily.
	   In a report Thursday to the Security Council, Butler said the
Iraqis refused to allow the issue of missile fuel to be included in
the program. The inspectors say Iraq may still be holding
propellant for long-range missiles, raising questions whether all
such weapons have actually been accounted for, as Baghdad claims.
	   More significantly, the report said Iraq ``refused ... to
clarify the extent of its attempts to produce the chemical warfare
agent VX.''
	   On biological weapons, Iraq refused to provide additional
information on its program. But at Iraq's request, the commission
agreed to another meeting of technical experts, including Russian,
French and Chinese, on July 11 in Baghdad to review material on
biological weapons which the Iraqis have already submitted.
	   The plan calls, among other things, for Iraq to clarify by July
21 where it supposedly destroyed 500 mustard gas artillery shells
in 1991.
	   It also provides for experts from both sides to meet in Baghdad
early next month to review results of chemical analyses of soil
samples taken from sites were the Iraqis say illegal weapons were
destroyed.

World Cup: No golf for South Korean soccer players 
</HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT QUENTIN (AP) _ Despite residing at the ``Golf National''
course hotel, South Korea's World Cup players refuse to offend the
elders in the delegation by hitting the fairways.
	   ``It's Confucius' teachings,'' said Chun Hanjin, the team's
vice-manager. ``There is still a lot of that influence in Korea.
Just like smoking or drinking, playing golf in front of elders or
parents doesn't look good. It isn't done.''
	   Not only does it look bad to their seniors, but the players are
also worried it might be construed as a lack of seriousness in
their World Cup preparations.
	   So despite the temptation _ and the boredom _ between training
sessions, South Korea's players would still refrain from pulling
out their putters.
	   ``The players have not been prohibited from playing,'' said
Chun. ``It's the players themselves who've thought ahead and think
it is wrong to play.
	   ``It's very cool to play, but if they play golf it also looks
like they are goofing off instead of concentrating on football.''
	   None of this has prevented team officials from putting the
hotel's rental clubs to use, the team doctor was seen on more than
one occasion heading for the greens.
	   While ideal for golf aficionados, the South Koreans' hotel is
located in a rather remote area outside of Paris. With no shops, no
entertainment and little to do, the players are left to their own
means of amusing themselves.
	   To break the monotony, the athletes persuaded security officials
to procure fishing lines, and regularly try their luck at the golf
course pond instead. But with no way to cook up their trophies, and
in order to avoid depleting the little pool, the players are forced
to throw the fish back.
	   If odds-makers were consulted, the South Koreans would probably
have a better chance of getting a hole-in-one than defeating their
next opponents, the Netherlands, in Marseille on Saturday.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Riot police clashed with striking
telephone workers as Puerto Rico's Senate voted Thursday to sell a
controlling stake in the government telephone company for dlrs 1.9
billion.
	   On a turbulent first day of a strike to protest the sale, one
demonstrator was arrested on charges of assaulting a police
officer, and at least two officers were hurt, police said.
	   Fearing for their jobs, 6,400 unionized Puerto Rico Telephone
Company employees struck to try to stop the sale of 50 percent plus
one share to a consortium led by telecommunications giant GTE
Corporation.
	   Senators voted 19-9 to approve the deal. Puerto Rico's House of
Representatives will vote next week.
	   The sale is the centerpiece of Gov. Pedro Rossello's
privatization program. In an interview with The Associated Press on
Thursday, Rossello insisted that the state cannot compete in a
newly-opened Puerto Rican market.
	   ``I can tell you that if you take the alternative route (keeping
the company in public hands), in five or six years the assets of
the people of Puerto Rico will be washed away,'' Rossello said.
	   PRTC had a monopoly in this U.S. commonwealth of 3.8 million
people until 1996, when the law changed. Now, it faces competition
from private firms and has been forced to cut rates.
	   Telephone worker protests erupted across this Caribbean island,
closing at least three company branches Thursday.
	   In San Juan, riot police shoved protesters and struck some with
batons when strikers blocked access to telephone company
headquarters. Government employees and students joined the
protests, waving flags and chanting.
	   ``The government is anti-worker!'' declared Leticia Malpica, a
secretary at the government Economic Development agency. She held a
sign that read, ``Rossello Dictator.''
	   Isolated acts of vandalism were reported. Telephone cables in
suburban Rio Piedras were severed, knocking out service to dozens
of homes.
	   In Ponce, Puerto Rico's second-largest city, Mayor Rafael
Cordero Santiago gave city workers the day off to join the picket
lines. The opposition Popular Democratic Party, meanwhile, urged
followers to support the strike.
	   With nonunion managers and contract employees fielding directory
assistance and service calls, phone company president Carmen Ana
Culpeper said the company could weather two weeks of a strike
without cutting back on services.
	   Annie Cruz, president of the Independent Brotherhood of
Telephone Employees, said dozens of automated bank teller machines,
which depend on phone lines, were out of service in San Juan.
	   ``The system is collapsing little by little,'' Cruz said.

World Cup: Two friends save France in need 
</HEADLINE>

By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ France was in need, and two young
friends stepped in. After a goalfest left the host nation a firm
favorite in the World Cup, their smiles and eyes locked into one
joyful embrace for all the globe to see.
	   Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet took care of a trio of goals
that paced France to a 4-0 win over Saudi Arabia and clinch a berth
in the second round.
	   Both 20, both playing for AS Monaco, and both long considered
outside shots at earning a place on the French team, they came
through with flying Tricolors Thursday as a rapturous crowd at the
Stade de France chanted the Marseillaise.
	   ``We've played in so many games together. We know each other's
game like the back of our hands,'' Trezeguet said.
	   Henry scored two goals to bring his World Cup total to three,
tying him for the individual scoring lead. It was Trezeguet's
first.
	   Henry is the outgoing one whose personal problems and a slump in
form over the winter earned so many critics that his place on the
French roster seemed unlikely.
	   Trezeguet is all family _ he still lives with his parents.
	   Different strokes, yet united in motivating one another into the
fancy of coach Aime Jacquet. ``We're just very good friends,'' said
Trezeguet.
	   They are together on the training pitch and hang out together
off it. Early in the season Henry was the star in Monaco, then came
Trezeguet. For Les Bleus they emerged together.
	   And it has paid great dividends.
	   Saudi Arabia was already down to 10 men because of a red card
when playmaker Zinedine Zidane set Bixente Lizarazu free in the
36th minute. The lightening quick left back perfectly passed it
into the goalmouth, where Henry coolly knocked it home for the
opening strike.
	   In the 68th minute, Trezeguet added the second, capitalizing on
a goalkeeping error, who let a simple cross from Lilian Thuram slip
through his hands, offering the simplest of headers for the goal.
	   Henry scored his second in the 77th minute, running on to a bad
defensive clearance and beating goalkeeper Mohammed al-Dayea with a
low right-footed shot.
	   Lizarazu added a great fourth, collecting a delicate backheel
assist from Youri Djorkaeff.
	   However, there was also bad news for France.
	   Starting forward Christophe Dugarry had to be carried off with a
torn right hamstring, threatening the rest of his World Cup
campaign. Fellow forward Stephane Guivarc'h already had to sit out
Thursday's game with a strained right knee.
	   And Zidane will miss at least next Wednesday's first-round
closer against Denmark after Mexican referee Arturo Brizio sent him
off in the 70th minute for putting his studs in the hip of Saudi
captain Fuad Amin.
	   After the 1-1 draw between Denmark and South Africa, France now
leads Group C with 6 points, 2 ahead of the Scandinavians. Saudi
Arabia became the first team to be eliminated from second-round
contention.
	   ``We tried to break out of defense, but there was just no way to
stop the French team,'' Saudi coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said.
``We were demoralized.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Good news for England and Scotland in the World
Cup means bad news for the lottery in Britain.
	   Camelot, which runs the lottery, announced Thursday that ticket
sales had dropped four percent since the World Cup started and
could drop further if England and Scotland progress.
	   At that rate, revenues could slump by as much as 45 million
pounds (dlrs 73.8 million) during the month-long tournament.
	   ``Ticket sales go down because people's minds are on different
things,'' a Camelot spokeswoman said. ``If they're trying to watch
lots of matches, their lives don't follow the usual patterns and
that can include buying tickets.''
	   England's opening World Cup match against Tunisia coincided with
a 30 percent decrease in ticket sales that day.
	   The trend in sales decline emerged during the 1996 European
Championships, but operators expect the impact of the World Cup to
be more significant.
	   ``Euro' 96 lasted for just two weeks compared to the month-long
World Cup,'' the spokeswoman said. ``It's quite a significant
length of time,''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAINT-GALMIER, France (AP) _ When off the pitch, Yugoslavia's
star striker Predrag Mijatovic always wears a Los Angeles Dodgers
cap. But, for him, the blue headgear with ``LA'' on the front has
nothing to do with the American baseball club.
	   ``It's the first letters of my two sons: Luka and Andrija,''
Mijatovic said. ``I devoted my play at the World Cup to my dear two
sons, and this hat always reminds me of them.''
	   Three-year-old Andrija has been seriously ill since his birth
and is hospitalized. Luka is 5.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italy's coach Cesare Maldini said young
striker Christian Vieri could become the Gunnar Nordahl of the
'90s.
	   ``He's powerful, fearless and determined,'' Maldini said.
	   Nordahl, a Swedish striker, starred for AC Milan in the '50s.
Maldini also played with AC Milan as a sweeper. His son, Paolo, the
national team captain, is a current Milan star.
	   Vieri, 24, the leading Spanish league striker with Atletico
Madrid this year, has tallied three goals in Italy's two World Cup
matches.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australians still shaking their sleepy
heads at the failure of their team to qualify for the World Cup are
trying to find some solace in the performance of Christian Vieri.
	   News media led bulletins with the ``Australian-trained'' Italian
striker's three goals that share the tournament's scoring lead with
Marcelo Salas.
	   Vieri moved to Sydney in 1977, when he was five, as father
Roberto was brought out as coach of leading club Marconi. They
stayed until 1988.
	   Meanwhile, Australians have been warned that staying up late to
watch the World Cup could be bad for their health. With games
starting most days at 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. eastern Australian time,
sleep disorder specialist Dr. David Hillman has suggested fans
``sleep through the boring bits.''
	   Hillman said night owl fans may begin to suffer coordination
impairment, irritability, even paranoia and mental illness.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SOWERBY, England (AP) _ Charity begins at home for Linda Davis,
who is watching all 64 World Cup matches on television to raise
money for needy children.
	   Linda, whose husband John is the vicar at Sowerby, North
Yorkshire, is an avid soccer fan and was looking forward to the
World Cup.
	   Now she has an excuse to watch every match.
	   The 48-year-old York City fan struck the idea of trying to raise
money for a children's center in Bucharest, Romania, by getting
sponsored to watch every match.
	   ``I'm watching all the games in full where I can, but if I have
to go out I video them and watch as though it were on live,'' she
said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ A day before they face each other
on the pitch, veteran Spanish goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta said he
was grateful for the words of support from his Paraguayan
counterpart.
	   Zubizarreta was blasted by critics in the Spanish and
international press after he fumbled on a simple cross and pushed
the ball into his own net for Nigeria's second goal in Spain's 3-2
defeat in its World Cup opener.
	   Jose Luis Chilavert came out in defense of Zubizarreta this
week, saying every keeper makes mistakes and that Zubizarreta's
error did not change his ranking as a top-class goalie.
	   ``What (Chilavert) demonstrates is that those of us who are in
the game, on the pitch, are the ones who know that some days things
work out well and others they don't and sometimes you make
mistakes,'' said the 36-year-old Zubziarreta, who is playing his
fourth world Cup for Spain.
	   ``I'm thankful for what he said and also to others who have
supported me. I'll thank him before the game and afterwards _ but
not during it as evidently we'll be going all out to win.''
	   Spain and Paraguay play Friday at Saint-Etienne.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italy will play a warmup game against a
local amateur selection Saturday, mostly to have striker Alessandro
Del Piero testing his form in a full match.
	   Del Piero who has not played 90 minutes since suffering a thigh
strain in the May 20 Champions Cup final against Real Madrid.
Roberto Baggio has started in his place in both of Italy's France
'98 games.
	   Also at the Italian camp, midfielder Roberto Di Matteo was given
a two-day rest by doctors to rest a sore muscle.
	   Baggio and midfielder Luigi Di Biagio also did not train
Thursday as they were nursing bruises suffered in Wednesday night's
match against Cameroon.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAINT-GALMIER, France (AP) _ Yugoslav soccer players like this
picturesque eastern French village as their World Cup training
base. But some aren't too happy with the isolation.
	   ``The nature here is nice, but life could be more exciting,''
said 20-year-old forward Perica Ognjenovic. ``For us younger
players it's a bit boring.''
	   ``There is not much going on here, and even when we have off
days we don't know where to go,'' said defender Miroslav Djukic.
``We keep on bumping into each other and with security people.''
	   Ognjenovic and his best friend, 19-year-old midfielder Dejan
Stankovic, were seen Thursday hitching a ride with journalists to
nearby Saint-Etiennne after a mid-day press conference.
	   ``We want to see some civilization,'' Stankovic said, laughing.

Move to energy could help Richardson's political ambitions 
</HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ From globe-trotting diplomat to energy
secretary may not be everyone's idea of a promotion.
	   But for U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson, the highest ranking
Hispanic in the Clinton administration, it's a career shift that
could reap long-term political benefits.
	   Richardson, nominated Thursday by President Bill Clinton as the
new energy secretary, has been mentioned as a potential No. 2 on an
Al Gore presidential ticket. And he's known to be interested in
running for governor in New Mexico.
	   For veteran diplomatic troubleshooter Richard Holbrooke, who
would replace Richardson at the United Nations if the Senate agrees
to both nominations, it would be a return to the track that had
made him a candidate for secretary of state before the job went to
Madeleine Albright.
	   Holbrooke brokered the Bosnian peace accord and would retain a
strong voice for the United States in the world body.
	   For Richardson, any goal for higher office could be helped by a
two-year stint as head of the Energy Department, a sprawling
bureaucracy that delves into everything from protecting America's
nuclear weapons stockpile to funding research on energy
conservation.
	   Recognized for his diplomatic forays, Richardson, 50, can use
his new Cabinet post to enhance his domestic resume, political
analysts say. And the job can't hurt him back home in New Mexico
where the Energy Department has two research labs and employs
thousands of workers.
	   Richardson, who was born in California but grew up in Mexico
City with an American father and Mexican mother, thanked Clinton
for ``being the most prolific appointer of Latinos of any
president.'' At the department he replaces Federico Pena.
	   From his years in Congress, Richardson is well versed in nuclear
issues, from weapons stockpiling to environmental cleanup. And his
diplomatic credentials may help in dealing with Russia on nuclear
proliferation and the sensitive diplomatic squabbles surrounding
Caspian Sea oil development.
	   ``He knows oil and gas production issues. He's no stranger to
energy policy,'' said George Yates, an independent oil and gas
producer from New Mexico.
	   Adds David Nemtzow, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a
private energy conservation advocacy group: ``He starts up with a
good personal relationship with the president and good chemistry.
He's a real player.''
	   While supportive, some environmentalists remain a bit wary of
Richardson's support of nuclear programs. Even so, says Scott
Denman of the Safe Energy Communications Council, a coalition of
environmental groups, ``he has a green tint to his energy policy.''
	   After years a a congressman with little national attention,
Richardson began making headlines in 1994 in a series of sometimes
unorthodox and unofficial diplomatic missions. In trips to Iraq,
North Korea, Cuba, and Sudan he negotiated the freedom of
Americans.
	   Richardson did what official Washington could not _ talk
face-to-face with the likes of Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein, North
Korea's leaders and Marxist rebels in Sudan.
	   And he relished the attention, even keeping a packed duffel bag
ready for the next rescue trip. Adding to his rumpled image, a
favorite and well worn blue blazer became his trademark. It's ``my
good luck charm,'' he told an interviewer.
	   Asked once about the key to successful negotiations, Richardson
replied, ``Understanding your adversary.'' Others say part of his
success is from his tenacity, whether matching wits with Saddam or
sharing goat meat under a mango tree with a Sudanese rebel leader.
	   In December 1996, only days after his face-off with a Marxist
leader in Sudan brought the release of three Red Cross workers,
Richardson was named by Clinton as U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations.
	   During one day of campaigning for Congress, Richardson shook the
hands of 8,871 people, a fact recorded in the Guinness Book of
Records. It's the kind of raw determination still burning within
him, say his associates.

EU presidency fraught with tough bargaining, potential pitfalls 
</HEADLINE>
By ROLAND PRINZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria is the first of three 1995
newcomers to the European Union to take over its rotating
presidency, and national prestige is at stake.
	   With such diplomatic landmarks as the 1815 Congress of Vienna _
which redrew the map of Europe _ in its past, Austria exudes
confidence that it can succeed, despite its smallness and EU
newness, in presiding over the 15-nation group from July 1 for the
six-month runup to the euro common currency.
	   But insiders warn of tough bargaining ahead, and the pitfalls of
playing European fireman on international crises such as the
simmering conflict in nearby Kosovo.
	   Critics say Austria's diplomatic service is too small, its
left-right coalition government too split or indecisive and a
certain sluggishness too ingrained for the presidency to pass
smoothly.
	   Certainly, the Social Democratic Chancellor, Viktor Klima, and
conservative Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel face some tests of
their jocular style.
	   The European Commission, headed by EU President Jacques Santer,
has sued Austria at the European Court of Justice for refusing to
abolish or sharply reduce a road toll imposed on traffic across the
Brenner pass freeway linking Austria with Italy.
	   It may do likewise to break Austrian insistence on anonymous
bank accounts despite repeated EU warnings that the practice favors
money laundering and other border-crossing crimes.
	   Another contentious issue is the controlled book prices that
exist under an agreement between Germany and Austria, which EU
Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert has said must be
abandoned.
	   Normally, the passage of EU presidency from one nation to
another is something remarked only by diplomatic insiders.
	   But Austria's debut in the role has prompted a flurry of
renovation in Vienna's beautiful historical center, and stirred
much comment in media and amongst politicians.
	   Austria, and Vienna, earn billions of dollars each year in
tourism and are adept at showing off their attractions.
	   Critical politicians and commentators fear diplomatic skills
don't match.
	   More than 2,000 official meetings will be held in the six
months, mostly in the EU's Brussels headquarters.
	   ``The many routine events are going to be wearisome, because
Austria's diplomatic service is really much too small for that,''
wrote Christoph Kotanko in the Kurier daily this week.
	   At government-owned Laudon Castle, a mansion tucked away in the
Vienna Woods, officials and diplomats reportedly are attending
``crash courses'' and simulating possible EU conference situations
to hone negotiating skills.
	   In a recently published book, Michael Jungwirth, an Austrian
journalist covering the EU, claims EU observers have been surprised
by the noncommittal attitude often displayed by Austria in
Brussels.
	   Austrians traditionally are masters of compromise _ a skill
learned over centuries of running the vast, multiethnic Habsburg
Empire, and more recently trained on the task of remaining neutral
during the Cold War with three Communist nations at its doorstep.
	   Aside from Schuessel and Klima, the spotlight will fall on
Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger, who will chair EU finance
ministers, and the ``euro-11'' council for European Monetary Union.
	   Edlinger already headed a ``euro-11'' meeting on June 4 because
Britain, currently holding the EU presidency, is, like Sweden,
Denmark and Greece, not introducing the euro from Jan. 1, 1999.
	   Despite the key elections in Germany in September, the EU
expects Austria to complete broad outlines for ``Agenda 2000,''
including vital reform of the costly EU farming subsidies.
	   Among other demanding tasks: efforts to reduce unemployment,
currently at 18 million in the EU, and talks on expanding eastwards
with Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia.

Center-left Social Democrats bid for power in Czech elections between 1200 and 2200 GMT Friday and 0400 and 1200GMT Saturday; first results expected just after polls close Saturday.

Eds: Will be led after polls open 1200 GMT Friday. Polls are open

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ After being in opposition for six
years, the Social Democrats are making a strong bid to form the
first left-of-center Czech government since the collapse of
Communism in 1989.
	   Heading into early parliamentary elections, the Social Democrats
led pre-election polls with more than 20 percent of the vote, at
least 5 percent ahead of the second-place Civic Democratic Party of
former premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   At stake Friday and Saturday are all 200 seats in the lower
chamber of the parliament and the chance to form the next Cabinet.
	   Some 8.09 million eligible voters vote for parties, but can move
individual candidates up on the party list by circling their name,
improving their chances of winning a seat.
	   Voting starts at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT) Friday and ends 24 hours
later, with first results expected after polls close Saturday.
	   The elections are being held two years ahead of schedule,
following the ouster of Klaus and his center-right coalition after
a party finance scandal last winter. A caretaker government under
banker Josef Tosovsky has been running the country.
	   Although it was hoped the early elections would break the
stalemate that has stymied Czech politics since 1996, no one
expects any political clarity to emerge from the vote.
	   Even if the leading center-left Social Democrats win by a large
margin, it won't be enough for a clear majority. There is little
chance that their leader Milos Zeman would join with his bitter
rival Klaus in a ``grand coalition'' of left and right.
	   Difficult negotiations to form a coalition will most likely
follow, with President Vaclav Havel playing a key role.
	   Five smaller parties are expected to clear the 5 percent hurdle
needed to get into the parliament, including the old guard
Communists and the extreme Republicans. Both are excluded by all
mainstream parties as possible coalition partners.
	   This leaves only the small Christian Democrats, the Freedom
Union _ a party of center-right rebels favored by Havel _ and the
populist Pensioners for Secure Living as potential partners in the
government.
	   The Social Democrats say their ideal choice would be forming a
coalition with the centrist Christian Democrats who, in turn,
suggest taking on Jan Ruml's Freedom Union.
	   But Ruml, a former dissident and lifelong fighter against
communism, says he would prefer yet another round of early
elections to forming a coalition with a leftist party.
	   That would force the Social Democrats to try and make a
coalition with the Pensioners and tacit support from the
Communists.
	   ``We, like everybody else, are afraid that the outcome of the
elections might be a series of weak, short-term governments,''
Social Democrat deputy Lubomir Zaoralek said this week.
	   The possibility of a left-wing government has financial experts
and foreign investors worried, but analysts said Thursday political
instability and a hung parliament could pose an even bigger threat
to the Czech krouna.

Pope returns this week to face Austria's angry and divided Catholics 
</HEADLINE>

By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Ten years after a tranquil visit to Austria,
Pope John Paul II will return to a nation of angry and divided
Roman Catholics.
	   The frail, 78-year-old pope leaves Friday on the three-day trip
that will include stops in Salzburg, a center of European culture,
and the capital, Vienna.
	   Since the pope's 1988 visit, Catholics in the Alpine nation have
led a movement demanding the church drop its requirement that
priests be celibate, allow women into the priesthood and give
greater voice to lay Catholics. The ``We are the Church'' movement
gathered a half-million signatures in Austria and spread elsewhere
in Europe and to the United States.
	   The Austrian church also has been rocked by sexual scandal. The
pope forced Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, accused of sexually
molesting young boys, to relinquish all his duties in April. Groer
has gone into exile in Germany.
	   Austrian church leaders had been eager to resolve the Groer case
before the pope's visit to avoid potentially embarrassing
demonstrations while John Paul was in the country.
	   Austrian Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, elevated to his post in
February, has taken steps to calm the waters among Catholics, by
Vatican count 77 percent of Austria's eight million people.
	   The pope is scheduled to beatify three people, including a nun,
Sister Restituta Kafka, who was beheaded by the Nazis in 1943.
Beatification is the last formal step before possible sainthood.

World Cup: Zidane criticized all round for expulsion 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: will be UPDATED in afternoon with new information
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Despite qualifying for the second
round, gloom hung over France's camp Friday because the upcoming
suspension of star playmaker Zinedine Zidane and the hamstring
injury of forward Christophe Dugarry could doom their World Cup
future.
	   Thursday's spectacular 4-0 win over Saudi Arabia gave France a
2-point lead over Denmark in Group C and assured the host nation of
advancing. The big question was to what extent its chances of
winning the World Cup had been compromised.
	   Zidane was harshly criticized by his captain and coach for
letting the team down because of his impulsive reaction, kicking an
opponent following a harsh challenge.
	   Zidane will at least be suspended for Wednesday's final Group C
match against Denmark, but with the clampdown on rough play, a more
severe sanction could well be slapped on France's greatest star.
	   It could rule him out of the key second-round match against an
opponent of Group D, where Nigeria currently leads but where Spain
and Bulgaria also still have major chances of advancing.
	   Dugarry tore his right hamstring and will be out for at least
two weeks, which will not allow him to see any action until the
quarterfinals, if France makes it that far.
	   France's other starting forward, Stephane Guivarc'h is trying to
recover from an injured knee and might make the Denmark game. But
his condition is hardly reassuring for a World Cup team short on
strikers.
	   Zidane was sent off by Mexican referee Arturo Brizio Carter for
putting his studs in the side of Saudi captain Fuad Amin as both
fell over one another during a challenge.
	   Despite claims he had no bad intentions, he found little
sympathy within his own ranks.
	   ``This is unforgivable,'' said captain Didier Deschamps. ``Not
only did he punish himself. He also punished the team.''
	   French coach Aime Jacquet agreed. ``He will have to pay the
price for this.''
	   ``All would be great if not for Dugarry's injury. All would be
great if not for Zidane's expulsion,'' said Jacquet, criticizing
his star for a lack of self control.
	   Jacquet did get great help from two upcoming stars though, with
Thierry Henry scoring two and David Trezeguet adding a third strike
in the 4-0 exhibition over Saudi Arabia.
	   Strangely enough, Zindane had already shown early on he was not
his usual self. He missed the easiest of chances early on to open
the score, finding himself alone in front of the Saudi goalie from
10 meters out. Instead he missed badly.
	   On another chance, he just kept waiting until a defender could
block his shot.

Dollar up slightly in early Tokyo trading, stocks drop 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was slightly higher against the yen
in early trading Friday ahead of a meeting this weekend in Tokyo of
world currency officials. Japanese stocks fell.
	   The dollar bought 137.32 yen in early trading, up 0.44 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo but below its rate of 137.83 yen in late New
York trading overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
dropped 121.23 points, or 0.79 percent, to 15,240.31 in the first
30 minutes of trading. On Thursday, the average surged 646.16
points, or 4.39 percent.
	   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers arrived in Tokyo
late Thursday for talks with Japanese officials and a meeting
Saturday with deputy finance ministers and central bankers from the
Group of Seven industrial nations and Asian countries.
	   The meeting was called earlier this week to find ways to end the
yen's recent sharp slide against the dollar that has threatened to
spark new rounds of currency devaluation in the rest of Asia.
	   Japanese newspapers reported Friday that Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto may propose new tax cuts at the meeting as well as
measures to speed up the write-off of some 76 trillion yen (dlrs
555 billion) in bad loans held by his nation's banks.
	   In talks late Thursday night, Summers and Japanese finance
official Eisuke Sakakibara agreed to work together to boost the
yen, the Nihon Keizai financial daily reported. U.S. and Japanese
central banks intervened late Wednesday to halt the yen's slide.
	   Investors will also be keeping a nervous eye on Summers'
meetings Friday with Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami and
Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga.
	   ``It's going to be choppy,'' said Yasuhisa Morikuni, assistant
vice president of financial markets at the Tokyo branch of Bank of
America. ``The dollar's under pressure, and there are a lot of
rumors.''
	   On the stock market, the benchmark index slipped on profit
taking after posting its biggest point gain since Jan. 16 on
Thursday.
	   Until that rise, the Nikkei had fell in tandem with the yen,
hurt by the same pessimism about Japan's economy that plagued the
Japanese currency.
	   But with the yen's rebound at least momentarily stalled,
investors had no fresh reason to buy Tokyo stocks, analysts said.
	   ``The yen's climb has stopped, and there is no further incentive
to push the market sharply higher,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general
manager of the equities operation group at Nikko Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 13.87 points, or 1.16 percent, to 1,184.97.
It jumped 42.00 points, or 3.63 percent, the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.260 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.285 percent, driving its price up to 111.54 yen from 111.36 yen.

	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ In this southwestern French city, a
college town of lively bars and colorful squares that give it the

	   And with good reason, they say. The English are coming.

night, when the alcohol rules took effect just after the South

arrested an English fan linked to the three days of clashes in
Marseille in which 50 people were injured and 80 detained.
	   The suspect, identified by English police as one of about 50
troublemakers from their country, was to be transferred to the
southern port.
	   Marseille authorities planned increased security for Saturday's
match between the Netherlands and South Korea.
	   But regional Prefect Jean-Paul Proust relented on a strict
alcohol ban announced earlier, under pressure from cafe and
restaurant owners who said the measures were ``anti-business.''
	   Proust agreed Thursday to allow alcohol to be sold an hour
later, until midnight, and said cafes and restaurants could remain
open until 4 a.m.

the weekend, starting Friday night.

along with riot police.

consumption of alcohol would be banned on the streets around the
Parc des Princes stadium in western Paris on match days.
	   Bars in the area would be ``asked to close'' on those days, the
police statement said.
	   Alcohol is also banned around the large World Cup viewing
screens built outside City Hall, near the Eiffel Tower and three
other locations, the statement said.
	   Police surveillance of ``at-risk fans,'' train stations,
transport and tourist sites would be increased, the statement said,
without giving figures. Festival of Music shows on the
Champs-Elysees were banned.

	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ In this southwestern French city, a
college town of lively bars and colorful squares that give it the
nickname ``the pink city,'' police are raining on the World Cup's

	   And with good reason, they say. The English are coming.

Wimbledon shuns direct advertising but still makes big money AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ There are no blimps hovering overhead,
no inflated mascots tethered to Centre Court, and billboards are
banned.
	   Wimbledon is one of sport's last advertising-free zones. But
it's also an enormous money-maker.
	   Profits have grown by 10 percent the last five years, with a
record 31 million pounds (dlrs 51 million) generated in 1997 from
the two-week tournament.
	   ``We could make more money in the next two or three years by
selling billboards and advertising out there,'' said Wimbledon
Marketing Director Robert McCowen. ``But we think in the long-term
we'd make less because television would turn around and say we're
now like any other sports event in the world.''
	   Discreet is the byword, which is the only way neighbors in
Wimbledon Village _ a 10-minute walk up Chruch Road from the All
England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club _ would have it.
	   ``Big banks, big drinks companies have offered us seven-figure
sums of money,'' McCowen said. ``They wanted it called the X-Bank
men's final. Once we do that we've devalued everything.''
	   Like the All England Club, Wimbledon village is well-kept,
well-off English. The main shopping street, anchored at each end by
a bank and a pub, is lined with galleries, outdoor cafes, the Ski
Club of Great Britain, and real estate offices.
	   A four-bedroom house can rent for 8,000 pounds (dlrs 13,000) a
month (gardener included) and selling prices are routinely in the
1-2 million-pound (dlrs 1.5-3 million) range.
	   ``It doesn't surprise me there's no advertising at Wimbledon,''
said Dave Hoebeeck, a bartender in the Dome brasserie who grew up
in working-class East London. ``It's all about keeping the place
very quaint, elite.''
	   Most every change to the All England Club has to get the
approval of local government. That includes the new grass on Centre
Court, re-laid for the first time in almost 40 years _ or the
construction completed a year ago of 13,000-seat Court No. 1.
	   Which is why suggestions to build a dome over Centre Court _ or
Court No. 1 _ to beat the rainy England summer never get past the
talking stage.
	   ``In our building, our architecture, there has been quite a lot
of pressure on us,'' McCowen said. ``Quite a lot of the
landscaping... has been imposed to make this look like a very
prestigious estate because there are wealthy homes that look on to
us.''
	   The look of Wimbledon _ lush-green courts squared off by
hedgerows and ivy _ has changed only slightly since the so-called
Open era began in 1968, a year the club made only 37,000 pounds
(dlrs 61,000) in profit _ or ``surplus'' as officials call it.
	   ``It's steeped up since then,'' McCowen said.
	   Just barely breaking even in the last 70s, Wimbledon succumbed
to commercial pressure _ but only slightly.
	   ``There were big sums of money on offer form Coke and Rolex and
we it was thought we could incorporate these two companies very
tastefully without distracting from the image,'' McCowen said.
	   Those two companies _ and nine others _ pay for the right to
advertise as official Wimbledon suppliers but are barely visible
during the tournament itself. The oldest supplier, the tennis ball
maker Slazenger, goes back to 1902.
	   ``We're very cagey, we don't discuss what they pay,'' McCowen
said.
	   Hefty television contracts _ as in most sports _ pay most of the
bills with merchandising, ticket sales and hospitality making up
the rest. Profits go to the Lawn Tennis Association, the governing
body of tennis in England.
	   ``We could get more income if we marketed trash,'' McCowen said.
``There's a lot of money at the bottom of the marketplace. But we'd
kill the goose that laid the golden egg.''

Despite slump, Sampras favored to win fifth Wimbledon title AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ He tends to hang his head, and lately
with good reason. In the battle against burnout, Pete Sampras is
losing.
	   When Wimbledon begins Monday, the four-time champion must try to
shake a lengthy slump. He has failed to reach the semifinals in the
past three Grand Slams and briefly lost the No. 1 ranking to
Marcelo Rios before regaining it.
	   At age 26, Sampras admits he lacks motivation and needs a
vacation. He watches 35-year-old Michael Jordan hold yet another
championship trophy, and like the rest of the world, Sampras
marvels.
	   ``That's one person whose advice I'd love to get,'' he said.
``I'm trying to get it set up to play golf with him and pick his
brain for a little bit and see how he has stayed motivated through
the years.''
	   The golf date must wait. The game Monday will be tennis, and the
opponent will be Dominik Hrabty, a Slovakian ranked 47th with
little experience on grass.
	   They'll play the first Centre Court match at 2 p.m., weather
permitting. Rain plagued last year's tournament, and frequent
showers in the past month have officials fearing a repeat.
	   There's another concern: While tennis struggles to increase its
popularity, the sport's most hallowed event may be overshadowed by
the World Cup.
	   Sampras has other worries.
	   Because he has won Wimbledon four of the past five years,
oddsmakers and opponents agree he remains the man to beat. London
bookies made the American a 6-4 favorite.
	   ``This year has been somewhat of a slump for him, but Wimbledon
is certainly a place where he could dig out of it,'' Andre Agassi
said.
	   ``Maybe he doesn't have the energy for another year here, but I
don't get the feeling he's too concerned about it. That leads me to
believe either he doesn't care, or he's about to play a lot
better.''
	   Burnout isn't an issue for 17-year-old Martina Hingis, an 8-11
favorite to repeat as the women's champion.
	   The top-ranked Hingis caught a break because three teen-age
rivals _ Venus Williams, Serena Williams and Anna Kournikova _ are
grouped together in another part of the draw. At least two of them
will be eliminated before the quarterfinals.
	   In the other half of the bracket, two veterans staging comebacks
hope to reach the final. Injury-plagued seven-time champion Steffi
Graf plans to play her first Grand Slam in more than a year, while
Monica Seles seeks an encore to her surprising second-place showing
at the French Open.
	   The men's field, by contrast, suffers from a dearth of depth.
Boris Becker is absent, Rios hates grass and Agassi last won a
Wimbledon match three years ago. Greg Rusedski and Tim Henman, each
hoping to become the first Brit to win the men's title since 1936,
must play carrying the weight of a nation's expectations.
	   1996 champion Richard Krajicek, the only player to beat Sampras
at Wimbledon in the past five years, poses the biggest threat. But
Sampras has recently shown himself capable of losing to anyone,
including:
	   _ Karol Kucera in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open;
	   _ Wayne Ferreira in the third round at Lipton;
	   _ Fabrice Santoro _ by a stunning 6-1, 6-1 score _ in the third
round at Monte Carlo;
	   _ Ramon Delgado in the second round at the French Open;
	   _ Mark Woodforde in the third round last week at Queen's Club, a
grass-court event.
	   None is a top-20 player.
	   ``Motivation-wise, Pete's not there,'' Woodforde said.
	   ``That's probably pretty accurate,'' Sampras confirmed. ``This
year it's not easy getting motivated each week I play. But I have
no problem getting motivated for Wimbledon. Come 2 o'clock Monday,
it's kind of like coming home.''
	   Sampras blames his burnout on a calf injury in a Davis Cup match
last November. By the time he completed rehabilitation, it was time
for another season to begin.
	   Because he wants to retain the No. 1 ranking, Sampras will wait
until the end of this year to take a break.
	   ``Part of you wants to chill out a little bit,'' he said. ``But
there's nothing I can do about it now.''
	   Perhaps the chance to make history will provide the incentive
that has been missing. A successful fortnight would give Sampras
five Wimbledon titles, matching Bjorn Borg's record, and 11 Grand
Slam crowns, one shy of Roy Emerson's record.
	   In the past, grass has been a cure-all for any Sampras slump.
	   ``It's much more instinctive tennis, and that's why he has been
so successful,'' said his coach, Paul Annacone.
	   ``Pete plays better when it's instinctive and he doesn't have a
lot of time to think about stuff. You hit spots with your serve,
stick volleys and take advantage of second-serve return points.
It's not rocket science.''
	   Because Sampras is best on grass, a Wimbledon defeat would
surely spark speculation that he's washed up. He said he hasn't
considered the possibility and wants to play at least three more
years, then admitted he could be content with 10 major titles.

Asian news media soul-searching after financial crisis 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos BK101-103 of Thursday

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In an industry where one-third of the
work force may be unemployed, some soul-searching could be in
order.
	   No one is saying whether that's why Sondhi Limthongkul _
formerly Thailand's most ambitious press baron _ recently entered
the monkhood at a secluded Buddhist temple in Thailand.
	   But like everyone connected with the press in Thailand and most
of recession-gripped East Asia, Sondhi has much to think about.
	   Did the press fail to properly report the shaky underpinnings of
the Asian boom, indirectly sowing the seeds of its own current
misery? And what will be the long-term effects of the Asian crash
on the media, other than a painful shakeout?
	   ``I think in the future, because of what we are experiencing
today, the public will demand more of the press,'' says Duangkamol
Chartprasert, a journalism professor at Chulalongkorn University in
Bangkok. ``To survive, they will need more quality reporting.''
	   In its heyday, Sondhi's media empire included a regional
English-language daily meant to challenge The Asian Wall Street
Journal, a business monthly, a Los Angeles lifestyle magazine, a
photo agency, a broadcasting satellite concession, and a dozen
Thai-language publications.
	   Today, a skeleton staff of pay-sacrificing loyalists struggles
to put out the three surviving publications of his Manager group.
	   Everywhere the Asian economic miracle has gone sour, the press
has been badly hit. In Thailand, where at least 5,000 workers in
the press sector have been laid off, jobless journalists sell
coffee and food from a Bangkok stall once a week to raise money.
	   Regionwide, advertising revenues are down as much as 60 percent
and costs _ most notably of newsprint _ are up. Devalued currencies
have made paying back offshore loans that financed much of the last
decade's expansion almost impossible.
	   The damage has been the worst in Thailand, Indonesia and South
Korea, the countries hardest-hit by the crisis, and less traumatic
where economies suffered less or where the marketplace is not very
competitive.
	   Indonesia's press, muzzled for decades under former President
Suharto, is enjoying unprecedented openness and popularity. But the
same crisis that helped push Suharto out threatens its prospects.
	   No one is sure how many of the country's 5,600 journalists and
11,000 other media workers have been laid off. But despite radical
cost-cutting, newspapers remain hostage to the high-rising cost of
newsprint.
	   The inability of Asia's governments to come to grips with the
economic crisis has increased the demand for open information. But
the opportunity for more and better reporting comes at a time the
media have fewer resources than ever.
	   ``People want to know why they're suffering and who's paying for
it,'' says Kathy Wilhelm, regional director for Freedom Forum, a
U.S.-based press foundation.
	   In South Korea and Thailand, the press was largely unfettered
but ended up devastated.
	   Korea's newspaper sector expanded beyond reason in the early
1990s, thanks to the coincidence of rapid economic growth and the
easing of controls.
	   Many newspapers invested too much in marketing and production
while diversifying into tourism and real estate _ sectors now
battered. Some 4,150 people, or 11.9 percent of all employees at 70
major Korean media companies, lost jobs between December and April.
	   Many larger media outlets are controlled by chaebol, Korea's
giant industrial conglomerates, feeding a lack of ``impartiality,
accuracy and diversity,'' said a press survey issued in June by the
Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy.
	   ``The media abandoned its duty as a watchdog of society,''
Chong-Hyuk Kim, a reporter for the Joong Ang Daily, said at a
Freedom Forum-sponsored seminar in January.
	   Duangkamol, the Thai journalism professor, says Thailand's press
wasn't aggressive enough during the economic boom to detect the
coming crash.
	   ``The way they did reporting was routine, with no investigation
_ just reporting what politicians said,'' Duangkamol said.
	   The press and the bubble economy _ driven by the speculative
stock and property markets _ had a symbiotic relationship. Many of
the publications now closed were created to cover those sectors.
	   Real estate developers provided the lion's share of newspaper
advertising for many newspapers. The property-sector collapse has
slowed revenues to a trickle.
	   Sondhi was just one of a number of publishers who leveraged
returns from an initial listing on the stock market to finance a
series of increasingly risky ventures. The practice was common
throughout the Thai economy.
	   Says Chavarong Limpattamapanee, secretary-general of the
Reporters Association of Thailand: ``Because the economy was so
good and everybody wanted to expand their businesses and make
money, they put out as many products as possible.''

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With World Cup ticket scandals widening, the head
of the world soccer federation is threatening disciplinary action
and wants to rethink the sales process before the next time around.
	   FIFA president Joseph Blatter spoke Thursday as two more
incidents surfaced _ the theft of thousands of tickets from an
agency under investigation, and word at least some phoned ticket
sales were rigged.
	   ``This whole World Cup ticketing operation must be reviewed for
the next time, in 2002,'' Blatter said on France Info radio. ``But
we need to take action now.''
	   Black market sales, including by national federations who sell
off their surplus tickets, are ``something that shocks us,''
Blatter said. ``Our disciplinary commission has the power to
intervene and even ... to sanction them.''
	   In the latest development, nearly 15,000 World Cup tickets and
hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash were stolen from the Paris
office of an American travel agency, authorities said Thursday.
	   Prime Sport International offered ``no questions asked reward''
of 1 million francs (dlrs 166,000) to recover the tickets that were
stolen overnight. It also promised to reimburse buyers of
undelivered tickets.
	   It was not clear why PSI had such a stockpile of tickets.
Judicial sources said on customary anonymity that the agency was
under investigation after Madrid travel agency complained it never
received more than 1,000 tickets it bought from PSI.
	   Along with the tickets, the thieves made off with 3.3 million
francs (dlrs 550,000) in cash, the company said in a statement.
	   Police sources said the burglars also took access badges to get
into Saint-Denis stadium in Paris.
	   France Telecom, the country's main telephone company, was
investigating a report that one of its workers leaked a phone
number that allowed thousands of World Cup tickets to be bought
unfairly.
	   The tickets were among the 170,000 sold by the World Cup
organizing committee, CFO, on a first-come, first-served basis from
April 22 through May 8.
	   The CFO switchboard was so swamped that most callers had to dial
more than 500 times before getting through. But a France Telecom
worker gave a friend a special number that allowed direct access to
the switchboard, said the daily Le Parisien.
	   The CFO said it would file legal charges if necessary.
	   The revelations came a day after three people _ including the
president of the French affiliate of ISL Worldwide, FIFA's
exclusive marketing partner _ were arrested in a separate
investigation into ticket fraud.
	   The arrests Wednesday were a response to the 12,000 Japanese
fans who were left ticketless for the World Cup.
	   Critics have said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.6 million tickets
printed, more than 962,000 were earmarked for supporters in the
host country, while commercial partners snapped up 436,000.

	   PARIS (AP) _ With World Cup ticket scandals widening, the head
of the world soccer federation is threatening disciplinary action
and wants to rethink the sales process before the next time around.
	   FIFA president Joseph Blatter spoke Thursday as two more
incidents surfaced _ the theft of thousands of tickets from an
agency under investigation, and word at least some phoned ticket
sales were rigged.
	   ``This whole World Cup ticketing operation must be reviewed for
the next time, in 2002,'' Blatter said on France Info radio. ``But
we need to take action now.''
	   Black market sales, including by national federations who sell
off their surplus tickets, are ``something that shocks us,''
Blatter said. ``Our disciplinary commission has the power to
intervene and even ... to sanction them.''
	   In the latest development, nearly 15,000 World Cup tickets and
hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash were stolen from the Paris
office of an American travel agency, authorities said Thursday.
	   Prime Sport International offered ``no questions asked reward''
of 1 million francs (dlrs 166,000) to recover the tickets that were
stolen overnight. It also promised to reimburse buyers of
undelivered tickets.
	   It was not clear why PSI had such a stockpile of tickets.
Judicial sources said on customary anonymity that the agency was
under investigation after Madrid travel agency complained it never
received more than 1,000 tickets it bought from PSI.
	   Along with the tickets, the thieves made off with 3.3 million

Britain gives muted welcome mixed with disgust to au pair's return

<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ It was a drama that riveted millions: A
baby's death, a murder conviction, a surprise reprieve, and an
agonizing wait for an appeal verdict.
	   But the final act unwound quietly as au pair Louise Woodward
returned Thursday to her home and a life that was forever changed.
	   Ms. Woodward's many supporters here wished her and the northern
England village a return to normalcy after her conviction for the
death of the 8-month-old Massachusetts boy in her care. It wouldn't
be easy.
	   Ms. Woodward herself said her life couldn't be the same.
	   ``Of course, not. How could it be?'' she told hundreds of
reporters in her first public comments since the saga began 16
months ago.
	   Her return to Britain followed Tuesday's decision by
Massachusetts' highest court that a lower court judge acted within
his power when he reduced her second-degree murder conviction to
manslaughter and sentenced her to the 279 days she had served since
her arrest.
	   At Manchester Airport, following her overnight journey from
Boston, Ms. Woodward insisted that she did not kill Matthew Eappen
and attacked what she called a ``purely political'' and
``atrocious'' American justice system.
	   She also pledged to clear her name for the Feb. 9, 1997 death of
the little boy.
	   At long last, she said with visible relief, she was back on
British soil. But back in Elton, there were no fireworks and no
parades to welcome her home.
	   It was, in the words of one Elton resident, an anticlimax.
	   The locals remembered all too well the barrage of world
criticism after their raucous champagne celebration when a
Massachusetts judge freed Ms. Woodward in November.
	   ``I think all the bad press made them all keep quiet now,'' said
59-year-old Elton resident Irene Williams.
	   A police escort accompanied Ms. Woodward and her parents into
Elton, where the most visible signs of support were the dozens of
yellow ribbons tied to trees and fences in the village green.
	   Ms. Woodward said the ordeal forced her to grow up.
	   ``I hope it will have changed me for the better, but I guess
only time will tell,'' she said.
	   Ms. Woodward still faces a civil lawsuit filed by Matthew
Eappen's parents. U.S. District Judge William Young barred her
temporarily from spending any money she may earn from selling her
story and set a trial date of Oct. 5. Ms. Woodward vehemently
denied Thursday that she has any plans to sell her story.
	   During the trial and after her murder conviction in October, the
British offered overwhelmingly enthusiastic _ and some say
nationalistic _ support.
	   After the verdict, most national newspapers waged campaigns to
win her freedom and 93 percent of the respondents to a SKY-TV poll
said her trial was unfair.
	   Ms. Woodward arrived home to this front-page headline Thursday
in the tabloid Mirror: ``First Class Child Killer,'' referring to
her high-priced airline flight from the United States.
	   The British press noted Ms. Woodward's homecoming with reserve
Friday, for the most part relegating the story to inside pages
without giving her a hero's welcome.
	   A headline in The Guardian said: ``Two cheers for Woodward,''
while the tabloid Sun, which campaigned heavily for her during the
trial, asked: ``Is Louise innocent or just an Oscar winning
actress?''
	   The Times argued that her trial was fair.
	   ``There will be those who believe ... that American justice is
not what it should be. Ms. Woodward seems to be exploiting that
sentiment for all it is worth,'' the newspaper said.
	   In Elton, meanwhile, the prevailing view was still of an
innocent Woodward. At least half the villagers' battle had been
won: Ms. Woodward was home, albeit as a convicted killer.
	   ``She's at home now. This is what the fight was for,'' said
Christine Gray of the au pair's appeal committee.
	   The few who expressed doubts about her innocence wouldn't give
their names.
	   ``She's a convicted manslaughterer and should not be
celebrated,'' said one middle-aged man.

Summerhays, Jenkins lead Canada Senior Open 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ Bruce Summerhays and Tom Jenkins shot
course-record 7-under-par 65s on Thursday to share the first-round
lead in the Canada Senior Open.
	   ``It's amazing to me to get around this course and not make any
bogeys,'' said Summerhays, who had seven birdies on the Glencoe
course. ``I've got to retire this golf ball, there aren't many
rounds that you have no bogeys. The greens are just about
perfect.''
	   Summerhays, 54, was an assistant pro at The Olympic Club in San
Francisco _ the site of this week's U.S. Open _ from 1968 to 1972.
	   ``My heart is at The Olympic Club, I know all the grass on it,''
said Summerhays, who has one Senior PGA Tour victory. ``It's just
my favorite place ... I'd dearly love to be there, but I'm grateful
to be here, this is where I belong.''
	   Jenkins birdied No. 18 following a lengthy delay because of rain
and lightning. He birdied four of the first five holes, and
finished with nine birdies and two bogeys.
	   ``Putting is the key, if you can start rolling some putts in
early that kind of builds the whole round,'' said Jenkins, a tour
rookie coming off a seventh-place tie last week in Nashville,
Tennessee. ``Last week, I got some confidence and as golf is all
about confidence.''
	   Bobby Stroble was a stroke back at 66, and Walter Hall, Brian
Barnes, Ed Dougherty and Jack Rule Jr. opened with 69s. J.C. Snead
and John Bland topped a 12-player group at 70, and Gary Player was
another stroke back at 71.
	   Dave Stockton and John Jacobs are the only players in the top 10
on the money list in the field. Stockton, No. 7 on the money list,
shot a 72. Jacobs, No. 8 on the list, had a 74.

Pope returns this week to face Austria's angry and divided Catholics

RETRANSMITS to fix slug

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Ten years after a tranquil visit to Austria,
Pope John Paul II will return to a nation of angry and divided
Roman Catholics.
	   The frail, 78-year-old pope leaves Friday on the three-day trip
that will include stops in Salzburg, a center of European culture,
and the capital, Vienna.
	   Since the pope's 1988 visit, Catholics in the Alpine nation have
led a movement demanding the church drop its requirement that
priests be celibate, allow women into the priesthood and give
greater voice to lay Catholics. The ``We are the Church'' movement
gathered a half-million signatures in Austria and spread elsewhere
in Europe and to the United States.
	   The Austrian church also has been rocked by sexual scandal. The
pope forced Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, accused of sexually
molesting young boys, to relinquish all his duties in April. Groer
has gone into exile in Germany.
	   Austrian church leaders had been eager to resolve the Groer case
before the pope's visit to avoid potentially embarrassing
demonstrations while John Paul was in the country.
	   Austrian Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, elevated to his post in
February, has taken steps to calm the waters among Catholics, by
Vatican count 77 percent of Austria's eight million people.
	   The pope is scheduled to beatify three people, including a nun,
Sister Restituta Kafka, who was beheaded by the Nazis in 1943.
Beatification is the last formal step before possible sainthood.

<TEXT>
	   YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) _ Graduate student Satoshi Okada finds
himself at fast-food joints too often these days, hunched over a
calorie-packed meal of teriyaki burgers and fries.
	   The result? He's one of a growing new breed in Japan: the
overweight man.
	   ``In short, I eat a lot,'' said Okada, 22, who's now in a
weight-loss program at his university to shed some of the 87
kilograms (191 pounds) he has amassed on his 170-centimeter
(5-foot-8 frame).
	   Okada's not the only one. Recent studies confirm what meets the
eye: Japanese men, after centuries of staying trim on a lean
cuisine of fish and seaweed, are getting flabby around the middle.
	   The shocker came in May, when the government announced that one
in three Japanese men in their 30s is at least slightly overweight.
Heft is also rising for men in their 20s and 40s.
	   The results were a jolt in Japan, where a scrumptious night out
has traditionally meant slices of raw fish and vinegar-laced rice
instead of filet mignon with potatoes and sour cream.
	   But times are changing, and so is the Japanese palate.
	   McDonald's and local imitators dole out burgers and fries across
the country. Increasingly popular convenience stores sell stacks of
oily ``lunchbox'' meals. Affluence means more beef _ and more
cholesterol.
	   The changes have hit men especially hard. Young women in Japan
are actually getting thinner, from a rash of dieting and _ some
doctors say _ an inactive lifestyle that has led to undereating.
	   But men typically spend their days in rat race jobs, wolfing
down lunch and dinner on the run, then going out after hours with
colleagues and clients to suck down another belly-busting favorite:
beer.
	   Chubby children are a growing concern. Kids rushing from school
to rigorous afternoon and evening cram courses have little time for
proper meals and are increasingly turning to greasy food.
	   ``Once I stopped doing exercise to study for entrance exams, I
started gaining weight,'' Kazuhiro Hatanaka, 19, said after taking
a treadmill test in the same weight-loss program as Okada.
	   The changes, for the most part, are predictable for a country
that has remade itself in just a few decades from a nation of
hard-scrabble farmers to one of white-collar workers with sedentary
jobs and hobbies.
	   Doctors are worried the trend will lead to higher incidences of
the obesity-related sicknesses so prevalent in the West.
	   ``If the Japanese continue this lifestyle, you'll see a lot more
people with diabetes,'' said Dr. Fuminori Katsukawa of the Sports
Medicine Research Center at Keio University in Yokohama, just south
of Tokyo.
	   And while the traditionally salty Japanese diet has caused
hypertension for centuries, high-blood pressure cases these days
are increasingly caused by clogged arteries, he said.
	   Health officials want to stave off the heart problems of other
countries. In 1996, 138,044 Japanese died of heart disease, while
in the United States, with just twice the population, 733,834 died
from heart ailments.
	   For good or bad, signs of Japan's weight gain are everywhere.
	   Big-bellied models pose coquettishly in a fashion magazine.
Clothing stores for big people are opening. Overweight cops in the
northern island of Hokkaido were recently issued orders to lose
weight after a study found 25 percent of them were too fat.
	   Even the venerated sports haven for heavy boys _ sumo _ has come
in for criticism. The head of the Sumo Association recently ordered
wrestlers to slim down, blaming excess weight for an increase in
injuries.
	   Sumo aside, the Japanese have far to go to match obesity in,
say, the United States, where 55 percent of the population is
overweight, according to new standards announced June 3 by the
National Institutes of Health.
	   It's not clear whether overweight Japanese face the same type of
discrimination that big folks grapple with in the United States.
	   Sumo wrestlers, for example, lead glamorous lives and often
marry models and actresses. A recent TV show depicted a sweaty,
obese office worker as an endearing symbol of hard work and
suffering rather than sloth. A young _ and slim _ office woman
falls in love with him.
	   But in the harsh peer pressure world of children and teens,
being the fat boy out can be costly.
	   Masanori Hayashi, 21, said he was so disgusted at 100 kilograms
(220 pounds) that he went on a crash diet five years ago, shedding
30 kilograms (66 pounds) in two months and putting himself in the
hospital.
	   Though he was vague about why he chose such a radical course,
cruel comments by fellow students played a part.

Payne Stewart takes U.S. Open lead with 66 Mickelson finished. AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous; UPDATES with Lehman at 68, Maggert at 69,
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Bobby Jones, who won the U.S. Open four
times, said golf is a match against Old Man Par, and that certainly
was the case in Thursday's first round at The Olympic Club.
	   Par was a very good score on the treacherous Lake Course, and
Payne Stewart won that battle with a sensational
birdie-birdie-birdie finish for a 4-under-par 66.
	   The closing holes were the early key to Olympic as Tom Lehman,
who has known heartbreak at the U.S. Open for three consecutive
years, made birdies on three of the last four holes and shot a 68.
	   Squeezed in between Stewart and Lehman was Mark Carnevale with a
67 and tied with Lehman was another typical first-day U.S. Open
unknown _ Joe Durant.
	   Lingering three shots off the lead were John Daly, Jesper
Parnevik and Jeff Maggert.
	   While precious few players could get under par, a bunch of
big-names put up some big numbers, including Tiger Woods and Jim
Furyk at 74 with David Duval and Ernie Els at 75, the highest of
the 20 U.S. Open rounds Els had played.
	   PGA Championship winner Davis Love III, who is struggling with a
bad back, shot a 41 on the back nine to finish with a 78.
	   ``You know coming here that par is going to be a really good
score,'' Stewart said. ``I took advantage of some breaks out there
today, and that's what you have to do in the U.S. Open.''
	   Among his breaks were a 12-foot (3 1/2 meters) putt to save par
on No. 5 and a 15-foot (4 1/2 meters) par-saver on the ninth hole.
He also made all three of his closing birdies from out of the rough
when he was fortunate enough to get good lies.
	   ``I was lucky I never got into the really deep stuff,'' Stewart
said.
	   Woods found out once again that a key to the U.S. Open is
staying away from Old Man Double Bogey.
	   Cruising along at 2-under par through eight holes, Woods put his
drive on No. 9 in the fairway and his second shot 40 feet (12
meter) from the pin.
	   Four putts later, he had a double bogey _ his fourth in the last
two years at the Open.
	   ``I'm not in that bad of shape,'' Woods insisted, despite being
eight strokes back. ``I'll go to the range and go out tomorrow and
see what I can do.''
	   Only Jack Fleck in 1955 trailed by more than eight strokes after
the first round of the U.S. Open and came back to win. But when
Fleck rallied from a nine-stroke deficit in 1955, it was right here
at Olympic.
	   Colin Montgomerie, whose games seems a perfect fit for Olympic,
closed with two birdies in the final six holes for a 70 along with
Andrew Magee, Masters champion Mark O'Meara and 19-year-old amateur
Matt Kuchar.
	   British Open winner Justin Leonard was at 71 along with Phil
Mickelson, while Fred Couples and Lee Westwood were both at 72.
	   Casey Martin, the first player to ride in a cart at the U.S.
Open, made a par on his first hole, although it started with a
drive in the left rough. Just after leaving the tee, he nearly ran
over a tournament official with his cart.
	   He was among those still on the course.
	   Carnevale got to 3-under par with a long iron from 204 yards
(185 meters) on No. 17 to within inches of the hole.
	   ``I got a little nervous out there,'' Carnevale said. ``It's
been a tough year for me.''
	   Carnevale, 38, is playing in just his second U.S. Open and had
never won on the PGA Tour. He has made only five cuts in 13
tournaments this year and has won less than dlrs 20,000.
	   Lehman was carried along by a wildly supportive gallery clearly
aware that he has played in the final group in the last three U.S.
Opens only to finish third, second and third.
	   ``The galleries were yelling, `Come on, Tom. Win it,''' Lehman
said. ``I just want to put the ball in play and forget about
winning until the 72nd hole. If I can keep playing it this way and
stroking it the way I'm stroking it, I like my chances.''
	   Stewart played like he did in 1989, when he won the PGA
Championship, and in 1991, when he won the U.S. Open.
	   Wearing his trademark knickers, he raised his putter in triumph
and punched his right fist through the air when a 12-foot birdie
fell into the cup on the final hole.
	   ``It really was spectacular,'' Stewart said of his finish.
``Four, three, three is pretty much unheard of on those last three
holes.''
	   No one had made a birdie on the 468-yard (425-meter) 17th hole
when Stewart rolled in a 45-foot (13,5-meter) putt that seemed to
take forever to wiggle its way across the green.
	   Stewart, who has won only once on the PGA Tour since the 1991
U.S. Open, stared in disbelief when the ball disappeared into the
cup.

In U.S. policy gap, American money seeps to Chinese military 
</HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ When Motorola wanted to build a cellular
telephone network in China, it found a partner in the People's
Liberation Army. Prodigy Inc. turned to a premier Chinese defense
contractor to crack China's budding Internet market.
	   While allegations a U.S. satellite maker gave China rocket
technology bedevil U.S. President Bill Clinton before his Beijing
summit next week, a slew of American businesses are quietly trading
the Chinese security establishment a more basic commodity: money.
	   The exchange raises fears that in their eagerness to tap the
China market, U.S. companies may be helping the Chinese military _
the world's largest _ and police modernize and better contain
political dissent.
	   Whether or not U.S. interests have been compromised, the trade
illustrates the pervasive influence of Beijing's powerful military
and police and the industries that serve them and underscores
commerce's dominant role in Clinton's China policy.
	   China's communist leaders have lobbied the Clinton
administration and U.S. firms to transfer ever higher forms of
technology. Defense firms, acutely aware of U.S. military prowess,
have pushed to obtain investment and leading-edge technologies from
abroad.
	   Take Motorola, one of the largest U.S. investors that has sunk
over dlrs 1 billion into China. Known in China for reliable paging
devices, the telecommunications firm agreed last year to build a
state-of-the art cellular network originally designed for military
use. The partner in the project was Beijing Telecom Great Wall,
partly owned by a company run by the People's Liberation Army.
	   Lucent Technologies is building a similar cellular network, and
other U.S. firms are also trading with the security-industrial
complex:
	   _Prodigy, the Internet service provider, pledged last year to
invest dlrs 50 million in a Shanghai venture with Norinco, a
leading producer of tanks and machine guns that was accused of
trying to smuggle AK-47s into the United States two years ago.
Budget problems at home caused Prodigy to quit China a few months
ago, leaving a nearly complete Internet system in place for
Norinco.
	   _Computer Associates, a topflight software maker, last month
struck a deal to develop computer anti-virus technologies with
China Jinchen Security Technology Industry and Commerce Corp., a
commercial arm of the Ministry of Public Security. The ministry
keeps tabs on political dissidents and helps police the Internet
for antigovernment content.
	   Name-brand U.S. companies outside the information technology
field are active too. Federal Express, the express transport firm,
used another Public Security-backed company, EAS, as agents in
building a bridgehead in China.
	   Fedex earlier this month chose not renew its service agreement
with EAS after what David Clarke, a spokesman for the U.S. company,
called a ``very profitable relationship'' for the past three years.
He said EAS' police ties did not influence the contract decision.
	   Executives with the American firms and U.S. business lobbyists
rejected the notion that anything is amiss. They say they are
following normal business practices and that working with
government-backed firms, military or otherwise, is unavoidable in
China.
	   ``The separation between government and business in China is
relatively blurred because they're going through a major
transition,'' said Philip Carmichael, vice chairman of the American
Chamber of Commerce's China chapter.
	   In selling an advanced cellular network, Motorola had to deal
with the People's Liberation Army because it controls the needed
radio frequency.
	   Although one U.S. diplomat described the system as ``well-suited
for military applications'' _ almost impossible to jam or intercept
_ Motorola vice president Tom Hinton said the technology has been
installed in over 50 countries.
	   ``I can see no way that this would be helping the military
progress their communications capabilities,'' Hinton said.
	   Still the telecommunications, computer virus and Internet deals
comes as the cash-strapped and largely low-tech PLA girds to fight
what it sees as information warfare in the 21st century.
	   ``Defense and commercial products are becoming more
compatible,'' General Ding Henggao, former head of a commission
coordinating military and civilian research, wrote in an essay
translated by a Pentagon scholar last year. ``We must study ...
possible transfers from commercial technology to defense use.''

Stars make Israel radio announcer a star with the Arabs BY SALAH NASRAWI 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo NY305
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Even as Arabs and Israelis trade insults,
and sometimes gunshots, listeners around the Arab world are tuning
in to an Israel radio program. Maybe it's in the stars.
	   Ibrahim Hazboun's horoscope show opens every Friday with a theme
of smooth jazz just after a nightly news report on the Voice of
Israel's Arabic service that rarely brings listeners good news
about prospects for peace.
	   After reading a weekly forecast according to the 12 signs of the
zodiac, Hazboun takes international telephone calls in the
station's studios in Jerusalem.
	   ``I am a Cancer ... any chance that I will get married to
someone who lives abroad, because I dream of living somewhere
else'' comes the soft voice of a young Egyptian woman who
identifies herself only as Dalal.
	   ``No,'' Hazboun answers sympathetically after a little
pondering. ``Your star says you are a domestic person; you cannot
live away from your family.'' Hazboun's advise: stick to Egypt.
	   For about an hour, Hazboun advises a stream of callers hoping to
fathom what the stars have in store.
	   The large following of his ``World of Stars'' program is a small
sign that the suspicion and even hatred that Arabs and Israelis
have felt for each other for decades doesn't affect every issue.
	   ``I, myself, have no political agenda but I think such ways of
contacts improve understanding between Arabs and the Israelis,''
Hazboun, a 50-year-old Israeli Arab, said in a telephone interview.
	   Along with his staying away from politics, one reason the
program succeeds is the absence of competition. Arab radio stations
do not air horoscope programs because Islam bans fortune telling
and astrology.
	   Most of Hazboun's callers are from Jordan and Egypt, the only
Arab nations with diplomatic ties and direct telephone links to
Israel.
	   But he says listeners from other countries, such as Iraq, Syria
and Lebanon, travel to Jordan to make calls, in some cases risking
the death penalty on charges of contacting an enemy state. Others
write to him at a post office box in Switzerland.
	   Hazboun, a long-time broadcaster with the Arabic service at the
Voice of Israel, said he receives about 700 letters every week,
some from as far away as Libya and Saudi Arabia.
	   Most questions he answers relate to travel, love, business and
health. Only a few seek political predictions, and Hazboun says he
tries to avoid answering these.
	   He recalls, though, that he did answer questions about the
horoscopes of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and the state of Israel,
noting both were born under the Taurus sign associated with strong
personalities.
	   Israel ``has all the characteristics of the Taurus ... strong
and determined and undefeatable,'' he said.
	   On Saddam, he told a caller that a Taurus-born man's personality
also can be shaped by his upbringing, adding: ``So they can be
strong, stubborn, aggressive or even brutal.''
	   Hazboun's program began in 1993 after his bosses spotted him
advising colleagues on their futures. He has dabbled in astrology
for years, saying he even consulted his and his wife's horoscopes
before marrying; he calls their marriage ``perfect.''
	   For every one of Hazboun's callers, there are many Arabs who
still see contacts with Israelis as taboo. They say normal
relations are anathema until Israel gives back territories seized
from Arabs during the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Hazboun's program is ``the worst kind of normalization with the
enemy who still occupies our land,'' said Ali Oqla Orsan, head of
the Arab Writers Union, based in Damascus, Syria.
	   ``This is a trap and an instrument to infiltrate the Arab mind
which every Arab should resist.''

	   BALJVINE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Rising from a jumble of
village ruins, the lone minaret left in the Serb-controlled half of
Bosnia presides over a ghostly scene of hatred and destruction.
	   The shell of a bombed-out mosque stands beside it, rain
splattering off smashed beams and broken glass that litter the
floor where men once kneeled to pray.
	   Scrawled in blue letters on the front facade, an obscenity aimed
at Serbs confronts the rare visitors venturing to the top of a
steep, dead-end road. ``You'll pay for all this,'' the graffiti
adds.
	   Yet against this grim backdrop, new life is slowly taking root
among the rubble in Baljvine, just as it is elsewhere across a
divided postwar Bosnia.
	   Refugees are trickling back to risk an uncertain future, even if
obstacles or limited prospects keep most away. A shaky peace has
held since the end of 1995, strained sporadically by ethnic riots.
	   Serbs, Croats and Muslims travel freely across each other's
lands, ``shielded'' by Bosnia's new, generic license plates that
don't reveal an owner's ethnicity, and other small steps toward
pluralism have been taken.
	   There are no illusions after a war that killed an estimated
200,000 people _ a return to a united, multi-ethnic society won't
happen in this generation, if ever. Without the muscle of 34,000
NATO soldiers who patrol the country, most believe the stability
would quickly collapse.
	   Still, this is progress.
	   ``I don't expect we will have a real mixed population, or a high
level of human rights, in Bosnia in the next 15 years,'' said
Mladen Ivanic, a leading independent politician who could be the
Bosnian Serbs' next leader. ``And it will never, never, never be
like before the war.
	   ``But it's much better than two years ago,'' he said in Banja
Luka, the administrative center of Bosnia's Serb Republic. ``Things
are going much better than a lot of us expected.''
	   Trying to ensure that a carved-up Bosnia gets a peaceful and
democratic new start, foreign powers have focused much of their
pressure on the Serb Republic, which comprises 49 percent of
Bosnia's land. It was here that many of the war's worst atrocities
were committed in the fanatical push for an ethnically pure state.
	   A drive across the Serb territory's gently rolling hills and
spectacular canyons makes graphically clear the enormous, perhaps
impossible, task of rebuilding a successful civil society.
	   Mile after mile (kilometer after kilometer) of destroyed houses,
blown up so their inhabitants would never return, keep ethnic
hatreds boiling. Factories stand ruined or idle _ unemployment is
40 percent nationwide.
	   Serb towns and hamlets are squeezed even worse than those in the
Muslim-Croat half of the country because of international
condemnation that many Serbs feel singles them out unfairly.
	   But Western officials point to several positive changes in the
Serb Republic since the hard-line leadership was replaced by a more
moderate government last fall. However subtle, they add up to a
step forward:
	   _Attacks on the small percentage of remaining or returning
Muslims and Croats have dwindled.
	   _Under the new leadership, Bosnian Serb media have softened
their aggressive, ultranationalist tone.
	   _The new license plates free of ethnic labels have been adopted
unexpectedly swiftly by the Serbs, indicating their support for
freedom of movement.
	   _Muslim-run companies from Sarajevo were represented at a recent
business fair in Banja Luka.
	   The next big test comes in September with general elections for
all three of Bosnia's ethnic groups. Results may determine the
success or failure of the resettlement process, now stalled by
wrangling over the fate of tens of thousands of people occupying
refugees' homes.
	   ``This election is crucial,'' said Simon Haselock, aide to
Carlos Westendorp, Bosnia's international administrator under the
peace accord. ``It's a litmus test of the peace process.''
	   For Muslims, real progress won't be visible until the Serbs
allow the rebuilding of some, any, of the more than 200 mosques
blown up in the 1992-95 war _ as were hundreds of Croat Roman
Catholic and Serbian Orthodox religious sites.
	   The obliteration of one in particular, the majestic 400-year-old
Ferhadija Mosque in Banja Luka, remains for many a painful symbol
of the war's finality.
	   The Muslims' latest bid to reconstruct it was quashed this
spring by hard-line Mayor Djordje Umicevic, who said in an
interview that building it now would ``spoil the good moment'' in
the peace process.
	   Today the mosque is only a postcard on the wall for the elderly
men who gather daily in an office building behind the Ferhadija
site, now an empty grass-covered lot. Outside the room where they
pray are pieces of shattered pillars from the ancient mosque.
	   ``What can our rights be when they don't allow us to rebuild
what they destroyed?'' asked Amzalaja Kapetanovic, secretary of the
Islamic Community.
	   And yet, typical of Bosnia's mixed picture of pragmatism and
despair, many Muslims privately acknowledge the time may not be
right to erect an ethnic landmark that could strain improving
relations.
	   ``The atmosphere is better,'' said Kapetanovic. ``No one attacks
you now. How it's going to be after the international peacekeepers
leave, I don't know.''
	   Quietly and cautiously, refugees are testing this atmosphere,
coming back to look at what they lost. Some are defying common
sense and staying, like 10 Muslim families who returned to Baljvine
in northwestern Bosnia, where they are living in half-destroyed
houses or building new ones on top of the ruins.
	   Starting over means putting faith in war-time enemies for
Muslims like Saban Habibovic, who came back to Baljvine with his
wife and 7-year-old son after fleeing in 1995.
	   ``I don't blame anyone,'' said the carpenter, whose new home
looks out on the wreckage of the mosque and village.
	   ``The Muslims here are in a good situation _ everybody accepts
us. We just need some help.''

<TEXT>
	   Under the peace plan signed in December 1995, Bosnia-Herzegovina
is supposed to be a loosely unified federal state with parliament
and three-person presidency _ one representative each from Muslim,
Serb and Croat communities.
	   In practice, administrations of Bosnia's two halves _
Muslim-Croat Federation, covering 51 percent of the territory, and
Bosnian Serb Republic, covering 49 percent _ are much stronger than
federal structure.
	   Ethnic nationalists in power during the war still hold sway,
paralyzing decision-making at federal level. Thus, international
community's administrator, who effectively is Bosnia's chief
official under peace accord, recently imposed common currency,
flag, coat of arms and car plates devoid of ethnic symbols.
	   Before 1992-95 war, 4.3 million people lived in Bosnia: 44
percent Muslim, 31 percent Serb, 17 percent Croat. No census
conducted since, but population estimated at 4 million, about half
displaced people or refugees.

Indonesia offers new proposals on East Timor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Indonesia's foreign minister met Thursday
with Secretary-General Kofi Annan and offered new proposals on East
Timor which a U.N. spokesman said could mark an important
development in resolving the dispute over the former Portuguese
colony.
	   The United Nations refused to disclose details over the
proposals presented by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.
	   But U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said they marked ``an important
development'' in negotiations over East Timor, which Indonesia
invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year.
	   Eckhard said the U.N. special envoy on East Timor, Jamsheed
Marker, would visit Portugal this month and Indonesia in July to
follow up on the new Jakarta proposals.
	   The U.N. General Assembly never recognized Indonesia's
annexation of the territory. The United Nations has been trying
since 1983 to help find a solution.
	   Portugal wants a referendum to decide East Timor's status. But
Indonesia has insisted that East Timor is an integral part of its
national territory.
	   East Timorese activists have been stepping up their campaign for
independence in the wake of the resignation of President Suharto,
who ordered the invasion of the half-island territory.
	   His successor, B.J. Habibie, has pledged democratic reform but
has ruled out a referendum in East Timor. Habibie, has released
some but not all east Timorese political prisoners.
	   Among those still in prison is Xanana Gusmao, a separatist rebel
leader who was arrested in 1992. Habibie has said he is considering
the release of Xanana, although many in the military would
disapprove of such a move.

Japan, U.S. officials hold talks on yen, Asian economy

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two days after intervening in world currency
markets to prop up the sagging yen, U.S and Japanese officials were
meeting Friday to discuss revitalizing Japan's recession-plagued
economy and boost growth in Asia.
	   Visiting U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers held
talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, the first in a
series of meetings with senior Japanese government officials
throughout the day.
	   ``We had good discussions,'' Summers told reporters after the
meeting. ``The United States and Japan share a very strong interest
in a return to sustained growth in the Asian continent.''
	   Summers was also scheduled to hold meetings Friday with Bank of
Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami and Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga.
	   In a meeting late Thursday, Summers and Japan's vice finance
minister for international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, stressed the
need for close cooperation to stabilize both the yen and regional
currencies, the Nihon Keizai economic daily reported Friday.
	   Summers and other U.S. finance officials were hastily dispatched
to Tokyo after the yen plummeted this week to an eight-year low
against the U.S. dollar, raising fears of another bout of currency
devaluations around Asia.
	   The United States and Japan intervened to halt the yen's
free-fall on Wednesday, buying up the currency and pushing the
dollar down more than 5 yen from the previous day's levels in
Tokyo.
	   Summers and Sakakibara also agreed that structural reform in
Japan's financial sector was essential to restoring calm to the
currency market, the newspaper said.
	   Early Friday, Sakakibara told reporters that his talks with
Summers had been ``informal'' and that he could not comment on
them.
	   On Thursday, Hayami held talks with the president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, William McDonough, who accompanied
Summers on his visit, the Nihon Keizai said.
	   Hayami told McDonough that the BOJ has ordered banks to publicly
disclose their estimates of bad-asset burdens, the newspaper
reported.
	   Shortly before Summers arrived in Tokyo on Thursday, Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a nationally televised press
conference that Japan's economy would recover after the government
implements its latest stimulus plan.
	   He also pledged to come up with a program to clean up the
serious problem of bad loans at the nation's banks.
	   Declining financial markets and worries about banks had severely
discouraged consumers, Hashimoto said, conceding that his
government's decision to raise the nation's sales tax last year had
hurt the economy.
	   ``Japan has fallen into a state of excessive lack of
confidence,'' Hashimoto said. ``These are very hard times.''
	   Japan will also host a meeting in Tokyo on Saturday of finance
officials from around the world to discuss the Asian economic
situation.
	   Finance officials from the Group of Seven _ Britain, Canada,
France, Italy, Japan, Germany and the United States _ are expected
to attend along with as many as 22 senior officials from the
``Manila Framework Group'' of Asian countries.
	   Representatives from the International Monetary Fund, the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank were also expected to attend.

ASEAN ministers meet to harness forces for haze battle plan 
</HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN DRAKE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Rescheduled because of recent political turmoil
in Indonesia, a one-day meeting of Southeast Asian environment
ministers began Friday as the start of the dry season brought
renewed risk of fires and haze.
	   In opening remarks to ASEAN environment leaders gathering for
the fourth time to discuss the clouds of smoke that have plagued
the region, Singapore's Environment and Health Minister Yeo Cheow
Tong said Southeast Asia could hardly afford ``another fire and
haze disaster.''
	   ``A repeat of this disaster will surely aggravate the already
bad regional economic situation,'' Yeo told ministers from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN.
	   Non-governmental organizations have put a hefty price tag on
fires that swept through millions of hectares (acres) of Indonesian
jungle last year, leaving Southeast Asians from the Philippines to
Malaysia choking in the haze, and wiping out rare species.
	   Conservative estimates put the cost at about dlrs 4.5 billion,
though with the huge influx of greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere, the global toll may have been even greater.
	   ``The decisions we make today will be crucial as we approach the
dry season,'' Yeo warned his counterparts at the start of the
meeting.
	   He said earlier this month that ASEAN _ which groups Brunei,
Burma, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia
and Thailand _ is expected to implement specific mechanisms to
prevent another severe bout of haze during or shortly after the
current meeting.
	   Prevention is likely to be the focus of discussions Friday,
since the ability to adequately fight the fires once they spread is
limited. Debate over the long-term rain forecasts for the region
continue, with no consensus on exactly when El Nino will end nor
how much precipitation its aftereffects might bring.
	   Yeo noted that ``over the past few days, fires have already been
detected in some parts of Sumatra,'' the Indonesian island where
fires burnt out of control last year.
	   Plantation owners and farmers clearing their land by traditional
slash and burn practices, in addition to dry conditions exacerbated
by a particularly bad El Nino, are blamed for the conflagration
there and in Kalimantan island to the east.
	   Yeo added that Indonesian, Malaysian and Singaporean officials
have met separately on two occasions since the last ASEAN haze
meeting, and plan to present recommendations to prevent fires
specifically on Sumatra.
	   The ministers are also expected to focus on implementing a
broader regional action plan to prevent and fight the fires and
haze.

Stakes are high, but many believe new Russian tax chief will deliver 
</HEADLINE>

By MITCHELL LANDSBERG
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Until now, Russia has been a great exception to
the old adage about the certainties of life. Russians couldn't
cheat death, but taxes were another matter.
	   That was before the latest economic crisis and the appointment
of Boris Fyodorov as the country's tax chief.
	   Like his predecessors, Fyodorov, a former finance minister and
investment banker, has pledged to make life difficult for tax
dodgers, who vastly outnumber Russia's few taxpayers.
	   What sets him apart is that many people believe him.
	   ``He's an enormously strong person,'' economist Anders Aslund
says. ``If you appoint Boris Fyodorov the head of the tax
authority, then you are serious.''
	   The consensus is that President Boris Yeltsin was quite serious
_ and perhaps desperate _ when he appointed Fyodorov. Western
economists and bankers have been telling Yeltsin for years that he
couldn't rebuild the economy without collecting taxes, but it took
a scary market crash and the threat of serious social unrest to
prod the president into action.
	   The man he picked has long held a reputation in Russia as a
tough, brilliant and arrogant advocate of liberal market reforms,
whose resume includes a stint at the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
	   Now, if Fyodorov can deliver, he could transform Russia's
economy _ and with it, perhaps, Russian society.
	   To succeed, Fyodorov must instill respect for the law and prove
no one is above it. That would be a huge accomplishment in a
country where the law has always been applied flexibly, depending
on one's status.
	   Already, Fyodorov has begun weeding out corrupt members of his
staff. Russian television has shown black-hooded tax commandos
raiding shops, confiscating goods and leading away frightened
merchants in handcuffs.
	   Fyodorov caused a buzz when he was quoted as saying he was
preparing a list of the 1,000 richest Russians and intended to
begin his efforts with them. Later, he backed off somewhat, saying
he wasn't preparing a list _ but added he still planned to go after
the rich.
	   ``The principle is quite simple,'' he said. ``We will start with
the prominent people. First, it will be 1,000. Then, it will be 1
million. Then, it will be everyone.''
	   Simple, perhaps, but in a society where the new rich wield
substantial power, where many rich people got their money through
dubious means and business executives are still periodically rubbed
out by rivals, it's a bold and potentially dangerous approach.
	   That doesn't seem to bother Fyodorov, a stocky 40-year-old who
exudes brash confidence.
	   ``He's a man who's not afraid of anything,'' says Aslund, a
senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
who says he knows Fyodorov well.
	   The notion of filing tax returns is new to most Russians. Since
all salaries were paid by the state in the Soviet era, tax returns
were unnecessary. Taxes were, in a sense, an unspoken part of every
salary.
	   Now that most Russians are paid by private or quasi-private
enterprises, the government is trying to collect taxes, both from
individuals and businesses. But last year, only about 5 million of
the country's 147 million citizens paid income taxes.
	   Worse, many of the nation's largest corporations are tax
delinquents, including its biggest company, the natural gas
monopoly Gazprom.
	   The reasons for Russians' noncompliance are pretty simple.
	   To begin with, there is ``this sort of total nihilism, this idea
of, `Why should I pay the government anything _ they're just a
bunch of crooks,''' observes Chris Granville, head of strategy for
Moscow's Fleming-UCB investment bank.
	   There's nothing uniquely Russian about that. What is different
is how easy it has been for Russian tax delinquents to get away
with it.
	   ``We are a country where, for years, the authorities pretended
that they were collecting taxes and the people pretended they were
paying,'' Fyodorov joked at a recent news conference.
	   Many economists, here and in the West, believe tax collection is
the key to Russia's economic growth.
	   Others contend the government has plenty of money already _ it
just needs to spend it better. Total government revenues last year
amounted to 32 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
	   ``Compared to Western Europe, that's quite low,'' notes
Granville. But it is high for a ``transitional'' economy, and
almost exactly the same as the ratio in the United States.
	   Fyodorov's goals, at the outset, seem modest enough: He wants to
raise the number of taxpayers from 5 million to 8 million next
year.
	   In a country where huge chunks of the economy have scurried
underground, the obstacles are enormous.
	   ``Everybody knows that in our country, in companies, nobody gets
paid a salary,'' Fyodorov says. ``Some presidents of banks make an
official salary of dlrs 300 (1,800 rubles) a month.''
	   He smiles a bit. ``I have sent telegrams to all the banks saying
I am not going to be friends with those who pay their salaries in
such a way.''
	   Of course, if he does his job well, Fyodorov may find friendship
isn't among his perks.
	   He may have to settle for respect.

Lehman gets game turned around in first round of Open AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ According to Tom Lehman, it is not torment
to take the lead into the final round of the U.S. Open for three
years in a row and then fall short. Torment is a three-putt from
four feet.
	   That's what he dealt with Thursday at The Olympic Club, taking a
double bogey on the 10th hole and knowing he'd better get moving if
he wanted to have a chance to be around Sunday.
	   ``It made me feel like I'd better not mess up any more holes
coming in,'' Lehman said.
	   Major championships, as the saying goes, are not won in the
first round, only lost. And even if Olympic doesn't suit Lehman's
game as well as other venues, the U.S. Open always seems to suit
him fine.
	   Lehman played the final eight holes in 4-under, including
birdies on three of the last four holes, that put him at 2-under 68
and just two strokes back of leader Payne Stewart.
	   ``It's only the first round,'' Lehman said. ``This is a very,
very, very hard golf course. This may be the most difficult course
for me. I'm not saying I can't play well, but it requires my very
best golf.''
	   Lehman, who won the 1997 British Open amid his U.S. Open
disappointments, hasn't won in America since the season-ending Tour
Championship in 1997.
	   The third close call at the U.S. Open seemed to take a toll on
him. Lehman was tied with Ernie Els until his 7-iron bounded into
the water on the 17th hole at Congressional last year.
	   Since then, Lehman never really worked himself into contention,
the main culprit being his putter.
	   But he met with noted golf teacher Jim Flick three weeks ago and
began seeing immediate improvement.
	   ``I was using my eyes better to visualize the putts,'' Lehman
said.
	   He played well at Memorial, finishing tied for 11th, then was
third last week at the rain-shortened Buick Classic.
	   All Lehman saw on the 10th green was a huge spike mark between
his ball and the hole, a measly four feet away. Lehman ran it by 3
1/2 feet (1 meter), missed that one, then had to hole a 3-footer
(0.9 meters) to save double bogey.
	   ``The 10th wasn't my best effort, but I managed to survive,''
Lehman said.
	   And he always seems to have an answer. He birdied the par-4 11th
from 15 feet (4 1/2 meters), then saved par with a 10-foot
(3-meter) putt on No. 12 after missing the green.
	   On both putts, Lehman said he got a perfect read from Steve
Jones, his good friend who beat him by one stroke at the 1996 U.S.
Open at Oakland Hills.
	   While the closing holes destroyed the rounds of so many others
Thursday, Lehman thrived. He holed a bending, 30-foot (9-meter)
putt for birdie on the 15th, hit a 9-iron into 12 feet (3 1/2
meters) for birdie on the par-5 16th and closed out his comeback
with a wedge into six feet (1.8 meters) on No. 18.

Mahathir attacks West, denies cronyism 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister on
Friday accused foreign powers of trying to ruin the country and
denied that cronyism and nepotism had hurt the economy.
	   Blaming foreign companies for preying on Malaysian companies
weakened by the Asian economic crisis, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad urged ruling party members at their annual convention to
deflect these attacks.
	   Mahathir dismissed attacks of crony capitalism in Asian nations,
saying Malaysians should not be influenced by Western propaganda
and by marauding market forces.
	   ``Rightly, the development process of the Malays, migrating from
farmers to entrepreneurs and educated traders, ought to continue,''
Mahathir told some 2,000 delegates at the United Malays National
Organization general assembly.
	   ``However it seems there are quarters who will not allow this.
We are pushed to become a backward, weak race, that is recolonized
and having to serve others,'' he said. ``They are trying to destroy
all that we have built.''
	   Mahathir's comments at the first party conference since Malaysia
has slid into a deep economic crisis come amid rumbles of criticism
about his style of governance.
	   At the opening of the assembly Thursday, some delegates cheered
the youth leader who spoke out against corruption and nepotism
within the party which, he said, could erode the party's unrivaled
grip over Malaysian politics.
	   If the criticisms during the assembly, which runs through
Sunday, become louder, Mahathir, 72, could find his 17-years of
unchallenged rule threatened.
	   For the first time since the Asian contagion began battering the
economy one year ago, sending the currency and stock markets
crashing, Malaysia posted a negative growth rate of 1.8 percent in
the first quarter of 1998. That compared with a robust 6.9 percent
growth in 1997.

Indonesia offers new proposals on East Timor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Indonesia's foreign minister met with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and offered new proposals on East
Timor which a U.N. spokesman said could mark an important
development in resolving the dispute over the former Portuguese
colony.
	   The United Nations refused Thursday to disclose details over the
proposals presented by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.
	   But U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said they marked ``an important

invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year.
	   Eckhard said the U.N. special envoy on East Timor, Jamsheed

	   The U.N. General Assembly never recognized Indonesia's

who ordered the invasion of the half-island territory.
	   His successor, B.J. Habibie, has pledged democratic reform but
has ruled out a referendum in East Timor. Habibie, has released
some but not all east Timorese political prisoners.
	   Among those still in prison is Xanana Gusmao, a separatist rebel
leader who was arrested in 1992. Habibie has said he is considering
the release of Xanana, although many in the military would
disapprove of such a move.

Stewart takes U.S. Open lead with 66 AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Tway and Olazabal in at 68
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Tom Lehman knows how difficult it is to
close out a U.S. Open. Three times he has failed. At The Olympic
Club, others went to finishing school.
	   Lehman handled it, making three birdies in the last four holes
for a 68 along with Bob Tway, who finished Thursday with eight
consecutive pars, and Jose Maria Olazabal.
	   Payne Stewart was up to the task, closing birdie-birdie-birdie
to take the first-round lead at 4-under-par 66.
	   And Mark Carnevale managed to make a spectacular birdie on No.
17 to slip in between Stewart and Lehman with a 67.
	   But many others failed the test, letting good rounds slip away
over the final holes.
	   ``That's the beauty of the U.S. Open,'' David Duval said after
four bogeys in the final eight holes led to a 75. ``You're never so
happy as when you're done. There's no letup.''
	   Tiger Woods made bogeys on Nos. 16 and 17 and shot a 74. Steve
Pate was 2-under par with three holes to play but finished
bogey-bogey-double bogey and shot a 72. Tom Kite let a 2-under par
round slip away with a double bogey on No. 16 and was at even-par
70.
	   Joe Durant, who shot a 69, finished with bogeys on two of the
last three holes.
	   ``You know coming here that par is going to be a really good
score,'' Stewart said. ``I took advantage of some breaks out there
today, and that's what you have to do in the U.S. Open.''
	   Among his breaks were a 12-foot (3 1/2 meter) putt to save par
on No. 5 and a 15-foot (4 1/2 meters) par-saver on the ninth hole.
He also made all three of his closing birdies from out of the rough
when he was fortunate enough to get good lies.
	   Lingering three shots off the lead were John Daly, Jesper
Parnevik and Jeff Maggert at 69, one stroke under par.
	   And while precious few players could get under par, a bunch of
big-names put up some big numbers, including Jim Furyk at 74, Ernie
Els at 75, the highest of his 20 U.S. Open rounds, and Nick Faldo
at 76.
	   PGA Championship winner Davis Love III, who is struggling with a
bad back, shot a 41 on the back nine to finish with a 78.
	   Colin Montgomerie was at 70, along with Andrew Magee, Masters
champion Mark O'Meara and 19-year-old amateur Matt Kuchar.
	   Casey Martin, the first player to ride in a cart at the U.S.
Open, nearly ran over a tournament official with his cart after he
left the first tee. He was even par through nine holes and it was
not clear if he would finish before dark.
	   Lehman was carried along by a wildly supportive gallery clearly
aware that he has played in the final group in the last three U.S.
Opens only to finish third, second and third.
	   ``The galleries were yelling, `Come on, Tom. Win it.''' Lehman
said. ``I just want to put the ball in play and forget about
winning until the 72nd hole. If I can keep playing it this way and
stroking it the way I'm stroking it, I like my chances.''
	   Stewart played like he did in 1989, when he won the PGA
Championship, and in 1991, when he won the U.S. Open.
	   Wearing his trademark knickers, he raised his putter in triumph
and punched his right fist through the air when a birdie fell into
the cup on the final hole.
	   ``It really was spectacular,'' Stewart said of his finish.
``Four, three, three is pretty much unheard of on those last three
holes.''
	   No one had made a birdie on the 468-yard (425-meter) 17th hole
when Stewart rolled in a 45-foot (13.5-meter) putt that seemed to
take forever to wiggle across the green.
	   Stewart stared in disbelief when the ball disappeared into the
cup. Then, he did a wiggling dance of his own to celebrate.
	   Carnevale got to 3-under par with a long iron from 204 yards
(185 meters) on No. 17 to within inches of the hole. Carnevale, 38,
has made only five cuts in 13 tournaments this year and has won
less than dlrs 20,000.
	   The USGA came into the Open threatening to ban high-tech clubs,
but it didn't have to take the driver out of Daly's bag. The course
did it instead. Playing with no driver because the 6,797-yard
(6,185-meter) course is so short, Daly turned the front nine at
2-over par, then shot a 32 on the back side.
	   Cruising along at 2-under par through eight holes, Woods played
the final 10 holes six over par, beginning with a four-putt on No.
9. Only Jack Fleck in 1955 trailed by more than eight strokes after
the first round of the U.S. Open and came back to win.

<TEXT>
	   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) _ Aaron Sele became the American League's
first 10-game winner and the Texas Rangers took advantage of
Oakland starter Tom Candiotti's wildness to end a three-game losing
streak with a 3-2 victory Thursday.
	   Sele (10-4) allowed six hits in 6 2-3 innings. The right-hander
issued a career-high seven walks and hit a batter, but hung on to
give the Rangers a badly needed boost. Texas starters were 1-5 with
a 7.58 ERA in their previous seven games.
	   John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 20th save.
	   Candiotti (4-9) lost his fifth consecutive start, allowing three
runs and four hits in five innings. He walked six and had two wild
pitches and an error as the A's had their four-game winning streak
snapped.
 &UR; Royals 5, Tigers 3 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Jeff King hit a two-run double and Dean Palmer
homered as Kansas City got its fourth win in five games.
	   King doubled in a three-run fifth inning that gave the Royals a
4-1 lead and ended Tigers left-hander Justin Thompson's
second-shortest start of the season.
	   Pat Rapp (6-6) gave up two runs and eight hits in six-plus
innings, and Jeff Montgomery got three outs for his 13th save.
	   Thompson (5-7) lasted just 4 1-3 innings, allowing four runs and
nine hits. He is 0-5 with a 5.29 ERA at home this season.
 &UR; Yankees 5, Indians 2 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Scott Brosius' bases-loaded walk started a
three-run ninth inning that lifted New York over Cleveland.
	   It was the Yankees' first appearance at Jacobs Field since
losing Game 5 of the AL division series last October, and the
second meeting between the division leaders this season.
	   After Brosius was walked by Mike Jackson, Chuck Knoblauch
singled off first baseman Jim Thome's glove for one run, and
another run scored on the play when second baseman David Bell threw
wildly trying to get Knoblauch at first.
	   Jeff Nelson (4-3) got the final out in the eighth, and Mariano
Rivera pitched the ninth for his 15th save.
 &UR; Red Sox 7, Devil Rays 5, 10 innings &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Troy O'Leary's two-run triple off
Jim Mecir in the 10th inning gave Boston a victory over Tampa Bay.
	   John Wasdin (4-3), the fourth of five Red Sox pitchers, worked
one perfect inning to get the victory. Tom Gordon pitched the 10th
to earn his 21st save in 22 opportunities.
	   O'Leary tripled into the gap in left-center to drive in
pinch-runner Steve Avery and Jim Leyritz after Esteban Yan (4-1)
walked Mo Vaughn and Leyritz with one out.
 &UR; Blue Jays 13, Orioles 6 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Alex Gonzalez had three hits and a homer to lead
an 18-hit attack, and Dave Stieb made his first major league
appearance in five years as Toronto routed Baltimore.
	   Shannon Stewart and Shawn Green also had three hits for the Blue
Jays, who got homers from Gonzalez and Mike Stanley in snapping a
three-game losing streak.
	   Stieb, 40, pitched the ninth inning for the Blue Jays, his first
outing in the majors since May 22, 1993, with the White Sox. Stieb,
the winningest pitcher in Toronto history, allowed three hits but
no runs.

Police investigate complaint filed by Livan Hernandez's ex-girlfriend girlfriend's neck, previously beat her, police planning to talk to player; 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with allegations that Hernadez tore chain off
By SANDRA WALEWSKI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Police on Thursday were investigating allegations
that Florida Marlins pitcher Livan Hernandez ripped a gold chain
off his girlfriend's neck among several violent incidents involving
the player.
	   ``She made some serious allegations against him. A report was
made. The detectives are very actively investigating those
allegations,'' Miami police spokesman Angel Calzadilla said.
	   Alina Elgarresta went to the police station late Wednesday night
to file a complaint against Hernandez, last year's World Series
MVP.
	   The 25-year-old woman was not taken to a hospital, but didn't
elaborate on what, if any, injuries she may have received,
Calzadilla said.
	   The allegations stemmed from an incident Saturday night when
Elgarresta was at a friend's apartment and Hernandez showed up,
Calzadilla said. A violent argument erupted, and he demanded her
car keys.
	   When she refused, she alleged Hernandez ripped a chain off her
neck.
	   Elgarresta said Hernandez tried to hit her but a male friend of
his intervened and stopped him, detectives said.
	   She said Hernandez had beaten her in the past and that she had
waited for him to leave town before filing a complaint because she
was afraid of him, Calzadilla said.
	   Police said Thursday night they want to talk to Hernandez when
he returns from a weekend series in New York.
	   His agent denied the accusations.
	   ``People like Livan are very vulnerable to these types of
allegations,'' agent Juan Iglesias said.
	   Elgarresta also said in the complaint that she was at a club in
Coconut Grove with a friend on Friday night when Hernandez showed
up and they got into an argument. She got up to leave, and that's
when she claims Hernandez grabbed her arm and took her out to his
car.
	   Later, she told police, they stopped and got out and he grabbed
her by the hair and pulled her back in the car. She alleges he
drove around for three hours until she agreed to reconcile _ which
she did because she was scared, Calzadilla said.

Alleged Mexican rebel says her confession came under torture 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A woman arrested after a firefight between
soldiers and leftist rebels claims government agents tortured her
and threatened her family to get her to implicate peasant groups in
guerrilla movements.
	   But the prosecutor in charge of investigating the June 7
shootout in the hamlet of El Charco, Guerrero said Thursday none of
the 27 people arrested at the scene were tortured. Eleven people
were killed in the gunbattle.
	   A statement delivered by the brothers of Erika Zamora Pardo, 21,
says that after her arrest, she was blindfolded, stripped and had
electric shocks put to her feet, the daily La Jornada reported
Thursday.
	   The statement said she was forced to falsely implicate the
Peasant Organization of the South Sierra and the Union of
Organizations of the South Sierra as being linked to the rebel
movement.
	   In a Thursday press conference, prosecutor Jose Luis Ramos said
Zamora and a man arrested after the raid in western Guerrero state
had admitted to being members of the Revolutionary Army of the
Insurgent People _ a recent offshoot of the Popular Revolutionary
Army, which took up arms in 1996 to demand political and social
reform.
	   ``Erika Zamora Pardo does not have a scratch, no injury of any
kind,'' Ramos said. ``I reject categorically that any testimony was
extracted through torture, that's evidently a defensive maneuver.''
	   The other 25 people arrested at the scene, mainly Indian
farmers, were released.
	   Local authorities in Zamora's hometown of Franciso I. Madero,
Hidalgo said her parents and two brothers have not been seen since
June 10. One neighbor said they were taken away in a pickup truck
by men dressed in black.
	   Ramos conceded that Mexican army troops which surrounded the
suspected rebels at a schoolhouse in El Charco may have taunted the
guerrillas, but denied that the incident could be called a massacre
or that civilians were killed.

Martin's drive into history not always smooth AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Casey Martin drove away from the first tee
and into U.S. Open history Thursday. He almost took an official
with him.
	   With the bleachers on the first tee packed and a crowd swelled
to three-deep off to the side, Martin crushed his opening drive,
held his elegant finishing position as the ball soared against a
low, gray sky, smiled, and handed the club to his caddie, Steve
Burdick.
	   Then, and only then, as Martin limped slightly off the tee box,
did the difference between him and the 150 or so other contestants
who played The Olympic Club on this day become apparent. Waiting
for him just a step off the tee was a green golf cart.
	   Martin jumped in, stepped on the gas _ and nearly ran over a
U.S. Golf Association official who cut in front of him. He hit the
brake, let the official pass, then sheepishly tipped his cap to the
crowd and rolled on.
	   ``It was,'' King Martin, said with a chuckle as he watched his
son ride off into the distance, ``a special moment.''
	   And it was only the latest in a week already overflowing with
them, even if it did not get off to an auspicious start. For
Monday's practice round, the bluecoats who run the USGA provided
Martin with a single-rider cart. The first one they gave him
wouldn't start. When a second one did, he quickly found out it
wasn't made for driving over the slippery slopes at Olympic.
Several times, the cart nearly turned over. Finally, Martin hit the
brakes, climbed out and walked most of the first few holes.
	   The USGA relented and decided he could have a standard cart for
the rest of the week. No one asked for any assurances, but Casey
gave one anyway. ``It's not like I'll be doing curlicues in the
rough to mat it down _ although I'd like to,'' he said.
	   Actually, Martin may have. On Thursday, John Daly arrived at his
ball on the fourth hole. He said he found ``what looked like two
little cart trails. ... So I've got to thank Casey for that.''
	   For all the attention focused on him in his biggest tournament,
Martin acquitted himself well. He shot an even-par 35 on the front
nine, then salvaged a par with a long putt on 12 after drives in
the rough cost him bogeys on the 10th and 11th holes. Through it
all, he kept his composure and even flashed an occasional smile.
	   The day after Monday's cart fiasco, Martin played a practice
round with Tiger Woods and Joel Kribel. If it looked more like a
reunion of college buddies than three competitors preparing for the
second major championship of the year, that's because it was.
Martin, Kribel and Woods played on the golf team at Stanford,
although not at the same time. Insults were slung, verbal jabs were
exchanged, and when it was time to settle the bets, Martin got the
last laugh.
	   ``Tiger still has to pay me,'' he told reporters when he walked
into the interview room at the end of the day.
	   But the lighthearted mood lasted only so long. A few questions
later, Martin was asked how much he looks forward to the day when
he is invited into the interview room because of his golf, not his
golf cart.
	   His answer made clear how few illusions he harbors.
	   ``I will always probably be known,'' Martin said, ``as the
person in the golf cart.''
	   There is a way to change that this week. He could win the U.S.
Open. Improbable as that sounds, he has beaten long odds before.
	   As a kid trying to master the game on a bad leg. As the
plaintiff in a lawsuit to win the right to use the cart. Just to
earn his place here, he had to sink a 25-foot (8-meter) birdie putt
in a playoff after making double-bogey on the last hole of
regulation in a qualifying tournament last week in Cincinnati.
	   ``It's amazing how things happen,'' Martin said. ``I would never
have dreamt it.''

NBA to consider moratorium in labor dispute AP Basketball Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A National Basketball Association lockout seemed
a little less of a certainty Thursday, with deputy commissioner
Russ Granik saying a summer-long moratorium is possible even
without a new labor contract by July 1.
	   ``We said we'd consider it, but only in the context of whether
it was good or not for the bargaining process,'' Granik said, one
day after the players' union proposed a moratorium as a way of
restoring 12 NBA players to the world championship roster.
	   The league and the union have made little progress in almost two
months of talks, and both sides had toughened in anticipation of a
lockout after the labor agreement expires June 30. The sides are
scheduled to meet again Monday.
	   Granik's comments were the first by a league official indicating
that a lockout may not be the most favored alternative. The league
and players have a history of imposing moratoriums during labor
talks.
	   ``Traditionally, you have a moratorium because you wanted to
have bargaining without doing any damage,'' Granik told The
Associated Press. ``But if we're going to do a moratorium, it's
because we're going to want to do a moratorium _ not because it has
anything to do with USA Basketball.''
	   Union director Billy Hunter said his moratorium proposal would
allow teams to make trades and sign free agents, and that anything
less would be unacceptable.
	   ``If you can't do business, it's basically still a lockout,''
Hunter said. ``What we put on the table they didn't seem to be
buying into. We're not going to do a no-strike, no-lockout
agreement if teams can't do business.''
	   The world championships became embroiled in the league's labor
troubles when the 12 NBA players told USA Basketball, the national
federation, they would not play in the tournament July 29-Aug. 9 in
Athens, Greece, if a lockout was in effect.
	   USA Basketball responded by dropping the 12 players and saying
they would be replaced by CBA players and Americans playing
overseas.
	   The Greek basketball federation and FIBA, the sport's world
governing body, were angered by the move.
	   Borislav Stankovic, FIBA's secretary general, has given USA
Basketball an extension until the end of the month for submitting a
roster.
	   ``We have agreed with Mr. Stankovic to a joint plan of action in
order to fight this unpleasant development in the hope that in the
end we will manage to change it,'' said Giorgos Vassilakopoulos of
the Greek Basketball Federation. ``I have the impression that the
American federation's decision was very hasty.''
	   He added: ``I hope the situation which has developed is a
tactical move.''
	   Granik insisted that any decision to impose a moratorium rather
than a lockout would have nothing to do with the world
championships.
	   The NBA and USA Basketball are separate entities, but the
players see them as inextricably linked because Granik serves as
president and WNBA commissioner Val Ackerman sits on the executive
board.

Zanardi returns to the scene of his first CART win AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) _ When Alex Zanardi won his first CART race
at Portland International Raceway, he was just an undistinguished
former Formula One driver trying to make his mark in America.
	   Two years later, as he returns for this weekend's Budweiser-G.I.
Joe's 200, was the hottest driver on the circuit and a good bet to
win his second consecutive PPG Cup points title.
	   He's also added some much-needed flamboyance to the Championship
Auto Racing Teams competition, with his Italian charm and trademark
``donut'' spins in his car after his victories.
	   ``I'm just crazy, you know,'' Zanardi said. ``I do a lot of
strange things, and I have a lot of fun.''
	   Since his 1996 victory at Portland, Zanardi has won 10 more
races, three this year, the latest two weeks ago at Detroit. His
Reynard-Honda has been in the top three of 12 of the last 15 races.
	   In eight races this year, Zanardi has three victories, one
second and two thirds.
	   Zanardi was a good driver in mediocre cars during his sporadic
Formula One career from 1991 to 1994. After a season of driving in
Britain, he signed with Chip Ganassi Racing in 1996.
	   Finally in a car that could win, Zanardi got his breakthrough on
the nine-turn, 1.967-mile (3.147-kilometer) road course in
Portland. He started on the pole and led 95 of 98 laps.
	   ``The circuit is very important to me since it's where I won my
first American race,'' he said. ``Obviously I have very good
memories. The track and the city are very beautiful. I drive to the
ocean from the circuit because I like nature so much.''
	   Ganassi has the dominant CART team for the third consecutive
year. Zanardi's teammate, Jimmy Vasser, won the points championship
in 1996, followed by Zanardi last year. This year, Zanardi leads
with 113 points. Greg Moore is second with 96, 16 points ahead of
Vasser, who has two victories this year.
	   Zanardi insists he doesn't expect his domination to continue.
	   ``You can't count on other people to rest and not improve,'' he
said. ``We are working very hard. Nothing comes easy, but every
member of my team is so dedicated. We certainly have the equipment
to do the job _ a great engine, great tires, great car. What can I
say?''
	   Nine of Zanardi's CART victories have come on street or road
courses.
	   Weather is always uncertain in Portland. Last year, rain
shortened the race to 78 laps. The finish was high drama, with Mark
Blundell edging Gil de Ferran by .027 seconds, the closest CART
finish ever.
	   Rain was a possibility for Friday's first round of qualifying,
but clear skies were forecast the remainder of the weekend.
	   Vasser has mixed memories of Portland. He was declared the
winner of the 1995 race after a post-race inspection determined
that first-place finisher Al Unser Jr.'s car was too close to the
ground. The verdict was reversed after Unser appealed.
	   ``Portland was, for a few months, my first CART win,'' Vasser
said. ``But then it was reversed, so I'm still looking for my first
official win there.''

Dollar edges higher, stocks fall prices 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with late morning dollar, Nikkei and bond
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar remained slightly higher against
the yen Friday morning ahead of a meeting this weekend in Tokyo of
world currency officials. Japanese stocks fell in light trading.
	   The dollar bought 137.14 yen in late morning trading, up 0.26
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its rate of 137.83 yen in
late New York trading overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
dropped 156.79 points, or 1.02 percent, to 15,204.75 at the end of
the morning session. On Thursday, the average surged 646.16 points,
or 4.39 percent.
	   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers arrived in Tokyo
late Thursday for talks with Japanese officials and a meeting
Saturday with deputy finance ministers and central bankers from the
Group of Seven industrial nations and Asian countries.
	   The meeting was called earlier this week to find ways to end the
yen's recent sharp slide against the dollar that has threatened to
spark new rounds of currency devaluation in already battered Asian
economies.
	   Japanese newspapers reported Friday that Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto may propose new tax cuts at the meeting as well as
measures to accelerate the write-off of some 76 trillion yen (dlrs
555 billion) in bad loans held by his nation's banks.
	   In talks late Thursday night, Summers and Japanese finance
official Eisuke Sakakibara agreed to work together to raise the
yen's value, the Nihon Keizai financial daily reported. U.S. and
Japanese central banks intervened late Wednesday to halt the yen's
slide.
	   Investors will also be keeping a nervous eye on Summers'
meetings Friday with Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami and
Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga.
	   ``It's going to be choppy,'' said Yasuhisa Morikuni, assistant
vice president of financial markets at the Tokyo branch of Bank of
America. ``The dollar's under pressure, and there are a lot of
rumors.''
	   On the stock market, the benchmark index slipped amid renewed
fears over the health of Japan's financial system and on profit
taking after posting its biggest point gain since Jan. 16 on
Thursday.
	   Until that rise, the Nikkei had fallen in tandem with the yen,
hurt by the same pessimism about Japan's economy that plagued the
Japanese currency.
	   But with the yen's rebound at least momentarily stalled,
investors had no fresh reason to buy Tokyo stocks, analysts said.
	   ``The yen's climb has stopped, and there is no further incentive
to push the market sharply higher,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general
manager of the equities operation group at Nikko Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 15.84 points, or 1.32 percent, to 1,183.00.
It leaped 42.00 points, or 3.63 percent, the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.255 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.285 percent, driving its price up to 111.58 yen from 111.36 yen.

Amateur U.S. golfer takes penalty when ball stolen 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ A ball thief may have cost Paul Simson, an
amateur playing in his first U.S. Open, a one-stroke penalty in
Thursday's first round.
	   Simson, vice president of a North Carolina insurance agency, was
2-under after the front nine but hit his tee shot on the 10th hole
through a tree left of the fairway.
	   Two spectators told USGA official Ron Reed they saw the ball
bounce off the tree and land on the ground between the ninth and
10th holes, where a fan appeared to pick up the ball.
	   Simson, his caddie and several spectators searched for the ball,
even climbing into a tree to look for it. After having no luck,
Simson went back to the tee and played another ball, taking a
one-shot penalty and eventually shooting a triple-bogey 7 on the
hole.
	   Reed said Simson perhaps should have been allowed a free drop in
the vicinity of where the spectators saw the ball land, since the
Rules of Golf provide for such a ruling in cases when a ball is
moved or stolen.
	   Since Simson had returned to the tee and played another ball,
the possibility of a free drop was wiped out. He finished at 6-over
76 for the round.

Mahathir attacks West, denies cronyism

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister on
Friday railed against ``foreign powers,'' whom he accused of trying
to topple him and ruin his country, while denying that cronyism and
nepotism had hurt the economy.
	   Blaming foreign companies for preying on Malaysian companies
weakened by the Asian economic crisis, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad urged ruling party members at their annual convention to
deflect the attacks.
	   Mahathir dismissed accusations of crony capitalism in Asian
nations, saying Malaysians should not be influenced by Western
propaganda and by marauding market forces.
	   ``Rightly, the development process of the Malays, migrating from
farmers to entrepreneurs and educated traders, ought to continue,''
Mahathir told some 2,000 delegates at the United Malays National
Organization general assembly.
	   ``However it seems there are quarters who will not allow this.
We are pushed to become a backward, weak race, that is recolonized
and having to serve others,'' he said. ``They are trying to destroy
all that we have built.''
	   Mahathir's speech comes on the heels of his UMNO deputy's speech
Thursday, which also put the blame for the Southeast Asian
country's economic ails on foreign currency speculators.
	   For the first time since the Asian contagion began battering the
economy one year ago, sending the currency and stock markets
crashing, Malaysia posted a negative growth rate of 1.8 percent in
the first quarter of 1998. That compared with a robust 6.9 percent
growth in 1997.
	   Similar comments by Mahathir have put him in hot water before,
scaring investors and sending the national currency, the ringgit,
and the stock market plunging.
	   Mahathir, long the outspoken champion of Southeast Asia, has
never been timid in his belief that Western powers would like to
unseat him and cow the region.
	   Once that is accomplished, he has said, Southeast Asia will then
be forced to beg those very same powers for help.
	   ``The attack on the country will continue until a leader is
chosen, one that will submit to the wishes of the foreign powers,''
Mahathir said.
	   ``The objective is to cause political instability because the
allegations will in turn create misunderstanding among leaders.
	   ``Their action does not differ much from robbers, who steal our
money and then, returning half of it, claiming that they were out
to help us.''
	   Mahathir's comments at the first party conference since Malaysia
has slid into a deep economic crisis come amid rumbles of criticism
about his style of governance.
	   If the criticisms during the assembly, which runs through
Sunday, become louder, Mahathir, 72, could find his 17-years of
unchallenged rule threatened.
	   At the opening of the assembly Thursday, some delegates cheered
the party's youth leader who spoke out against corruption and
nepotism within UMNO which, he said, could erode the party's
unrivaled grip over Malaysia since independence in 1957.
	   Mahathir challenged the accusations.
	   ``Unfortunately, whoever is given the opportunity and support
will be branded as a crony,'' said Mahathir. ``If he succeeded and
became rich, he will be accused of being a crony although he has
not received any government assistance and is not close to any
leader.''

CHICAGO: the loss. Expos 7, Mets 6 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In Montreal, Vladimir Guerrero homered, doubled, and scored
twice and Rondell White homered for the second straight game as the
Expos beat the New York Mets.
	   Guerrero homered off Masato Yoshii (4-3) in the first, doubled
to begin a five-run rally in the sixth, and made an outstanding
running catch to cut off a Mets comeback bid in the seventh.
	   Edgardo Alfonzo went 3-for-4 and Carlos Baerga drove in two runs
for the Mets.
	   Shayne Bennett (2-3) relieved starter Javier Vazquez in the
sixth and got the win. Ugueth Urbina pitched the ninth for his 17th
save.
 &UR; Cardinals 7, Astros 6 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Mark McGwire hit a 449-foot home run into the
Astrodome's upper deck for his 33rd this season, setting the major
league record for most homers hit through June.
	   McGwire still has 11 games this month to add to the record,
previously held by Ken Griffey Jr., who hit 32 through June 1994.
	   Ron Gant drove in three runs to help the Cardinals take an early
5-2 lead. Ray Lankford and McGwire hit back-to-back homers in the
fifth inning that chased Shane Reynolds (7-5).
 &UR; Dodgers 5, Rockies 0 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Eric Karros homered and drove in five runs and Dave
Mlicki pitched his second career shutout as the Los Angeles Dodgers
ended a four-game losing streak.
	   Mlicki (3-4), who beat Colorado last Friday in Los Angeles, gave
up seven hits, walked two and struck out three en route to his
first road win in seven starts this season.
	   It was the first time the Rockies had been shut out at home
since Aug. 12, 1997, by Philadelphia's Matt Beech.
	   Rockies starter Jamey Wright (5-7) gave up three runs in seven
innings.

Two Koreas may jointly celebrate liberation day in August 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea accepted ``in principle''
Friday a North Korean proposal to jointly celebrate their
liberation from Japan's colonial rule in 1945.
	   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South right after the liberation on Aug. 15. Both
sides mark the day with celebrations.
	   On Wednesday, North Korea proposed marking this year's
Independence Day with a ``grand festival for national
reconciliation, unity and reunification'' involving Koreans in the
North, the South and overseas.
	   The North proposed that the festival be held Aug. 14-15 at the
border village of Panmunjom inside the 4 kilometer (2.5-mile)-wide
demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.
	   North Korea said letters containing the proposal were sent to
about 85 South Korean political, social, cultural, religious and
student leaders.
	   On Friday, South Korea's Unification Minister Kang In-duk said
his government would accept the North's proposal ``in principle''
and that a formal South Korean reply would be sent next week.
	   He said South Korea would propose that the festival be expanded
to include a music concert, soccer matches and joint religious
services.
	   ``Since it will be a civilian event, concerned representatives
of both sides should meet to discuss in detail contents of the
festival,'' Kang told reporters.
	   The two Koreas fought a devastating, three-year war that ended
without a peace treaty in 1953 and mutual distrust remains deep.
Their border is the world's most heavily guarded, with two million
men on both sides.
	   But under its ``sunshine policy,'' South Korea's new government
of President Kim Dae-jung is trying to induce North Korea's
reclusive government toward peace and reconciliation.
	   The centerpiece of the South Korean policy is promoting civilian
exchanges and cooperation. North Korea shuns official government
contact with South Korea, which it regards as a U.S. colony.
	   South Korea has rejected all similar North Korean proposals in
the past, because they always carried conditions it could not
accommodate, including an end to the U.S. military presence in its
territory.
	   The North's proposal this year has no such conditions attached,
Seoul officials said.
