	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ American and British forces bombarded Iraq
in Thursday's early darkness and explosions sounded in Baghdad.
Iraqi gunners fired volleys of anti-aircraft flak over the capital,
and Saddam Hussein accused the West of cowardice for attacking with
long-range missiles.
	   At least two people were killed and 30 were injured, a doctor
said.
	   The Iraqi president urged Iraqis to ``Fight the enemies of God,
enemies of the nation, enemies of humanity.'' He said ``several
targets'' were hit, in the statement carried by the official Iraqi
News Agency.
	   In a radio broadcast, Saddam said the attackers did not ``come
to meet you face to face'' and depended ``on a long technological
arm, which is not a measure of bravery.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said he ordered airstrikes on
military and security targets after reading the latest U.N. reports
about Iraq's alleged obstruction of the United Nations Special
Commission, which is responsible for eliminating the country's
weapons of mass destruction. But apparently some missiles hit
civilian areas.
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the Aliyarmouk Hospital, said two
people were killed and more than 30 were injured, suffering mostly
burns in the face, hands and legs.
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft guns opened fire after air raid sirens broke
the night's silence _ and just before Washington and London
announced airstrikes on military and security installations. The
explosions continued into the pre-dawn hours, stopping briefly
before morning chants calling Muslims to prayer wailed from the
city's mosques.
	   Unlike during previous Western alliance attacks on Baghdad,
there was no blackout.
	   State-run television did not mention the attack and instead
continued to broadcast pictures of Saddam meeting Wednesday with
ruling Baath Party officials.
	   Along with the anti-aircraft fire, at least two large blasts
were heard, and foreign television transmissions showed a huge
fiery glow on the horizon. Smoke could be seen trailing into the
dark sky in the distance.
	   The Iraqi blasts violently shook the glass windows of the
Information Ministry building near the center of Baghdad where
foreign reporters are based.
	   The anti-aircraft fire began at 12:49 a.m. Thursday (2149 GMT).
A barrage of blasts lighted the sky several hours after the Clinton
administration warned that it would make a military strike against
Iraq at any time.
	   Clinton ordered airstrikes on Iraq over a protracted impasse
with Saddam over U.N. weapons inspections just minutes before the
blasts began. Less than an hour later, Prime Minister Tony Blair
announced that British froces had participated in the airstrikes.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States bombarded Iraq Thursday
with waves of missile strikes, and Baghdad shook with explosions
and anti-aircraft gunfire. Two people were killed and 30 were
injured in the night-long assault, a doctors said.
	   At least one missile fell in an area near President Saddam
Hussein's biggest palace in Baghdad. The whereabouts of the
president were not known.
	   Witnesses said one more missile landed in the neighborhood of
al-Adil, about 2 kilometers (1 mile) from Abu Ghraib where a huge
military camp and radio relay stations are located.
	   Air raid sirens broke the night's silence minutes before a
barrage of anti-aircraft fire lit up the sky at 12:49 a.m. (2149
GMT Wednesday), unleashing thunderous blasts as if at a giant
fireworks show and shaking windows of buildings.
	   This was repeated four more times. As the sounds of the last
barrage at 5.18 a.m. (0218 GMT) was fading, a muezzin's call for
prayer floated over the winter morning from a mosque loudspeaker.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said he ordered airstrikes on
military and security targets to retaliate for Iraq's defiance of
the United Nations Special Commission, which is responsible for
eliminating the country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he authorized the
participation of British forces.
	   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological weapons,'' Clinton
said.
	   President Saddam Hussein taunted the United States and Britain,
saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face'' but
``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the Aliyarmouk Hospital, said two
people were killed and more than 30 were injured, suffering mostly
burns in the face, hands and legs.
	   ``Where is this Clinton I wish I could get my hands on him,''
mumbled Salam Mohammed, 34, as he moaned on his hospital bed, his
face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Unlike previous attacks on the war-weary city, there was no
blackout. The streets were brightly lit, as were many homes when
the attack began.
	   At least two large blasts were heard and a huge fiery glow
filled the horizon. Smoke could be seen trailing into the dark sky
in the distance.
	   The damage from the attack could not be immediately assessed.
Iraqi officials took reporters to Karada, a mixed commercial and
residential neighborhood, where a missile had landed, bursting
water mains in a street.
	   A 2 kilometer (1 mile) stretch of the street was flooded.
	   Karada is across the Tigris river from the Old Presidential
Complex in central Baghdad. It was not clear if the palace was
damaged. Saddam's whereabouts also were not known.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the events a ``sad day
for the world,'' saying he did everything in his power to seek
peace. But he didn't say whether the attacks were justified.
	   A senior Pentagon official said in Washington that warships
stationed in the Gulf fired hundreds of Tomahawk cruise missiles
and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck against Iraqi air defense
radars. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Clinton said it will be a ``strong sustained series of
airstrikes,'' indicating that more punishing strikes are likely in
the next few days.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire Tomahawk, 210 aircraft and the aircraft carrier
USS Enterprise. The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy
bombers.
	   Iraq's U.N. envoy Nizar Hamdoon urged the U.N. Security Council
to call for an immediate halt to the attacks.
	   The United States hopes the attacks will achieve what the United
Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM, says it has not been able to
achieve in seven years of work: destroy Iraq's ability to produce
weapons of mass destruction, specifically chemical and biological
arms.
	   ``Instead of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam is
disarming the inspectors,'' Clinton said.
	   The U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until UNSCOM
certifies that Iraq is free of chemical and biological weapons and
long-range missiles.
	   Iraq accuses UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler of being a U.S.
puppet who is deliberately prolonging the sanctions.
	   Butler withdrew all his weapons inspectors from Baghdad on
Wednesday, accusing Iraq of going back on its promise last month to
cooperate fully with UNSCOM. That promise had saved Iraq from an
imminent U.S. attack on Nov. 14.
	   Butler cited Iraq's recent refusal to allow a team of inspectors
into a headquarters of the ruling Baath Party. He also said Iraq
was obstructing and evading the inspectors.
	   The complaints were used by the United States and Britain as the
necessary provocation for the airstrikes.
	   But China and Russia, traditional Iraq allies, were not pleased.
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse of pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' the U.N. Security Council, China's ambassador, Qin Husaen,
said.
	   ``The use of force ... poses a threat to international as well
as regional stability,'' he said.
	   He said Butler's complaints are ``apparently one-sided'' and do
not ``reflect the situation on ground.''
	   Staunch U.S. allies, Germany, Canada and even Japan, supported
the attack.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chinese athletes were offered bribes to
lose in gold medal matches at the Asian Games, a senior Chinese
sports official said Thursday.
	   Li Furong, deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation, said
more than one person offered bribes to Chinese athletes and that
the athletes refused, saying they wouldn't throw a medal even for
U.S. dlrs 100,000.
	   ``Some people tried to use money to buy gold medals,'' Li said
in a telephone interview. ``It wasn't just once.''
	   ``Of course, the athletes refused,'' he added.
	   Li refused to give details about the bribes or say what
countries, sports or people were involved. He first mentioned the
bribes at a news conference for Chinese reporters, and said in the
interview that he brought the issue to light to show that Chinese
athletes were clean, not to shame others.
	   In refusing the bribes, Chinese athletes said, ``If you give me
100,000 American dollars I won't do it,'' Li said.
	   ``Some athletes also said I'm not here for money but for the
glory of the country,'' Li added.
	   Asked how he felt about his athletes' response, Li said, ``Of
course I'm happy.''

President says Indonesia might break up if protests not curbed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president told the
powerful military Thursday that anti-government protests must be
curbed to prevent the sprawling Southeast Asian nation from
breaking up.
	   ``If the protests are not be controlled it can lead to the
disintegration of the nation,'' said President B.J. Habibie at a
graduation ceremony of new army officers.
	   Habibie, who has promised democratic reform after decades of
authoritarian rule, said that freedom of expression that allows
protests is now guaranteed under Indonesian law.
	   ``But in carrying out these rights people must also respect
other people's rights,'' he said.
	   Indonesia, with 202 million people, is the world's fourth most
populous country. It has more than 300 ethnic groups spread over
about 17,000 islands.
	   For weeks, students have been holding street protests demanding
that Habibie force the military out of politics and put his
autocratic predecessor, ex-President Suharto, on trial for
corruption.
	   The protesters and security forces have clashed on several
occasions.
	   On Wednesday in Jakarta, police fired tear gas and swung batons
to disperse hundreds of protesters who had entered the grounds of
the Defense Ministry, not far from Habibie's presidential palace.
	   On Nov. 13, security forces shot dead nine student protesters
when thousands tried to march on Parliament.
	   Student protests and deadly riots last May also forced Suharto
to quit after 32 years in power.
	   Habibie has promised to open up the tightly controlled political
system and to hold elections next year. But the students are not
satisfied and stage demonstrations almost daily in Jakarta and
other cities.
	   Anger at Habibie's seven-month old government has been sharpened
by a continuing economic crisis, which has resulted in soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and rising poverty.
	   Sporadic rioting and looting has hit some parts of the country.
There has also been violence among the Muslim majority and the
Christian minority with dozens of mosques and churches set afire or
ransacked.
	   On Wednesday mobs rioted and attacked Chinese-owned shops in
Samarinda on the island of Borneo.
	   To counter the threat of rising violence and lawlessness ahead
of next year's elections, the government plans to establish a
civilian militia to help the police and military.
	   Some opposition groups and human rights activists fear the
group, to consist of as many as 40,000 unemployed young men, will
be used to intimidate government opponents.
	   Meanwhile a senior Cabinet minister claimed that Habibie had
moved too fast to deliver democratic reform.
	   Education Minister Juwono Sudarsono said Indonesia had now

U.S. tacitly accepts India's need for a nuclear deterrence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Initial U.S. outrage over nuclear
testing has evolved over the course of discussions with New Delhi
into tacit acceptance of India's determination to build a nuclear
defense, a senior diplomatic source said Thursday.
	   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, opened a window
onto the ongoing talks on India's defense policy that followed
India's May underground nuclear tests. Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee also provided some details this week in two
speeches to lawmakers who had complained about the secrecy
surrounding the discussions.
	   According to the diplomatic source, officials have given
Vajpayee's envoy Jaswant Singh a tour of U.S. facilities that
provide direct communication between Washington and Moscow, and he
has met with experts on ``command and control'' systems that
determine under what circumstances nuclear weapons would be used.
	   So even while questioning India's need for a nuclear arsenal,
the United States has taken steps to help New Delhi manage it, the
source said. It also has encouraged India to clearly define what it
means by what Vajpayee calls a ``minimum, credible nuclear
deterrent,'' arguing that being open about its capabilities is the
only way to persuade perceived enemies of India that they have
something to fear.
	   After the May tests with which India declared established it a
nuclear power, Vajpayee said his country needed a deterrent because
its uneasy neighbors China and Pakistan were nuclear capable.
Pakistan responded to the tests with its own underground
explosions, raising fears nuclear war could one day break out in
the region.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three conventional wars since the
two independent nations were carved out of the British empire in
1947.
	   Vajpayee told his parliament Tuesday that after six round of
talks between Singh and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott, the United States has developed ``some understanding of
our security concerns and requirements.''
	   A seventh Singh-Talbott meeting is scheduled in late January in
New Delhi. Singh was recently named foreign minister, raising
questions as to whether he would continue direct talks with a
lower-ranking U.S. official. Plans for Singh to continue are a sign
he and Talbott have developed a relationship considered crucial to
the success of the talks.
	   It is unclear when the talks will be concluded, as the two sides
remain far apart on key issues.
	   The United States wants India and Pakistan to sign an
international test ban treaty, issue a formal moratorium on
production of the fissile materials used to make nuclear weapons
and adopt restraints on nuclear-capable missiles and aircraft.
	   Vajpayee has never clearly promised to sign the test ban treaty,
but said again Tuesday he supports its coming into force by
September _ the treaty as it is now written cannot come into force
without India's signature. He also said India needs no more test
explosions to refine its nuclear capability.
	   Vajpayee added in his speech to parliament that India could not
unilaterally end fissile material production, but was participating
in talks in Geneva aimed at establishing an international ban. He
also said India ``will not accept any restraints'' on developing
missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Work on India's
extended range Agni missile continued, he said.
	   India also has a force of 20-50 nuclear-capable medium-range
Prithvi missiles, according to the London defense journal Jane's
Intelligence Review.
	   Washington lifted some anti-nuclear economic sanctions this
month after India and Pakistan announced a moratorium on further
testing and promised to adhere to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
by September, as well to control the production and sale of nuclear
materials.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq, Russia and China called for an
immediate halt to U.S. and British attacks on Iraqi targets late
Wednesday, but a divided U.N. Security Council took no action.
	   After 15 speeches from supporters and opponents of the military
strikes, the council adjourned a formal meeting shortly before
midnight without setting a timetable for further talks on the Iraq
crisis.
	   Speaking at the start of the meeting, Iraq's U.N. envoy Nizar
Hamdoon urged the council to call for an immediate halt to the
attacks, which he said were wrecking the lives of innocent Iraqis.
	   Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov also appealed for an
immediate end ``to these acts of military force.'' China's U.N.
envoy Qin Huasun called on the United States and Britain ``to stop
forthwith all military actions against Iraq.''
	   But the United States and Britain said the attacks were
justified because Iraq failed to keep its Nov. 14 promise to
cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors _ a position backed by
Japan.
	   ``The United States did not seek a confrontation and did not
undertake this decision lightly,'' said Deputy U.S. Ambassador
Peter Burleigh. ``Iraq's policy of unremitting defiance and
non-compliance necessitated the resort to military force.''
	   He said the United States was now looking to ``the highest level
of the Iraqi leadership for an immediate demonstration of
unconditional compliance with the terms of the Security Council
resolutions.''
	   But Hamdoon insited that Iraq has been cooperating with the U.N.
Special Commission known as UNSCOM, which Butler heads, that it was
disarmed, and that it was not a threat to the region as the United
States and Britain contend.
	   Council members were also divided over the accuracy of Butler's
report, his decision to evacuate the inspection teams from Baghdad
without consulting the council, and the use of force by the United
States and Britain without council authorization.
	   Noting that Butler cited only five incidents in 300 inspection
operations, Hamdoon accused the chief inspector of bias in his
report Tuesday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan which was used
by Washington and London to justify the attacks.
	   Qin said Butler played ``a dishonerable role in this crisis'' by
submitting reports which were ``unfounded and evasive of facts.''
	   Lavrov, who called for the formal Security Council meeting, said
the attacks violated council resolutions. ``The entire
responsibility for the consequence of these actions must be borne
by those states who have chosen a unilateral act of force in order
to resolve their problems with Iraq,'' he said.
	   Hamdoon challenged the Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, to
produce physical evidence that Iraq still has prohibited weapons.
	   ``The exaggerated uproar over the Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction is nothing more than a big lie,'' he said. ``The other
lie is that Iraq poses a threat to its neighbors.''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq, Russia and China called for an
immediate halt to U.S. and British attacks on Iraqi targets
Wednesday, but a divided U.N. Security Council took no immediate
action.
	   After 15 speeches from supporters and opponents of the military
strikes, the council adjourned a formal meeting shortly before
midnight without setting a timetable for further talks on the Iraq
crisis.
	   Speaking at the start of a formal council meeting, Iraqi envoy
Nizar Hamdoon accused chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler
of producing a biased report Tuesday, which concluded that Baghdad
had not fully cooperated with the U.N. monitors and triggered the
airstrikes.
	   Russia and China backed Iraq's claim, but the United States and
Britain accused Iraq of failing to give the U.N. Special
Commission, which Butler heads, the cooperation it needs to
complete its verification of Iraq's disarmament.
	   ``The United States did not seek a confrontation and did not
undertake this decision lightly,'' said Deputy U.S. Ambassador
Peter Burleigh. ``Iraq's policy of unremitting defiance and
non-compliance necessitated the resort to military force.''
	   He said the United States was now looking to ``the highest level
of the Iraqi leadership for an immediate demonstration of
unconditional compliance with the terms of the Security Council
resolutions.''
	   Hamdoon said Butler cited only five incidents in 300 inspection
operations, and that was used as justification by the United States
and Britain to attack Iraq.
	   ``The exaggerated uproar over the Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction is nothing more than a big lie,'' he said. ``The other
lie is that Iraq poses a threat to its neighbors.''
	   The Iraqi envoy challenged the Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, to produce physical evidence that Iraq still has prohibited
weapons.
	   And he called on the council ``to fulfill its responsibilities
as set forth in the United Nations charter and request immediate,
unconditional cessation of the aggression that is under way against
Iraq.''
	   Earlier, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the bombing of
Iraq ``a sad day for the world.''
	   He said he did everything in his power to seek peace and deeply
regretted not being able to avert the use of force.
	   The divided council discussed Butler's report and the Iraqi
attack in private three times Wednesday before holding an open
session Wednesday night.
	   ``This is a situation of dire relevance to the Security Council
mandate and members consequently want to discuss their positions,''
said Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, who called for the
formal meeting. ``I'm sure there will be some condemnation.''
	   Annan, who helped avert military action twice this year by
flying to Baghdad in February and sending a last-minute appeal to
the Iraqis in November, was at the council meeting Wednesday
afternoon when reports of bombing began circulating. He emerged
looking grim and made no comment.
	   Several hours later, Annan made a brief statement saying his
thoughts were with ``the people of Iraq, with the 370 United
Nations humanitarian workers who remain in the country, and with
all others whose lives are in danger.''
	   ``This is a sad day for the United Nations, and for the world,''
he said. ``It is also a very sad day for me personally. Throughout
this year I have done everything in my power to ensure peaceful
compliance with Security Council resolutions, and so to avert the
use of force.
	   ``I deeply regret that today these efforts have proved
insufficient,'' Annan said.
	   He didn't say whether the U.S. and British attacks were
justified _ only that ``what has happened cannot be reversed.''
	   Under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes, Iraq promised on
Nov. 14 to cooperate fully with weapons inspectors and allow
unfettered access to sites and documents. Annan warned Iraq at the
time that if it did not fully cooperate there might not be another
chance for diplomacy.
	   Over the past month, inspectors tested Iraq's pledge _ and
Butler's report delivered to Annan late Tuesday set the stage for
Wednesday's attacks.
	   The Security Council met for 90 minutes Wednesday morning to
discuss the report and Butler's decision to evacuate all inspectors
and staff _ which angered China, Russia and France because the
permanent council was not consulted.
	   The council met for about an hour Wednesday afternoon before
reports of an attack began circulating and the meeting broke up.
China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasen was visibly angry when he
emerged.
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' he said. ``The use of force not only has serious
consequences for the implementation of Security Council resolutions
but also poses a threat to international as well as regional
stability.''
	   After the U.S. launched the airstrikes, U.S. Deputy Ambassador
Peter Burleigh met privately with Hamdoon for about 15 minutes.
U.S. and Iraqi officials would not comment on the talks.

	   SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) _ Sonoma County supervisors approved
plans designed to nearly double the amount of water taken from the
Russian River for urban use.
	   The 4-1 vote Tuesday came despite the possibility state and
federal officials will restrict water diversions.
	   The supervisors said the plan is needed to secure enough water
for expected population growth in Sonoma and northern Marin
counties.
	   State and federal officials want to restrict water diversions in
the 1,485-square-mile Russian River watershed to improve habitat
for steelhead trout and coho salmon, both on the threatened list.
	   ``We're just starting the environmental process here, not
finishing it,'' said Supervisor Mike Cale. ``But in order to begin
the process, we've got to have a project that can be evaluated.''

Yeltsin condemns strikes on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain on Thursday for attacking Iraq and demanded an
immediate end to the campaign, warning it could shatter regional
security.
	   ``Russia demands an immediate end to military action, to show
common sense and restraint and not to allow further escalation of
the conflict which could result in the most dramatic consequences
not only for the Iraqi settlement but for the stability of the
entire region,'' Yeltsin said in a statement.
	   The United States and Britain launched air and missile attacks
against Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The Russian president said only a political and diplomatic
solution would solve the impasse over Iraq and he condemned the
joint U.S.-British attack as unprovoked. Yeltsin, who has been ill
in recent weeks, was in the Kremlin monitoring the situation, aides
said.
	   ``The settlement of the Iraq problem is possible only through
political and diplomatic means on the basis of preserving the
resolutions of the security council of the United Nations and
international law,'' he said.
	   Russia has consistently opposed military action against Iraq, an
old ally of the Soviet Union, and attempted to find a political
solution to the dispute. But Moscow is no longer a global
superpower and is able to do little more than protest U.S. actions.
	   The Yeltsin statement was highly critical of Washington and
London, underlining how relations have declined in the past year or
two.
	   ``The fact that the states which performed this forceful action
did not find it possible to continue the search for settling the
crisis through political means causes indignation,'' the statement
added.

Iran condemns air strikes, urges Iraq to cooperate with UN
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran warned Thursday that air strikes
against Iraq will bring ``pain and misery,'' and urged Baghdad to
cooperate with the United Nations.
	   ``Such unilateral attacks against Iraq will lead to even more
pain and misery for the people of that country and will bring about
insecurity in the region,'' Iranian television reported a Foreign
Ministry spokesman as saying.
	   The United States bombarded Iraq with waves of missile strikes,
and Baghdad shook with explosions and anti-aircraft gunfire.
	   Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi called the attacks ``unacceptable''
and urged the U.N. Security Council to take immediate action to
prevent ``further deterioration of the situation in the region,''
television reported.
	   He also urged Iraq to cooperate with the United Nations.
	   Relations between Iran and Iraq are still tense after their
1980-88 war. But Iran has always been against military strikes
against Iraq.
	   The Security Council will not lift economic sanctions imposed on
Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until it certifies that Iraq
is free of chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Hundreds of missiles rained down on Iraq on
Thursday, and at least one fell on an area near President Saddam
Hussein's biggest palace in Baghdad, witnesses and officials said.
At least two people were killed and 30 were injured, a doctor said.
	   Iraqi gunners fired volleys of anti-aircraft flak over the
capital as explosions flared in Thursday's early darkness during
the U.S.-British airstrikes.
	   Saddam urged Iraqis to ``fight the enemies of God, enemies of
the nation, enemies of humanity.'' He said ``several targets'' were
hit, in a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   The Iraqi president said the attackers did not ``come to meet
you face to face'' and depended ``on a long technological arm,
which is not a measure of bravery.''
	   President Clinton said he ordered airstrikes on military and
security targets following the latest U.N. reports on Iraq's
alleged obstruction of weapons inspectors.
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the Aliyarmouk Hospital, said two
people were killed and more than 30 were injured, suffering mostly
burns in the face, hands and legs. However, no authoritative
account of the damage caused by the airstrikes was available.
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft guns opened fire after air raid sirens broke
the night's silence _ and just before Washington and London
announced airstrikes on military and security installations. The
explosions continued into the pre-dawn hours, stopping briefly
before morning chants calling Muslims to prayer wailed from the
city's mosques.
	   In Karada, a mixed commercial and residential neighborhood, a
missile strike burst water mains, flooding a 1{ mile stretch.
Workers were seen trying to plug the bubbling pipe.
	   Karada is across the Tigris river from the Old Presidential
Complex in central Baghdad. It was not clear if the palace was
damaged. Saddam's whereabouts also were not known.
	   State-run television did not mention the attack and instead
continued to broadcast pictures of Saddam meeting Wednesday with
ruling Baath Party officials.
	   Along with the anti-aircraft fire, at least two large blasts
were heard, and foreign television transmissions showed a huge
fiery glow on the horizon. Smoke could be seen trailing into the
dark sky in the distance.
	   The blasts also violently shook the glass windows of the
Information Ministry building near the center of Baghdad where
foreign reporters are based.
	   The anti-aircraft fire began at 12:49 a.m. Thursday (4:49 p.m.
EST Wednesday). A barrage of blasts lighted the sky several hours
after the Clinton administration warned that it would make a
military strike against Iraq at any time.
	   An Iraqi official seemed resigned even before the attack began.
	   ``We have done everything in our capacity,'' Iraq's U.N.
Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said at the United Nations.
	   Earlier in the day, long lines formed outside Baghdad gas
stations and customers cursed Clinton for planning an attack before
the holy Islamic month of Ramadan, which is expected to begin
Sunday.
	   ``It seems that Clinton ... wants to kill some people in a hurry
out of respect for Ramadan,'' said Amin Jadir, a government worker.
	   The crisis unfolded quickly after chief U.N. inspector Richard
Butler ordered his monitors out of the country, accusing Iraq of
obstructing their search for weapons of mass destruction.
	   In Washington, Clinton met with his top national security
advisers before ordering the attack, and the U.N. Security Council
held an emergency meeting in New York on the crisis.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair blamed Saddam for
precipitating the impasse: ``This action could have been avoided.
... Our quarrel is with him alone and the evil regime which he
represents.''
	   In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain for the attack and demanded an immediate end to
the campaign, warning it could shatter regional security.
	   ``Russia demands an immediate end to military action, to show
common sense and restraint and not to allow further escalation of
the conflict,'' Yeltsin said in a statement issued Thursday.
	   The airstrikes are the first large-scale military action against
Iraq since September 1996. Over two days, U.S. ships and jets fired
scores of cruise missiles at Iraqi anti-missile sites to punish the
Iraqi military for venturing into the Kurdish ``safe haven'' in
northern Iraq.
	   Earlier, Iraqi television interrupted regular programming to
play patriotic music and footage of Iraqi commandos training with
machine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.
	   Three trucks loaded with luggage also left the U.N. headquarters
in Baghdad. About a half-hour later, three busloads of weapons
inspectors also left the U.N. compound, followed by four white U.N.
cars carrying spare tires on top.
	   Most of the 140 inspectors, who work for the U.N. Special
Commission, or UNSCOM, flew aboard a special U.N. plane from an air
base outside Baghdad to the gulf state of Bahrain.
	   ``All international staff ... have been pulled out from
Baghdad,'' UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain.
``There is nobody left behind.''
	   The International Atomic Energy Agency, which is monitoring
Iraq's compliance on dismantling its nuclear program, also withdrew
its staff from Baghdad. UNSCOM is responsible for eliminating
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons.
	   Until these weapons are destroyed, the United Nations will not
lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, which led to the Persian Gulf War.
	   Iraq says it has complied with every U.N. demand, and accuses
Butler of prolonging the inspections at the behest of the United
States.
	   On Tuesday, Butler gave a report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in which he said Iraq's claim to be free of banned weapons
``cannot be accepted without further verification.'' But
verification is impossible as Iraq is obstructing the inspectors,
he said.

Army: Saddam may strike Israel if brought to verge of collapse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Saddam Hussein may fire missiles with chemical
or biological warheads at Israel if U.S. air strikes bring him to
the verge of collapse, Israeli military commanders said Thursday.
	   Israelis were asked to check their gas masks as a precaution or
obtain new ones, but were also assured that chances of an Iraqi
missile attack on Israel are very low.
	   During the 1991 Gulf War, Saddam fired 39 Scud missiles with
conventional warheads at Israel in hopes of breaking up the Arab
coalition against him. Israel did not retaliate.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was evasive Thursday
about whether Israel would strike back this time, saying only that
Israel reserved the right to defend itself.
	   Netanyahu emphasized that Israel is not a party to the conflict
with Iraq but has to be prepared for an Iraqi attack, just in case
Saddam does the unexpected.
	   ``Who knows what is going on in that man's brain?'' Netanyahu
said in an interview with Israel army radio. ``We have to be ready
for all eventualities, in case somebody tries to get us involved in
that conflict.''
	   U.S. officials informed Netanyahu on Wednesday afternoon that a
U.S. air strike on Iraq was imminent. Shortly after the attack
began, Netanyahu was told ``Operation Deser Fox'' was under way,
said the prime minister's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky.
	   On Tuesday, Netanyahu had also discussed the situation in the
Gulf with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Bushinsky said. The
conversation took place on the tarmac of Ben Gurion International
Airport near Tel Aviv, moments before Clinton left for the United
States after a three-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas.
	   In an early morning news conference Thursday, army generals
presented their assessment of the situation.
	   Brig. Gen. Amos Gilad, the head of research in Military
Intelligence, said that for now it was not in Saddam's interest to
attack Israel.
	   ``So long as there is no tangible threat to his survival .... he
will not attack Israel, so as not to become embroiled in another
front,'' said Gilad. ``But if he is on the brink of extinction, he
certainly may take suicidal steps involving the launching of a few
missiles against Israel.''
	   Gilad said that in spite of Iraq's denials, it still possesses a
few missile launchers, several dozen missiles and a chemical
warfare capability.
	   The army announced Thursday that it is reopening gas mask
distribution stations all over the country and called on the public
to check whether their gas masks were still serviceable or had to
be replaced.
	   Israel is much better prepared to deal with an Iraqi missile
attack than it was in 1991, a defense official said. Patriot
anti-missile missiles provided by the United States in 1991 proved
ineffectual against the Iraqi Scuds.
	   ``Today we have a satellite terminal which enables us to receive
early warning in a much shorter time and we are linked directly to
the American radar,'' said Avi Benayahu, adviser to Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   The radar system of the Arrow anti-missile missile, which Israel
is developing, is already operational, Benayahu told Israel radio.
The system, code-named Green Pine, is capable of tracking a
ballistic missile in flight, he said.
	   ``We also have something moving around in space which can see
all sorts of things,'' Benayahu said, in an apparent reference to
the Israeli satellite Amos.

U.N. prosecutor asks Russia for diplomatic backing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The chief prosecutor for the
Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has asked Russia for more diplomatic
backing in international efforts to bring Serb war crimes suspects
to justice.
	   Louise Arbour of Canada made the request earlier this week
during talks with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov at a peace
conference on Bosnia in Madrid, Spain.
	   ``I requested the meeting in part because of the increased
frequency and strength of their public comments ... with respect to
our use of sealed indictments,'' Arbour told reporters in The Hague
on Wednesday.
	   Russia has questioned the legality of the U.N. court's use of
so-called ``secret indictments,'' claiming they deprive suspects of
the right to turn themselves in and prevent governments from
arresting suspects.
	   Arbour dismissed the argument as having ``no air of reality in
the present context.''
	   The tribunal argues that sealed indictments are necessary,
particularly in the Serb-controlled section of Bosnia, because far
from arresting indicted suspects, authorities often shield them.
	   During her meeting with Ivanov on Monday, Arbour said she also
asked Russia to exert diplomatic pressure on Serb authorities in
Bosnia and Yugoslavia to arrest indicted suspects.
	   ``I did not come back with a commitment to that extent,'' she
said Wednesday.
	   Russia recently blocked the U.N. Security Council from taking
action against Yugoslavia for hindering the tribunal's work.
	   Diplomats said that Moscow, which has close religious and
cultural ties to Yugoslavia, even blocked a press statement from
the council president condemning Yugoslavia's defiance.

U.S. bombards Iraq through the night: 2 killed, 30 injured

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States bombarded Iraq Thursday
with waves of missile strikes, and Baghdad shook with explosions
and anti-aircraft gunfire. Two people were killed and 30 were
injured in the night-long assault, a doctor said.
	   At least one missile fell in an area near President Saddam
Hussein's biggest palace in Baghdad. The whereabouts of the
president were not known.
	   Witnesses said one more missile landed in the neighborhood of
al-Adil, about 2 kilometers (1 mile) from Abu Ghraib where a huge
military camp and radio relay stations are located.
	   Air raid sirens broke the night's silence minutes before a
barrage of anti-aircraft fire lit up the sky at 12:49 a.m. (2149
GMT Wednesday), unleashing thunderous blasts as if at a giant
fireworks show and shaking windows of buildings.
	   This was repeated four more times. As the sounds of the last
barrage at 5:18 a.m. (0218 GMT) was fading, a call for prayer
floated over the winter morning from a mosque loudspeaker.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said he ordered airstrikes on
military and security targets to retaliate for Iraq's defiance of
the United Nations Special Commission, which is responsible for
eliminating the country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he authorized the
participation of British forces.
	   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological weapons,'' Clinton
said.
	   President Saddam Hussein taunted the United States and Britain,
saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face'' but
``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the Aliyarmouk Hospital, said two
people were killed and more than 30 were injured, suffering mostly
burns in the face, hands and legs.
	   ``Where is this Clinton I wish I could get my hands on him,''
mumbled Salam Mohammed, 34, as he moaned on his hospital bed, his
face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Unlike previous attacks on the war-weary city, there was no
blackout. The streets were brightly lit, as were many homes when
the attack began.
	   At least two large blasts were heard and a huge fiery glow
filled the horizon. Smoke could be seen trailing into the dark sky

	   The total damage from the attack could not be immediately

Army: Saddam may strike Israel if brought to verge of collapse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Saddam Hussein may fire missiles with chemical
or biological warheads at Israel if U.S. air strikes bring him to
the verge of collapse, Israeli military commanders said Thursday.
	   Israelis were asked to check their gas masks as a precaution or
obtain new ones, but were also assured that chances of an Iraqi
missile attack on Israel are very low.
	   During the 1991 Gulf War, Saddam fired 39 Scud missiles with
conventional warheads at Israel in hopes of breaking up the Arab
coalition against him. Israel did not retaliate.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was evasive Thursday
about whether Israel would strike back this time, saying only that
Israel reserved the right to defend itself.
	   Netanyahu emphasized that Israel is not a party to the conflict
with Iraq but has to be prepared for an attack, just in case Saddam
does the unexpected.
	   ``Who knows what is going on in that man's brain?'' Netanyahu
said in an interview with Israel army radio. ``We have to be ready
for all eventualities, in case somebody tries to get us involved in
that conflict.''
	   U.S. officials informed Netanyahu on Wednesday afternoon that a
U.S. air strike on Iraq was imminent. Shortly after the attack
began, Netanyahu was told ``Operation Desert Fox'' was under way,
said the prime minister's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky.
	   On Tuesday, Netanyahu had also discussed the situation in the
Gulf with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Bushinsky said. The
conversation took place on the tarmac of Ben-Gurion International
Airport near Tel Aviv, moments before Clinton left for the United
States after a three-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas.
	   In an early morning news conference Thursday, army generals
presented their assessment of the situation.
	   Brig. Gen. Amos Gilad, the head of research in Military
Intelligence, said that for now it was not in Saddam's interest to
attack Israel.
	   ``So long as there is no tangible threat to his survival .... he
will not attack Israel, so as not to become embroiled in another
front,'' said Gilad. ``But if he is on the brink of extinction, he
certainly may take suicidal steps involving the launching of a few
missiles against Israel.''
	   Gilad said that in spite of Iraq's denials, it still possesses a
few missile launchers, several dozen missiles and a chemical
warfare capability.
	   The army announced Thursday that it is reopening gas mask
distribution stations all over the country and called on the public
to check whether their gas masks were still serviceable or had to
be replaced.

Dollar up against yen after attack on Iraq, Tokyo stocks lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar, bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar remained higher against the yen at
mid-afternoon Thursday after U.S. and British forces attacked Iraq
for defying U.N. arms inspectors. Japanese stocks finished mixed.
	   The dollar bought 116.02 yen, up 0.40 yen from Wednesday in
Tokyo but below its late New York level of 116.53 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 30.69 points,
or 0.22 percent, to close at 14,126.99. On Wednesday, the average
finished up 85.11 points, or 0.61 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar, considered a safe haven in
times of international unrest, briefly surged to as high as 117.17
yen following the military action.
	   Clinton said late Wednesday that he ordered a ``strong,
sustained series of airstrikes'' against Iraq in response to Saddam
Hussein's continued defiance of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   By midday Thursday, however, the dollar lost most of its gains
on notions that the conflict would likely be of limited duration,
dealers said. Market attention shifted back to Clinton's political
travails and concerns over the gaping U.S. trade deficit, they
said.
	   Kenji Karikomi, general manager at Daiwa Securities, said
currency trading was thin as many players retreated to the
sidelines to watch further developments in Iraq and the dollar's
reaction.
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei rebounded in late afternoon
trading after spending most of the day lower following an overnight
drop on Wall Street and the U.S. airstrikes.
	   In New York Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
32.70 points, closing at 8,790.60.
	   The air strikes against Iraq initially raised fears among stock
investors that recession-stricken Japan would face higher oil
costs, initially sending the Nikkei below the psychologically
important 14,000-point mark.
	   The Nikkei rallied in the final 20 minutes of afternoon trading,
however, on futures-led covering of short, or oversold, positions
as most investors were eyeing currency movements as an indicator of
developments in Iraq, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 2.53 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,090.86.
The TOPIX closed up 4.12 points, or 0.38 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond was quoted at 1.343 percent, up from Wednesday's
1.330-percent finish, pushing down its price to 103.83 yen from
103.96 yen.

Japan adopts high tariffs on rice imports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan decided Thursday to begin imposing high
tariffs on rice imports starting in April of next year, a
government official said.
	   The decision was officially made by representatives from the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, the Agriculture Ministry and the
Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives, said LDP official Koji
Hanai.
	   The tariff to be imposed on imported rice will be 351.17 yen
(dlrs 3.05) per kilogram in fiscal 1999, and 341 yen (dlrs 2.96)
per kilogram in and after fiscal 2000, Hanai said.
	   Under the tariff system, the highest-grade U.S.-grown
``Tamanishiki'' brand, which sells for 300 yen (dlrs 2.60) per
kilogram in the United States, would be sold at up to 651.17 yen
(dlrs 5.66) a kilogram in Japan, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   The United States and other foreign rice exporters have
expressed concern about Japan's plans to impose tariffs on rice
imports.
	   Earlier this week, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Thomas Foley warned
Japan against implementing a rice tariff, saying it could
``cripple'' imports of U.S. rice to Japan and cause a serious trade
disagreement.
	   Tokyo, however, has shrugged off foreign complaints on the rice
issue, saying the duty conforms with World Trade Organization
regulations.
	   The United States, China and Australia are among major rice
exporters to Japan, where foreign rice imports now account for
about 640,000 tons, or 6.4 percent of Japan's total annual
consumption.
	   Under a 1993 GATT trade agreement, Japan is committed to import
4 percent of its rice in 1995 and to gradually increase that amount
to 8 percent by 2000.
	   The Japanese government adopted an import tariff measure after
it judged it would ease a serious rice glut in coming years, local
news reports said.
	   Shoichi Nagagawa, Minister of the Agriculture, Fisheries and
Forestry, told a news confernece that the rice tariff was
calculated based on a ``transparency method'' and that
international understanding could be gained for the measrue, Kyodo
said.
	   Rice imports have long been a thorny issue in trade talks
between Japan and the United States.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's Cabinet is scheduled to officially
approve the tariffication at Friday's Cabinet meeting, Hanai said.
	   He said the government then will notify the Geneva-based World
Trade Organization about the move next week.

Paris criticizes air strikes and Iraqi intransigeance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Criticizing both Baghdad and Washington, France
early Thursday deplored ``the mechanics that led to the American
military strikes against Iraq and the grave human consequences they
could have on the Iraqi population.''
	   Paris also said it ``regrets that the Iraqi leaders were not
able to prove a complete spirit of cooperation'' called for in an
agreement they reached with with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
on Feb. 23.
	   That agreement ``would have rendered possible the complete
examination of Iraqi disarmament'' required by the United Nations
after the Gulf War, said the statement by the Foreign Ministry.
	   The statement was released after U.S. and British forces
overnight Wednesday launched an air strike on Iraqi targets after
Iraq blocked U.N. weapons inspectors from probing for evidence of
weapons of mass destruction.

Iraq still feeling aftermath of 1991 Gulf War
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Even before the latest allied military strike, Iraq was a
damaged nation, reeling from the effects of the Gulf War seven
years ago.
	   Power cuts last up to two hours a day in Baghdad, the capital,
and about twice as long in rural areas.
	   Damaged sewer lines leak, polluting drinking water supplies.
Diseases such as typhoid, cholera and polio _ almost nonexistent
before the war _ are back with a fatal vengeance.
	   Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh complains that ``95 percent
of our transport is obsolete'' and worries that the pollution from
old cars, buses and trucks ``is creating environmental problems we
never had before.''
	   Iraq says U.N. trade sanctions, imposed to punish the country
for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, have created such shortages that
5,000 children are dying every month from the effects of
malnourishment or ailments that can't be properly treated.
	   In a White House address Wednesday, President Bill Clinton said
the sanctions would remain in place until Iraq complies with U.N.
Security Council resolutions requiring it to destroy its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   The U.N.-approved oil-for-food program _ which since December
1996 has allowed Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil to buy needed
food and medicine _ was designed to alleviate some of the problems.
But Iraq complains often and loudly that supplies have been slow to
arrive.
	   The U.N. Children's Fund estimates that close to one in three
Iraqi children are malnourished.
	   But the fund's Phillipe Heffinck said in an interview that
oil-for-food has kept the situation from worsening.
	   ``What we see now is a stabilizing of the numbers'' of
malnourished children. He added: ``It's still unacceptably high,
but at least the situation isn't deteriorating.''
	   Other problems plague the country, which once was among the most
modern in the Middle East because of its oil wealth.
	   School attendance has dropped and illiteracy has risen. Car
theft and house burglaries are on the rise, and communication with
the outside world has been greatly reduced.
	   Most Iraqis see only state-run television and read state-run
newspapers. Few can afford the dlrs 230 needed for a travel permit,
and almost no one but aid workers comes into the country.
	   Western diplomats say Iraqis feel cut off from the world and
often don't understand international realities. This increases the
chance of miscommunication with western governments and the United
Nations.
	   The public does not openly blame Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for
their problems _ at least to reporters accompanied by government
``minders.'' Instead, many Iraqis blame the United States, which
Iraq regularly accuses of working to prolong the sanctions.
	   ``We are a rich country and we could feed ourselves,'' said Omar
Saleh, a 50-year-old merchant in the Shorja downtown market. ``Just
tell President Clinton to lift the embargo.''

early Thursday deplored ``the spiral of events that led to the
American military strikes against Iraq and the grave human
consequences they could have on the Iraqi population.''
	   Paris said it ``regrets that the Iraqi leaders were not able to
prove a complete spirit of cooperation'' called for in an agreement
they reached with with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Feb.
23.
	   The memorandum of understanding, signed during a trip by Annan
to Baghdad to head off an earlier crisis, allowed for unfettered
weapons inspections that averted U.S. and British air strikes.
	   That agreement ``would have rendered possible the complete
examination of Iraqi disarmament forseen in (U.N.) Security Council
Resolution 1194,'' the Foreign Ministry said. A green light after
the global examination was to get crippling sanctions lifted.
	   The statement Thursday was released after U.S. and British
forces overnight Wednesday launched an air strike on Iraqi targets
after Iraq blocked U.N. weapons inspectors from probing for weapons
of mass destruction following the 1990-92 Gulf War.
	   Before the air strikes, French government spokesman Daniel
Vaillant on Wednesday suggested that France wanted to avoid
military strikes ``at all cost.''
	   France, which in the past had fruitful trade relations with
Iraq, has wanted the U.N. Security Council to play the leading role
in the crisis, and hours ahead of the strikes expressed hope the
new dispute could be solved peacefully.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Igor Korolev scored twice during a four-goal
outburst in the second period as the Toronto Maple Leafs handed the
Phoenix Coyotes only their fourth loss of the season, 5-2 Wednesday
night.
	   Mats Sundin, Darby Hendrickson and Fredrik Modin also scored for
the Leafs, who are 12-1-1 against Western Conference clubs this
season.
	   Toronto became the first team this season to score five goals
against Phoenix, which has the NHL's top defense.
	   Jeremy Roenick and Oleg Tverdovsky scored for the Coyotes
(17-4-4), who played with injured star Keith Tkachuk.
 &UR; Devils 6, Rangers 3 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Jason Arnott scored two goals
and linemates Petr Sykora and Patrik Elias added three assists
apiece as the New Jersey Devils beat the New York Rangers.
	   Jay Pandolfo also had two goals and Sheldon Souray and Bobby
Holik each scored once as the Devils used a three-goal second
period to extend their season-high unbeaten streak to 6-0-2.
	   New Jersey, more offensive since Robbie Ftorek replaced Jacques
Lemaire as coach, has now scored at least five goals in each of its
last five games _ the first time that's happened in team history.
 &UR; Panthers 4, Penguins 1 &QC; 
	   In Sunrise, Florida, Ray Whitney and Bill Lindsay scored goals
47 seconds apart in the third period to help the Florida Panthers
beat the Pittsburgh Penguins.
	   Lindsay added an open-net goal with six seconds left, his fourth
of the season.
	   Scott Mellanby had a goal and two assists, including his 300th
career assist on the open-net goal, and Rob Niedermayer added two
assists for Florida.
 &UR; Red Wings 5, Bruins 3 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, defensemen Nick Lidstrom and Larry Murphy each
scored a goal as the Detroit Red Wings defeated the Boston Bruins.
	   Murphy (23 points) and Lidstrom (19) are two of the top scoring
defensemen in the league.
	   The Red Wings, who have won six straight at home, ended Boston's
three-game road winning streak. Chris Osgood made 23 saves,
improving his career record against Boston to 6-1.
 &UR; Mighty Ducks 6, Predators 1 &QC; 
	   In Anaheim, California, Teemu Selanne and Travis Green each had
two goals and an assist as the Anaheim Mighty Ducks beat the
Nashville Predators.
	   Anaheim goalie Guy Hebert lost his bid for a third consecutive
shutout with 4:06 remaining. He had stopped 113 straight shots _
over a span of 191 minutes and 37 seconds _ before Nashville's
Denny Lambert knocked in a rebound on the Predators' 36th shot of
the game.
	   Hebert finished with 38 saves for the Mighty Ducks, who tied a
club record with four power-play goals. Paul Kariya had four
assists _ all in the second period _ and Steve Rucchin added a goal
and two assists for Anaheim.

Polaroid announces at least 600 additional layoffs

<TEXT>
	   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) _ Declining sales of film and camera
equipment, blamed on overseas economic problems, will cost another
600 to 700 employees at Polaroid Corp. their jobs over the next
year and a half.
	   Company officials said Wednesday the layoffs are caused by
unprofitable operations in Russia, Latin America and the Pacific
Rim.
	   Many Russian vendors have been unable to pay Polaroid for
products sent to them, spokeswoman Nancy Childs said. Film that has
gone unsold there has been thrown out or returned to the company.
	   Representing about 7 percent of Polaroid's work force, the
layoffs will be primarily in manufacturing, sales, general and
administrative operations.
	   The news came a year to the day after Polaroid's last round of
layoffs were made public _ 1,500 people, mostly in Massachusetts
manufacturing.
	   Polaroid makes instant photographic cameras and films; digital
imaging hardware, software and media; and an array of other
products.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Russia and China angrily denounced Wednesday's
U.S.-British attack on Iraq, while allies such as Germany and
Canada offered their immediate support, placing all blame on Saddam
Hussein.
	   Meanwhile, Arab nations remained noticeably silent.
	   Iraq's neighbor, Iran, joined Russia and China in blasting the
use of force and warning that it could shatter regional security.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin demanded an immediate end to the
military campaign.
	   ''Nobody has the right to act on their own in the name of the
United Nations and even less to pretend to be the judge of the
entire world,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said from
Madrid, Spain.
	   China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasen was visibly angry when he
emerged from a Security Council session Wednesday evening, learning
of the attack only after the fact.
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' he said.
	   The German government noted, however, that the Iraqi leadership
``had been warned'' the international community would have to act
if it failed to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   ``The federal government regrets that, in the face of the
attitude of the Iraqi leadership, it had to come now to the use of
military measures,'' its statement said.
	   Support for the airstrikes also poured in from Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Spain.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has brought this crisis on himself,'' Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said.
	   France, which has close ties to Iraq, deplored ''the grave human
consequences'' of the military strikes, but added its regret that
Iraqi leaders were unable to ''show proof of the spirit of complete
cooperation'' demanded by previous agreements with the United
Nations.
	   While Iranian television quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as
saying that ''such unilateral attacks against Iraq will lead to
even more pain and misery for the people of that country and will
bring about insecurity in the region.''
	   Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi urged the U.N. Security Council to
take immediate action to prevent ``further deterioration'' of the
situation, television reported. Iran also called on Baghdad to
cooperate with the United Nations.
	   Foreign ministry officials in Pakistan were in meetings to draft
a response to the attack.
	   Airstrikes against Iraq led news reports in Lebanon. All
newspaper, radio and television stations carried news agency
reports without comment.
	   In Indonesia, the world's most populous Islamic nation, leaders
pleaded for restraint.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was noncommittal,
saying, ``Israel is outside the dispute, and in any case will take
care of defending itself if the need arises.''
	   Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka backed the United
States and Britain, saying, ``We strongly demand that Iraq
immediately and unconditionally implement the U.N. Security
Council's resolutions.''
	   He was seconded by Misao Nozaki, a 47-year-old Tokyo restaurant
owner who called the bombing justified ``because Iraq has continued
developing nuclear weapons in a way that goes against the common
sense of the rest of the world.''
	   But Yukari Ohi, 38, an office worker in Tokyo, said she opposed
the use of force.
	   ``I think the U.S. decision to attack Iraq was apparently
intended to shift attention from the impeachment issue to war,''
Ohi said, noting that the airstrikes came as U.S. President Bill
Clinton faced an impeachment vote.
	   India condemned the attack, while Mexico expressed
disappointment.
	   In Britain, the country's largest-selling tabloid, The Sun, got
behind the attack, saying in a Thursday editorial, ``Saddam must be
crushed. Blitz about time too.'' But about 30 demonstrators
disagreed, protesting outside the prime minister's Downing Street
residence.
	   Members of the U.S. Congress generally endorsed the bombing,
while noting that it conveniently took the spotlight off the
Clinton impeachment proceedings.

Handled properly, IOC can emerge strongly from scandal: Sydney
</HEADLINE>
organizers &QL; 
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ With the International Olympic
Committee embroiled in a corruption scandal and a world summit in
February set to discuss sports doping, Sydney 2000 organizers
denied Thursday they had been handed a poisoned chalice.
	   The three senior officers of the Sydney Organizing Committee for
the Olympic Games (SOCOG) said that if the twin scandals of
corruption in the host city bidding process and drugs in sport were
handled correctly, the Olympic movement could emerge stronger by
the time of the Sydney games.
	   ``There is every intention (that the) IOC is moving swiftly in
relation to this matter, so it is not going to be a running sore,
it will not linger,'' said Sandy Hollway, SOCOG chief executive.
	   ``It is highly likely that if we cast our minds forward to
February or March we will have seen an effective inquiry into the
corruption matters and we will have seen and effective and
intelligent attack on the doping issue.
	   ``If the IOC is able to respond intelligently to them, then (the
IOC) will come out of this stronger, fast.''
	   Dissenting sports face the possibility of being thrown out of
the Olympics.
	   At a summit in Lausanne in February, the IOC will seek uniform
support from international sporting federations for a series of
anti-doping measures, including a minimum two-year suspension for a
first major offense and life for a second.
	   IOC member Marc Hodler cast the Olympic world into turmoil with
claims that the Olympics have been systematically bought and sold
and that some IOC members accepted money or favors in return for
their votes.
	   The IOC has launched an investigation into the successful bid by
Salt Lake City, Utah for the 2002 Winter Olympics after organizers
disclosed they had made payments of nearly U.S. dlrs 400,000 in
scholarship funds to 13 people, including six relatives of IOC
members.
	   Hodler has called the process corrupt and claims as many as 25
members might have received favors or cash for votes in four recent
elections to choose sites for the games.
	   SOCOG said Thursday that Sydney should not be tarnished by
Hodler's corruption allegations.
	   ``Marc Hodler was asked to put up or shut up about Sydney and he
has shut up,'' said president Michael Knight. ``There is no taint
on Sydney, even from Marc Hodler.''
	   He said public support for the games had not faltered because of
the scandal, but ``anything that reflects negatively on the
Olympics doesn't help Sydney.
	   ``The sooner this is resolved and off the agenda the better.''
	   Knight said he was confident the IOC scandal would not deter
sponsors from the Sydney games.
	   SOCOG is facing problems meeting its U.S. dlrs 1.64 billion
budget. Its marketing boss, John Moore, has said SOCOG is almost
U.S. dlrs 124 million short of its corporate-sponsorship goal of
U.S. dlrs 542 million.
	   ``We are very confident we will raise our money and we are
confident that this matter will be resolved quickly by the IOC,''
Knight said.
	   John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee and
SOCOG vice-president, said he supported a proposal to remove the
host city vote from all of the IOC more than 100 members to reduce
the potential for corruption.
	   ``I think there is a good chance (this will happen),'' he said.
	   Knight said the Salt Lake City scandal must be dealt with before
the anti-doping summit.
	   ``Clearly they need to be seen to have their own house in order
before they start talking to athletes about their behavior,'' he
said.

Netanyahu: Clinton raised possibility of attack on Tuesday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout with new Netanyahu quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton raised the
possibility of a U.S. attack on Iraq already on Tuesday, as he was
about to be told Iraq was not cooperating with U.N. weapons
inspectors, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday.
	   At the time, Netanyahu was standing with Clinton on the tarmac
of Ben-Gurion International Airport, waiting to see him off after a
three-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas.
	   Asked by Israel army radio whether at that time Clinton talked
to him about a possible attack on Iraq, Netanyahu said: ``Yes, we
talked about this possibility.''
	   ``He told me that he was about to get a very difficult report by
(chief U.N. weapons inspector) Richard Butler on Iraq's failure to
fullfil its commitments, and that it apparently would obligate him
to act,'' Netanyahu said of his conversation with Clinton.
	   Netanyahu said Israel does not want to get involved in a new
confrontation between the United States and Iraq, but reserves the
right to defend itself if attacked by Saddam Hussein.
	   ``Israel is prepared for every possibility. We are not part of
this conflict. We have no intention of being part of this conflict,
but we are preparding for every eventuality,'' Netanyahu told
Israel radio.
	   ``Who knows what is going on in that man's brain?'' he told army
radio.
	   During the 1991 Gulf War, Saddam fired 39 Scud missiles with
conventional warheads at Israel in hopes of breaking up the Arab
coalition against him. Israel did not retaliate.
	   Israeli military commanders said Saddam may fire missiles with
chemical or biological warheads at Israel if U.S. air strikes,
which began Wednesday night, bring him to the verge of collapse.
	   Israelis were asked to check their gas masks as a precaution or
obtain new ones, but were also assured by army officials that
chances of an Iraqi missile attack on Israel are very low.
	   Brig. Gen. Amos Gilad, the head of research in Military
Intelligence, said that for now it was not in Saddam's interest to
attack Israel.
	   ``So long as there is no tangible threat to his survival .... he
will not attack Israel, so as not to become embroiled in another
front,'' said Gilad. ``But if he is on the brink of extinction, he
certainly may take suicidal steps involving the launching of a few
missiles against Israel.''
	   Gilad said that in spite of Iraq's denials, it still possesses a
few missile launchers, several dozen missiles and a chemical
warfare capability.
	   The army announced Thursday that it is reopening gas mask
distribution stations all over the country and called on the public
to check whether their gas masks were still serviceable or had to
be replaced.
	   Israel is much better prepared to deal with an Iraqi missile
attack than it was in 1991, a defense official said. Patriot
anti-missile missiles provided by the United States in 1991 proved
ineffectual against the Iraqi Scuds.
	   ``Today we have a satellite terminal which enables us to receive
early warning in a much shorter time and we are linked directly to
the American radar,'' said Avi Benayahu, adviser to Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   The radar system of the Arrow anti-missile missile, which Israel
is developing, is already operational, Benayahu told Israel radio.
The system, code-named Green Pine, is capable of tracking a
ballistic missile in flight, he said.
	   ``We also have something moving around in space which can see
all sorts of things,'' Benayahu said, in an apparent reference to
the Israeli satellite Amos.

Yeltsin in Kremlin, will meet with Belarusian, Swiss president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin was working at the Kremlin
on Thursday, monitoring the situation in Iraq and preparing for
separate meetings with the leaders of Belarus and Switzerland, his
press center said.
	   Yeltsin has made a number of public appearances since he was
released from a hospital a week ago to finish recovering from
pneumonia. He had received treatment for more than two weeks.
	   Yeltsin was up for much of the night monitoring the situation in
Iraq, according to aides. He condemned the attacks on Baghdad by
the United States and Great Britain.
	   The president met Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Chief of

Yeltsin in Kremlin, will meet with Belarusian, Swiss president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin was working at the Kremlin
on Thursday, monitoring the situation in Iraq and preparing for
separate meetings with the leaders of Belarus and Switzerland, his
press center said.
	   Yeltsin has made a number of public appearances since he was
released from a hospital a week ago to finish recovering from
pneumonia. He had received treatment for more than two weeks.
	   Yeltsin was up for much of the night monitoring the situation in
Iraq, according to aides. He condemned the attacks on Baghdad by
the United States and Great Britain.
	   The president met Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Chief of
Staff Nikolai Bordyuzha to discuss Iraq, as well as Russia's
pressing economic problems.
	   He was to meet with Swiss President Flavio Cotti, in Russia on a
three-day visit. They were expected to discuss economic crimes,
among other things.

East Timorese protest as U.N. envoy meets jailed rebel chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 1,000 pro-independence
protesters waved rebel flags and chanted anti-Indonesian slogans
outside East Timor's local Parliament Thursday as a U.N. special
envoy held talks with a guerrilla commander in a Jakarta prison.
	   Shops and schools were closed in the provincial capital, Dili,
as tensions rose ahead of planned visit by U.N. diplomat Jamsheed
Marker on the weekend.
	   Speaking to reporters outside of Cipinang Prison in Jakarta,
Marker said negotiations over the future of the troubled territory
would succeed only if secessionists and Indonesian troops stopped
fighting.
	   Marker said he had ``a very useful and productive meeting'' with
jailed rebel chief Xanana Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence
for opposing Indonesian troops.
	   The two met for an hour and exchanged views on the situation in
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony invaded by Indonesia in
1975.
	   Despite his imprisonment, Gusmao is regarded internationally as
a key player in moves to secure peace for his homeland.
	   Long-running talks between Indonesia and Portugal and chaired by
Marker were revitalized earlier this year when Jakarta offered to
grant autonomy to East Timor.
	   In exchange, Indonesia wants international recognition of its
sovereignty over the half-island territory of 800,000 people.
	   Marker said negotiations were heading in ``the right
direction.''
	   ``But the important thing is to maintain a peaceful climate
because negotiations are in an advanced stage,'' Marker said.
	   East Timor, about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of
Jakarta, has been wracked by guerrilla war and human rights abuses
since it was annexed as Indonesia's 27th province in 1976.
	   Clashes between guerrillas and Indonesian troops have increased
in recent weeks despite the U.N. talks. Protests by
pro-independence activists have also grown in size and frequency.
	   Five East Timor protesters tried to drape Marker's car with a
rebel flag before he drove away from the prison.
	   Thursday's protest in Dili was noisy but peaceful.
	   The demonstrators called for a total withdrawal of Indonesian
troops and for the holding of a referendum on independence
-something the Indonesian government has ruled out.
	   They also demanded the release of Gusmao and other East Timorese
political prisoners.
	   The official Antara news agency Wednesday quoted Gusmao as
saying he would agree to Indonesia's autonomy plan as long as a
referendum was held after 10 years.
	   Meanwhile Marker declined to comment on a report from Portugal
that radicals within the rebel movement planned to kidnap him
during his forthcoming visit to East Timor.
	   The territory's military commander Col. Tono Suratman downplayed
the threat and said no extra security measures had been in place to
protect Marker when he arrives on Saturday.
	   ``I don't believe it. The people of East Timor want Marker to
help find a peaceful solution to their problems,'' he said.
	   Marker visited East Timor last July and was heavily guarded by
Indonesian troops when he held talks with local community leaders
at a remote air force base.
	   During an earlier visit in March 1997, Indonesian soldiers shot
and killed two pro-independence protesters at a rally outside a
hotel where the envoy was staying.

	   CANBERA, Australia (AP) _ England completed a morale-boosting
16-run victory over the Prime Ministers XI in Thursday's cricket

	   The Englishmen bowled out the Prime Ministers combination for
209.
	   Tasmanian Daniel Marsh top-scored for the Prime Ministers team

Anwar's former official residence raided
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes from court
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian police searched jailed
politician Anwar Ibrahim's former official residence and took away
mattresses and pillows, the trial court was told Thursday.
	   The chief defense lawyer said police went to the former deputy
prime minister's official residence on Wednesday, one day after
prosecutors produced a semen-stained mattress in court as evidence
of his alleged illegal sex acts.
	   ``I understand from my client that his former residence was
raided by police yesterday afternoon,'' Raja Aziz Adrusse told the
court. No details were available.
	   Musa Hassan, the assistant commissioner of police who
investigated the accusations of sodomy, adultery and abuse of power
against Anwar, confirmed that the search occurred, but said it was
not related to the 10 charges that Anwar faces.
	   Musa was giving his testimony as the prosecution's 13th witness.
	   Anwar has denied all the accusations against him, saying they
were cooked up to eliminate his challenge to Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule.
	   Musa, who led the investigations against Anwar, said there was
no high-level conspiracy, as the defense is trying to prove.
	   ``My investigations do not indicate the existence of a political
conspiracy to topple Anwar,'' Musa said. ``But my investigations
reveal the existence of a conspiracy by Anwar and other individuals
to block the process of justice.''
	   At this point the judge interjected. ``This is for the court to
decide.''
	   ``Anwar used the government's machinery, that is, the police, to
protect himself,'' Musa continued.
	   Musa said he did not get statements from Mahathir and his top
advisor, Daim Zainuddin, seen as a key Anwar rival, because he
believed the two played only ``minimal roles.''
	   ``Daim didn't play a big role,'' said Musa, adding that Daim met
with the author of a letter accusing Anwar of sexual misconduct.
Daim delivered the letter to the prime minister. No further details
were provided.
	   On Tuesday, prosecutors dragged a mattress into the courtroom.
They said it was seized from a Kuala Lumpur apartment which they
alleged had been used by Anwar for his secret sexual escapades,
including sleeping with his former secretary's wife.
	   But the defense said there was no proof that it was a mattress
that was used by Anwar. Police said they had conducted a DNA test
on the semen stains on the mattress, but the results were not
disclosed.
	   On Thursday, Musa also testified that Anwar's adopted brother,
Sukma Dermawan, had told him about a ``homosexual relationship''
between the two.
	   ``Sukma told me that he and Anwar had been enmeshed in a
homosexual affair,'' Musa told the court.
	   Musa's latest testimony was meant to rebut defense claims that
police had coerced Sukma into confessing that he was sodomized by
Anwar.
	   ``Sukma on his own free will wanted to tell me about his
activities with Anwar,'' Musa said. ``In our meeting, Sukma agreed
to give a statement on video tape.'' He said Sukma's guilty plea
was voluntary.
	   Sukma has said in a statement from jail that police broke down
his resolve by conducting a painful examination of his genitalia,
Anwar's lawyer told the court on Wednesday.
	   Sukma, 38, is serving a six-month sentence, along with Anwar's
speech writer, Munawar Ahmad Anees, who also pleaded guilty to
having sex with Anwar.
	   Both men are now appealing their convictions on the grounds that
police coerced their confessions.
	   The government's case was prompted by accusations by Ummi
Hafilda Ali, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, and Azizan Abu
Bakar, a former driver for the politician's family.
	   Ummi wrote a letter in 1997 alleging sexual misconduct that was
submitted to Mahathir. Police investigations concluded the charges
were spurious and exonerated Anwar. Mahathir halted the
investigations last August.
	   But Musa began investigating the case afresh this year after a
book containing all the accusations was published.

It's time to set the record straight says Azhar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Assocaited Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ Captain Mohammad Azharuddin says
it's time to set the record straight and improve India's image in
test cricket in New Zealand.
	   Azharuddin, in his second stint as captain, is confident India
has the resources to beat New Zealand in the three-test series
starting at Carisbrook Friday.
	   ``We have one of the best top six batsmen in test cricket and
bowlers for any conditions,'' Azharuddin said Thursday on the eve
of the first test.
	   ``We will try and break the hoodoo on this tour. We have drawn a
lot of confidence from the two first-class games before the test
unlike on our previous visits here.''
	   India has not beaten New Zealand in a series away from home
since 1968 when Nawab Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi led his side to a 3-1
win.
	   India is fresh from a victory over Wellington in a four-day
match and Azharuddin felt his key batsmen were getting the ``feel''
of the different pitches under cold conditions here.
	   ``The batsmen are getting behind the line much better,''
Azharuddin said.
	   This is India's sixth visit to New Zealand in three decades and
Azharuddin want to win a test series here with his young side.
	   Meanwhile, New Zealand coach Steve Rixon says reputations will
count for nothing when the match begins.
	   Rixon says Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid are two of the
top-three-ranked batsmen in the world, but says when they play away
from home, they don't always bat as well.
	   Rixon believes the hard, bouncy Carisbrook wicket will upset the
Indian batsmen and the bitterly cold weather that hit the region
late Wednesday was a bonus.
	   ``They don't see the ball bouncing in the sub-continent so that
should be to our advantage, and let's face it, we suffer in the
heat over there so they can play in the cool here,'' Rixon said
Thursday.
	   New Zealand's four-pronged pace attack is likely to have first
use of the pitch Friday. New Zealand will bowl if captain Stephen
Fleming calls correctly but the Indian camp is concerned about the
lack of moisture in the pitch and are leaning towards batting
first.
	   The only hiccup in New Zealand's buildup came when Simon Doull
was ruled out with a strained calf and replaced by leftarmer Shayne
O'Connor.
	   Teams:
	   NEW ZEALAND: Stephen Fleming (captain), Matthew Horne, Matthew
Bell, Nathan Astle, Craig McMillan, Adam Parore, Chris Cairns, Dion
Nash, Daniel Vettori, Shayne O'Connor, Geoff Allott, Paul Wiseman
(one to be omitted).
	   INDIA: Mohammad Azharuddin (captain), Navjot Sidhu, Ajay Jadeja,
Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Saurav Ganguly, Nayan Mongia, Anil
Kumble, Javagal Srinath, Venkatesh Prasad, Harbhajan Singh,
Debashish Mohanty (one to be omitted).
	   Umpires: Steve Dunne, Edward Nicholls. Third umpire: Evan
Watkin. (kam/djp)

Netanyahu: Clinton raised possibility of attack on Tuesday

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton raised the
possibility of an attack on Iraq on Tuesday, before he was told
Iraq was not cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday.
	   At the time, Netanyahu was standing with Clinton on the tarmac
of Ben-Gurion International Airport, waiting to see him off after a
three-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas.
	   Asked by Israel army radio whether at that time Clinton talked
to him about a possible attack on Iraq, Netanyahu said: ``Yes, we
talked about this possibility.''
	   ``He told me that he was about to get a very difficult report by
(chief U.N. weapons inspector) Richard Butler on Iraq's failure to
fulfill its commitments, and that it apparently would obligate him
to act,'' Netanyahu said of his conversation with Clinton.
	   Netanyahu said Israel does not want to get involved in a new
confrontation between the United States and Iraq, but reserves the
right to defend itself if attacked by Saddam Hussein.
	   ``Israel is prepared for every possibility. We are not part of
this conflict. We have no intention of being part of this conflict,
but we are preparing for every eventuality,'' Netanyahu told Israel
radio.
	   ``Who knows what is going on in that man's brain?'' he told army
radio.
	   During the 1991 Gulf War, Saddam fired 39 Scud missiles with
conventional warheads at Israel in hopes of breaking up the Arab
coalition against him. Israel did not retaliate.
	   Israeli military commanders said Saddam may fire missiles with
chemical or biological warheads at Israel if U.S. airstrikes, which
began Wednesday night, bring him to the verge of collapse.
	   Israelis were asked to check their gas masks as a precaution or
obtain new ones, but were also assured by army officials that
chances of an Iraqi missile attack on Israel are very low.
	   Brig. Gen. Amos Gilad, the head of research in Military
Intelligence, said that for now it was not in Saddam's interest to
attack Israel.
	   ``So long as there is no tangible threat to his survival .... he
will not attack Israel, so as not to become embroiled in another
front,'' said Gilad. ``But if he is on the brink of extinction, he
certainly may take suicidal steps involving the launching of a few
missiles against Israel.''
	   Gilad said that in spite of Iraq's denials, it still possesses a
few missile launchers, several dozen missiles and a chemical
warfare capability.
	   The army announced Thursday that it is reopening gas mask
distribution stations all over the country and called on the public
to check whether their gas masks were still serviceable or had to
be replaced.
	   Israel is much better prepared to deal with an Iraqi missile
attack than it was in 1991, a defense official said. Patriot
anti-missile missiles provided by the United States in 1991 proved
ineffectual against the Iraqi Scuds.
	   ``Today we have a satellite terminal which enables us to receive
early warning in a much shorter time and we are linked directly to
the American radar,'' said Avi Benayahu, adviser to Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   The radar system of the Arrow anti-missile missile, which Israel
is developing, is already operational, Benayahu told Israel radio.
The system, code-named Green Pine, is capable of tracking a
ballistic missile in flight, he said.
	   ``We also have something moving around in space which can see
all sorts of things,'' Benayahu said, in an apparent reference to
the Israeli satellite Amos.

China says it was offered money to throw Asian Games medals

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chinese athletes were offered bribes to
lose in gold medal matches at the Asian Games, a senior Chinese
sports official said Thursday.
	   Li Furong, deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation, said
more than one person offered bribes to Chinese athletes and that
the athletes refused, saying they wouldn't throw a medal even for
U.S. dlrs 100,000.
	   ``Some people tried to use money to buy gold medals,'' Li said
in a telephone interview. ``It wasn't just once.''
	   ``Of course, the athletes refused,'' he added.
	   Li refused to give details about the bribes or say what
countries, sports or people were involved. He first mentioned the
bribes at a news conference for Chinese reporters, and said in the
interview that he brought the issue to light to show that Chinese
athletes were clean, not to shame others.
	   The president of the Olympic Council of Asia, Sheikh Ahmad
Al-Sabah, told The Associated Press that he has asked the Chinese
to provide the names of people who allegedly offered bribes.
	   ``This is a very serious matter, if true,'' Al-Sabah said.
``Right now it is only a rumor and to nail this rumor we have asked
the Chinese to give us the names of people and countries who made
the offer.
	   ``We are studying the whole matter very carefully and if and
when we get the names, we will order a full-fledged investigation.
But we have to wait until the Chinese give us the names,'' he said.
	   Earlier, Li, the deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation
said that in refusing the bribes, Chinese athletes declared, ``If
you give me 100,000 American dollars I won't do it.''
	   ``Some athletes also said I'm not here for money but for the
glory of the country,'' Li added.
	   Asked how he felt about his athletes' response, Li said, ``Of
course I'm happy.''

U.S. bombards Iraq through the night: 2 killed, 30 injured

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States fired hundreds of
missiles on Iraq Thursday in attacks that lasted through the night,
and Baghdad shook with explosions and anti-aircraft gunfire. Two
people were killed and 30 were injured, a doctor said.
	   Russia and China called for an immediate halt to the attacks,
but U.S. officials suggested the strikes may continue.
	   In the Iraqi capital, employees of government offices went to
their offices and young children headed to school in scenes that
gave little indication of the nightlong blitz. Morning traffic jams
clogged some of the streets in downtown Baghdad.
	   Air raid sirens broke the night's silence minutes before a
barrage of anti-aircraft fire lit up the Baghdad sky at 12:49 a.m.
(2149 GMT Wednesday), unleashing thunderous blasts like a fireworks
display and shaking windows of buildings.
	   At least one missile fell in an area near President Saddam
Hussein's biggest palace in Baghdad, but the whereabouts of the
president were not known. A speech by Saddam was broadcast on Iraqi
radio hours after the first attack.
	   Witnesses said another missile landed in the neighborhood of
al-Adil, about two kilometers (one mile) from Abu Ghraib where a
sprawling military camp and radio relay stations are located.
	   One stray missile hit an Iranian city, Tehran radio reported.
	   Sirens went off four times during the night. As the sounds of
the last barrage at 5:18 a.m. (0218 GMT) faded, a call for prayer
floated over the winter morning from a mosque loudspeaker.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said he ordered the strikes on
military and security targets to retaliate for Iraq's defiance of
the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for eliminating
the country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological weapons,'' he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he authorized the
participation of British forces.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in his radio
address, saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face''
but ``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the Aliyarmouk Hospital in Baghdad,
said two people were killed and more than 30 were wounded,
suffering mostly burns in the face, hands and legs. But the full
casualty toll was not known, and there was no official word.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
mumbled Salam Mohammed, 34, as he moaned on his hospital bed, his
face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Unlike a previous U.S. attacks on the city in 1993, there was no
blackout this time. The streets were brightly lit, as were many
homes when the attack began.
	   The total damage from the attack could not be immediately
assessed. Iraqi officials took reporters to Karada, a mixed
commercial and residential neighborhood, where a missile had
landed, bursting water mains in a street.
	   A two kilometer (one mile) stretch of the street was flooded.
	   Karada is across the Tigris River from the Old Presidential
Complex, but it was not clear if the palace was damaged.
	   In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain for the attack and demanded an immediate end to
the campaign, warning it could shatter regional security.
	   ``Russia demands an immediate end to military action, to show
common sense and restraint and not to allow further escalation of
the conflict,'' Yeltsin said in a statement issued Thursday.
	   At a Security Council meeting, the ambassadors of Russia and
China, both sympathetic to Iraq, urged an end to the attacks.
	   Staunch American allies _ Germany, Canada and even Japan _
supported the strikes.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the events a ``sad day
for the world,'' saying he did everything in his power to seek
peace. But he didn't say whether the attacks were justified.
	   In his speech, Clinton said the campaign against Iraq will be a
``strong sustained series of airstrikes,'' indicating that more
punishing strikes are likely in the next few days.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   In the attacks, the warships fired hundreds of Tomahawk cruise
missiles, and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck against Iraqi air
defense radars, Pentagon officials said.
	   The United States hopes the attacks will achieve what the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, says it has not been able to achieve
in seven years of work: destroy Iraq's ability to produce weapons
of mass destruction, specifically chemical and biological arms.
	   ``Instead of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam is
disarming the inspectors,'' Clinton said.
	   The U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until the
inspectors certify that Iraq is free of chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles and programs to build them.
	   Iraq accuses the chief inspector, Richard Butler, of being a
U.S. puppet who is deliberately prolonging the sanctions.
	   Butler withdrew all his weapons inspectors from Baghdad on
Wednesday, accusing Iraq of going back on its promise last month to
cooperate fully with UNSCOM. That promise had saved Iraq from an
imminent U.S. attack on Nov. 14.
	   Butler cited Iraq's recent refusal to allow a team of inspectors
into a headquarters of the ruling Baath Party. He also said Iraq
was obstructing and evading the inspectors.
	   The complaints were used by the United States and Britain as the
necessary provocation for the airstrikes.
	   Many of the U.N. humanitarian staff remained in Iraq, and their
spokesman, George Somerwill, said they had received no instructions
to evacuate. He said 133 U.N. staff had stayed in Baghdad and 233
staff remained in northern Iraq.
	   ``We are still waiting for instructions from New York,'' he
said.

Agency downgrades two banks' credit ratings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A top credit rating agency downgraded the
ratings of two Hong Kong banks on Thursday and warned that problem
loans could continue to grow in the recession-plagued city.
	   Moody's Investors Service downgraded its financial strength
rating and long-term debt and deposit ratings on Bank of East Asia
Ltd. The agency also lowered its financial strength rating on Wing
Hang Bank Ltd.
	   ``The Hong Kong economy is still vulnerable to external
shocks,'' the agency said in a statement.
	   ``Weakness in domestic demand and high property prices, even
after the adjustments seen over the last year, suggest that it may
be some time before economic growth has returned to its recent
pace,'' it added.
	   Property prices have halved from their peaks last year as Asia's
financial crisis swept Hong Kong into recession.
	   The once-robust economy shrank by 7 percent in the third quarter
this year and is forecast to contract by 5 percent for all of 1998.
	   Economists say the recession won't turn around until the second
half of next year at the earliest.
	   ``Problem loans should continue to accumulate over the medium
term, although at a slower pace,'' Moody's said. The banking
system's non-performing loans may reach as high as 8 percent to 10
percent, it said.
	   However, the agency said Hong Kong banks could withstand a
deeper downturn because they have strong capital bases and strong
earnings.
	   It also said Hong Kong banks are well-regulated and that the
legal system here allows for speedy enforcement of claims.
	   After the review, Moody's also confirmed the ratings of Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp., Hong Kong's largest, Hang Seng
Bank, Dao Heng Bank Group Ltd., Shanghai Commercial Bank and Wing
Lung Bank Ltd.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A missile from the U.S.-British attack on
Iraq Thursday fell on city of Khorramshahr in southern Iran, Tehran
radio reported.
	   The state-run radio gave no details. But a resident reached in
the city by telephone said that the windows of several buildings
were shattered.
	   The resident, who did not want his name used, said he did not
know if anyone had been injured or killed.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which is
headquartered in the Gulf state of Bahrain, refused to comment
about the Iranian report, saying all comments would have to come
from the U.S. Defense Department in Washington.
	   Khorramshahr is about 40 kilometers (25 kilometers) east of
Basra in Iraq, a large port city with major oil facilities.
	   An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman warned Thursday that air
strikes against Iraq would bring ``pain and misery'' to Iraq's
people and urged Baghdad to cooperate with the United Nations.
	   Relations between Iran and Iraq are still tense after their
1980-88 war, which killed or injured an estimated 1 million people.
But Iran has always been against military strikes against Iraq.

	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   In the attacks, the warships fired hundreds of Tomahawk cruise
missiles, and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck against Iraqi air
defense radars, Pentagon officials said.
	   The United States hopes the attacks will achieve what the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, says it has not been able to achieve
in seven years of work: destroy Iraq's ability to produce weapons
of mass destruction, specifically chemical and biological arms.
	   ``Instead of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam is
disarming the inspectors,'' Clinton said.
	   The U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until the
inspectors certify that Iraq is free of chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles and programs to build them.
	   Iraq accuses the chief inspector, Richard Butler, of being a
U.S. puppet who is deliberately prolonging the sanctions.
	   Butler withdrew all his weapons inspectors from Baghdad on
Wednesday, accusing Iraq of going back on its promise last month to
cooperate fully with UNSCOM. That promise had saved Iraq from an
imminent U.S. attack on Nov. 14.
	   Butler cited Iraq's recent refusal to allow a team of inspectors
into a headquarters of the ruling Baath Party. He also said Iraq
was obstructing and evading the inspectors.
	   Many of the U.N. humanitarian staff remained in Iraq, and their
spokesman, George Somerwill, said they had received no instructions
to evacuate. He said 133 U.N. staff had stayed in Baghdad and 233
staff remained in northern Iraq.
	   ``We are still waiting for instructions from New York,'' he
said.

U.S. bombards Iraq through the night: 2 killed, 30 injured

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States fired hundreds of
missiles on Iraq Thursday in attacks that lasted through the night,
and Baghdad shook with explosions and anti-aircraft gunfire. Two
people were killed and 30 were injured, a doctor said.
	   Russia and China called for an immediate halt to the attacks,
but U.S. officials suggested the strikes may continue.
	   In the Iraqi capital, government employees went to their offices
and young children headed to school in scenes that gave little
indication of the night-long blitz. Morning traffic jams clogged
some of the streets in downtown Baghdad.
	   Air raid sirens broke the night's silence minutes before a
barrage of anti-aircraft fire lit up the Baghdad sky at 12:49 a.m.
(2149 GMT Wednesday), unleashing thunderous blasts like a fireworks
display and shaking building windows.
	   At least one missile fell in an area near President Saddam
Hussein's biggest palace in Baghdad, but the whereabouts of the
president were not known. A speech by Saddam was broadcast on Iraqi
radio hours after the first attack.
	   Witnesses said another missile landed in the neighborhood of
al-Adil, about two kilometers (one mile) from Abu Ghraib where a
sprawling military camp and radio relay stations are located.
	   One stray missile hit an Iranian city, Tehran radio reported.
There were no immediate reports of injuries.
	   Sirens went off four times during the night. As the sounds of
the last barrage at 5:18 a.m. (0218 GMT) faded, a call for prayer
floated over the winter morning from a mosque loudspeaker.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said he ordered the strikes on
military and security targets to retaliate for Iraq's defiance of
the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for eliminating
the country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological weapons,'' he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he authorized the
participation of British forces.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in his radio
address, saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face''
but ``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the Aliyarmouk Hospital in Baghdad,
said two people were killed and more than 30 were wounded,
suffering mostly burns to the face, hands and legs. But the full
casualty toll was not known, and there was no official word.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
mumbled Salam Mohammed, 34, as he moaned on his hospital bed, his
face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Unlike a previous U.S. attack on the city in 1993, there was no
blackout this time. The streets were brightly lit, as were many
homes when the attack began.
	   The total damage from the attack could not be immediately
assessed. Iraqi officials took reporters to Karada, a mixed
commercial and residential neighborhood, where a missile had
landed, bursting water mains in a street.
	   A two kilometer (one mile) stretch of the street was flooded.
	   Karada is across the Tigris River from the Old Presidential
Complex, but it was not clear if the palace was damaged.
	   In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain for the attack and demanded an immediate end to
the campaign, warning it could shatter regional security.
	   ``Russia demands an immediate end to military action, to show
common sense and restraint and not to allow further escalation of
the conflict,'' Yeltsin said in a statement issued Thursday.
	   At a Security Council meeting, the ambassadors of Russia and
China, both sympathetic to Iraq, urged an end to the attacks.
	   Staunch American allies _ Germany, Canada and even Japan _
supported the strikes.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the events a ``sad day
for the world,'' saying he did everything in his power to seek
peace. But he didn't say whether the attacks were justified.
	   In his speech, Clinton said the campaign against Iraq will be a
``strong sustained series of airstrikes,'' indicating that more
strikes are likely in the next few days.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   In the attacks, the warships fired hundreds of Tomahawk cruise
missiles, and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck against Iraqi air
defense radars, Pentagon officials said.
	   The United States hopes the attacks will achieve what the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, says it has not been able to achieve
in seven years of work: destroy Iraq's ability to produce weapons
of mass destruction, specifically chemical and biological arms.
	   ``Instead of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam is
disarming the inspectors,'' Clinton said.
	   The U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until the
inspectors certify that Iraq is free of chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles and programs to build them.
	   Iraq accuses the chief inspector, Richard Butler, of being a
U.S. puppet who is deliberately prolonging the sanctions.
	   Butler withdrew all his weapons inspectors from Baghdad on
Wednesday, accusing Iraq of going back on its promise last month to
cooperate fully with UNSCOM. That promise had saved Iraq from an
imminent U.S. attack on Nov. 14.
	   Butler cited Iraq's recent refusal to allow a team of inspectors
into a headquarters of the ruling Baath Party. He also said Iraq
was obstructing and evading the inspectors.
	   Many of the U.N. humanitarian staff remained in Iraq, and their

to evacuate. He said 133 U.N. staff had stayed in Baghdad and 233
staff remained in northern Iraq.

said.

Security Council bitterly divided and paralyzed after attacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With PM-Iraq, Bjt &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council was bitterly
divided and paralyzed after the United States and Britain launched
airstrikes against Iraq _ and there was no sign it would be able to
play a role in restoring peace.
	   Iraq, Russia and China called Wednesday night for an immediate
halt to the attacks. But the United States and Britain insisted
military action was justified because Iraq had failed to cooperate
fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The result was a formal Security Council meeting with 15
speeches, an outpouring of frustration that peace efforts had
failed, but no action _ and no timetable for future talks on the
Iraqi crisis. The council is scheduled to meet today, but the
agenda is Cyprus and the Western Sahara.
	   ``I am certain the Security Council will be considering this
issue in the coming days,'' said Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey
Lavrov, who called for Wednesday night's formal meeting.
	   For U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, it was ``a sad day for
the United Nations and for the world.''
	   Annan, who helped avert military action against Iraq in February
and November, said he did everything in his power to seek peace and
deeply regretted not being able to avert the use of force. He said
his thoughts were with the Iraqi people, the 370 U.N. humanitarian
workers still in the country ``and with all others whose lives are
in danger.''
	   He spent much of the day at the three closed council meetings
and the open council session Wednesday night.
	   Only a month ago, the Security Council unanimously backed a
resolution demanding that Iraq cooperate fully with weapons
inspectors _ as it promised Nov. 14 when the United States and
Britain called off threatened airstrikes.
	   But that unity started to fray when chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler reported to Annan on Tuesday that Iraq not only
failed to cooperate fully but imposed new restrictions on the
inspectors' work.
	   And it totally collapsed after Butler pulled out the inspection
teams Tuesday night without consulting the council _ and the United
States and Britain then launched airstrikes without council
approval.
	   During Wednesday night's meeting, there were serious divisions
among the 15-member council over a cease-fire, the accuracy of
Butler's report and his decision to evacuate inspection teams from
Baghdad, and the unilateral use of force by the United States and
Britain.
	   Some council members were also angered that the airstrikes were
launched just as they were discussing three options suggested by
Annan to deal with Butler's report, which became moot.
	   Speaking at the start of Wednesday night's meeting, Iraq's U.N.
envoy Nizar Hamdoon urged the council to call for an immediate halt
to the uprovoked attacks which he said were ``wrecking the lives''
of innocent Iraqis.
	   Russia's Lavrov backed his appeal for an immediate end ``to
these acts of military force'' and China's U.N. envoy Qin Huasun
called on the United States and Britain ``to stop forthwith all
military actions against Iraq.''
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' Qin said earlier.
	   But the United States and Britain insisted the airstrikes were
launched only after diplomacy was exhausted and Butler had
documented its failure to hand over documents and allowed
unfettered inspections.
	   ``The United States did not seek a confrontation and did not
undertake this decision lightly,'' said Deputy U.S. Ambassador
Peter Burleigh. ``Iraq's policy of unremitting defiance and
noncompliance necessitated the resort to military force.''
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to develop nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and threaten his neighbors.
	   Hamdoon challenged the U.N. Special Commission known as UNSCOM,
which Butler heads, to produce physical evidence that Iraq still
has prohibited weapons.
	   ``The exaggerated uproar over the Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction is nothing more than a big lie,'' he said. ``The other
lie is that Iraq poses a threat to its neighbors.''
	   Britain and the United States insisted that they acted under the
authority provided by previous Security Council resolutions. But
many other council members countered only the council can sanction
the use of military force _ and it had not done so.
	   Swedish Ambassador Hans Dahlgren said his government regretted
``that the council was presented with a fait acompli.'' And
Russia's Lavrov warned that ``the entire responsibility for the
consequence of these actions must be borne by those states who have
chosen a unilateral act of force in order to resolve their problems
with Iraq.''
	   Hamdoon accused Butler of bias, noting that Butler cited only
five incidents in 300 inspection operations.
	   ``The leader of UNSCOM has played a dishonorable role in this
crisis,'' said China's Qin. ``The reports submitted by UNSCOM to
the secretary-general were unfounded and evasive of the facts. It
is difficult for the UNSCOM leader to shed his responsibility over
the current crisis.''
	   Asked whether Butler still had the council's backing, Lavrov
noted that steps he had taken in the last 24 hours ``were
questioned seriously'' by council members.
	   Under the cease-fire resolution which ended the 1991 Persian
Gulf War, UNSCOM must verify that Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction have been eliminated before tough economic sanctions
against Iraq can be lifted. But there were questions of when _ and
whether _ UNSCOM would be able to return to Iraq.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A missile from the U.S.-British attack on
Iraq Thursday fell on the city of Khorramshahr in southern Iran,
Tehran radio reported.
	   The state-run radio gave no details. But a resident reached in
the city by telephone said that the windows of several buildings
were shattered.
	   The resident, who did not want his name used, said he did not
know if anyone had been injured or killed.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which is
headquartered in the Gulf state of Bahrain, refused to comment
about the Iranian report, saying all comments would have to come
from the U.S. Defense Department in Washington.
	   Khorramshahr is about 40 kilometers (25 kilometers) east of
Basra in Iraq, a large port city with major oil facilities.
	   An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman warned Thursday that air
strikes against Iraq would bring ``pain and misery'' to Iraq's

Islamic militants in Chechnya threaten attacks elsewhere in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen Islamic militants accused of killing four
foreigners threatened to launch attacks on Russia if authorities
clamp down on their operations, a news report said Thursday.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov accused the group, Islamic
Jamaats or Warriors of Islam, of beheading three kidnapped Britons
and a New Zealander after a rescue attempt went wrong last week.
The group has denied any connection with the killings.
	   Maskhadov imposed a one-month state of emergency to control
rampant crime in Chechnya. He has said the leader of the group,
Arbi Barayev, is partly to blame for a sharp rise in violence and
kidnappings that have paralyzed the region since its 1994-96
independence war with Russia.
	   In a statement made on Chechen television Wednesday night, group
leaders threatened to attack Russian sites outside Chechnya if
Maskhadov tries to fight them, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   The group does not want to fight within Chechnya because it
refuses to ``spill the blood of Moslem brothers'' or play into the
hands of Russia's secret services and enemies of Chechen
independence, ITAR-Tass said, citing remarks made during the
address.
	   Barayev's group is holed up in Chechnya's second largest city,
Urus-Martan. His fighters have dug trenches around the town and say
they are ready for war.

Basuki wins tennis title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Indonesia's Yayuk Basuki overcame a
patriotic crowd to crush hometown hope Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-4, 6-2
in the women's tennis final at the Asian Games Thursday.
	   Basuki, ranked No. 56 by the WTA, rode to victory on a strong
groundstroke assault against the No. 37-ranked Tamarine.
	   A full house tried to lift the 21-year-old Thai after she
dropped the opening set, but she suffered two breaks in the second.
	   The pair are close friends because of time spent together on the
world tour and had a long hug at the net after Tamarine hit a
backhand wide on the second match point.
	   Tamarine accepted flowers from her fans but spent the next
half-hour trying to smile through her disappointment and ward off
tears. Basuki, who is seven years Tamarine's senior, tried to keep
her opponent cheered up and hugged her several more times before
and during the medal ceremony.
	   `` We are like a family when we're on the tour,'' said Basuki.
	   But the victory was a great moment for Basuki, who will play
singles and doubles in the Australian Open next month.
	   ``This title means a lot to me even though it is not a
professional tour event,'' Basuki said. ``I am just so pleased to
have won this gold medal for the Indonesian people.''
	   She said she was not affected by Tamarine's supporters, who went
against etiquette by cheering every Basuki mistake along with every
Tamarine winner.
	   ``I had my supporters here too, and I just concentrated on the
match,'' Basuki said.
	   Tamarine said Basuki was always in control.
	   ``Wow! She was unbelievable today. Every shot she played she
played right. She served well and she hit her balls deep,''
Tamarine said.
	   ``I felt like I was the underdog because I was younger and she
has lots of experience. When she plays very well you have to play
great, but that wasn't possible today.''
	   Basuki has been a guiding force for Tamarine. ``She's kind of
like my sister and helped me a lot on all the tours,'' Tamarine
said.
	   Basuki had an early break in the first set. Serving for the set
at 5-4, she reached set point with a forehand down the line. She
missed a backhand drop shot on the next point, but finished the set
with a well-placed second serve. Tamarine lunged but hit a weak
forehand into the net.
	   In the second set, Basuki broke in the first game on her fifth
break point when Tamarine's forehand down the line went into the
net. She broke again for 4-1 and served out the match from 5-2.
	   Meanwhile Yoon Yong-Il of South Korea became the first man
through to the gold medal game with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Srinath
Prahlad of India.

U.S. State department orders departure of some embassy personnel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The U.S. State Department ordered the departure of
some of its embassy personnel and their families in Kuwait on
Thursday following U.S. military strikes against neighboring Iraq.
	   According to a taped message on an embassy telephone line, the
State Department also urged 8,000 American citizens who live in
this Gulf state to ``take this information into account in
considering whether they should also depart the country.''
	   Thursday's warning said although the risk of the retaliatory use
of chemical and biological weapons by Iraq was remote, ``we are
concerned that some members of our community cannot be fully
protected against the potential use of such weapons.''
	   Using such weapons against Kuwait would be difficult, and Iraq's
capabilities were limited, the message said.
	   U.S. citizens outside Kuwait were warned to reconsider whether
they should travel here.
	   The embassy staff and their families who were ordered to leave
include those under 18, over 65 and pregnant women.
	   Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and occupied it for seven months
before a U.S.-led coalition drove out the Iraqi forces.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A missile from the U.S.-British attack on
Iraq Thursday fell on the city of Khorramshahr in southern Iran,
Tehran radio reported.
	   The state-run radio gave no details. But a resident reached in
the city by telephone said that the windows of several buildings
were shattered.
	   The resident, who did not want his name used, said he did not
know if anyone had been injured or killed.
	   Khorramshahr, about 40 kilometers (25 kilometers) east of Basra
in Iraq, a large port city with major oil facilities.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which is
headquartered in the Gulf state of Bahrain, refused to comment
about the Iranian report, saying all comments would have to come
from the Pentagon in Washington.
	   The British charge d'affaires and the ambassador of Switzerland,
whose embassy looks after U.S. interests in Iran, were summoned
Thursday to the Foreign Ministry, where they received a protest
over the stray missile, diplomats at both missions said.
	   Meanwhile, residents in the Iranian border town of Mehran said
they could see thick smoke rising from apparent targets hit in Iraq
hours after the air strikes, Tehran radio reported.
	   It said the residents were jolted awake by loud explosions that
shook the town and broke windows in several houses and other
buildings. Mehran is 175 kilometers (108 miles) east of Baghdad and
not close to any major city in Iraq.
	   An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman warned Thursday that air
strikes against Iraq would bring ``pain and misery'' to Iraq's
people and urged Baghdad to cooperate with the United Nations.
	   Relations between Iran and Iraq are still tense after their
1980-88 war, which killed or injured an estimated 1 million people.

Philippine police beef up security around U.S. Embassy, other
</HEADLINE>
facilities &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Police stepped up security around the
U.S. Embassy and other American facilities in the Philippines on
Thursday to prevent retaliatory terrorist attacks after Washington
ordered missile strikes on Iraq.
	   ``All U.S. installations have been adequately secured even
before the attack but still, we will beef up security,'' said
national police chief Roberto Lastimoso.
	   Lastimoso said the action was taken without a request for
additional security from U.S. embassy authorities.
	   He said local terrorists with links to Iraq are likely to attack
U.S. facilities after President Bill Clinton ordered air strikes on
targets suspected of concealing key elements of Iraq's biological
and chemical weapons program.
	   Lastimoso said local terrorists have attacked U.S. targets in
the country since the height of the Gulf War in 1991. During that
time, two Iraqi agents in Manila tried to bomb the Thomas Jefferson
Cultural Center in suburban Makati City, but the bomb they carried
exploded prematurely, killing one of them.
	   Security around the embassy has been raised since August,
following the bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya by
suspected followers of Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.
	   Aside from its embassy, the United States also maintains a large
residential seaside compound in Manila and a consulate in central
Cebu City.
	   Aside from U.S. facilities, additional security will also be
posted at the embassies of Britain and Israel, Lastimoso said.
	   Police on foot and car patrols will cover the embassy and the
other facilities, he said.
	   He did not say say if there was reason to believe the facilities
were in any immediate danger.
	   He said the local Muslim extremist group, Abu Sayyaf, is
believed to be involved in bin Laden's network.
	   The group has also been linked to the convicted mastermind of
the World Trade Center bombing in New York in 1993, Ramzi Yousef,
who also allegedly plotted to kill Pope Paul II during the pope's
visit to Manila in January 1995.
	   The Philippine military and police are known to work closely
with U.S. intelligence agencies and share information.
	   Also Thursday, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, another Muslim
rebel group fighting the government, condemned the U.S, air
strikes.
	   Ghadzali Jaafar, a deputy chairman of the MILF, called Clinton a
``murderer of Islam.''

 &UR; China says it was offered money to throw Asian Games medals
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 3 grafs after 5th `Li refused ...,' to UPDATE with
Olympic Council of Asia asking Chinese to provide names, may order
probe, quotes

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chinese athletes were offered bribes to
lose in gold medal matches at the Asian Games, a senior Chinese
sports official said Thursday.
	   Li Furong, deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation, said
more than one person offered bribes to Chinese athletes and that
the athletes refused, saying they wouldn't throw a medal even for
U.S. dlrs 100,000.
	   ``Some people tried to use money to buy gold medals,'' Li said
in a telephone interview. ``It wasn't just once.''
	   ``Of course, the athletes refused,'' he added.
	   Li refused to give details about the bribes or say what
countries, sports or people were involved. He first mentioned the
bribes at a news conference for Chinese reporters, and said in the
interview that he brought the issue to light to show that Chinese
athletes were clean, not to shame others.
	   The president of the Olympic Council of Asia, Sheikh Ahmad
Al-Sabah, told The Associated Press that he has asked the Chinese
to provide the names of people who allegedly offered bribes.
	   ``This is a very serious matter, if true,'' Al-Sabah said.
``Right now it is only a rumor and to nail this rumor we have asked
the Chinese to give us the names of people and countries who made
the offer.
	   ``We are studying the whole matter very carefully and if and
when we get the names, we will order a full-fledged investigation.
But we have to wait until the Chinese give us the names,'' he said.
	   Earlier, Li, the deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation
said that in refusing the bribes, Chinese athletes declared, ``If
you give me 100,000 American dollars I won't do it.''
	   ``Some athletes also said I'm not here for money but for the
glory of the country,'' Li added.
	   Asked how he felt about his athletes' response, Li said, ``Of
course I'm happy.''

 &UR; Basuki wins tennis title

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Indonesia's Yayuk Basuki overcame a
patriotic crowd to crush hometown hope Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-4, 6-2
in the women's tennis final at the Asian Games Thursday.
	   Basuki, ranked No. 56 by the WTA, rode to victory on a strong
groundstroke assault against the No. 37-ranked Tamarine.
	   A full house tried to lift the 21-year-old Thai after she
dropped the opening set, but she suffered two breaks in the second.
	   The pair are close friends because of time spent together on the
world tour and had a long hug at the net after Tamarine hit a
backhand wide on the second match point.
	   Tamarine accepted flowers from her fans but spent the next
half-hour trying to smile through her disappointment and ward off
tears. Basuki, who is seven years Tamarine's senior, tried to keep
her opponent cheered up and hugged her several more times before
and during the medal ceremony.
	   `` We are like a family when we're on the tour,'' said Basuki.
	   But the victory was a great moment for Basuki, who will play
singles and doubles in the Australian Open next month.
	   ``This title means a lot to me even though it is not a
professional tour event,'' Basuki said. ``I am just so pleased to
have won this gold medal for the Indonesian people.''
	   She said she was not affected by Tamarine's supporters, who went
against etiquette by cheering every Basuki mistake along with every
Tamarine winner.
	   ``I had my supporters here too, and I just concentrated on the
match,'' Basuki said.
	   Tamarine said Basuki was always in control.
	   ``Wow! She was unbelievable today. Every shot she played she
played right. She served well and she hit her balls deep,''
Tamarine said.
	   ``I felt like I was the underdog because I was younger and she
has lots of experience. When she plays very well you have to play
great, but that wasn't possible today.''
	   Basuki has been a guiding force for Tamarine. ``She's kind of
like my sister and helped me a lot on all the tours,'' Tamarine
said.
	   Basuki had an early break in the first set. Serving for the set
at 5-4, she reached set point with a forehand down the line. She
missed a backhand drop shot on the next point, but finished the set
with a well-placed second serve. Tamarine lunged but hit a weak
forehand into the net.
	   In the second set, Basuki broke in the first game on her fifth
break point when Tamarine's forehand down the line went into the
net. She broke again for 4-1 and served out the match from 5-2.
	   Meanwhile Yoon Yong-Il of South Korea became the first man
through to the gold medal game with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Srinath
Prahlad of India.

Stray missile fell on Iranian city, Tehran says

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A missile from the U.S.-British attack on
Iraq Thursday fell on the city of Khorramshahr in southern Iran,
Tehran radio reported.
	   The state-run radio gave no details. But a resident reached in
the city by telephone said that the windows of several buildings
were shattered.
	   The resident, who did not want his name used, said he did not
know if anyone had been injured or killed.
	   Khorramshahr, about 40 kilometers (25 kilometers) east of Basra
in Iraq, a large port city with major oil facilities.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which is
headquartered in the Gulf state of Bahrain, refused to comment
about the Iranian report, saying all comments would have to come
from the Pentagon in Washington.
	   The British charge d'affaires and the ambassador from
Switzerland, whose embassy looks after U.S. interests in Iran, were
summoned Thursday to the Foreign Ministry, where they received a
protest over the stray missile, diplomats at both missions said.
	   Meanwhile, residents in the Iranian border town of Mehran said
they could see thick smoke rising from apparent targets hit in Iraq
hours after the air strikes, Tehran radio reported.
	   It said the residents were jolted awake by loud explosions that
shook the town and broke windows in several houses and other
buildings. Mehran is 175 kilometers (108 miles) east of Baghdad and
not close to any major city in Iraq.
	   An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman warned Thursday that air
strikes against Iraq would bring ``pain and misery'' to Iraq's
people and urged Baghdad to cooperate with the United Nations.
	   Relations between Iran and Iraq are still tense after their
1980-88 war, which killed or injured an estimated 1 million people.
But Iran has always been against military strikes against Iraq.

<TEXT>
	   Q: There's no visible sign of support from anybody but the
British. And a month ago, you had a lot of people lined up. Where
is everybody else?
	   Berger: Well, I think there is _ based on the phone calls that
all of us have made today _ the secretary of state, myself, the
secretary of defense, the president _ I think there is a good deal
of support in the world.
	   Q: (off microphone)
	   Berger: Well, if I could finish.
	   We made a conscious decision. And back in February, we put
together a coalition of several _ three, four dozen countries that
all had participated in _ in the arsenal that was prepared. That is
a time-consuming process.
	   You have to fit in the extra plane so that it interfaces with
the rest of the operation. It takes weeks to do that. You lose the
element of surprise.
	   We decided that we would act with the British, ourselves, with
the support of many other countries, but not necessarily with their
participation because the process of securing that participation in
and of itself would have taken us days, if not weeks.
	   QUESTION: (off microphone) just an endorsement?
	   Berger: Well, I _ well, I suspect we will see that in the days
ahead.
	   Q: Sandy, do you care if (off microphone)?
	   Berger: Let me just say _ excuse me, Bill, that yesterday the
Gulf Cooperation Council, which consists of all of the gulf
countries, issued a statement saying, in terms very similar to the
statement that they issued back in the second week of November,
that if Saddam Hussein did not comply and did not cooperate, the
consequences of his actions would be his responsibility alone.
	   I take that to be quite a forthcoming statement.
	   Q: Did you specifically seek the support of the Congressional
leadership? Did you get their support? And are you surprised or
dismayed by Lott's reaction?
	   Berger: We talked through this period with the Congressional
leadership, both in the House and in the Senate. Obviously, we
would like the support of all members of Congress. It's a judgment
they have to make. I noticed that Senator Helms just issued a
statement in support of what we did. I believe there are other
Republicans and Democrats in the Congress that are supportive.
	   Q: Sandy, do you know where Saddam Hussein is? And dose the
administration care if he's alive or dead?
	   Berger: I just got out _ a quick factual correction. The GCC
Statement was last week, not yesterday.
	   Q: OK, now answer my question.
	   Berger: OK. Excuse me?
	   Q: Do you know where Saddam Hussein is at this moment? And does
the administration care if he is alive or dead?
	   Berger: Well, I think I've set forward the objectives of the
mission. That is, to degrade his military capability and to degrade
his WMD and missile delivery capability. And I'm not going to go
any further in terms of ...
	   Q: The Russian Duma is schedule to vote within the next 10 days
or so on START II. Given Russia's obvious attitude toward this
military action, do you expect that what's going on right now to
delay START II even further, or even kill it?
	   Berger: Well, I would hope not. START II is very much not only
in the interests of the United States, it's very much in the
interests of Russia. And I would hope the members of the Duma would
act in the interests, the best interests of the Russian Federation.
	   Q: What is your expectation?
	   Berger: I have no expectation of that. I think the _ it was hard
to predict before this. We certainly would hope that they would do
that.
	   Q: Sandy, half-a-dozen senators have sent a letter to the
president, saying it's time to get serious about implementing the
Iraq Liberation Act, and urging that Saddam Hussein be indicted for
war crimes. Is indicting Saddam Hussein something the
administration is considering?
	   Berger: Well, first of all, let me say, as the president said on
November 15, we _ and he said again today _ in the interim, we have
to contain Saddam Hussein _ all the elements that I mentioned to
Claire _ in terms of sanctions, in terms of use of military force
where necessary.
	   But over the long term, we agree with the Congress that the
solution here is a government in Iraq that respects its own people.
	   We intend to _ to proceed on the Iraqi Liberation Act. We have
already done a number of things, most importantly is to change
what's called our declarative policy with respect to Iraq. That is
what our stated goals are.
	   We'll work very actively with the opposition. We have already
had met with them in London.
	   One of the things that's important is to try to bring the
opposition groups together in a more coherent, cohesive operation.
There's not a lot of _ right now, they're quite divided.
	   We will do _ I think Secretary Albright has said that we would
support an indict _ the indict Iraq campaign, Radio Free Iraq.
	   This is something that has to be seen as a long-term goal. We
have to proceed in a practical, prudent, effective way. But we have
to keep our eye on the goal and be steady about it _ steady about
it. And I think we are moving toward that objective.
	   Q: Sandy, on many occasions in the past, when Saddam Hussein
broke his promises, the United States refrained from taking
military action. This time Clinton takes action the very eve of his
impeachment vote, which is expected to go against him, and
effectively delays that vote.
	   How can you say that this doesn't at least have the perception
of ``Wag the Dog''?
	   Berger: Well, you know _ I can't, you know, deal with
perceptions. I can only deal with realities.
	   The fact is in those previous instances what happened was the
United States built up our military capability. We threatened
force, and we backed down.
	   Now, in this situation, having backed down on November 15th and
our setting criteria, he violated those commitments that he made on
November 14th. And the president was very clear on November 14th
and 15th of what would happen if he did not fully cooperate.
	   And the _ what the United States says matters in the world. And
the credibility of our word and the fact that we will carry out
what we say we will do is important.
	   So all I can tell you is that that this was, you know, we have
_we have _ we've spent countless hours on this over the last two
weeks and _ and certainly over the last several days. And the
president has been extremely firm and steadfast in making it clear
that the criteria here that he was going to make a decision on was
what is in the national security interests and that the fact of the
congressional debate would not alter what he saw was his
responsibility as president.

President says Indonesia might break up if protests not curbed

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with protests on Thursday, graf 3,11; ADDS byline
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president told the
powerful military Thursday that anti-government protests must be
curbed to prevent the sprawling Southeast Asian nation from
breaking up.
	   ``If the protests are not be controlled it can lead to the
disintegration of the nation,'' said President B.J. Habibie at a
graduation ceremony of new army officers.
	   Hours after he spoke dozens of riot police and troops peacefully
blocked about 100 students about 100 meters (yards) in front of the
presidential palace.
	   On Wednesday police fired tear gas and swung batons to disperse
hundreds of rock-throwing protesters at the Defense Ministry, not
far from the palace.
	   Habibie, who has promised democratic reform after decades of
authoritarian rule, said that freedom of expression that allows
protests is now guaranteed under Indonesian law.
	   ``But in carrying out these rights people must also respect
other people's rights,'' he said.
	   Indonesia, with 202 million people, is the world's fourth most
populous country. It has more than 300 ethnic groups spread over
about 17,000 islands.
	   For weeks, students have been holding street protests demanding
that Habibie force the military out of politics and put his
autocratic predecessor, ex-President Suharto, on trial for
corruption.
	   The protesters and security forces have clashed on several
occasions.
	   On Nov. 13, security forces shot dead nine student protesters
when thousands tried to march on Parliament.
	   On Thursday about 200 Islamic and pro-Habibie supporters rallied
near Jakarta's National Monument and called on anti-government
students to end their protests during Ramadan, the Muslim holy
month, which starts on Sunday.
	   Student protests and deadly riots last May also forced Suharto
to quit after 32 years in power.
	   Habibie has promised to open up the tightly controlled political
system and to hold elections next year. But the students are not
satisfied and stage demonstrations almost daily in Jakarta and
other cities.
	   Anger at Habibie's seven-month old government has been sharpened
by a continuing economic crisis, which has resulted in soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and rising poverty.
	   Sporadic rioting and looting has hit some parts of the country.
There has also been violence among the Muslim majority and the
Christian minority with dozens of mosques and churches set afire or
ransacked.
	   On Wednesday mobs rioted and attacked Chinese-owned shops in
Samarinda on the island of Borneo.
	   To counter the threat of rising violence and lawlessness ahead
of next year's elections, the government plans to establish a
civilian militia to help the police and military.
	   Some opposition groups and human rights activists fear the
group, to consist of as many as 40,000 unemployed young men, will
be used to intimidate government opponents.
	   Meanwhile a senior Cabinet minister claimed that Habibie had
moved too fast to deliver democratic reform.
	   Education Minister Juwono Sudarsono said Indonesia had now
become a ``frightening society.''
	   ``People are hungry and they take tend to take the law into
their own hands,'' he told a group of foreign business people on
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The airstrikes against Iraq have bitterly
divided the U.N. Security Council, leaving it unable to decide on
any course of action to resolve the conflict over weapons
inspections.
	   Iraq, Russia and China called Wednesday night for an immediate
halt to the attacks. But the United States and Britain insisted
military action was justified because Iraq had failed to cooperate
fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The result was a formal Security Council meeting with 15
speeches, an outpouring of frustration that peace efforts had
failed, but no action _ and no timetable for future talks on the
Iraqi crisis. The council is scheduled to meet today, but the
agenda is Cyprus and the Western Sahara.
	   ``I am certain the Security Council will be considering this
issue in the coming days,'' said Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey
Lavrov, who called for Wednesday night's formal meeting.
	   For U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, it was ``a sad day for
the United Nations and for the world.''
	   Annan, who helped avert military action against Iraq in February
and November, said he did everything in his power to seek peace and
deeply regretted not being able to avert the use of force. He said
his thoughts were with the Iraqi people, the 370 U.N. humanitarian
workers still in the country ``and with all others whose lives are
in danger.''
	   He spent much of the day at the three closed council meetings
and the open council session Wednesday night.
	   Only a month ago, the Security Council unanimously backed a
resolution demanding that Iraq cooperate fully with weapons
inspectors _ as it promised Nov. 14 when the United States and
Britain called off threatened airstrikes.
	   But that unity started to fray when chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler reported to Annan on Tuesday that Iraq not only
failed to cooperate fully but imposed new restrictions on the
inspectors' work.
	   And it totally collapsed after Butler pulled out the inspection
teams Tuesday night without consulting the council _ and the United
States and Britain then launched airstrikes without council
approval.
	   During Wednesday night's meeting, there were serious divisions
among the 15-member council over a cease-fire, the accuracy of
Butler's report and his decision to evacuate inspection teams from
Baghdad, and the unilateral use of force by the United States and
Britain.
	   Some council members were also angered that the airstrikes were
launched just as they were discussing three options suggested by
Annan to deal with Butler's report, which became moot.
	   Speaking at the start of Wednesday night's meeting, Iraq's U.N.
envoy Nizar Hamdoon urged the council to call for an immediate halt
to the uprovoked attacks which he said were ``wrecking the lives''
of innocent Iraqis.
	   Russia's Lavrov backed his appeal for an immediate end ``to
these acts of military force'' and China's U.N. envoy Qin Huasun
called on the United States and Britain ``to stop forthwith all
military actions against Iraq.''
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' Qin said earlier.
	   But the United States and Britain insisted the airstrikes were
launched only after diplomacy was exhausted and Butler had
documented its failure to hand over documents and allowed
unfettered inspections.
	   ``The United States did not seek a confrontation and did not
undertake this decision lightly,'' said Deputy U.S. Ambassador
Peter Burleigh. ``Iraq's policy of unremitting defiance and
noncompliance necessitated the resort to military force.''
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to develop nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and threaten his neighbors.
	   Hamdoon challenged the U.N. Special Commission known as UNSCOM,
which Butler heads, to produce physical evidence that Iraq still
has prohibited weapons.
	   ``The exaggerated uproar over the Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction is nothing more than a big lie,'' he said. ``The other
lie is that Iraq poses a threat to its neighbors.''
	   Britain and the United States insisted that they acted under the
authority provided by previous Security Council resolutions. But
many other council members countered only the council can sanction
the use of military force _ and it had not done so.
	   Swedish Ambassador Hans Dahlgren said his government regretted
``that the council was presented with a fait acompli.'' And
Russia's Lavrov warned that ``the entire responsibility for the
consequence of these actions must be borne by those states who have
chosen a unilateral act of force in order to resolve their problems
with Iraq.''
	   Hamdoon accused Butler of bias, noting that Butler cited only
five incidents in 300 inspection operations.
	   ``The leader of UNSCOM has played a dishonorable role in this
crisis,'' said China's Qin. ``The reports submitted by UNSCOM to
the secretary-general were unfounded and evasive of the facts. It
is difficult for the UNSCOM leader to shed his responsibility over
the current crisis.''
	   Asked whether Butler still had the council's backing, Lavrov
noted that steps he had taken in the last 24 hours ``were
questioned seriously'' by council members.
	   Under the cease-fire resolution which ended the 1991 Persian
Gulf War, UNSCOM must verify that Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction have been eliminated before tough economic sanctions
against Iraq can be lifted. But there were questions of when _ and
whether _ UNSCOM would be able to return to Iraq.

Congo war threatens to kill off last of Northern White Rhinos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A recent attack on rangers in Garamba
National Park in war-torn northeastern Congo led conservationists
to warn Thursday that the last of the world's Northern White Rhinos
that live there are threatened with extinction.
	   Three rangers patrolling the park for signs of endangered rhinos
were wounded in the Nov. 27 attack, the World Wildlife Fund said.
	   ``This attack, and the fact that it happened in the heart of
rhino territory, leads us to believe that the world may have to
prepare itself for the loss of a unique rhino species,'' WWF
Director General Claude Martin said in a statement.
	   The Geneva-based agency has been warning that the four-month
rebellion in Congo and the proliferation of arms in the area could
have disastrous effects on wildlife there, especially the
endangered rhinos and the mountain gorillas whose habitat is the
Virunga National Park that straddles a string of volcanoes along
Congo's eastern border with Uganda and Rwanda.
	   When WWF last counted in May, there were 25 Northern White
Rhinos left, all of them in the Garamba park near the border with
Sudan.
	   Since then, the agency has suspended reconnaissance flights over
the area, and park rangers patrol only on foot, leaving the rhinos
more exposed to poachers.
	   When ground into power, rhino horns are believed to be powerful
aphrodisiacs, and they command high prices in the Far East.
	   The statement said the fund ``fears that the combination of high
qualities of firearms, with a severe reduction in patrolling and
conservation activities in Garamba could mean the end for the
Northern White Rhino in the wild.''
	   The park is in an area recently captured by Ugandan government
troops backing the Congolese rebels.
	   The statement said park employees believe the attackers were
connected with southern Sudanese rebels who have links with Uganda.

Jordan closes border with Iraq to prevent influx of Iraqi refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan closed its borders with Iraq
Thursday to prevent an influx of refugees from Iraq following
U.S.-British military strikes, the interior minister said.
	   However, the minister, Nayef Qadi, said Jordan would offer Iraq
any assistance it needed. He did not elaborate.
	   ``Our instructions are to prevent any possible waves of refugees
from Iraq to Jordan as a result of the military strike,'' Qadi
said.
	   He spoke after he held an emergency meeting with Prime Minister
Fayez Tarawneh and security chiefs to discuss measures to deal with
consequences of the military strikes.
	   Hundreds of thousands of refugees flooded into Jordan from Iraq
during the 1990-91 Gulf conflict, burdening the kingdom's
debt-strapped economy.
	   The United States and Britain launched air and missile attacks
against Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The official Petra news agency said traffic at the Rweished
border post between Jordan and Iraq was normal shortly after
midnight Wednesday and before the strikes.

 &UR; With PM-Iraq, Bjt &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Russia and China angrily denounced the
U.S.-British attack on Iraq, while allies such as Germany and
Canada offered their immediate support, placing all blame for the
crisis on Saddam Hussein.
	   Iraq's neighbor, Iran, joined Russia and China in blasting the
use of force and warning that it could shatter regional security.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin demanded an immediate end to the
military campaign, while his foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said
the United States and Britain had acted without U.N. authorization.
	   ``Nobody has the right to act on their own in the name of the
United Nations and even less to pretend to be the judge of the
entire world,'' Ivanov said in Madrid, Spain.
	   China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasen was visibly angry when he
emerged from a Security Council session Wednesday evening, learning
of the attack only after the fact.
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' he said.
	   The German government noted, however, that the Iraqi leadership
``had been warned'' the international community would have to act
if it failed to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   ``The federal government regrets that, in the face of the
attitude of the Iraqi leadership, it had to come now to the use of
military measures,'' its statement said.
	   Support for the airstrikes also poured in from Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Spain.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has brought this crisis on himself,'' Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said.
	   France, which has close ties to Iraq, deplored ``the grave human
consequences'' of the military strikes, but added its regret that
Iraqi leaders were unable to ``show proof of the spirit of complete
cooperation'' demanded by previous agreements with the United
Nations.
	   While Iranian television quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as
saying that ``such unilateral attacks against Iraq will lead to
even more pain and misery for the people of that country and will
bring about insecurity in the region.''
	   Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi urged the U.N. Security Council to
take immediate action to prevent ``further deterioration'' of the
situation, television reported. Iran also called on Baghdad to
cooperate with the United Nations.
	   Foreign ministry officials in Pakistan were in meetings to draft
a response to the attack.
	   Airstrikes against Iraq led news reports in Lebanon. All
newspaper, radio and television stations carried news agency
reports without comment.
	   In Indonesia, the world's most populous Islamic nation, leaders
pleaded for restraint.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was noncommittal,
saying, ``Israel is outside the dispute, and in any case will take
care of defending itself if the need arises.''
	   Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka backed the United
States and Britain, saying, ``We strongly demand that Iraq
immediately and unconditionally implement the U.N. Security
Council's resolutions.''
	   He was seconded by Misao Nozaki, a 47-year-old Tokyo restaurant
owner who called the bombing justified ``because Iraq has continued
developing nuclear weapons in a way that goes against the
commonsense of the rest of the world.''
	   But Yukari Ohi, 38, an office worker in Tokyo, said she opposed
the use of force.
	   ``I think the U.S. decision to attack Iraq was apparently
intended to shift attention from the impeachment issue to war,''
Ohi said, noting that the airstrikes came as President Clinton
faced an impeachment vote.
	   India condemned the attack, while Mexico expressed
disappointment.
	   In Britain, the country's largest-selling tabloid, The Sun, got
behind the attack, saying in an editorial today, ``Saddam must be
crushed. Blitz about time too.'' But about 30 demonstrators
disagreed, protesting outside the prime minister's Downing Street
residence.
	   Members of U.S. Congress generally endorsed the bombing, while
noting that it conveniently took the spotlight off the Clinton
impeachment proceedings.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea, paced by the top three
from the individual archery, easily won the women's team event at
the Asian Games Thursday, beating China in the final.
	   Gold and silver medalists Kim Jo-sun and Lee Eun-kyung combined
with Lee Mi-jeong to beat China in the final shoot-out, 242-238.
	   Lee Mi-jeong actually finished third in the individual contest
but under rules that one country is not allowed to sweep the
medals, the bronze went to China's Lin Sang.
	   Sang combined with He Ying an Wang Xiaozhu for the silver in the
team event.
	   Kazakstan won the bronze medal.

Strike paralyzes life in Nepalese capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Schools, shops and businesses remained
closed in the Nepalese capital Thursday in response to a general
strike call by supporters of Maoists rebels who have been fighting
a guerrilla war since 1995.
	   Police detained 60 protesters. Life was paralyzed as vehicles
stayed off the road in Katmandu, a city of 1.5 million people.
	   Support for the rebels' campaign is not widespread. The success
of the strike is linked to fear of violence _ two people were
killed for defying a strike call in April.
	   The National People's Movement Coordination Committee, which has
strong links with Maoists rebels, accused the government of
``terrorizing and murdering innocent people.''
	   Since the insurgency began in 1995, nearly 400 people have been
killed, including policemen and civilians. The guerrillas oppose
Nepal's constitutional monarchy and demand that Nepal be turned
into a republic.
	   In May, the Nepalese government ordered security forces to flush
the rebels from their jungle hide-outs. Nearly 250 guerrillas have
been shot and killed since then.

Dollar higher against yen after attack on Iraq, stocks mixed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, comments

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar was temporarily boosted against the yen
Thursday following a U.S. and British military strike on Iraq, but
slipped back amid concerns over President Bill Clinton's possible
impeachment. Japanese stocks were mixed.
	   The dollar bought 116.10 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.48
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level
of 116.53 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 30.69 points,
or 0.22 percent, to close at 14,126.99. On Wednesday, the average
finished up 85.11 points, or 0.61 percent.
	   In currency trading, the dollar, considered a safe haven in
times of international unrest, briefly surged beyond 117 yen
following the military action. The currency ranged from 115.82 yen
to 117.17 yen.
	   Clinton said late Wednesday that he ordered a ``strong,
sustained series of airstrikes'' against Iraq in response to Saddam
Hussein's continued defiance of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   With conflict expected to last only several days, dollar-buying
faded as market focus shifted to concerns over the U.S. economy and
Clinton's possible impeachment, traders said.
	   ``With the impeachment still not out of the way, it's difficult
to conduct safe-haven dollar buying,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu,
foreign exchange manager at Commerzbank in Tokyo.
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei rebounded in late afternoon
trading after spending most of the day lower following Wednesday's
drop on Wall Street and the airstrikes against Iraq.
	   The attacks on Iraq initially raised fears that
recession-stricken Japan would face higher oil costs, sending the
Nikkei below the psychologically important 14,000-point mark in
early trading.
	   The Nikkei rallied in the final 20 minutes as investors eyed
currency movements as an indicator of developments in Iraq, traders
said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 2.53 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,090.86.
The TOPIX closed up 4.12 points, or 0.38 percent, the day before.
	   Volume on the first section was estimated at 356 million shares,
up from 336.37 million shares Wednesday. Retreating issues
outnumbered advancers 675 to 414, while 185 issues were unchanged.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond was quoted at 1.340 percent, up from Wednesday's
1.330-percent finish, pushing down its price to 103.87 yen from
103.96 yen.

Security Council bitterly divided after attacks on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with new material &QL; 
 &UR; With Iraq &QL;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The airstrikes against Iraq have bitterly
divided the U.N. Security Council, leaving it unable to decide on
any course of action to resolve the conflict over weapons
inspections.
	   Iraq, Russia and China called Wednesday night for an immediate
halt to the attacks. But the United States and Britain insisted
military action was justified because Iraq had failed to cooperate
fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The result was a formal Security Council meeting with 15
speeches, an outpouring of frustration that peace efforts had
failed, but no action _ and no timetable for future talks on the
Iraqi crisis. The council is scheduled to meet Thursday, but the
agenda is Cyprus and the Western Sahara.
	   ``I am certain the Security Council will be considering this
issue in the coming days,'' said Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergei
Lavrov, who called for Wednesday night's formal meeting.
	   For U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, it was ``a sad day for
the United Nations and for the world.''
	   Annan, who helped avert military action against Iraq in February
and November, said he did everything in his power to seek peace and
deeply regretted not being able to avert the use of force. He said
his thoughts were with the Iraqi people, the 370 U.N. humanitarian
workers still in the country ``and with all others whose lives are
in danger.''
	   He spent much of the day at the three closed council meetings
and the open council session Wednesday night.
	   Only a month ago, the Security Council unanimously backed a
resolution demanding that Iraq cooperate fully with weapons
inspectors _ as Baghdad promised Nov. 14 when the United States and
Britain called off threatened airstrikes.
	   But that unity started to fray when chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler reported to Annan on Tuesday that Iraq had not only
failed to cooperate fully but imposed new restrictions on the
inspectors' work.
	   And it totally collapsed after Butler pulled out the inspection
teams from Baghdad on Wednesday morning without consulting the
council _ and the United States and Britain then launched
airstrikes hours later without council approval.
	   During Wednesday night's meeting, there were serious divisions
among the 15-member council over a cease-fire, the accuracy of
Butler's report and his decision to evacuate inspection teams from
Baghdad, and the unilateral use of force by the United States and
Britain.
	   Some council members were also angered that the airstrikes were
launched just as they were discussing three options suggested by
Annan to deal with Butler's report, which became moot.
	   Speaking at the start of Wednesday night's meeting, Iraq's U.N.

to the uprovoked attacks which he said were ``wrecking the lives''
of innocent Iraqis.
	   Russia's Lavrov backed his appeal for an immediate end ``to

called on the United States and Britain ``to stop forthwith all
military actions against Iraq.''
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against

	   But the United States and Britain insisted the airstrikes were
launched only after diplomacy had been exhausted and Butler had

	   ``The United States did not seek a confrontation and did not

noncompliance necessitated the resort to military force.''
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said Iraq's President

which Butler heads, to produce physical evidence that Iraq still

	   ``The exaggerated uproar over the Iraqi weapons of mass

is difficult for the UNSCOM leader to shed his responsibility over
the current crisis.''
	   Asked whether Butler still had the council's backing, Lavrov
noted that steps he had taken in the last 24 hours ``were
questioned seriously'' by council members.
	   Under the cease-fire resolution which ended the 1991 Gulf War,
UNSCOM must verify that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _
chemical, biological and nuclear, as well as long-range missiles _
have been eliminated before tough economic sanctions against Iraq
can be lifted. But there were questions of when _ and whether _
UNSCOM would be able to return to Iraq.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States fired hundreds of
missiles on Iraq Thursday in attacks that lasted through the night,
and Baghdad shook with explosions and anti-aircraft gunfire. Two
people were killed and 30 were wounded, a doctor said.
	   Russia and China called for an immediate halt to the attacks,
but U.S. officials suggested the strikes may continue.
	   In the Iraqi capital, employees of government offices went to
their offices and young children headed to school in scenes that
gave little indication of the nightlong blitz. Morning traffic jams
clogged some of the streets in downtown Baghdad.
	   But the strikes were met with defiance in Iraqi newspapers.
	   ``Iraqis are pulling together to go forward to bury the
aggression's strikes and continue their new crusade to teach the
enemy lessons, which they will never forget,'' al-Qadissiya, a
government newspaper, said in an editorial.
	   Air raid sirens broke the night's silence minutes before a
barrage of anti-aircraft fire lit up the Baghdad sky at 12:49 a.m.
(2149 GMT Wednesday), unleashing thunderous blasts like a fireworks
display and shaking windows of buildings.
	   At least one missile fell in an area near President Saddam
Hussein's biggest palace in Baghdad, but the whereabouts of the
president were not known. A speech that Iraqi radio said was by
Saddam was broadcast hours after the first attack.
	   Witnesses said another missile landed in the neighborhood of
al-Adil, about two kilometers (one mile) from Abu Ghraib where a
sprawling military camp and radio relay stations are located.
	   One stray missile hit an Iranian city, Tehran radio reported.
	   Sirens were heard twice in Baghdad, and anti-aircraft guns were
fired four times during the night. As the sounds of the last
barrage at 5:18 a.m. (0218 GMT) faded, a call for prayer floated
over the winter morning from a mosque loudspeaker.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said he ordered the strikes on
military and security targets to retaliate for Iraq's defiance of
the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for eliminating
the country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological weapons,'' he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he authorized the
participation of British forces.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in his radio
address, saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face''
but ``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   An Iraqi newspaper, Babil, suggested Clinton launched the attack
to divert attention from his impeachment hearings.
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the al-Yarmouk Hospital in Baghdad,
said two people were killed and more than 30 were wounded,
suffering mostly burns in the face, hands and legs. But the full
casualty toll was not known, and there was no official word.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
mumbled Salam Mohammed, 34, as he moaned on his hospital bed, his
face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Unlike a previous U.S. attack on the city in 1993, there was no
blackout this time. The streets were brightly lit, as were many
homes when the attack began.
	   The total damage from the attack could not be immediately
assessed, although residents in an Iranian town reportedly saw
thick smoke rising from targets across the border in Iraq.
	   Iraqi officials took foreign reporters to Karada, an upscale
commercial and residential neighborhood, where a missile had
landed. The blast bursted water mains in a street, flooding a
two-kilometer (one-mile) stretch of a street.
	   Karada is across the Tigris River from the Old Presidential
Complex, but it was not clear if the palace was damaged.
	   Foreign reporters, who are based at a press center in downtown
Baghdad and can travel around the city only with a government
escort, were given selective access to the damage.
	   In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain for the attack and demanded an immediate end to
the campaign, warning it could shatter regional security.
	   At a Security Council meeting, the ambassadors of Russia and
China, both sympathetic to Iraq, urged an end to the attacks.
	   Staunch American allies _ Germany, Canada and even Japan _
supported the strikes.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the events a ``sad day
for the world,'' saying he did everything in his power to seek
peace. But he didn't say whether the attacks were justified.
	   In his speech, Clinton said the campaign against Iraq will be a
``strong sustained series of airstrikes,'' indicating that more
punishing strikes are likely in the next few days.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   In the attacks, the warships fired hundreds of Tomahawk cruise
missiles, and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck against Iraqi air
defense radars, Pentagon officials said.
	   The United States hopes the attacks will achieve what the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, says it has not been able to achieve
in seven years of work: destroy Iraq's ability to produce weapons
of mass destruction, specifically chemical and biological arms.
	   ``Instead of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam is
disarming the inspectors,'' Clinton said.
	   The U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until the
inspectors certify that Iraq is free of chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles and programs to build them.
	   Iraq accuses the chief inspector, Richard Butler, of being a
U.S. puppet who is deliberately prolonging the sanctions.
	   Butler withdrew all his weapons inspectors from Baghdad on
Wednesday, accusing Iraq of going back on its promise last month to
cooperate fully with UNSCOM. That promise had saved Iraq from an
imminent U.S. attack on Nov. 14.
	   Butler cited Iraq's recent refusal to allow a team of inspectors
into a headquarters of the ruling Baath Party. He also said Iraq
was obstructing and evading the inspectors.
	   The complaints were used by the United States and Britain as the
necessary provocation for the airstrikes.
	   Many of the U.N. humanitarian staff remained in Iraq, and their
spokesman, George Somerwill, said they had received no instructions
to evacuate. He said 133 U.N. staff were still in Baghdad and 233
staff had stayed in northern Iraq.
	   ``We are still waiting for instructions from New York,'' he
said.

Jordan closes border with Iraq to prevent influx of Iraqi refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan closed its borders with Iraq
Thursday to prevent an influx of refugees from Iraq, following
U.S.-British military strikes, the interior minister said.
	   However, the minister, Nayef Qadi, said Jordan would offer Iraq
any assistance it needed. He did not elaborate.
	   ``Our instructions are to prevent any possible waves of refugees
from Iraq to Jordan as a result of the military strike,'' Qadi
said.
	   He spoke after he held an emergency meeting with Prime Minister
Fayez Tarawneh and security chiefs to discuss measures to deal with
consequences of the military strikes.
	   Hundreds of thousands of refugees flooded into Jordan from Iraq
during the 1990-91 Gulf conflict, burdening the kingdom's
debt-strapped economy.
	   The United States and Britain launched air and missile attacks
against Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The official Petra news agency said traffic at the Rweished
border post between Jordan and Iraq was normal shortly after
midnight Wednesday and before the strikes.

Netanyahu: Clinton raised possibility of attack on Tuesday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with Israel deploying Patriot anti-missile
batteries, opening 65 gas mask distribution centers &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton raised the
possibility of a U.S. attack on Iraq already two days ago when he
first learned that Iraq was not cooperating with U.N. weapons
inspectors, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday.
	   Speaking several hours after the U.S. air strike on Iraq,
Netanyahu said Israel does not want to get involved in the new
confrontation, but reserves the right to defend itself if attacked
by Saddam Hussein.
	   The Israeli army announced it would deploy Patriot anti-missile
systems and urged its citizens to check their gas masks or obtain
new ones.
	   Patriots proved largely ineffective in the 1991 Gulf War, when
Saddam fired 39 Scud missiles with conventional warheads at Israel
in hopes of breaking up the Arab coalition against him. Israel did
not retaliate at the time.
	   Israeli military commanders said Thursday that Saddam may fire
missiles with chemical or biological warheads at Israel if U.S. air
strikes bring him to the verge of collapse. However, the generals
said chances of an Iraqi missile attack on Israel are very low.
	   Netanyahu said Clinton talked to him about the situation in the
Gulf on Tuesday. At the time, Netanyahu was standing with Clinton
on the tarmac of Ben-Gurion International Airport, waiting to see
him off after a visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas.
	   Asked by Israel army radio whether at that time Clinton talked
to him about a possible attack on Iraq, Netanyahu said: ``Yes, we
talked about this possibility.''
	   ``He told me that he was about to get a very difficult report by
(chief U.N. weapons inspector) Richard Butler on Iraq's failure to
fullfil its commitments, and that it apparently would obligate him
to act,'' Netanyahu said of his conversation with Clinton.
	   Netanyahu said Israel was maintaining a low profile.
	   ``Israel is prepared for every possibility. We are not part of
this conflict. We have no intention of being part of this conflict,
but we are preparding for every eventuality,'' Netanyahu told
Israel radio.
	   ``Who knows what is going on in that man's brain?'' he told army
radio.
	   Brig. Gen. Amos Gilad, the head of research in Military
Intelligence, said that for now it was not in Saddam's interest to
attack Israel.
	   ``So long as there is no tangible threat to his survival .... he
will not attack Israel, so as not to become embroiled in another
front,'' said Gilad. ``But if he is on the brink of extinction, he
certainly may take suicidal steps involving the launching of a few
missiles against Israel.''
	   Gilad said that in spite of Iraq's denials, it still possesses a
few missile launchers, several dozen missiles and a chemical
warfare capability.
	   Later Thursday, the army was to open 65 gas mask distribution
stations all over the country and called on the public to check
whether gas masks were still serviceable or had to be replaced.
	   Israel is much better prepared to deal with an Iraqi missile
attack than it was in 1991, a defense official said.
	   ``Today we have a satellite terminal which enables us to receive
early warning in a much shorter time and we are linked directly to
the American radar,'' said Avi Benayahu, adviser to Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   The radar system of the Arrow anti-missile missile, which Israel
is developing, is already operational, Benayahu told Israel radio.
The system, code-named Green Pine, is capable of tracking a
ballistic missile in flight, he said.
	   ``We also have something moving around in space which can see
all sorts of things,'' Benayahu said, in an apparent reference to
the Israeli satellite Amos.

Indonesian leader says he must stay close to armed forces chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military has denied rumors
that it might stage a coup.
	   Even so, civilian President B.J. Habibie says he'll stay close
to the head of the armed forces chief as long as political turmoil
in the world's fourth most populous nation continues to boil.
	   Habibie made the comment when asked by reporters why he had
insisted that military commander Gen. Wiranto accompany him to this
week's Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Vietnam.
	   ``In this political crisis, I don't want to take any risks. The
armed forces must always be close to the president, who is also the
military's supreme commander,'' the official Antara news agency
Thursday quoted Habibie as saying on a flight back to Indonesia.
	   ``So, wherever I go out of Jakarta the armed forces chief must
be close to me,'' he said.
	   Habibie also ordered Wiranto to come with him to last month's
summit of Asia Pacific leaders in neighboring Malaysia.
	   Habibie took power seven months ago after student protests and
riots forces his authoritarian predecessor, President Suharto to
quit and end a 32-year rule.
	   Student protests against Habibie have increased recently and the
president has relied on the military to maintain order.
	   Earlier this month the head of the military's main think tank
denied speculation that the armed forces might takeover the
government if economic and political turmoil worsened.
	   The military's ``loyalty to the nation will never change,'' Lt.
Gen. Agum Gumlear said.

China says it was offered money to throw Asian Games medals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with further Chinese quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chinese athletes were offered bribes to
lose in gold medal matches at the Asian Games, a senior Chinese
sports official said Thursday.
	   Li Furong, deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation, said
more than one person offered bribes to Chinese athletes and that
the athletes refused, saying they wouldn't throw a medal even for
U.S. dlrs 100,000.
	   ``Some people tried to use money to buy gold medals,'' Li said
in a telephone interview. ``It wasn't just once.''
	   ``Of course, the athletes refused,'' he added.
	   Li refused to give details about the bribes or say what
countries, sports or people were involved. He first mentioned the
bribes at a news conference for Chinese reporters, and said in the
interview that he brought the issue to light to show that Chinese
athletes were clean, not to shame others.
	   The president of the Olympic Council of Asia, Sheikh Ahmad
Al-Sabah, told The Associated Press that he has asked the Chinese
to provide the names of people who allegedly offered bribes.
	   ``This is a very serious matter, if true,'' Al-Sabah said.
``Right now it is only a rumor and to nail this rumor we have asked
the Chinese to give us the names of people and countries who made
the offer.
	   ``We are studying the whole matter very carefully and if and
when we get the names, we will order a full-fledged investigation.
But we have to wait until the Chinese give us the names,'' he said.
	   Earlier, Li, the deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation
said that in refusing the bribes, Chinese athletes declared, ``If
you give me 100,000 American dollars I won't do it.''
	   ``Some athletes also said I'm not here for money but for the
glory of the country,'' Li added.
	   Asked how he felt about his athletes' response, Li said, ``Of
course I'm happy.''
	   At a news conference later on other subjects, Wei Jizhong, a
Chinese official on the OCA Sports Committee, said in reply to a
question: ``As far as I know, one agent who spoke Chinese
approached the athletes, trying to buy the match offering U.S.
dollars. The athletes refused and reported back to the delegation
and then to the chef de mission.
	   He said Chinese officials told the athletes, ``Try to remember
the faces of the agents, we should catch them,'' but the agent was
not seen again.
	   He said Chinese teams battled constantly against doping and
corruption in the games.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A top credit rating agency downgraded the
ratings of two Hong Kong banks on Thursday and warned that problem
loans could continue to grow in the recession-plagued city.
	   Moody's Investors Service downgraded its financial strength
rating and long-term debt and deposit ratings on Bank of East Asia
Ltd. The agency also lowered its financial strength rating on Wing
Hang Bank Ltd.
	   ``The Hong Kong economy is still vulnerable to external
shocks,'' the agency said in a statement.
	   ``Weakness in domestic demand and high property prices, even
after the adjustments seen over the last year, suggest that it may
be some time before economic growth has returned to its recent
pace,'' it added.
	   Property prices have halved from their peaks last year as Asia's
financial crisis swept Hong Kong into recession.
	   The once-robust economy shrank by 7 percent in the third quarter
this year and is forecast to contract by 5 percent for all of 1998.
	   Economists say the recession won't turn around until the second
half of next year at the earliest.
	   ``Problem loans should continue to accumulate over the medium
term, although at a slower pace,'' Moody's said. The banking
system's non-performing loans may reach as high as 8 percent to 10
percent, it said.
	   However, the agency said Hong Kong banks could withstand a
deeper downturn because they have strong capital bases and strong
earnings.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan decided Thursday to begin imposing high
tariffs on rice imports starting in April of next year, a
government official said.
	   The decision was officially made by representatives from the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, the Agriculture Ministry and the
Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives, said LDP official Koji
Hanai.
	   The tariff to be imposed on imported rice will be 351.17 yen
(dlrs 3.05) per kilogram in fiscal 1999, and 341 yen (dlrs 2.96)
per kilogram in and after fiscal 2000, Hanai said.
	   Under the tariff system, the highest-grade U.S.-grown
``Tamanishiki'' brand, which sells for 300 yen (dlrs 2.60) per
kilogram in the United States, would be sold at up to 651.17 yen
(dlrs 5.66) a kilogram in Japan, or a 117 percent tariff, Kyodo
News agency reported.
	   The United States and other foreign rice exporters have
expressed concern about Japan's plans to impose tariffs on rice
imports.
	   Some, such as Australia, had feared in recent days that Tokyo
might impose tariffs as high as 1,200 percent.
	   Earlier this week, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Thomas Foley warned
Japan against implementing a rice tariff, saying it could
``cripple'' imports of U.S. rice to Japan and cause a serious trade
disagreement.
	   Tokyo, however, has shrugged off foreign complaints on the rice
issue, saying the duty conforms with World Trade Organization
regulations.
	   The United States, China and Australia are among major rice
exporters to Japan, where foreign rice imports now account for
about 640,000 tons, or 6.4 percent of Japan's total annual
consumption.
	   Under a 1993 GATT trade agreement, Japan committed to import 4
percent of its rice in 1995 and to gradually increase that amount
to 8 percent by 2000.
	   The Japanese government adopted an import tariff measure after
it judged it would ease a serious rice glut in coming years, local
news reports said.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The owner of South Korea's largest
conglomerate returned from North Korea Thursday, saying he has
struck a deal to build an industrial park in the communist country.
	   ``A broad agreement was reached on the construction of an
industrial park on North Korea's west coast,'' Chung Ju-yung told
reporters after crossing the border at the neutral village of
Panmunjom.
	   Chung, founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai group, said
he plans to visit North Korea again in February to follow up the
agreement, reached with Kim Yong Sun, a close confidant of leader
Kim Jong Il.
	   Kim Yong Sun heads a communist party organization instrumental
in helping Hyundai set up unprecedented tours of a scenic North
Korean mountain that began last month.
	   Chung, who was in the North for three days, said the 6 sq.
kilometer (16,000 acre) industrial park will be built close to the
border with South Korea and accommodate footwear and other
labor-intensive facilities to be moved from the South.
	   Experts say the cost of labor in North Korea is about one-tenth
of that in the South.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ 'Tis the season to be jolly, but not in Japan,
where companies slashed winter bonuses for the first time in five
years, according to an employer's association.
	   The average bonus was cut 1.6 percent from last winter, the
Japan Federation of Employer's Associations said in a survey
released Wednesday. It was the first time the winter bonus has
fallen since 1993, the group reported.
	   The association surveyed 271 large companies from 22 different
industries and found the average winter bonus to be 834,420 yen
(dlrs 7,183).
	   Last winter, the average bonus was 848,063 yen (dlrs 7,303).
	   Employees in the hotel industry suffered the greatest loss with
a 15.6 percent drop in their bonus, followed by auto workers, whose
bonus fell 12.8 percent, the association said.
	   In Japan, bonuses are considered part of workers' salaries and a
similar summer bonus is paid around July or early August. The
amount loosely reflects the company's profitability and is
considered a barometer of the health of the nation's overall
economy.
	   Hit by the country's worse recession in decades, many Japanese
companies have undertaken drastic restructuring and cost cutting
measures, including worker layoffs.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Malaysia and Singapore said Thursday that
have agreed to link an extension of their water-supply deal with
other issues.
	   Singapore, an island state, relies on Malaysia for water. The
100-year deal does not expire until 2061, but there already have
been preliminary discussions on whether and how to extend it.
	   Relations between the neighbors have been strained by
differences over the location of a border post in Singapore and the
cancellation of automatic flyover rights for Singaporean military
aircraft in Malaysian airspace.
	   Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said his Malaysian
counterpart, Mahathir Mohamad, made the linkage suggestion during a
meeting Thursday morning after the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations summit.
	   ``Malaysia has committed to give us water in the longer term and
tied it to part of the CIQ (Customs, Immigration and Quarantine
operations at the railway station in Singapore) and airspace
(issues),'' said Goh.
	   ``Singapore has put in writing what they want. We're waiting to
hear from KL (Kuala Lumpur) what they want,'' Goh said. ``It's a
balanced approach where both sides give something and take
something. It must be a win-win approach.''
	   Goh said in Parliament last month that Singapore and Malaysia
had submitted to each other draft agreements on funds and water
supply.
	   There has been speculation that Malaysia would only renew the
deal if Singapore helped raise funds to finance Kuala Lumpur's
economic recovery efforts.

	   HANGZHOU, China _ As supporters shouted and protested outside,
two of China's most prominent dissidents went on trial Thursday for
subversion for setting up an opposition group challenging Communist
Party rule.
	   Police maintained visible presences outside the separate trials
in two cities. Despite a flurry of detentions, 200 people gathered
in bold support of Wang Youcai in Hangzhou city. But in Wuhan,
police seized two people as Qin Yongmin was taken away after his
trial.
	   Both men claimed their innocence and mounted their own defenses
after authorities scared potential attorneys away. The trials
lasted about 2 1/2 hours, and court officials said verdicts would
be issued later and carried by state-run media.
	   Wang, a former student leader of 1989 prodemocracy protests, and
Qin, a democracy campaigner for 20 years, could be sentenced to
life in prison if convicted in the government's most aggressive
crackdown on dissent in two years.
	   Both are accused of being leading figures in the China Democracy
Party. Wang announced the would-be opposition group's formation in
June. Since then, dissidents in 14 provinces and cities have tried
to meet legal requirements to register the party but authorities
have rebuffed them.
	   In Hangzhou, prosecutors called Wang a repeat offender and
accused him of linking up with exiled dissidents to organize the
party, according to his wife. She and two family friends were the
only supporters of his allowed to attend the trial.
	   During his 30-minute self-defense, Wang ``said he had no
intention of subverting the government,'' said his wife, Hu
Jiangxia, who emerged pale and shaken after the session. She said
the judge cut off Wang's presentation, saying it was not relevant
to the indictment.
	   With 20 uniformed police flanking the Hangzhou courthouse, 200
people stood at the head of the narrow lane leading to the building
to show support for Wang. One woman carried a small banner saying
``kang yi,'' or ``protest,'' and successfully resisted efforts by
plainclothes police to grab it.
	   Local officials prevented foreign reporters from conducting
interviews and confiscated their tapes and film.
	   Meanwhile, 500 kilometers (300 miles) to the west in Wuhan, Qin
Yongmin also went on trial. Police detained a man who shouted
``Yongmin'' as Qin was taken away in a police van. Another
dissident who attempted to make a speech outside the courthouse
also was seized by police.
	   Friends of Qin and fellow dissidents said at least five among
their ranks were detained last night and released at noon after the
trial ended.
	   The show of support for Wang came despite the detentions of at
least ten leading activists in Hangzhou.
	   More than 30 people associated with the China Democracy Party
have been detained or questioned in an 18-day-old crackdown against
the group.
	   The defense lawyer hired for Wang was ordered off the case after
being held temporarily, and family members say others were
pressured not to defend either man.
	   The trials began a day before a major Communist Party gathering
in Beijing to celebrate the achievements of 20 years of economic
reform. The timing of the events highlights the widening gap
between growing social and economic freedom in China and a closed
political system that deals harshly with dissent.
	   ``The government's sole concern is to maintain its unchallenged
grip on power at the cost of smothering the Chinese people's
fundamental rights and freedoms,'' said Xiao Qiang, executive
director of the New York-based group Human Rights in China.
	   In a symbolic gesture, Wei Jingsheng and other leading
dissidents living in exile said they would stage a 24-hour hunger
strike.
	   Chinese government official contend that the trials are for
criminal acts and have nothing to do with human rights.
	   Qin, 45, and Wang, 32, are among the most prominent dissidents
still active in China. A third leading figure, Xu Wenli, also has
been detained, but not charged.
	   Wang and Qin are the most well-known dissidents China has put on
trial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in 1996. He
was convicted of subversion and served less than two of an 11-year
sentence. In return for his release, he agreed to go into exile.

Report: DaimlerChrysler considering linkup with Nissan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ DaimlerChrysler is considering taking
a stake in Japan's debt-laden Nissan Motor Co. and not in its
truck-making subsidiary as originally contemplated, a German news
magazine reported Thursday.
	   However, DaimlerChrysler Chairman Juergen Schrempp is hesitant
to do so at present, according to an advance copy of next week's
Der Spiegel.
	   ``We shouldn't take too much on board at one time,'' Schrempp
was quoted as saying. ``In three years' time we'll be measured by
whether we've made a success of DaimlerChrysler or not and less by
whether we've entered Asia.''
	   A DaimlerChrysler spokesman declined to comment until he had
read the Spiegel article.
	   Daimler-Benz and Nissan said in July they will jointly build a
light truck starting in 2002 as the first step toward a broader
alliance. Daimler also said then it was considering taking a stake
in Nissan Diesel.
	   Originally expected to decide by year's end, the board will miss
that deadline due to the workload surrounding the DaimlerChrysler
merger, a company spokesman said last week.
	   Spiegel added that Nissan is also discussing possible linkups
with France's Renault and Ford Motor Co.
	   Nissan is looking for an all-around partner and not just for a
company to take over its diesel trucks, reported Spiegel.

 &UR; Serb police arrest 3 Albanians in Kosovo killings
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of arrests, trims. Changes dateline,
byline.
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police were reported
Thursday to have arrested three Kosovo Albanians in the slayings of
six young Serbs whose deaths further inflamed tensions in the
province and prompted harassment against ethnic Albanians.
	   Police in Pec, where Monday's brutal barroom killings occurred,
sealed off a suburb of the western Kosovo city as well as the
nearby village of Glodjane and arrested three suspected accomplices
in the crime, the Serb-run Media Center said.
	   They were hunting for 11 other ethnic Albanians whom they said
organized and carried out the attack, the report said, citing a
police source. Police released the names of nine of those suspects
_ ethnic Albanian men between the ages of 18 and 29.
	   The political representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which is fighting to drive Serb police out of Kosovo and break the
province away from Serbia, has denied KLA involvement in Monday's
attack.
	   But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this week to arrest
the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   Serbian state-run media late Wednesday called the United States
``the biggest accomplice of the most monstrous crimes of the
Albanian terrorists.''
	   Thousands of Serbs gathered at a rally in Pristina on Wednesday
to protest the killings, and 5,000 attended an emotional service in
Pec where the victims were buried.
	   A policeman heading to the funeral in Pec on Wednesday
reportedly shot and killed a suspected rebel in the latest in a
wave of violence that has taken dozens of lives since an October
truce. Some ethnic Albanians elsewhere complained of harassment
connected to the killings, including schoolchildren being beaten by
Serb civilians and broken Albanian shop windows.
	   The killings cast further gloom over stalled diplomatic efforts
to resolve the Serb-Albanian standoff in Kosovo, where more than
1,000 people have been killed since Milosevic began a crackdown on
separatists in February.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, whose weeks of shuttle diplomacy
have failed to produce visible progress toward a political
settlement on Kosovo's future, was expected back in Pristina for
more talks on Thursday.
	   Serbian authorities say they are willing to grant only limited
autonomy for Kosovo, while most of the overwhelmingly
Albanian-populated province want independence from Serbia _ the
dominant republic remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Wednesday that Serb military and police have increased their
presence on roads and in the cities of Kosovo. Serb police deny
there has been an increase.

Bribery allegations hit games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with later medals &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ As China neared the 100 gold medal mark
at the Asian Games Thursday, one of its team leaders said Chinese
athletes had been offered bribes to lose in gold medal matches.
	   Li Furong, deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation, gave
no names or other details, but said there had been more than one
case. The president of the Olympic Council of Asia, Sheikh Ahmad
Al-Sabah, said that if the Chinese do provide names, the OCA will
order an investigation.
	   Meanwhile, South Korea was the big winner in Thursday's early
events, taking gold in cycling, archery and badminton.
	   But its total of 54 gold medals was still far behind China's 96.
Japan had 44 after taking the badminton women's singles.
	   Indonesian tennis player Yayuk Basuki handed the Thais another
setback after their soccer team's ``miracle'' run was ended by
Kuwait in Wednesday's semifinals. She beat Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-4,
6-2 in the women's singles final despite the partisan crowd
cheering for her mistakes as well as Tamarine's winners.
	   But the Thais were celebrating soon afterward. Brothers Paradorn
and Narathorn Srichaphan beat South Korea's Lee Hyung-taik and Yoon
Yong-il 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) for the men's doubles gold. Fans jammed into
the stadium's front row to seek autographs.
	   Basuki said she was not put off by the crowd noise, and added:
``This title means a lot to me even though it is not a professional
tour event. I am just so pleased to have won this gold medal for
the Indonesian people.''
	   She and Tamarine are close friends from the women's tennis tour,
and they hugged several times after the match.
	   `` We are like a family when we're on the tour,'' said Basuki.
	   South Korea's archers swept to their third gold medal. After
earlier taking the men's and women's individual events, they took
the women's team gold Thursday, winning a shoot-out with China
242-238. That made Kim Jo-sun a double gold medalist.
	   In cycling, South Korea beat Kazakstan by seven seconds for the
gold in men's four-kilometer team pursuit cycling.
	   Kazakstan's Sergey Lavrenenko won the day's other cycling gold,
in the men's 40-kilometer points race, beating South Korea's Cho
Ho-sung 41 points to 34.
	   In early badminton finals, Japan's Kanako Yonekura beat China's
Gong Zhichao 1-11, 11-5, 11-6 for the women's singles gold. Kim
Dong-moon and La Kyung-min won an all-Korean mixed doubles final
15-6, 15-8 against Lee Dong-soo and Kim Kying-jin.
	   In the alleged bribery cases, Chins's Li said, ``Some people
tried to use money to buy gold medals. It wasn't just once.''
	   ``Of course, the athletes refused,'' he added.
	   Li said the athletes responded: ``If you give me 100,000
American dollars I won't do it.''
	   Wei Jizhong, a Chinese official on the OCA Sports Committee,
said an agent who spoke Chinese aproached the athletes, but was not
seen again after delegation leaders told the athletes to try to
remember the agent's face and help catch the person.
	   OCA president Al-Sabah called the matter serious, adding: ``We
are studying the whole matter very carefully and if and when we get
the names, we will order a full-fledged investigation. But we have
to wait until the Chinese give us the names.''

British joins with United States on attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS thruout with new information from British foreign
secretary &QL; 
 &UR; By MARA D. BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign Secretary Robin Cook warned Thursday that
Wednesday night's U.S.-British attack against Iraq ``is not the
end.''
	   He said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. that
the airstrikes would continue until Britain and the United States
achieved the twin objectives of ``degrading'' Saddam Hussein's
capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction and ``diminishing
severely'' the war machine that keeps him in power.
	   ``He is not going to succeed in developing weapons with which he
can threaten the whole region and threaten humanity,'' Cook said.
	   He told BBC Radio 4's Today program that British troops did not
participate in Wednesday's attack, which he said involved only
cruise missiles.
	   But Cook said Britain would be ``heavily involved'' in the
future manned aircraft raids, contributing ``about a fifth'' of the
force.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair announced Britain's participation on
Wednesday night, moments after the assault began at 10 p.m. (2200
GMT) local time.
	   ``We act because we must,'' Blair told reporters outside his
official Downing Street residence.
	   The government canceled regularly scheduled Parliamentary action
Thursday for Blair to address lawmakers and hold a special debate
on the Iraqi situation.
	   The opposition Conservative Party, however, gave their immediate
support.
	   ``The behavior of Saddam Hussein is a serious danger to the
peace of the Middle East and beyond and the interests of this
country,'' Conservative Party leader William Hague said. ``Across
political parties, we unite behind this action and the brave men
and women of our armed services who have carried it out.''
	   Hague also called on both nations to step up efforts to remove
Saddam from power.
	   On Tuesday, a report by chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler accused Saddam of not meeting promises made last month to
fully cooperate with U.N. inspectors.
	   ``Despite constant lies, prevarication and breaching of the
agreed conditions, the weapons inspectors carried out their task,
uncovering in the process vast evidence of weapons of mass
destruction,'' Blair said.
	   ``Saddam has no intention whatever of keeping to his word,'' he
added. ``He is a serial breaker of promises.''
	   Britain has stood alongside the United States in threatening to
attack Iraq, and its forces were to have joined with American units
in a strike that was called off in mid-November.
	   Cook warned Thursday that ``yes, of course, people will be
killed in this operation,'' but he said it was essential that
Britain and the United States act.
	   But about 30 demonstrators from the Islamic group Al-Muhajiroun
disagreed. They gathered outside the prime minister's office to
protest the military action.
	   Britain has 12 Tornado GR1 bombers stationed in Kuwait, 35 miles
(55 kms) from the Iraqi border. Another six Tornados were based in
Saudi Arabia. Additionally, two VC-10 tankers were based in Bahrain
to provide in-flight refueling.
	   The Royal Navy also had a Type 22 frigate, the HMS Boxer, in the
area.

Analysts laud Singapore bank's takeover of Hong Kong institution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Development Bank of Singapore's decision to
take control of Hong Kong's Kwong On Bank was applauded by analysts
on Thursday who predict boosted earnings and healthy
regionalization for the island nation's largest bank.
	   Ending months of speculation on Wednesday, DBS said it would
acquire a controlling interest in the Hong Kong bank through its
wholly-owned subsidiary DBS Group Holdings, which will buy a
minimum 65 percent stake.
	   DBS has secured commitments from Japan's Fuji Bank for 36.5
percent of the bank, from large share holding members of the Leung
and Chang families for 14.9 percent, and another 13.6 percent from
Kwong On Holdings, a joint venture between Fuji Bank and the Leung
family.
	   The move is part of a regional drive by DBS, which has been
actively scouting and purchasing banking assets in
economically-troubled Asian countries since the start of the
regional crisis.
	   ``They have probably done more bank-related acquisitions this
year than anyone else in the region,'' Michael Berchtold, managing
director of Morgan Stanley Asia in Hong Kong, told Dow Jones
Newswires.
	   Some observers hailed DBS' latest takeover action as
strategically valuable.
	   ``We deem it positive because it would add to earnings and
enable DBS to make inroads into Hong Kong's banking sector,'' said
Lim Beng Eu, an analyst at Vickers Ballas Investment Research in
Singapore.
	   DBS was ``actually quite aggressive in making this
acquisition,'' argued Lim, who said the bank was positioning itself
for the future return of growth in regional economies.
	   If DBS fully acquires Kwong On Bank by next year, Lim predicted
that the Singapore bank's net profits would be boosted by about 10
percent _ or at least 50 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 30
million) _ to about 550 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 333
million) in 1999.
	   DBS will pay between 2.8 billion and 4.3 billion Hong Kong
dollars (dlrs 361 million to 555 million) for the initial
controlling stake in Kwong On Bank, according to Dow Jones
Newswires.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
and his British counterpart skipped the NATO defense ministers
meeting Thursday in favor of staying at home and dealing with the
bombing of Iraq.
	   As the alliance's defense chiefs gathered for their two-day,
year-end meeting, the United States and Britain continued their
missile assault on Iraq.
	   ``The German government has clearly said that we politically
support the approach of the United States,'' said German Defense
Minister Rudolf Scharping. ``We think that Saddam Hussein has to
comply fully with the U.N. Security Council resolution. He didn't
do that. That's why he is fully responsible for the military
actions, which are necessary.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana also blamed Saddam Hussein,
but in his statement did not mention the attacks.
	   Solana said all efforts by the United Nations over the past
several months have been unsuccessful.
	   ``He alone is responsible for the grave situation and for the
consequences that his defiance of the will of the international
community has entailed,'' Solana said.
	   Ministers were to take up the thorny questions of rising
violence in Kosovo and the slow pace of peace efforts in Bosnia.

Basuki wins tennis title

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's doubles final, second singles semifinal &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Indonesia's Yayuk Basuki overcame a
patriotic crowd to crush hometown hope Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-4, 6-2
in the women's tennis final at the Asian Games Thursday.
	   Basuki, ranked No. 56 by the WTA, rode to victory on a strong
groundstroke assault against the No. 37-ranked Tamarine.
	   A full house tried to lift the 21-year-old Thai after she
dropped the opening set, but she suffered two breaks in the second.
	   The Thais were celebrating soon afterward, however. Brothers
Paradorn and Narathorn Srichaphan beat South Korea's Lee Hyung-taik
and Yoon Yong-il 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) for the men's doubles gold. Fans
jammed into the stadium's front row to seek autographs.
	   Basuki and Tamarine are close friends because of time spent
together on the world tour and had a long hug at the net after
Tamarine hit a backhand wide on the second match point.
	   Tamarine accepted flowers from her fans but spent the next
half-hour trying to smile through her disappointment and ward off
tears. Basuki, who is seven years Tamarine's senior, tried to keep
her opponent cheered up and hugged her several more times before
and during the medal ceremony.
	   `` We are like a family when we're on the tour,'' said Basuki.
	   But the victory was a great moment for Basuki, who will play
singles and doubles in the Australian Open next month.
	   ``This title means a lot to me even though it is not a
professional tour event,'' Basuki said. ``I am just so pleased to
have won this gold medal for the Indonesian people.''
	   She said she was not affected by Tamarine's supporters, who went
against etiquette by cheering every Basuki mistake along with every
Tamarine winner.
	   ``I had my supporters here too, and I just concentrated on the
match,'' Basuki said.
	   Tamarine said Basuki was always in control.
	   ``Wow! She was unbelievable today. Every shot she played she
played right. She served well and she hit her balls deep,''
Tamarine said.
	   ``I felt like I was the underdog because I was younger and she
has lots of experience. When she plays very well you have to play
great, but that wasn't possible today.''
	   Basuki has been a guiding force for Tamarine. ``She's kind of
like my sister and helped me a lot on all the tours,'' Tamarine
said.
	   Basuki had an early break in the first set. Serving for the set
at 5-4, she reached set point with a forehand down the line. She
missed a backhand drop shot on the next point, but finished the set
with a well-placed second serve. Tamarine lunged but hit a weak
forehand into the net.
	   In the second set, Basuki broke in the first game on her fifth
break point when Tamarine's forehand down the line went into the
net. She broke again for 4-1 and served out the match from 5-2.
	   Meanwhile Yoon Yong-Il of South Korea became the first man
through to the gold medal game with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Srinath
Prahlad of India. His final opponent will be Japan's Satoshi
Iwabuchi, a 6-4, 7-6 (7-1) winner over India's Mahesh Bhupathi.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States fired hundreds of
missiles on Iraq Thursday in attacks that lasted through the night,
and Baghdad shook with explosions and anti-aircraft gunfire. Two
people were killed and 30 were wounded, a doctor said.
	   Russia and China called for an immediate halt to the attacks,
but U.S. officials suggested the strikes may continue.
	   In the Iraqi capital, government employees went to their offices
and young children headed to school in scenes that gave little
indication of the nightlong blitz. Morning traffic jams clogged
some of the streets in downtown Baghdad.
	   But the strikes were met with defiance in Iraqi newspapers.
	   ``Iraqis are pulling together to go forward to bury the strikes
of aggression and continue their new crusade to teach the enemy
lessons, which they will never forget,'' al-Qadissiya, a government
newspaper, said in an editorial.
	   Air raid sirens broke the night's silence minutes before a
barrage of anti-aircraft fire lit up the Baghdad sky at 12:49 a.m.
(2149 GMT Wednesday), unleashing thunderous blasts like a fireworks
display and shaking windows of buildings.
	   At least one missile fell in an area near President Saddam
Hussein's biggest palace in Baghdad, but the whereabouts of the
president were not known. A speech that Iraqi radio said was by
Saddam was broadcast hours after the first attack.
	   Witnesses said another missile landed in the neighborhood of
al-Adil, about two kilometers (one mile) from Abu Ghraib where a
sprawling military camp and radio relay stations are located.
	   One stray missile hit an Iranian city, Tehran radio reported.
There were no immediate reports of casualities.
	   Sirens were heard twice in Baghdad, and anti-aircraft guns were
fired four times during the night. As the sounds of the last
barrage at 5:18 a.m. (0218 GMT) faded, a call for prayer floated
over the winter morning from a mosque loudspeaker.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said he ordered the strikes on
military and security targets to retaliate for Iraq's defiance of
the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for eliminating
the country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological weapons,'' he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he authorized the
participation of British forces.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in his radio
address, saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face''
but ``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   An Iraqi newspaper, Babil, suggested Clinton launched the attack
to divert attention from his impeachment hearings.
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the al-Yarmouk Hospital in Baghdad,
said two people were killed and more than 30 were wounded,
suffering mostly burns to the face, hands and legs. But the full
casualty toll was not known, and there was no official word.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
mumbled Salam Mohammed, 34, as he moaned on his hospital bed, his
face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Unlike a previous U.S. attack on the city in 1993, there was no
blackout this time. The streets were brightly lit, as were many
homes when the attack began.
	   The total damage from the attack could not be immediately
assessed, although residents in an Iranian town reportedly saw
thick smoke rising from targets across the border in Iraq.
	   Iraqi officials took foreign reporters to Karada, an upscale
commercial and residential neighborhood, where a missile had
landed. The blast bursted water mains in a street, flooding a
two-kilometer (one-mile) stretch of a street.
	   Karada is across the Tigris River from the Old Presidential
Complex, but it was not clear if the palace was damaged.
	   Foreign reporters, who are based at a press center in downtown
Baghdad and can travel around the city only with a government
escort, were given selective access to the damage.
	   In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain for the attack and demanded an immediate end to
the campaign, warning it could shatter regional security.
	   At a Security Council meeting, the ambassadors of Russia and
China, both sympathetic to Iraq, urged an end to the attacks.
	   Staunch American allies _ Germany, Canada and even Japan _
supported the strikes.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the events a ``sad day
for the world,'' saying he did everything in his power to seek
peace. But he didn't say whether the attacks were justified.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   In the attacks, the warships fired hundreds of Tomahawk cruise
missiles, and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck against Iraqi air
defense radars, Pentagon officials said.
	   The United States hopes the attacks will achieve what the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, says it has not been able to achieve
in seven years of work: destroy Iraq's ability to produce weapons
of mass destruction, specifically chemical and biological arms.
	   ``Instead of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam is
disarming the inspectors,'' Clinton said.
	   The U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until the
inspectors certify that Iraq is free of chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles and programs to build them.
	   Iraq accuses the chief inspector, Richard Butler, of being a
U.S. puppet who is deliberately prolonging the sanctions.
	   Butler withdrew all his weapons inspectors from Baghdad on
Wednesday, accusing Iraq of going back on its promise last month to
cooperate fully with UNSCOM. That promise had saved Iraq from an
imminent U.S. attack on Nov. 14.
	   Butler cited Iraq's recent refusal to allow a team of inspectors
into a headquarters of the ruling Baath Party. He also said Iraq
was obstructing and evading the inspectors.
	   Many of the U.N. humanitarian staff remained in Iraq, and their
spokesman, George Somerwill, said they had received no instructions
to evacuate. He said 133 U.N. staff were still in Baghdad and 233
staff had stayed in northern Iraq.
	   ``We are still waiting for instructions from New York,'' he
said.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Thousands of people rallied in central
Grozny on Thursday in support of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov,
who has promised to clamp down on crime in the breakaway republic.
	   Maskhadov imposed a one-month state of emergency Tuesday to try
to end rampant crime and kidnappings in Chechnya. He called for
people to turn out at the rally Thursday to support his decision.
	   Hundreds of people have been taken hostage in Chechnya since the
end of a 1994-96 war with Russia. In an unusually gruesome display
of lawlessness, four Western captives were beheaded last week.
	   The hostages _ three Britons and a New Zealander _ had been in
Chechnya to install a cellular phone system. They were kidnapped
Oct. 3 and their heads were found after a rescue attempt apparently
went wrong.
	   Maskhadov blamed the leader of a prominent group of Chechen
Islamic militants for the attack and for many of the other
kidnappings that have hit the region.
	   The group, the Islamic Jamaats or Warriors of Islam, has denied
any connection with the killings, and threatened to launch attacks
on Russia if authorities clamp down on their operations, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said Thursday.
	   In a statement made on Chechen television Wednesday night, group
leaders threatened to attack Russian sites outside Chechnya if
Maskhadov tries to fight them, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   The group does not want to fight within Chechnya because it
refuses to ``spill the blood of Moslem brothers'' or play into the
hands of Russia's secret services and enemies of Chechen
independence, ITAR-Tass said, citing remarks made during the
address.
	   The group is holed up in Chechnya's second largest city,
Urus-Martan. Fighters, led by warlord Arbi Barayev, have dug
trenches around the town and say they are ready for war.
	   Maskhadov won Chechnya's presidential elections almost two years
ago by an overwhelming margin, and still retains widespread support
among many Chechens despite his failure to restore stability in the
region.

Netanyahu: Clinton raised possibility of attack on Tuesday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with Israel deploying Patriot anti-missile
batteries, opening 65 gas mask distribution centers &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton raised the
possibility of a U.S. attack on Iraq earlier this week, as he first
learned that Iraq was not cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday.
	   Speaking several hours after the U.S. airstrike on Iraq,
Netanyahu said Israel does not want to get involved in the new
confrontation, but reserves the right to defend itself if attacked
by Saddam Hussein.
	   The Israeli army announced it would deploy Patriot anti-missile
systems and urged its citizens to check their gas masks or obtain
new ones.
	   Patriots proved largely ineffective in the 1991 Gulf War, when
Saddam fired 39 Scud missiles with conventional warheads at Israel
in hopes of breaking up the Arab coalition against him. Israel did
not retaliate at the time.
	   Israeli military commanders said Thursday that Saddam may fire
missiles with chemical or biological warheads at Israel if U.S.
airstrikes bring him to the verge of collapse. However, the
generals said chances of an Iraqi missile attack on Israel are very
low.
	   Netanyahu said Clinton talked to him about the situation in the
Gulf on Tuesday. At the time, Netanyahu was standing with Clinton
on the tarmac of Ben-Gurion International Airport, waiting to see
him off after a visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas.
	   Asked by Israel army radio whether at that time Clinton talked
to him about a possible attack on Iraq, Netanyahu said: ``Yes, we
talked about this possibility.''
	   ``He told me that he was about to get a very difficult report by
(chief U.N. weapons inspector) Richard Butler on Iraq's failure to
fulfill its commitments, and that it apparently would obligate him
to act,'' Netanyahu said of his conversation with Clinton.
	   Netanyahu said Israel was maintaining a low profile.
	   ``Israel is prepared for every possibility. We are not part of
this conflict. We have no intention of being part of this conflict,
but we are preparing for every eventuality,'' Netanyahu told Israel
radio.
	   ``Who knows what is going on in that man's brain?'' he told army
radio.
	   Brig. Gen. Amos Gilad, the head of research in Military
Intelligence, said that for now it was not in Saddam's interest to
attack Israel.
	   ``So long as there is no tangible threat to his survival .... he
will not attack Israel, so as not to become embroiled in another
front,'' said Gilad. ``But if he is on the brink of extinction, he
certainly may take suicidal steps involving the launching of a few
missiles against Israel.''
	   Gilad said that in spite of Iraq's denials, it still possesses a
few missile launchers, several dozen missiles and a chemical
warfare capability.
	   Later Thursday, the army was to open 65 gas mask distribution
stations all over the country and called on the public to check
whether gas masks were still serviceable or had to be replaced.
	   Israel is much better prepared to deal with an Iraqi missile
attack than it was in 1991, a defense official said.
	   ``Today we have a satellite terminal which enables us to receive
early warning in a much shorter time and we are linked directly to
the American radar,'' said Avi Benayahu, adviser to Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   The radar system of the Arrow anti-missile missile, which Israel
is developing, is already operational, Benayahu told Israel radio.
The system, code-named Green Pine, is capable of tracking a
ballistic missile in flight, he said.
	   ``We also have something moving around in space which can see
all sorts of things,'' Benayahu said, in an apparent reference to
the Israeli satellite Amos.

Paris criticizes air strikes and Iraqi intransigence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with newspaper comment, ADDS Albright comment, byline
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Criticizing both Baghdad and Washington, France on
Thursday deplored ``the spiral of events that led to the American
military strikes against Iraq and the grave human consequences they
could have on the Iraqi population.''
	   The air strikes that began late Wednesday again put Paris at
odds with Washington over Iraq, with France having insisted on
diplomatic solutions to repeated standoffs and a lifting of
crippling sanctions against its former trading partner.
	   ``It would be very nice if those who did not support our
approach had an approach that worked,'' U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright snapped back in Washington.
	   But in its statement Paris also chided Baghdad, saying it
``regrets that the Iraqi leaders were not able to prove a complete
spirit of cooperation'' called for in an agreement they reached
with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Feb. 23.
	   The memorandum of understanding, signed during a trip by Annan
to Baghdad to head off an earlier crisis, allowed for unfettered
weapons inspections that averted U.S. and British air strikes.
	   That agreement ``would have rendered possible the complete
examination of Iraqi disarmament foreseen in (U.N.) Security
Council Resolution 1194,'' the Foreign Ministry said. A green light
after the global examination was to get crippling sanctions lifted.
	   ``That would have brought a more positive solution,'' Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin said, referring to the statement.
	   French newspapers were sharply critical of Washington. The
conservative Le Figaro said ``won't destroy the chemical and
biological arsenals'' of Iraq.
	   The leftist Liberation, headlining with ``Clinton's War,'' said
the strikes ``punished a country already weak and permanently
humiliated,'' and it noted the air strikes led Congress to postpone
an impeachment vote against President Clinton.
	   U.S. and British forces overnight Wednesday began launching air
strikes on Iraqi targets after Baghdad blocked U.N. weapons
inspectors from probing for weapons of mass destruction following
the 1990-91 Gulf War.
	   France, which in the past had fruitful trade relations with
Iraq, has wanted the U.N. Security Council to play the leading role
in the crisis, and hours ahead of the strikes expressed hope the
new dispute could be solved peacefully.

In first blast since Omagh, bomb wounds nobody outside rural pub
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A small bomb exploded outside a
rural pub late Wednesday _ the first explosion of any kind in
Northern Ireland since August's car-bomb slaughter of 29 civilians
in Omagh.
	   About a dozen customers and workers were inside the
Catholic-owned McKenna's Bar near Crumlin when a blast outside
knocked in six windows and left a crater at the front door. Nobody
was injured, said residents of the religiously mixed village 10
miles (15 kms) west of Belfast.
	   ``Given what is happening in this country at the present and
with people looking for political movement in the runup to
Christmas, this is particularly sad,'' said a local moderate
Catholic politician, Oran Keenan.
	   Keenan said ordinary residents were hoping that April's historic
accord among eight Northern Ireland parties would mean that ``we
can lie in our beds at night without worrying about a bomb being
left on our doorsteps.''
	   The blast came a few hours after talks brokered by British Prime
Minister Tony Blair's chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, failed to
resolve a four-year confrontation between the province's major
Protestant fraternal group and Catholic protesters determined to
block their traditional marches in the town of Portadown.
	   The daylong talks took place at Nutts Corner, about 3 miles (5
kms) east of Crumlin. Both sides left accusing the other side of
intransigence.
	   The Protestant group, the Orange Order, is planning mass
protests in and around the predominantly Protestant town of
Portadown starting Saturday. Militant residents of Garvaghy Road,
the main Catholic area on the town's periphery, have refused since
1995 to let the Orangemen march as they usually do each July from a
rural Anglican church down the road back into Portadown. The
confrontation has triggered widespread violence for the past three
summers.
	   Protestant extremists have previously targeted Catholics in
Crumlin this year, abducting and fatally shooting a 22-year-old
student walking home from another pub in April.
	   The pub itself _ which lies on the shores of Ireland's largest
lake, Lough Neagh _ was bombed before, by Protestant extremists in
the mid-1970s.
	   The Aug. 15 car bombing in Omagh was committed by Irish
Republican Army dissidents opposed to the outlawed group's July
1997 cease-fire. The IRA draws support from militant Catholics. The
province's various outlawed pro-British paramilitary groups, which
have roots in the poorest Protestant neighborhoods, are all
supposed to be observing cease-fires too.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
and his British counterpart skipped the NATO defense ministers
meeting Thursday in favor of staying at home and dealing with the
bombing of Iraq.
	   As the alliance's defense chiefs gathered for their two-day,
year-end meeting, the United States and Britain continued their
missile assault on Iraq.
	   ``The German government has clearly said that we politically
support the approach of the United States,'' said German Defense
Minister Rudolf Scharping. ``We think that Saddam Hussein has to
comply fully with the U.N. Security Council resolution. He didn't
do that. That's why he is fully responsible for the military
actions, which are necessary.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana also blamed Saddam Hussein,
but in his statement did not mention the attacks.
	   Solana said all efforts by the United Nations over the past
several months have been unsuccessful.
	   ``He alone is responsible for the grave situation and for the
consequences that his defiance of the will of the international
community has entailed,'' Solana said.
	   Ministers were to take up the thorny questions of rising
violence in Kosovo and the slow pace of peace efforts in Bosnia.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police were reported
Thursday to have arrested three Kosovo Albanians in the slayings of
six young Serbs whose deaths further inflamed tensions in the
province and prompted harassment against ethnic Albanians.
	   Police in Pec, where Monday's brutal barroom killings occurred,
sealed off a suburb of the western Kosovo city as well as the
nearby village of Glodjane and arrested three suspected accomplices
in the crime, the Serb-run Media Center said.
	   They were hunting for 11 other ethnic Albanians whom they said
organized and carried out the attack, the report said, citing a
police source. Police released the names of nine of those suspects
_ ethnic Albanian men between the ages of 18 and 29.
	   The political representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which is fighting to drive Serb police out of Kosovo and break the
province away from Serbia, has denied KLA involvement in Monday's
attack.
	   But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this week to arrest
the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   Serbian state-run media late Wednesday called the United States
``the biggest accomplice of the most monstrous crimes of the
Albanian terrorists.''
	   Thousands of Serbs gathered at a rally in Pristina on Wednesday
to protest the killings, and 5,000 attended an emotional service in
Pec where the victims were buried.
	   A policeman heading to the funeral in Pec on Wednesday
reportedly shot and killed a suspected rebel in the latest in a
wave of violence that has taken dozens of lives since an October
truce. Some ethnic Albanians elsewhere complained of harassment
connected to the killings, including schoolchildren being beaten by
Serb civilians and broken Albanian shop windows.
	   The killings cast further gloom over stalled diplomatic efforts
to resolve the Serb-Albanian standoff in Kosovo, where more than
1,000 people have been killed since Milosevic began a crackdown on
separatists in February.
	   Serbian authorities say they are willing to grant only limited
autonomy for Kosovo, while most of the overwhelmingly
Albanian-populated province want independence from Serbia _ the
dominant republic remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Wednesday that Serb military and police have increased their
presence on roads and in the cities of Kosovo. Serb police deny
there has been an increase.

Firebomb explodes at Athens bank branch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A firebomb exploded early Thursday at a
Commercial Bank branch in a residential Athens neighborhood,
causing damage to the bank but no injuries, police said.
	   The firebomb, consisting of 11 propane gas canisters, had been
placed beside the bank's automatic transaction machine. The
explosion destroyed the machine and caused serious damage to the
bank, located in the neighborhood of Kypseli, authorities said.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   Nearly 200 similar firebombing attacks have been carried out
this year against cars and offices belonging to diplomats,
government officials, foreigners and journalists.
	   Most have been claimed by shadowy leftist groups little known to
authorities.

Thai technocrat calls loan auction a failure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai government agency said on
Thursday the result of its auction of more than dlrs 10 billion in
bad business loans fell far short of expectations and it was
negotiating with bidders to try and get better prices.
	   The money the agency is attempting to raise through auctioning
the bad loans is needed to repair Thailand's battered banking and
finance system, which is buckling under the weight of bad debt.
	   Amaret Sila-On, chairman of the Financial Restructuring
Authority, said the agency ``was negotiating with a number of
bidders on a profit sharing arrangement that would effectively
increase the purchase price.''
	   Amaret called the results of Tuesday's auction of 370 billion
baht (dlrs 10.3 billion) worth of non-performing business loans a
``failure,'' according to Thursday's The Nation newspaper.
	   On Wednesday evening the FRA announced that four companies won
nine of 39 tranches bid on during the auction. They paid a total of
11.66 billion baht (dlrs 324 million), or an average of 37 percent
of the full value of the loans.
	   That was far below what the agency was hoping to raise.
	   The delay, and consequent attempt to renegotiate with bidders,
caused the Stock Exchange of Thailand index to lose 4.65 points,
closing at 344.53 on Wednesday.
	   Amaret said that a profit sharing arrangement would provide the
FRA with a continuing share of proceeds from the repayment of the
loans.
	   He said the negotiations would take one week, and any unsold
loans would be repackaged in a second auction.
	   The FRA is overseeing the cleanup of Thailand's shaky banking
and finance sectors which have been hard hit by the country's
economic crisis.
	   The government has taken over six of the country's 15 commercial
banks. The loans on auction were originally held by 56 finance
companies the government was forced to shut down last year because
they were insolvent.
	   The money raised from the auction will be used to refund the
Financial Institutions Development Fund, which is bailing out banks
and finance companies in trouble.

Kuwait ruling family member calls for steps to protect his nation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A member of Kuwait's ruling family,
whose father was killed when Iraqi troops invaded his nation eight
years ago, said Thursday he was worried about the country's safety
in the wake of the U.S. attack on Iraq.
	   ``We are seriously worried about what is happening in our
neighborhood,'' said Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah, who is in Bangkok for
the Asian Games as president of the Olympic Council of Asia. The
two-week games conclude Sunday.
	   ``We know the Iraqis too well, they are capable of anything,''
Al-Sabah told The Associated Press.
	   His father Sheikh Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, a previous president
of the OCA, was killed on the second day of the 1990 Iraqi
invasion, which led to the Gulf War.
	   ``Kuwait does not want war with anybody, but we should be
prepared in case the Iraqis think of attacking us,'' he said after
the U.S. attacks on Iraq to punish Saddam Hussein for not
cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   It was Al-Sabah who was instrumental in keeping Iraq out of the
Asian Games for its invasion and occupation of another member
country of Asia's main sporting body.
	   The U.S. attack on Iraq came as a surprise at the Asian Games
village, where athletes from 41 countries are staying.
	   ``As people from the same Persian Gulf region, I can't be happy
that a number of Iraqi people will be wounded or killed in that
bombing,'' said Iranian handball player Ahmad Faghihi.
	   Japanese high jumper Masumi Ono said, ``We talk about not
allowing international politics to interfere with the Asian games,
which we say is a festival for Asia extending beyond borders, but I
guess we live in a world where we never know what is going to
happen.''
	   Japanese delegation chief Teruji Kogake was surprised by the
attack, but said: ``Since it has come to this, we will have to
watch carefully as the situation develops.''
	   Athletes and officials were worried about their return home,
recalling that some airlines stopped flying in the region during
the Gulf War.
	   ``We will watch the situation closely and keep members of the
neighboring national Olympic committees informed,'' said Santiparb
Tejavanija, chairman of the administrative committee of the Bangkok
Asian Games Organizing Committee.

President says Indonesia might break up if protests not curbed
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more protests, graf 4

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president told the
powerful military Thursday that anti-government protests must be
curbed to prevent the sprawling Southeast Asian nation from
breaking up.
	   ``If the protests are not be controlled it can lead to the
disintegration of the nation,'' said President B.J. Habibie at a
graduation ceremony of new army officers.
	   Hours after he spoke dozens of riot police and troops peacefully
blocked about 100 students about 100 meters (yards) in front of the
presidential palace.
	   Another 500 protesters were stopped from marching into
Parliament. Some tore down tents used by troops guarding the
legislature and blocked a major road.
	   On Wednesday police fired tear gas and swung batons to disperse
hundreds of rock-throwing protesters at the Defense Ministry, not
far from the palace.
	   Habibie, who has promised democratic reform after decades of
authoritarian rule, said that freedom of expression that allows
protests is now guaranteed under Indonesian law.
	   ``But in carrying out these rights people must also respect
other people's rights,'' he said.
	   Indonesia, with 202 million people, is the world's fourth most
populous country. It has more than 300 ethnic groups spread over
about 17,000 islands.
	   For weeks, students have been holding street protests demanding
that Habibie force the military out of politics and put his
autocratic predecessor, ex-President Suharto, on trial for
corruption.
	   The protesters and security forces have clashed on several
occasions.
	   On Nov. 13, security forces shot dead nine student protesters
when thousands tried to march on Parliament.
	   On Thursday about 200 Islamic and pro-Habibie supporters rallied
near Jakarta's National Monument and called on anti-government
students to end their protests during Ramadan, the Muslim holy
month, which starts on Sunday.
	   Student protests and deadly riots last May also forced Suharto
to quit after 32 years in power.
	   Habibie has promised to open up the tightly controlled political
system and to hold elections next year. But the students are not
satisfied and stage demonstrations almost daily in Jakarta and
other cities.
	   Anger at Habibie's seven-month old government has been sharpened
by a continuing economic crisis, which has resulted in soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and rising poverty.
	   Sporadic rioting and looting has hit some parts of the country.
There has also been violence among the Muslim majority and the
Christian minority with dozens of mosques and churches set afire or
ransacked.
	   On Wednesday mobs rioted and attacked Chinese-owned shops in
Samarinda on the island of Borneo.
	   To counter the threat of rising violence and lawlessness ahead
of next year's elections, the government plans to establish a
civilian militia to help the police and military.
	   Some opposition groups and human rights activists fear the
group, to consist of as many as 40,000 unemployed young men, will
be used to intimidate government opponents.
	   Meanwhile a senior Cabinet minister claimed that Habibie had
moved too fast to deliver democratic reform.
	   Education Minister Juwono Sudarsono said Indonesia had now
become a ``frightening society.''
	   ``People are hungry and they take tend to take the law into
their own hands,'' he told a group of foreign business people on
Wednesday.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police were reported
Thursday to have arrested three Kosovo Albanians in the slayings of
six young Serbs whose deaths further inflamed tensions in the
province.
	   Police in Pec, where Monday's brutal barroom killings occurred,
sealed off a suburb of the western Kosovo city as well as the
nearby village of Glodjane and arrested three suspected accomplices
in the crime, the Serb-run Media Center said.
	   They were hunting for 11 other ethnic Albanians whom they said
organized and carried out the attack, the report said, citing a
police source. Police released the names of nine of those suspects
_ ethnic Albanian men between the ages of 18 and 29.
	   The political representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which is fighting to drive Serb police out of Kosovo and break the
province away from Serbia, has denied KLA involvement in Monday's
attack.
	   But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this week to arrest
the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   Serbian state-run media late Wednesday called the United States
``the biggest accomplice of the most monstrous crimes of the
Albanian terrorists.''
	   Thousands of Serbs gathered at a rally in Pristina on Wednesday
to protest the killings, and 5,000 attended an emotional service in
Pec where the victims were buried.
	   A policeman heading to the funeral in Pec on Wednesday
reportedly shot and killed a suspected rebel in the latest in a
wave of violence that has taken dozens of lives since an October
truce. Some ethnic Albanians elsewhere complained of harassment
connected to the killings, including schoolchildren being beaten by
Serb civilians and broken Albanian shop windows.
	   The killings cast further gloom over stalled diplomatic efforts
to resolve the Serb-Albanian standoff in Kosovo, where more than
1,000 people have been killed since Milosevic began a crackdown on
separatists in February.
	   Serbian authorities say they are willing to grant only limited
autonomy for Kosovo, while most of the overwhelmingly
Albanian-populated province want independence from Serbia _ the
dominant republic remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Wednesday that Serb military and police have increased their
presence on roads and in the cities of Kosovo. Serb police deny
there has been an increase.

Commercial shipping uninterrupted by strikes on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Commercial and oil shipping
operations in the Gulf have not been affected by the U.S.-British
military strikes against Iraq, the U.S. Navy said Thursday.
	   A spokeswoman of the Bahrain-based U.S. Marine Liaison Office
said there has been no report of any shipping interruptions in the
region since the military strikes began early Thursday. No
interruptions were foreseen either, she added.
	   The spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, advised
that commercial ships leave Iraqi ports.
	   The MLO liaises between the U.S. navy and the shipping community
in the Gulf.
	   The strategic Gulf is usually crowded with oil tankers exporting
oil from important producers, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran,
Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Iraq and Bahrain, through the narrow
Strait of Hormuz.

More Myanmar opposition members resign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Nine more members of Myanmar's main
opposition party have resigned and another office belonging to the
party closed, the state-run New Light of Myanmar reported on
Thursday.
	   The nine members of the National League for Democracy who
resigned were from Chin State in western Myanmar, and the NLD
office that closed was in Kya-in-Seikkyi township in Kachin State
in the north, the paper said.
	   The resignations and closing were voluntary, it said.
	   NLD leader and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi
has said, however that the resignations were coerced by the
military government and her party's leadership does not recognize
them.
	   Myanmar has been ruled by the military since 1962.
	   Since the middle of this year, the military has arrested nearly
a thousand NLD members and refused to release them until they
resign from the party or sign agreements to cease all political
activity.
	   The military has said it has arrested no one, but instead
invited the party members to stay at government guest houses and
engage in discussions, which they have done voluntarily.
	   Suu Kyi's party won 82 percent of the seats in a 1990 election
the military refused to honor.
	   The United Nations has condemned Myanmar repeatedly for its
repression against political opponents as well as rampant human
rights violations.

Dutch government supports `unavoidable' attacks on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Prime Minister Wim Kok said
Thursday that the missile attack on Iraq was ``unavoidable'' and
gave the Dutch government's backing to the strikes.
	   ``It is tragic that such an attack is necessary,'' Kok said in
an interview with Dutch television news. ``I believe they (the
United States and Britain) have rightly judged that it was
unavoidable.''
	   Kok, however, said Dutch forces _ which in the past have played
a key riole in peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia and
in Africa _ would play no role in the assault.
	   President Bill Clinton, with support from Britain, launched the
attack Wednesday night after Iraq again prevented U.N. inspectors
from hunting for weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``I hope the attacks do not last too long and that they do not
effect the civilian population,'' Kok said. He added that the
attack was ``a defeat for diplomacy.''
	   Dutch Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen said he was told about
the attacks by the British government a few hours before they
began.
	   ``Saddam has blocked inspections twice,'' Van Aartsen said.
``His cat-and-mouse games had to be ended.''

Palestinian Authority caught in dilemma after U.S. attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian school children burned
American flags and stoned Israeli soldiers on Thursday to protest
the U.S. air strikes against Iraq, but the Palestinian Authority
maintained official silence.
	   The attack placed Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a
difficult situation. He does not want to hurt his growing ties with
Bill Clinton who became the first U.S. president this week to visit
the Palestinian areas, a gesture seen by many Palestinians as
implicit U.S. recognition of their claims to independence.
	   However, Arafat also knows that he cannot suppress the strong
emotional support in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for the Iraqi
people, though not necessarily for Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   Many Palestinians side with the Iraqis as fellow Arabs and
fellow Muslims and expressed disappointment Thursday with Clinton
whom they had cheered only days earlier during his visits to the
Gaza Strip and the biblical West Bank town of Bethlehem.
	   ``What Clinton has done is unfair,'' said Hussein Najib, who
sells bread from a cart in the West Bank town of Ramallah. ``The
only victims of such attacks are the Iraqi people.''
	   Arafat and his senior advisers refused to talk to reporters
about the U.S. air strikes, apparently because they considered the
subject too sensitive. In the 1991 Gulf War, Arafat had openly
sided with Saddam Hussein.
	   Arafat's security chief in the West Bank, Jibril Rajoub, said he
would permit peaceful rallies in support of Iraq, but not violent
demonstrations.
	   In Bethlehem, where Clinton had sung along with a Palestinian
children's choir in Manger Square just two days earlier, some 20
school children threw stones at Israeli soldiers guarding Rachel's
Tomb, an Israeli enclave in the city. Palestinian policemen
dispersed the stone throwers after a few minutes.
	   In the West Bank of Abeda, several dozen high school students
burned tires and threw stones at Israeli soldiers who responded
with tear gas.
	   In orchestrated rallies in the Dheisheh refugee camp near
Bethlehem and the Gaza Strip town of Beit Lahia, hundreds of
children, among them preschoolers, were given Iraqi flags to wave.
Teachers marched in the front rows, shouting slogans.
	   In the Gaza Strip, Iraqi flags quickly replaced U.S. banners
that had covered the streets of the impoverished strip earlier this
week.
	   Safi Sayed, a Gaza City grocer who had done a brisk business
with U.S. flags was now selling Iraqi flags. Sayed said the Clinton
visit to Gaza had given him hope, but that he was now disappointed.
	   ``We are very sorry about this strike against our people in
Iraq,'' Sayed said.

Death toll in apartment building collapse reaches 23
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Rescue crew digging through the rubble of a
collapsed apartment house found three more bodies Thursday, raising
the total number of dead from the accident to 23.
	   Authorities believe eight more residents lie buried under the
rubble. But hope of finding any survivors more than 24 hours after
the collapse was virtually nil.
	   The building, in Rome's middle-class Portuense neighborhood, a
district about 6 kilometers (3 1/2 miles) from central Piazza
Venezia, collapsed during the night Wednesday.
	   Investigators were trying to determine what caused the collapse.
Initial reports suggested the structure of the building gave out.
	   The five-story apartment house was erected in the early 1950s,
which was a period of intense and hurried post-war building in the
capital.
	   Residents also reportedly complained a few years ago that
unauthorized work was done on two reinforced concrete pillars to
create an underpass to the printing plant on the ground and first
floor of the building.
	   Firefighters, police and volunteers worked through the night,
using headlamps and other lighting. The latest victims, two
children about five years of age and a woman, were found at dawn.
	   In all, nine women, nine men and five children have been found
dead.
	   The only survivors were an elderly couple found Wednesday
afternoon, about 12 hours after the collapse. The man suffered leg
fractures and the woman underwent surgery for internal injuries.

American and British defense secretaries skip NATO meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russians staying away, Portuguese quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
and his British counterpart skipped the NATO defense ministers
meeting Thursday in favor of staying at home and dealing with the
airstrikes on Iraq.
	   As the alliance's defense chiefs gathered for their two-day,
year-end meeting, the United States and Britain continued their
missile assault on Iraq, attacks that began early Thursday in
response to President Saddam Hussein's defiance of U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who was scheduled to be
at NATO headquarters on Friday for a meeting of the Russia-NATO
Permanent Joint Council, abruptly canceled his trip on orders from
President Boris Yeltstin, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``The German government has clearly said that we politically
support the approach of the United States,'' German Defense
Minister Rudolf Scharping said on arrival at NATO headquarters.
	   ``We think that Saddam Hussein has to comply fully with the U.N.
Security Council resolution. He didn't do that. That's why he is
fully responsible for the military actions, which are necessary.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana also blamed Saddam Hussein,
but in his statement did not mention the attacks.
	   Solana said all efforts by the United Nations over the past
several months have been unsuccessful.
	   ``He alone is responsible for the grave situation and for the
consequences that his defiance of the will of the international
community has entailed,'' Solana said.
	   Portuguese Defense Minister Vega Simao agreed.
	   ``I have full confidence in the judgment of our British and
American colleagues,'' Simao said.
	   Ministers were to take up the thorny questions of rising
violence in Kosovo and the slow pace of peace efforts in Bosnia.
	   American-mediated negotiations in Kosovo, the poor southern
province of Serbia _ the dominant republic of Yugoslavia _ have
failed to bring Serbs and ethnic Albanians anywhere near an
agreement. More than three dozen deaths in the province this week
has taken ethnic tensions to new heights.
	   Those tensions were compounded by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's assertion that use of a special NATO extraction force
to pull civilian peace monitors out of Kosovo in emergency
conditions would be an act of aggression.
	   NATO has a 1,700-man rapid reaction force in place just across
the Kosovo border in Macedonia. It was created in the wake of U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke's Oct. 12 deal with Milosevic to end the
fighting between the government and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking
independence in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and as many as 300,000 forced
from their homes during fighting this year in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up about 90 percent of a population of 2 million.
	   A senior NATO military officer said Milosevic agreed during
talks to both the creation of the extraction force and to its
planned activities.
	   ``The situation in Kosovo is indeed becoming increasingly
worrying,'' said a senior NATO diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Other senior NATO officials insisted that Milosevic himself
bears the primary responsibility for protecting the civilian peace
verifiers, who eventually may number 2,000.
	   In Bosnia, they other area where NATO is playing a direct
intervention role, implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace
agreement is going very slowly. That means ministers will not be
able to plan for any significant reduction in the 32,000-member
NATO-led force any time soon.
	   While there has been some success, the top civilian coordinator
in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, says the lingering ultranationalist
mentality that led to the 1992-1995 war is still there.
	   The Dayton accord chopped Bosnia up into a Serb Republic and a
Muslim-Croat Federation, each with their own government, and a
nominal central government linking them.
	   Sixty thousand troops entered the country in December 1995 on a
one-year mandate to enforce the peace agreement. That was later
extended by 18 months and the force reduced. Finally, the force was
given an open-ended mandate with reviews every six months.
	   Cohen also will be pushing Washington's proposal to create a
special center at NATO headquarters on weapons of mass destruction,
which the United States feels is one of the biggest threats of the
post-Cold War era.
	   Not all of the allies are enthusiastic. As one senior diplomat
put it, there is a certain skepticism about ``the degree of the
risk.''
	   The defense ministers also will be taking a close look at the
preparations of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for entry
into the alliance, expected sometime early next year as well as a
number of other issues that are expected to come up at the NATO
summit in Washington in April.

Dutch government supports `unavoidable' attacks on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Dutch government saying no plans to send ships to
Gulf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Prime Minister Wim Kok said
Thursday that the missile attack on Iraq was ``unavoidable'' and
gave the Dutch government's backing to the strikes.
	   ``It is tragic that such an attack is necessary,'' Kok said in
an interview with Dutch television news. ``I believe they (the
United States and Britain) have rightly judged that it was
unavoidable.''
	   Kok, however, said Dutch forces _ which in the past have played
a key role in peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia and
in Africa _ would play no role in the assault.
	   Defense Ministry spokesman Jochem van de Laarschot said there
was no Dutch military presence in the Gulf and no plans to send a
ship. The Netherlands was not asked to participate in the attack,
the Foreign Ministry said.
	   President Bill Clinton, with support from Britain, launched the
assault Wednesday night after Iraq again prevented U.N. inspectors
from hunting for weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``I hope the attacks do not last too long and that they do not
effect the civilian population,'' Kok said. He added that the
attack was ``a defeat for diplomacy.''
	   Dutch Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen said he was told about
the attacks by the British government a few hours before they
began.
	   ``Saddam has blocked inspections twice,'' Van Aartsen said.
``His cat-and-mouse games had to be ended.''

Palestinian Authority caught in dilemma after U.S. attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian school children burned
American flags and stoned Israeli soldiers on Thursday to protest
the U.S. airstrikes against Iraq, but the Palestinian Authority
maintained official silence.
	   The attack placed Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a
difficult situation. He does not want to hurt his growing ties with
U.S. President Bill Clinton earlier this week visited the
Palestinian areas, a gesture seen by many Palestinians as implicit
U.S. recognition of their claims to independence.
	   However, Arafat also knows that he cannot suppress the strong
emotional support in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for the Iraqi
people.
	   Many Palestinians side with the Iraqis as fellow Arabs and
fellow Muslims and expressed disappointment Thursday with Clinton,
whom they had cheered only days earlier during his visits to the
Gaza Strip and the biblical West Bank town of Bethlehem.
	   ``What Clinton has done is unfair,'' said Hussein Najib, who
sells bread from a cart in the West Bank town of Ramallah. ``The
only victims of such attacks are the Iraqi people.''
	   Arafat and his senior advisers refused to talk to reporters
about the U.S. airstrikes, apparently because they considered the
subject too sensitive. In the 1991 Gulf War, Arafat had openly
sided with Saddam Hussein.
	   Arafat's security chief in the West Bank, Jibril Rajoub, said he
would permit peaceful rallies in support of Iraq, but not violent
demonstrations.
	   In Bethlehem, where Clinton had sung along with a Palestinian
children's choir in Manger Square just two days earlier, some 20
school children threw stones at Israeli soldiers guarding Rachel's
Tomb, an Israeli enclave in the city. Palestinian policemen
dispersed the stone throwers after a few minutes.
	   In the West Bank of Abeda, several dozen high school students
burned tires and threw stones at Israeli soldiers who responded
with tear gas.
	   In orchestrated rallies in the Dheisheh refugee camp near
Bethlehem and the Gaza Strip town of Beit Lahia, hundreds of
children, among them preschoolers, were given Iraqi flags to wave.
Teachers marched in the front rows, shouting slogans.
	   In the Gaza Strip, Iraqi flags quickly replaced U.S. banners
that had covered the streets of the impoverished strip earlier this
week.
	   Safi Sayed, a Gaza City grocer who had done a brisk business
with U.S. flags was now selling Iraqi flags. Sayed said the Clinton
visit to Gaza had given him hope, but that he was now disappointed.
	   ``We are very sorry about this strike against our people in
Iraq,'' Sayed said.

Hong Kong stocks end up despite Iraq worries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong share prices ended higher in thin
trading Thursday despite concern over a U.S. British air strike on
Iraq.
	   Traders said stock prices were boosted by a surge in the
December Hang Seng Index futures, which rose 2.6 percent.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended up 143.92 points, or 1.4
percent, at 10,083.31. It had fallen 0.13 percent on Wednesday.
	   However, trading was light at just 2.96 billion Hong Kong
dollars, up slightly from 2.76 billion Wednesday.
	   ``There's not enough volume to read anything into this market,''
said Richard Verin, head of sales at Credit Suisse First Boston
(Hong Kong) Ltd.
	   Investors largely shrugged of the military strikes on Iraq which
they believed would not have much effect on financial markets, said
Antony Mak, a trader at Vickers Ballas Hong Kong Ltd.
	   Mak said investors also paid little attention to news that
Moody's Investors Service, a top international credit ratings
agency, downgraded its ratings on two Hong Kong banks, including
blue-chip Bank of East Asia. The agency also confirmed the ratings
of five other banks.
	   Shares in Bank of East Asia gained 20 Hong Kong cents to 14.15
Hong Kong dollars. Banking giant HSBC, the largest company on the
index, gained 4.0 to 190.0, and its affiliate Hang Seng Bank rose
2.0 to 69.25.
	   Among property shares, Cheung Kong Holdings gained 25 cents to
54.50, Henderson Land rose 10 cents to 4.53, and Sun Hung Kai
Properties rose 1.75 to 57.50.
	   Conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. gained 1.25 to 53.75 after
its unlisted telecommunications division announced it was cutting
mobile phone calling rates as much as 83 percent Thursday.

Stray missile fell on Iranian city, Tehran says

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A missile from the U.S.-British attack on
Iraq Thursday fell on the city of Khorramshahr in southern Iran,
damaging several houses, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported. No one was injured.
	   The agency said the missile struck the center of Khorramshahr in
southern Khuzestan province at 1:25 a.m. (2155 GMT).
	   The bomb hit a barren piece of land in the Dorreh district in
the center of the city, but the impact damaged homes within a 200
meter (660 foot) radius, the agency said.
	   Hadi Ravanat, who lives in Khorramshahr, said all the windows in
his house were shattered and nearby houses were partly damaged by
the impact, IRNA reported.
	   Khorramshahr, about 40 kilometers (25 kilometers) east of Basra
in Iraq, is a large port city with major oil facilities.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which is
headquartered in the Gulf state of Bahrain, refused to comment
about the Iranian report, saying all comments would have to come
from the Pentagon in Washington.
	   The British charge d'affaires and the ambassador of Switzerland,
whose embassy looks after U.S. interests in Iran, were summoned
Thursday to the Foreign Ministry, where they received a protest
over the stray missile, diplomats at both missions said.
	   The missile blast spread panic in Khorramshahr, said 22-year-old
Mehran Ahmadi.
	   ``Everyone was out in the streets all night, and we didn't sleep
a wink,'' she told The Associated Press by telephone.
	   ``It was really scary, and reminded me of the bombings during
the war with Iraq,'' Ahmadi said.
	   Iran fought a devastating 1980-88 war with Iraq.
	   An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman warned Thursday that air
strikes against Iraq would bring ``pain and misery'' to Iraq's
people and urged Baghdad to cooperate with the United Nations.
	   Relations between Iran and Iraq are still tense after their war,
which killed or injured an estimated 1 million people. But Iran has
always been against military strikes against Iraq.

Australian takes first-round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COOLUM, Australia (AP) _ Australian golfer Craig Spence sneaked
in just before nightfall with a 7-under-par 65 to take first-day
honors in the Coolum Classic pro-am at the Hyatt Regency resort
course Thursday.
	   His painfully slow round did not contain a blemish, a tribute to
the 24-year-old's patience as some rounds reached the 6-hour mark
and one group failed to finish.
	   The pro-am format has professionals playing with teams of
amateurs for the first three days of the tournament, then playing
Sunday's final round on their own.
	   ``I hit it really well off the tee and got aggressive with the
driver,'' said Spence of his career-best round. ``I was hitting
short irons into the greens which made the course easier.''
	   His late charge denied joint leadership to 23-year-old
Australian Adam Crawford (68), who squeezed two late birdies from a
surprisingly mean Coolum layout, and countryman Paul Moloney, who
also shot 68.
	   In ideal but extremely hot conditions, Crawford rolled home
much-needed birdies at the 17th and 18th holes.
	   Crawford finished ahead of drawcards and Presidents Cup players
Stuart Appleby (69) and Craig Parry (72). (djp)

Anwar's former official residence raided
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 5-7 with two new witnesses brought in to testify
and judge canceling Friday's hearing ahead of Ramadan.
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian police searched jailed
politician Anwar Ibrahim's former official residence and took away
mattresses and pillows, the trial court was told Thursday.
	   The chief defense lawyer said police went to the former deputy
prime minister's official residence on Wednesday, one day after
prosecutors produced a semen-stained mattress in court as evidence
of his alleged illegal sex acts.
	   ``I understand from my client that his former residence was
raided by police yesterday afternoon,'' Raja Aziz Addruse told the
court. No details were available.
	   Musa Hassan, the assistant commissioner of police who
investigated the accusations of sodomy, adultery and abuse of power
against Anwar, confirmed that the search occurred, but said it was
not related to the 10 charges that Anwar faces.
	   After Musa finished giving his testimony as the prosecution's
13th witness, a locksmith took the stand to testify that police
asked him to break into two apartment units where Anwar was
believed to have indulged in illegal sex.
	   The prosecution's next witness, a manager of a property company,
said both units belonged to a company where a former Anwar
associate used to work.
	   Judge Augustine Paul later said Friday's hearing was canceled to
allow ethnic Malays involved in the court proceedings to prepare
for Ramadan, the holy fasting month for Muslims which begins
Saturday. The trial resumes Monday.
	   Anwar has denied all the accusations against him, saying they
were cooked up to eliminate his challenge to Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule.
	   Musa, who led the investigations against Anwar, said there was
no high-level conspiracy, as the defense is trying to prove.
	   ``My investigations do not indicate the existence of a political
conspiracy to topple Anwar,'' Musa said. ``But my investigations
reveal the existence of a conspiracy by Anwar and other individuals
to block the process of justice.''
	   At this point the judge interjected. ``This is for the court to
decide.''
	   ``Anwar used the government's machinery, that is, the police, to
protect himself,'' Musa continued.
	   Musa said he did not get statements from Mahathir and his top
advisor, Daim Zainuddin, seen as a key Anwar rival, because he
believed the two played only ``minimal roles.''
	   ``Daim didn't play a big role,'' said Musa, adding that Daim met
with the author of a letter accusing Anwar of sexual misconduct. No
further details were provided.
	   On Tuesday, prosecutors dragged a mattress into the courtroom.
They said it was seized from a Kuala Lumpur apartment which they
alleged had been used by Anwar for his secret sexual escapades,
including sleeping with his former secretary's wife.
	   But the defense said there was no proof that it was a mattress
that was used by Anwar. Police said they had conducted a DNA test
on the semen stains on the mattress, but the results were not
disclosed.
	   On Thursday, Musa also testified that Anwar's adopted brother,
Sukma Dermawan, had told him about a ``homosexual relationship''
between the two.
	   ``Sukma on his own free will wanted to tell me about his
activities with Anwar,'' Musa said. ``In our meeting, Sukma agreed
to give a statement on video tape.'' He said Sukma's guilty plea
was voluntary.
	   Sukma has said in a statement from jail that police broke down
his resolve by conducting a painful examination of his genitalia,
Anwar's lawyer told the court on Wednesday.
	   Sukma, 38, is serving a six-month sentence, along with Anwar's
speech writer, Munawar Ahmad Anees, who also pleaded guilty to
having sex with Anwar.
	   Both men are now appealing their convictions on the grounds that
police coerced their confessions.
	   The government's case was prompted by accusations by Ummi
Hafilda Ali, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, and Azizan Abu
Bakar, a former driver for the politician's family.
	   Ummi wrote a letter in 1997 alleging sexual misconduct that was
submitted to Mahathir. Police investigations concluded the charges
were spurious and exonerated Anwar. Mahathir halted the
investigations last August.
	   But Musa began investigating the case afresh this year after a
book containing all the accusations was published.

Report: Uganda purchased 62 Soviet-era tanks from Israeli dealer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Uganda procured 62 T-55 Soviet-era tanks
earlier this year through an Israeli arms dealer, and most of them
are not operational, the government-owned New Vision Newspaper said
Thursday.
	   The tanks, which arrived last month from Ukraine at the
Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam, were recently transported by rail
to Masaka, 130 kilometers (80 miles) southwest of the capital
Kampala, according to previous media reports.
	   The newspaper said Uganda purchased the tanks from an Israeli
arms dealer Amos Golan, believed to be a former colonel in the
Israeli army now working for a company called Silvershadow Ltd.
	   The Israeli Embassy declined to comment on the report.
	   The newspaper said the tanks may have come from the Ukraine,
Bulgaria or Romania.
	   Opposition legislator Aggrey Awori, a critic of the government
of President Yoweri Museveni, told The Associated Press this week
the government paid dlrs 750,000 each for the tanks that are in
poor condition.
	   Awori said the going price in the international market for tanks
in such condition would be dlrs 230,000.
	   ``They are definitely junk,'' he said. ``We do not believe they
are combat-worthy.''
	   He accused the Ugandan government of buying the tanks to supply
the Congolese rebellion in eastern Congo. Uganda and Rwanda are
backing the Congolese rebels in their fight to oust President
Laurent Kabila.
	   Previous New Vision reports have said the tanks were all more
than 30 years old and that 10 did not even run.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
and his British counterpart skipped the NATO defense ministers
meeting Thursday in favor of staying at home and dealing with the
airstrikes on Iraq.
	   As the alliance's defense chiefs gathered for their two-day,
year-end meeting, the United States and Britain continued their
missile assault on Iraq, attacks that began early Thursday in
response to President Saddam Hussein's defiance of U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who was scheduled to be
at NATO headquarters on Friday for a meeting of the Russia-NATO
Permanent Joint Council, abruptly canceled his trip on orders from
President Boris Yeltstin, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``The German government has clearly said that we politically
support the approach of the United States,'' German Defense
Minister Rudolf Scharping said on arrival at NATO headquarters.
	   ``We think that Saddam Hussein has to comply fully with the U.N.
Security Council resolution. He didn't do that. That's why he is
fully responsible for the military actions, which are necessary.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana also blamed Saddam Hussein,
but in his statement did not mention the attacks.
	   Solana said all efforts by the United Nations over the past
several months have been unsuccessful.
	   ``He alone is responsible for the grave situation and for the
consequences that his defiance of the will of the international
community has entailed,'' Solana said.
	   Portuguese Defense Minister Vega Simao agreed.
	   ``I have full confidence in the judgment of our British and
American colleagues,'' Simao said.
	   Ministers were expected to take up the thorny questions of
rising violence in Kosovo and the slow pace of peace efforts in
Bosnia.
	   American-mediated negotiations in Kosovo, the poor southern
province of Serbia _ the dominant republic of Yugoslavia _ have
failed to bring Serbs and ethnic Albanians anywhere near an
agreement. More than three dozen deaths in the province this week
has taken ethnic tensions to new heights.
	   Those tensions were compounded by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's assertion that use of a special NATO extraction force
to pull civilian peace monitors out of Kosovo in emergency
conditions would be an act of aggression.
	   NATO has a 1,700-man rapid reaction force in place just across
the Kosovo border in Macedonia. It was created in the wake of U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke's Oct. 12 deal with Milosevic to end the
fighting between the government and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking
independence in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and as many as 300,000 forced
from their homes during fighting this year in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up about 90 percent of a population of 2 million.
	   A senior NATO military officer said Milosevic agreed during
talks to both the creation of the extraction force and to its
planned activities.
	   ``The situation in Kosovo is indeed becoming increasingly
worrying,'' said a senior NATO diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Other senior NATO officials insisted that Milosevic himself
bears the primary responsibility for protecting the civilian peace
verifiers, who eventually may number 2,000.
	   In Bosnia, they other area where NATO is playing a direct
intervention role, implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace
agreement is going very slowly. That means ministers will not be
able to plan for any significant reduction in the 32,000-member
NATO-led force any time soon.
	   While there has been some success, the top civilian coordinator
in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, says the lingering ultranationalist
mentality that led to the 1992-1995 war is still there.
	   The Dayton accord chopped Bosnia up into a Serb Republic and a
Muslim-Croat Federation, each with their own government, and a
nominal central government linking them.
	   Sixty thousand troops entered the country in December 1995 on a
one-year mandate to enforce the peace agreement. That was later
extended by 18 months and the force reduced. Finally, the force was
given an open-ended mandate with reviews every six months.
	   Cohen also will be pushing Washington's proposal to create a
special center at NATO headquarters on weapons of mass destruction,
which the United States feels is one of the biggest threats of the
post-Cold War era.
	   Not all of the allies are enthusiastic. As one senior diplomat
put it, there is a certain skepticism about ``the degree of the
risk.''
	   The defense ministers also will be taking a close look at the
preparations of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for entry
into the alliance, expected sometime early next year as well as a
number of other issues that are expected to come up at the NATO
summit in Washington in April.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
and his British counterpart skipped the NATO defense ministers
meeting Thursday in favor of staying at home and dealing with the
airstrikes on Iraq.
	   As the alliance's defense chiefs gathered for their two-day,
year-end meeting, the United States and Britain continued their
missile assault on Iraq, attacks that began early Thursday in
response to President Saddam Hussein's defiance of U.N. weapons
inspectors.

Police force students to end hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Police forced dozens of students to end a
hunger strike, after one student participating in the protest was
diagnosed with hepatitis, officials said on Thursday.
	   At 4:00 a.m. local time (0300GMT), police entered the dormitory
complex and broke up the protest that 40 students from Tirana and
Skodra universities were staging, demanding better learning
conditions and higher scholarships.
	   Despite accusations that the protest also had political motives,
Albanian authorities said the decision to break up the strike
stemmed from a doctor's discovery that one student was suffering
from hepatitis C. Doctors were checking in on the students daily.
	   ``The only reason that the police got the order to do that was
the diagnosis of the hepatitis virus in a student. It could be
transmitted to the other hunger strikers'' said a spokeswoman for
the interior ministry.
	   Some of the protesters were admitted to hospital for a check-up,
while others returned to their dorm rooms.
	   The hunger strike began late Thursday in a disco in the Tirana
dormitory complex. Students from Shkodra University, in northern
Albania, joined in the protest.
	   Two months ago, however, the government pledged to improve the
conditions in the dormitories, known informally as Student City.
About dlrs 70,000 are to be invested in the buildings.
	   Student boycotts and hunger strikes seven years ago were
instrumental in forcing Albania's last communist leader to call
multi-party elections, and the spread of organized student protests
significantly increased pressure on the government.
	   A hunger strike by students in the southern town of Vlora
preceded the failure of the government of Sali Berisha, who was
president of the country from 1992 to 1997. His government lost
power after pyramid schemes collapsed, creating anarchy and chaos.
	   Berisha, who leads the Democratic Party, called on Albanians to
gather in the capital's central Skenderbeg square at noon Thursday,
to support the students and their demands.

Japan gets first Asian Games badminton gold in 28 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kanako Yonekura converted her
giant-killing skills into Asian Games gold Thursday, outsmarting
China's Gong Zhichao to win Japan's first badminton title at the
games in 28 years.
	   Yonekura, ranked just 47th in the world, had downed the Chinese
first seed Ye Zhaoying on her way to the final and came from behind
to beat Gong, the No. 2 seed, 1-11, 11-5, 11-6 for the singles
crown.
	   ``I gave everything of myself,'' said the unseeded pony-tailed
22-year-old, who jumped up and down after her win and bowed
politely to her teammates in the stands.
	   China salvaged gold in men's singles, however, when fourth seed
Dong Jiong downed Indonesia's Hendrawan, seeded third, 17-14,
10-15, 15-8 for his first title of the year.
	   In mixed doubles, Kim Dong-moon and La Kyung-min, the
second-seeded pair, beat unseeded Lee Dong-soo and Yim Kyung-jin
15-6, 15-8 for gold in an all-South Koran final.
	   Yonekura's gold was Japan's first in Asian Games badminton since
1970, when the Chinese weren't competing, Japanese sports officials
said.
	   Yonekura had looked totally outclassed in the first game, and
the score had reached 10-0 in Gong's favor before she was able to
mark a point, earning her a congratulatory round of applause from
the packed crowd.
	   That game convinced Yonekura that she needed to force longer
rallies to give the quick-footed Gong room to make mistakes, she
said. The strategy appeared to work: having made just seven errors
in the first game, Gong made 18 in the second and a fatal 19 in the
third. Yonekura, in contrast, made just eight in that deciding last
game.
	   Yonekura also said that Gong, listed 4th in new world rankings
published Tuesday, appeared to be laboring under the strain of
being the favorite.
	   ``I was much more relaxed than the other girl because she was
under pressure to win for China,'' Yonekura said.
	   Yonekura was aided in her victory by killer drop shots to the
left and right of the court that got more accurate as the hour-long
match wore on. Gong, on the other hand, looked unable to figure a
way through Yonekura's defenses.

Hong Kong unemployment rises to record 5.5 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Unemployment edged up to 5.5 percent for the
three months ended Nov. 30, the highest level since the government
began keeping records in 1981.
	   The Census and Statistics Department said 191,000 people, or 5.2
percent of the workforce, were out of work in the
September-November period, compared with 188,700 in August-October.
	   Joseph Wong, the secretary for education and manpower, warned
that unemployment will rise further as the recession-mired economy
continues to shrink. The economy shrank by 7 percent in the third
quarter and is expected to contract by 5 percent for all of 1998.
	   Economists predict the economy will not rebound until the second
half of next year.
	   ``Hong Kong is undergoing a major economic adjustment brought on
largely by repercussions of the regional financial turmoil,'' Wong
said.
	   ``Unemployment will remain on the high side for some time as a
result of corporate downsizing and layoffs during this process.''
	   Unionists warn more people would be thrown out of work ahead of
the Chinese New Year in February, when most companies review their
operations and lay off unneeded staff after giving them a year-end
bonus and a traditional thanks for the year's service.
	   Many companies, including some of Hong Kong's largest employers,
have announced pay cuts of up to 20 percent and salary freezes to
cut costs.
	   Tang Kwong-yiu, the government economist, said at a news
conference the latest figures reflected higher unemployment in
decoration and maintenance, manufacturing, business services and
import and export sectors.
	   There were also substantial layoffs in the construction sector
as many private property projects have slowed down.
	   The territory's property values have fallen by as much as 50
percent since their peak last year. Property prices have rebounded
slightly in recent weeks as stock prices and interest rates
stabilize.
	   Although Hong Kong's unemployment is low compared with some
countries, people in the territory had been used to years of
healthy economic growth.
	   The government said earlier it is facing a 13 billion Hong Kong
dollar (U.S. dlrs 1.67 billion) welfare bill this year, a fivefold
increase in as many years.
	   Hoping to keep a lid on rising welfare costs, the government
recently announced controversial proposals to cut welfare payments
by up to 20 percent and encourage recipients to perform volunteer
work as a condition of receiving assistance.

United States orders African embassies closed as precaution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The United States on Thursday
closed all its African embassies, except for the missions in
Nigeria and South Africa, as a precaution because of the U.S. air
strikes on Iraq.
	   Offices of the Peace Corps, U.S. Information Service and U.S.
AID and consulates also were ordered closed, said Bruce Wharton, an
embassy spokesman here.
	   After the deadly U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania
last August, ``I'm sure people just didn't want to take chances in
Africa,'' he said.
	   The offices will stay closed Friday, and reopen Monday.
	   Americans traveling Thursday through Sunday who needed to pick
up passports would be allowed in to the consulate in Johannesburg,
which is being run by a skeleton staff, he said.
	   The embassy blasts killed 224 people, including 12 Americans,
and wounded thousands of others.

Prime Ministers: New Zealand and Australia support Gulf action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Australians advised to leave region, protest in
Sydney &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Australian and New Zealand
leaders gave their full support Thursday to U.S. and British air
strikes against Iraq, calling them unavoidable.
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard said that having seen the
report of U.N. weapons inspection chief Richard Butler on Iraq's
failure to comply with United Nations demands, he believed the
United States and Britain had no choice but to launch the attacks.
	   ``Any use of force is always to be regretted . . . (but) the
Australian government does not believe that the United States and
the United Kingdom have been left with any alternative,'' Howard
said.
	   ``This has been very much a case of it being unavoidable and
inevitable that if Iraq failed to comply with the earlier
undertakings then action to degrade Iraq's military capacity . . .
would eventuate.''
	   In a special statement to Parliament, New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley said the world could not stand by as Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein continually flouted U.N. resolutions.
	   ``Action, at the end of the day, is required,'' Shipley said.
	   ``There will be some (innocent) people who will suffer from the
consequences (but) to not act could lead to much more serious
consequences.''
	   Both leaders said they would consider any request for
assistance, but that none had so far been received.
	   They said they were not given prior warning of the strikes.
	   Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade urged 25
Australians believed to be in Iraq _ including a woman and her two
children on a visit to Baghdad _ to leave immediately.
	   Australians were also advised to leave Israel, West Bank, Gaza
and Kuwait and avoid traveling there unless they had essential
business.
	   In Sydney, U.S. and Australian antiwar protesters demonstrated
outside the U.S. consulate, condemning the strikes as an exercise
in distracting the world from the ``sleazy affairs'' of U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
	   Australians and New Zealanders awoke on Thursday to the sounds
of air raid sirens in Baghdad as radio and television stations
broadcast live coverage of the strikes.
	   Television and radio also carried live broadcasts of British
Prime Minister Tony Blair's announcement he had authorized British
participation in Operation Desert Fox, and a short time later,
Clinton's address to the nation.
	   During the 1991 Gulf war which drove Iraq from Kuwait, New
Zealand sent cargo planes, medical personnel and commandos to the
Gulf.
	   Australia sent two guided missile frigates and a supply ship.
	   In February, Special Air Service commandos were dispatched
separately from Australia and New Zealand to the Gulf when further
hostilities loomed. They returned home when the threat of military
action declined.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ England responded to a pre-game blast
from skipper Alec Stewart to end a month of misery with a
morale-boosting 16-run cricket victory over the Prime Minister's XI
on Thursday.
	   Their Ashes campaign wrecked by two losses in the first three
tests, the English faced a side of emerging domestic Sheffield
Shield prospects led by Australian captain Mark Taylor.
	   England clinched a much-needed win when the prime minister's
side was bowled out for 209 in reply to England's 225-8 from 50
overs.
	   Stewart said he addressed the team before the game.
	   ``I just said to them with four games of cricket to go, you're
looking to win all four,'' Stewart said. ``Get out there and show
everyone we've still got a bit of pride in our performances.''
	   The words were looking like a waste of time when England crashed
to 26-4 in the seventh over after Stewart won the toss and batted
on a slow pitch in warm conditions.
	   But contributions from Stewart (34), Nasser Hussain (41) and a
top score of 47 by backup wicketkeeper Warren Hegg lifted England
to a respectable score.
	   England's total was also boosted by 16 off the last over bowled
by Taylor. The part-time spinner bowled Angus Fraser with a
double-bouncing no ball, but then watched as Fraser smashed two of
his following deliveries for six.
	   Taylor's bowling proved the difference in the end and Stewart
was relieved he did not have to reciprocate the Australian
captain's final over-generosity.
	   England travels on Friday to Hobart for a four-day game against
a near-test strength Australian XI starting on Saturday. (djp)

Sports official promises clearer rules on limits on medals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Reacting to protests from South Korea
over medals it lost under a two-per-country limit, an official of
the Asian Games' governing body promised Thursday that clearer
rules would be written.
	   South Koreans had swept the top three places in some archery,
equestrian and bowling events, but received only the gold and
silver medals because of the games' limit.
	   In their latest protest, over a bronze lost in equestrian
competition, the Koreans insisted that some individual sports
federations allowed complete medal sweeps in one event, and that
their athletes had earned the bronzes.
	   Wei Jizhong of China, chairman of the Olympic Council of Asia
Sports Committee, apologized at a news conference, saying ``some
misunderstanding arose'' because the rules were not clearly
stipulated in the games' technical handbook.
	   He also said the rule had not been applied strictly at the last
Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994.
	   ``I thought I would get better understanding and cooperation
from the delgations that have been hurt by this rule,'' Wei said.
	   He said the committee would study proposals from the delegations
and sports federations, ``and try to write out regulations more
precisely and clearly.''

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ England completed a morale-boosting
16-run victory over the Prime Ministers XI in Thursday's cricket
tour match at Manuka Oval.
	   After winning the toss and batting first, England recovered from
being 26-4 to finish at 225-8, wicketkeeper Warren Hegg top-scoring
with 47.
	   The Englishmen bowled out the Prime Ministers combination for
209.
	   Tasmanian Daniel Marsh top-scored for the Prime Ministers team
with 74 from 72 balls.
	   Australian captain Mark Taylor's decision to bowl himself in the
final over of England's innings proved crucial as it cost 16 runs _
the eventual difference.
	   England's win was its first against the Prime Ministers
Invitation side since the 1986-87 Ashes tour. (djp)

Australian economy the `strongman' of the region, government says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's economy stood rock-solid
during the Asian financial crisis and outperformed the rest of the
world, Treasurer Peter Costello said Thursday.
	   Costello released the government's fiscal year 1998-99 mid-year
economic and fiscal outlook, which boosted official forecasts for
economic growth, jobs growth and the budget surplus while pointing
to lower inflation and steady unemployment in the current financial
year.
	   The document suggests the full impact of the Asian crisis will
hit Australia's economic growth in 1999, before a recovery in the
new millennium.
	   ``In the face of the Asian financial fury Australia has been a
rock of economic stability and growth,'' Costello said.
	   ``The Australian economy has outperformed the region and the
world.''
	   But Costello said a widening current account deficit _ expected
to expand to Australian dollars 32 billion (U.S dlrs 19.85
billion), or 5.5 percent of gross domestic product by June 30, 1999
_ made a further cut in official interest rates unlikely.
	   The midyear review increased economic growth forecasts for
1998-99 to 3.25 percent, from 2.75 percent forecast before the Oct.
3 national election.
	   Costello said growth would strengthen, reaching an annual rate
of 3.5 percent over the year to June 30, 2000.
	   Jobs growth for 1998-99 was forecast at two percent, sliding to
1.25 percent in the year to June 30, 2000.
	   Costello said the falling Australian exchange rate and the
ability of Australian exporters to diversify had helped the economy
withstand the Asian crisis.
	   But he expected business investment and economic growth to slow
next year before recovering in 2000.

situation, quotes from Lukashenko. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin kept a close watch on
developments in Iraq on Thursday, in between meetings with the
leaders of Belarus and Switzerland, his press service said.
	   At a meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko,
Yeltsin said the economic situation in Russia ``is now stable,''
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin has made a number of public appearances since he was
released from a hospital a week ago to finish recovering from
pneumonia. He had received treatment for more than two weeks.
	   Yeltsin was up for much of the night monitoring the situation in
Iraq, according to aides. He condemned the attacks on Baghdad by
the United States and Great Britain.
	   The president met Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Chief of
Staff Nikolai Bordyuzha to discuss Iraq, as well as Russia's
pressing economic problems. He also talked to Chinese President
Jiang Zemin by telephone about Iraq.
	   Later, he met at the Kremlin with Swiss President Flavio Cotti,
in Russia on a three-day visit. There was no immediate report of
their discussion, but they had been expected to discuss economic
crimes, among other things.
	   The Russian president then met with Lukashenko, who said before
arriving in Moscow on Wednesday that he would only discuss
strengthening a union treaty between Belarus and Russia during his
trip.
	   But the two leaders had also been expected to discuss Belarus's
massive economic problems, deepened by Russia's financial collapse
in August. Belarus was hit harder by the crash than other former
Soviet republics because of its strong trade links to Russia and
already weak currency.
	   In an interview with the newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta,
Lukashenko called for pooling the financial resources of Russian
and Belarus. Lukashenko has frequently pushed closer ties to
Russia, in part out of an ambition to restore the Soviet Union.
	   Yeltsin has largely passed on responsibility for the country's
pressing economic problems to Primakov, and has not traveled abroad
recently because of his health. Still, he insists he will serve out
his term, which ends in 2000.

Report: Uganda purchased 62 Soviet-era tanks from Israeli dealer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Clarifies graf 4 reason for no comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Uganda procured 62 T-55 Soviet-era tanks
earlier this year through an Israeli arms dealer, and most of them
are not operational, the government-owned New Vision Newspaper said
Thursday.
	   The tanks, which arrived last month from Ukraine at the
Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam, were recently transported by rail
to Masaka, 130 kilometers (80 miles) southwest of the capital
Kampala, according to previous media reports.
	   The newspaper said Uganda purchased the tanks from an Israeli
arms dealer Amos Golan, believed to be a former colonel in the
Israeli army now working for a company called Silvershadow Ltd.
	   The Israeli Embassy declined to comment on the report since it
involved private businessmen.
	   The newspaper said the tanks may have come from the Ukraine,
Bulgaria or Romania.
	   Opposition legislator Aggrey Awori, a critic of the government
of President Yoweri Museveni, told The Associated Press this week
the government paid dlrs 750,000 each for the tanks that are in
poor condition.
	   Awori said the going price in the international market for tanks
in such condition would be dlrs 230,000.
	   ``They are definitely junk,'' he said. ``We do not believe they
are combat-worthy.''
	   He accused the Ugandan government of buying the tanks to supply
the Congolese rebellion in eastern Congo. Uganda and Rwanda are
backing the Congolese rebels in their fight to oust President
Laurent Kabila.
	   Previous New Vision reports have said the tanks were all more
than 30 years old and that 10 did not even run.

President warns of Indonesian break up; students protest

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to lead with thousands of students protesting outside
Parliament
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of student demonstrators
threw rocks and bottles at troops guarding the Parliament on
Thursday after Indonesia's president warned that his country might
break up if anti-government protests escalate.
	   ``If the protests are not be controlled it can lead to the
disintegration of the nation,'' said President B.J. Habibie at a
graduation ceremony of new army officers.
	   Hours after he spoke as many as 3,000 students in two groups
converged on the heavily guarded legislature. Many carried sticks
but were stopped from entering by police and troops.
	   The military said several soldiers were injured when protesters
threw rocks. Some tore down tents used by troops and blocked two
major roads.
	   Earlier, dozens of riot police and troops peacefully blocked
about 100 students about 100 meters (yards) in front of the
presidential palace.
	   On Wednesday police fired tear gas and swung batons to disperse
hundreds of rock-throwing protesters at the Defense Ministry, not
far from the palace.
	   Habibie, who has promised democratic reform after decades of
authoritarian rule, said that freedom of expression that allows
protests is now guaranteed under Indonesian law.
	   ``But in carrying out these rights people must also respect
other people's rights,'' he said.
	   Indonesia, with 202 million people, is the world's fourth most
populous country. It has more than 300 ethnic groups spread over
about 17,000 islands.
	   For weeks, students have been holding street protests demanding
that Habibie force the military out of politics and put his
autocratic predecessor, ex-President Suharto, on trial for
corruption.
	   The protesters and security forces have clashed on several
occasions.
	   On Nov. 13, security forces shot dead nine student protesters
when thousands tried to march on Parliament.
	   On Thursday about 200 Islamic and pro-Habibie supporters rallied
near Jakarta's National Monument and called on anti-government
students to end their protests during Ramadan, the Muslim holy
month, which starts on Sunday.
	   Student protests and deadly riots last May also forced Suharto
to quit after 32 years in power.
	   Habibie has promised to open up the tightly controlled political
system and to hold elections next year. But the students are not
satisfied and stage demonstrations almost daily in Jakarta and
other cities.
	   Anger at Habibie's seven-month old government has been sharpened
by a continuing economic crisis, which has resulted in soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and rising poverty.
	   Sporadic rioting and looting have hit some parts of the country.
There has also been violence among the Muslim majority and the
Christian minority with dozens of mosques and churches set afire or
ransacked.
	   On Wednesday mobs rioted and attacked Chinese-owned shops in
Samarinda on the island of Borneo.
	   To counter the threat of rising violence and lawlessness ahead
of next year's elections, the government plans to establish a
civilian militia to help the police and military.
	   Some opposition groups and human rights activists fear the
group, to consist of as many as 40,000 unemployed young men, will
be used to intimidate government opponents.
	   Meanwhile a senior Cabinet minister claimed that Habibie had
moved too fast to deliver democratic reform.
	   Education Minister Juwono Sudarsono said Indonesia had now
become a ``frightening society.''
	   ``People are hungry and they take tend to take the law into
their own hands,'' he told a group of foreign business people on
Wednesday.

Head of Russia's biggest TV network asks Yeltsin for help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of Russia's largest television network
asked President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday for protection because he
says opposition leaders are trying to influence the debt-ridden
media outlet.
	   Igor Shabdurasulov, the director of state-controlled ORT or
Russian Public Television, claimed that Communist politicians are
using the company's massive debts in a bid to take control.
	   According to the business daily Kommersant, ORT owes up to dlrs
80 million to private creditors and the government. Authorities
recently launched bankruptcy proceedings against it.
	   Shabdurasulov accused Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet
of doing nothing to protect ORT from attacks by the Communists. He
also said that Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, one of the country's most
powerful politicians and a leading presidential candidate, is
trying to manipulate the outlet.
	   ``Russian Public Television is again under enormous pressure,
and the reason is the struggle for the presidential seat, the
struggle for power by unscrupulous politicians,'' Shabdurasulov
said in an open letter to Yeltsin, released by the Interfax news
agency.
	   There was no immediate reaction from Yeltsin's office. A senior
Cabinet official, who declined to be named, said Shabdurasulov was
trying to cover his own incompetence with the statement.
	   ORT drew criticism from opposition leaders in 1996 for what they
said was unfair coverage of that year's presidential race. The
station focused heavily on Yeltsin's campaign, while mostly
ignoring his opponent, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov.

South Africa criticizes U.S. strikes on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa on Thursday
criticized the U.S. air strikes on Iraq, saying military force
would not solve the conflict between U.N. weapons inspectors and
Baghdad.
	   Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo ``expressed his deep concern'' about
the attack to the U.S. deputy chief of mission, the ministry said.
	   Nzo also said South Africa supported U.N. Security Council
resolutions for Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass destruction.
	   But the strikes ``would inevitably lead to greater human
suffering for the people of Iraq,'' the ministry said.

using the company's massive debts in a bid to take control.
	   According to the business daily Kommersant, ORT owes up to dlrs
80 million to private creditors and the government. Authorities
recently launched bankruptcy proceedings against it.
	   Shabdurasulov accused Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet
of doing nothing to protect ORT from attacks by the Communists. He
also said that Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, one of the country's most
powerful politicians and a leading presidential candidate, is
trying to manipulate the outlet.
	   ``Russian Public Television is again under enormous pressure,
and the reason is the struggle for the presidential seat, the
struggle for power by unscrupulous politicians,'' Shabdurasulov
said in an open letter to Yeltsin, released by the Interfax news
agency.
	   There was no immediate reaction from Yeltsin's office. A senior
Cabinet official, who declined to be named, said Shabdurasulov was
trying to cover his own incompetence with the statement.
	   ORT drew criticism from opposition leaders in 1996 for what they
said was unfair coverage of that year's presidential race. The
station focused heavily on Yeltsin's campaign, while mostly
ignoring his opponent, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov.

Stray missile fell on Iranian city, Tehran says

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A missile from the U.S.-British attack on
Iraq Thursday fell on the city of Khorramshahr in southern Iran,
damaging several houses, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported. No one was injured.
	   The agency said the missile struck the center of Khorramshahr in
southern Khuzestan province at 1:25 a.m. (2155 GMT).
	   The bomb hit a barren piece of land in the Dorreh district in
the center of the city, but the impact damaged homes within a 200
meter (660 foot) radius, the agency said.
	   Hadi Ravanat, who lives in Khorramshahr, said all the windows in
his house were shattered and nearby houses were partly damaged by
the impact, IRNA reported.
	   Khorramshahr, about 40 kilometers (25 kilometers) east of Basra
in Iraq, is a large port city with major oil facilities.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which is
headquartered in the Gulf state of Bahrain, refused to comment
about the Iranian report, saying all comments would have to come
from the Pentagon in Washington.
	   The British charge d'affaires and the ambassador from
Switzerland, whose embassy looks after U.S. interests in Iran, were
summoned Thursday to the Foreign Ministry, where they received a
protest over the stray missile, diplomats at both missions said.
	   The missile blast spread panic in Khorramshahr, said 22-year-old
Mehran Ahmadi.
	   ``Everyone was out in the streets all night, and we didn't sleep
a wink,'' she told The Associated Press by telephone.
	   ``It was really scary, and reminded me of the bombings during
the war with Iraq,'' Ahmadi said.
	   Iran fought a devastating 1980-88 war with Iraq.
	   An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman warned Thursday that air
strikes against Iraq would bring ``pain and misery'' to Iraq's
people and urged Baghdad to cooperate with the United Nations.
	   Relations between Iran and Iraq are still tense after their war,
which killed or injured an estimated 1 million people. But Iran has
always been against military strikes against Iraq.

U.S. Senator hands Assad letter from Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ The chairman of the U.S. Senate's
intelligence committee said Thursday that he carried a message from
the Israeli prime minister to Syrian President Hafez Assad.
	   But Arlen Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania, did not
disclose the contents of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's letter to Assad.
	   Specter, who had accompanied President Bill Clinton during his
visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories earlier this week,
has shuttled between Israel and Syria several times this year in an
effort to broker peace in the region.
	   He arrived here Wednesday and flew to Cairo, Egypt, Thursday for
talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
	   Specter told a news conference in Damascus before leaving for
Egypt that he had briefed Assad on the outcome of Clinton's trip to
Israel and the Gaza Strip.
	   ``President Assad and I had a good, frank, open and extensive
discussion,'' he said.
	   He said he told Assad that Clinton was trying to bring the
Syrian and Israeli sides to resume talks which were suspended in
1996.
	   Syria demands the return of the Golan Heights that Israel
captured in the 1967 Mideast war. Netanyahu says the heights are
crucial to Israel's security.
	   Specter and Assad also discussed Iraq in their meeting
Wednesday, hours before the United States and Britain launched air
and missile attacks against Iraq for defying U.S. weapons
inspectors.
	   He said he had asked Assad to try to persuade Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein to allow U.N. inspectors free access to all weapons
sites.

United States orders African embassies closed as precaution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The United States on Thursday
closed all its African embassies, except for the missions in
Nigeria and South Africa, as a precaution following the U.S.
airstrikes on Iraq.
	   Offices of the Peace Corps, U.S. Information Service and U.S.
AID and consulates also were ordered closed, said Bruce Wharton, an
embassy spokesman here.
	   After the deadly U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania
last August, ``I'm sure people just didn't want to take chances in
Africa,'' he said.
	   The offices will stay closed Friday, and reopen Monday.
	   Americans traveling Thursday through Sunday who needed to pick
up passports would be allowed in to the consulate in Johannesburg,
which is being run by a skeleton staff, he said.
	   The embassy blasts killed 224 people, including 12 Americans,
and wounded thousands of others.

Singapore soldier jailed for illegal use of Internet account
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Singapore soldier was jailed for 10 months on
Thursday for illegal use of the Internet in a further sign the
high-tech island nation is serious about preventing
computer-related crimes.
	   Luqman bin Mohamad Fadlon, a 23-year old serving his compulsory
military training, used a company's account without permission
between December and March to chat and play games on the Internet,
reported state-run television.
	   He also sold the account information to two other people.
	   Singapore's subordinate court handed the national serviceman a
stiff sentence under the recently-amended Computer Misuse Act,
which seeks to enhance security, broaden powers of investigation,
and deter cyber criminals with tough penalties.
	   In an effort to propel its economy into the 21st century,
Singapore, a major business center, is actively encouraging
Internet and electronic commerce.
	   Luqman chalked up about 3,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 1,820)
worth of online time on Pony Canyon's Internet account, to which he
gained access from a colleague who had provided computers services
to the music and entertainment company, said the TV report.

Germany backs strikes against Saddam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder expressed
support for the U.S. missile strikes on Iraq Thursday, saying
Saddam Hussein had only himself to blame.
	   ``The use of military force is the consequence of Saddam
Hussein's stubborn refusal to cooperate with weapons inspectors as
foreseen by U.N. resolutions,'' Schroeder said on German
television.
	   He said the Iraqi leader ``bears the responsibility for the
reaction of the international community.''
	   ``There can be no doubt about our solidarity with the
international community and our U.S. and British allies,''
Schroeder said.

Thailand and UN pledge to support Cambodia's anti-drug program
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ In an effort to stifle the flow of
narcotics from the region, the anti-drug agencies of Thailand and
the United Nations pledged Thursday to provide support to
Cambodia's under-funded drug control program.
	   The assistance is aimed at tightening enforcement along the
sprawling Thai-Cambodian border, drug officials announced after a
four-day visit by representatives of Thailand's Narcotics Control
Board and the U.N. Drug Control Program.
	   Thai narcotics agents will train their Cambodian counterparts
stationed at the border crossing between Thailand's Trat province
and Cambodia's Koh Kong province, said Sorasit Sangprasert, deputy
secretary-general of the Narcotics Control Board.
	   The border crossing, 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Phnom
Penh, lies on the Gulf of Thailand in an area of Cambodia notorious
for piracy, smuggling and lawlessness.
	   Sorasit said Thailand will also provide equipment and technical
assistance for the establishment of a laboratory in Cambodia to
test seized substances.
	   ``If we find that these programs are successful, we will expand
our cooperation to other border areas,'' along the border, the Thai
drug official said.
	   Visiting UNDCP official Christian Kornevall said his office in
Bangkok would provide financial assistance to the program.
	   Cambodia, one of 28 countries identified by the United States as
a source of drug problems, is a major exporter of marijuana and an
important transshipment point for heroin coming from the Golden
Triangle, the opium-growing region bordering Laos, Thailand and
Myanmar.
	   Linked to the drug trade in Cambodia are money laundering
operations that thrive under the developing country's lax banking
laws.
	   Techniques to expose money laundering will also be taught to
Cambodian police by the Thais, according to a statement.
	   There have been several highly-publicized drug seizures in
Cambodia in the last year, but sorely underpaid police and military
are often reported to be aiding the lucrative narcotics trade
instead of curbing it.
	   In March, military police surrounded the home of one of the
nation's top anti-drug officials and opened fire with machine guns
and rocket launchers shortly after the arrest of a high-ranking
military police officer connected to a drug smuggling operation.

Republic of Congo battles militia south of capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Sporadic heavy weapons
fire boomed through the suburbs south of Brazzaville early Thursday
morning as the army battled an outlawed militia group.
	   ``We're taking control of the situation,'' said Lt. Jaques
Otalet of the Republic of Congo army. ``We have asked the civilian
population to leave the area to permit authorities to proceed with
the mopping-up operations.''
	   The shooting began Wednesday night and continued, off and on,
into early Thursday when the outlawed ``Ninja'' militia of former
Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas, who had launched scattered
ambushes, were pushed back, he said.
	   There were no details on casualties and Otelet's version of
events could not be independently confirmed.
	   The government has been battling the Ninjas in the Pool region
south of Brazzaville for the past few months, though the intensity
of the fighting has picked up in recent weeks. Pool is Kolelas'
home region.
	   Thousands of refugees have fled to neighboring Congo because of
the fighting, according to aid workers there. The Kinshasa
newspaper Palmares estimated that 10,000 refugees have crossed the
river border from Republic of Congo to Congo _ the former Zaire.
	   Kolelas and his sometime-ally, ousted president Pascal Lissouba,
fled Republic of Congo after President Denis Sassou-Nguesso and his
``Cobra'' militia _ with the help of Angolan government troops _
defeated Lissouba in a five-month civil war last year. Since then,
the Ninjas have resisted disarmament and are waging a campaign
against Sassou-Nguesso's government.
	   Since his takeover, Sassou-Nguesso has outlawed all militia
groups including the Cobras.
	   Angola turned the tide in Republic of Congo's civil war, coming
in to help Sassou-Nguesso and helping him defeat Lissouba. Many
Angolan soldiers stayed in Republic of Congo after the war ended.
	   Angola entered last year's civil war because Lissouba was
believed to be sending aid to the rebel group UNITA a Portuguese
acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
which has been fighting the
	   The Republic of Congo government has said that UNITA is now
supporting the Ninjas. (lo-ad-tjs)

Europarliament gives no-confidence vote to Commission over budget

 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with reax

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Parliament dealt a severe
blow to the European Union's Commission on Thursday by rejecting
its 1996 accounts amid allegations of fraud and irregularities in
spending.
	   A total 270 members of the 626-member parliament voted to
withhold approval of the 1996 budget; 225 voted in favor of
approving the budget and 23 abstained. A total 518 members voted
during the parliamentary session in Strasbourg, France.
	   The vote is damaging to the Commission's standing and puts
political pressure on its president, Jacques Santer.
	   The vote could be followed by a formal no-confidence vote. Under
the EU treaty, the parliament can only fire the entire 20-member EU
executive panel, not individual commissioners.
	   Under Parliament procedure, the issue is going back to the
Parliament's committee for budgetary affairs which will put it to
vote again next March.
	   The European Union has long been hounded by reports and
allegations of fraud. On Nov. 17, the EU Court of Auditors
estimated fraud and financial irregularities amounted to 5 percent
of the EU's 1997 budget of 83 billion European currency units (dlrs
97 billion) budget.
	   The EU Commission has defended itself against these attacks. The
EU's Budget Commissioner Erkki Liikanen argues he has met all
demands for tighter financial controls.
	   Yet many in the parliament deny he has gone far enough to
guarantee regular fraud reports, to keep national justice officials
informed of investigations or to create an independent anti-fraud
office.

Police disperse protesting miners from national road, railway line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Police dispersed hundreds of miners,
who blocked a national highway and railway lines in protest of
falling living standards and possible job cuts, a police spokesman
said Thursday.
	   Some 200 gold and zinc miners sat down across a central Romanian
highway and railway track Wednesday, after the state electricity
company cut power to four mines, affecting 5,000 miners. Dozens of
trains were delayed, canceled or rerouted due to the miners'
protest.
	   Pre-dawn Thursday, 200 policemen moved in to break up the
demonstration in Sandominic, a small town 225 kilometers (140
miles) north Bucharest. The miners did not resist as they were
``hungry, tired and frozen,'' said Maj. Gheorghe Tudor by
telephone.
	   According to the state electricity company, the mines have
arrears of up to 156 billion lei (dlrs 1.5 million). The miners are
demanding the government reconnect their power and guarantees their
jobs. Their demands will be discussed by the government later.
	   Last December, the government said unprofitable mines will be
closed over the coming months and tens of thousands of mainly coal
miners were laid off.
	   Miners in Romania are seen as an uncontrollable force. Twice in
the past decade, they rampaged through the capital, forcing a prime
minister to resign and killing civilians _ the state counts only
six victims, but citizens say the numbers are as high as 60.
	   The miners have said they want to protest in Bucharest at the
weekend, but it is unsure whether they will get municipal and
police approval needed to stage a demonstration.

Basuki wins tennis title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mixed doubles final &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Indonesia's Yayuk Basuki overcame a
patriotic crowd to crush hometown hope Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-4, 6-2
in the women's tennis final at the Asian Games Thursday.
	   Basuki, ranked No. 56 by the WTA, rode to victory on a strong
groundstroke assault against the No. 37-ranked Tamarine.
	   A full house tried to lift the 21-year-old Thai after she
dropped the opening set, but she suffered two breaks in the second.
	   The Thais were celebrating soon afterward, however. Brothers
Paradorn and Narathorn Srichaphan beat South Korea's Lee Hyung-taik
and Yoon Yong-il 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) for the men's doubles gold. Fans
jammed into the stadium's front row to seek autographs.
	   Japan's Satoshi Iwabuchi and Nana Miyagi won the mixed doubles,
beating South Korea's Kim Dong-hyun and Choi Ju-yeon 7-5, 7-5 in
the final.
	   Basuki and Tamarine are close friends because of time spent
together on the world tour and had a long hug at the net after
Tamarine hit a backhand wide on the second match point.
	   Tamarine accepted flowers from her fans but spent the next
half-hour trying to smile through her disappointment and ward off
tears. Basuki, who is seven years Tamarine's senior, tried to keep
her opponent cheered up and hugged her several more times before
and during the medal ceremony.
	   `` We are like a family when we're on the tour,'' said Basuki.
	   But the victory was a great moment for Basuki, who will play
singles and doubles in the Australian Open next month.
	   ``This title means a lot to me even though it is not a
professional tour event,'' Basuki said. ``I am just so pleased to
have won this gold medal for the Indonesian people.''
	   She said she was not affected by Tamarine's supporters, who went
against etiquette by cheering every Basuki mistake along with every
Tamarine winner.
	   ``I had my supporters here too, and I just concentrated on the
match,'' Basuki said.
	   Tamarine said Basuki was always in control.
	   ``Wow! She was unbelievable today. Every shot she played she
played right. She served well and she hit her balls deep,''
Tamarine said.
	   ``I felt like I was the underdog because I was younger and she
has lots of experience. When she plays very well you have to play
great, but that wasn't possible today.''
	   Basuki has been a guiding force for Tamarine. ``She's kind of
like my sister and helped me a lot on all the tours,'' Tamarine
said.
	   Basuki had an early break in the first set. Serving for the set
at 5-4, she reached set point with a forehand down the line. She
missed a backhand drop shot on the next point, but finished the set
with a well-placed second serve. Tamarine lunged but hit a weak
forehand into the net.
	   In the second set, Basuki broke in the first game on her fifth
break point when Tamarine's forehand down the line went into the
net. She broke again for 4-1 and served out the match from 5-2.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot squads fired warning shots and
tear gas when thousands of student demonstrators demanding
democratic reform tried to storm the Parliament on Thursday.
	   The protesters threw rocks and bottles at troops who pushed beat
them back with clubs.
	   Soldiers ordered reporters and news crews to leave the scene.
	   It was the second straight day that students have clashed with
security forces in the Indonesian capital.
	   Hours earlier President B.J. Habibie warned his country might
break up if anti-government protests continued to escalate.
	   ``If the protests are not be controlled it can lead to the
disintegration of the nation,'' Habibie said at a graduation
ceremony of new army officers.
	   More than 3,000 students in two groups converged on the heavily
guarded legislature. Many of them carried sticks.
	   They marched to the Parliament demanding political reform and
the release of some activists arrested by police this week.
	   Dozens of students and some troops were injured in the clash.
	   Outnumbered soldiers retreated briefly after the students tried
to run into the parliamentary grounds.
	   The protesters scattered when the troops responded with warning
shots and tear gas.
	   Some heavily bleeding students were carried to safety by their
friends through clouds of tear gas.
	   The students earlier tore down tents used by troops and blocked
two major roads.
	   Also on Thursday, dozens of riot police and troops peacefully
blocked about 100 students about 100 meters (yards) in front of the
presidential palace.
	   On Wednesday police fired tear gas and swung batons to disperse
hundreds of rock-throwing protesters at the Defense Ministry, not
far from the palace.
	   On Nov. 13, security forces shot dead nine student protesters
when thousands tried to march on Parliament.
	   Habibie, who has promised democratic reform after decades of
authoritarian rule, said that freedom of expression that allows
protests is now guaranteed under Indonesian law.
	   ``But in carrying out these rights people must also respect
other people's rights,'' he said.
	   Indonesia, with 202 million people, is the world's fourth most
populous country. It has more than 300 ethnic groups spread over
about 17,000 islands.
	   For weeks, students have been holding street protests demanding
that Habibie force the military out of politics and put his
autocratic predecessor, ex-President Suharto, on trial for
corruption.
	   On Thursday about 200 Islamic and pro-Habibie supporters rallied
near Jakarta's National Monument and called on anti-government
students to end their protests during Ramadan, the Muslim holy
month, which starts on Sunday.
	   Student protests and deadly riots last May also forced Suharto
to quit after 32 years in power. At that time students occupied the
parliament building for several days.
	   Habibie has promised to open up the tightly controlled political
system and to hold elections next year. But the students are not
satisfied and stage demonstrations almost daily in Jakarta and
other cities.
	   Anger at Habibie's seven-month old government has been sharpened
by a continuing economic crisis, which has resulted in soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and rising poverty.
	   Sporadic rioting and looting has hit some parts of the country.
There has also been violence among the Muslim majority and the
Christian minority with dozens of mosques and churches set afire or
ransacked.
	   On Wednesday mobs rioted and attacked Chinese-owned shops in
Samarinda on the island of Borneo.
	   At the same time hundreds of farmers clashed with troops during
a protest over the ownership of a plantation near Medan on the
island of Sumatra.

Dutch court rejects legal challenge to retail groups' merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch court gave the green light
Thursday for two of the nation's biggest retail groups to merge,
bringing all the top Dutch department store chains together in one
organization.
	   Rotterdam's Administrative Court refused to grant an injunction
against the Dutch competition watchdog NMA which approved the
merger of Vendex NV and NV Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer earlier
this year.
	   A group of small businesses, fearing unfair competition, had
applied for the injunction in a last-ditch attempt to block the
merger.
	   The announcement means that the two companies have cleared the
final hurdle to their 1.7 billion guilder (dlrs 909 million)
merger, which was announced in February.
	   ``Now that the court has rejected the petition to stay the NMA's
grant of a license for the merger of Vendex and KBB, there is no
longer any need to delay the integration of the two companies,''
Vendex and KBB said in a joint press release.
	   Effectively the merger is a takeover by Vendex of KBB, but both
companies stress they will operate on an equal footing within the
new organization.

Republic of Congo battles militia south of capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Sporadic heavy weapons
fire boomed through the suburbs south of Brazzaville early Thursday
morning as the army battled an outlawed militia group.
	   ``We're taking control of the situation,'' said Lt. Jaques
Otalet of the Republic of Congo army. ``We have asked the civilian
population to leave the area to permit authorities to proceed with
the mopping-up operations.''
	   The shooting began Wednesday night and continued, off and on,
into early Thursday when the outlawed ``Ninja'' militia of former
Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas, who had launched scattered
ambushes, were pushed back, he said.
	   There were no details on casualties and Otelet's version of
events could not be independently confirmed.
	   The government has been battling the Ninjas in the Pool region
south of Brazzaville for the past few months, though the intensity
of the fighting has picked up in recent weeks. Pool is Kolelas'
home region.
	   Thousands of refugees have fled to neighboring Congo because of
the fighting, according to aid workers there. The Kinshasa
newspaper Palmares estimated that 10,000 refugees have crossed the
river border from Republic of Congo to Congo _ the former Zaire.
	   Kolelas and his sometime-ally, ousted president Pascal Lissouba,
fled Republic of Congo after President Denis Sassou-Nguesso and his
``Cobra'' militia _ with the help of Angolan government troops _
defeated Lissouba in a five-month civil war last year. Since then,
the Ninjas have resisted disarmament and are waging a campaign
against Sassou-Nguesso's government.
	   Since his takeover, Sassou-Nguesso has outlawed all militia
groups including the Cobras.
	   Angola turned the tide in Republic of Congo's civil war, coming
in to help Sassou-Nguesso and helping him defeat Lissouba. Many
Angolan soldiers stayed in Republic of Congo after the war ended.
	   Angola entered last year's civil war because Lissouba was
believed to be sending aid to the rebel group UNITA a Portuguese
acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
which has been fighting the Republic of Congo government has said
that UNITA is now supporting the Ninjas.

China condemns US bombing, calls for halt to strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Shocked by U.S. airstrikes against Iraq, China
condemned the United States Thursday for acting alone and called on
Washington to stop launching attacks.
	   China accused the United States of ignoring the will of the U.N.
Security Council, of which both are veto-wielding permanent
members, by unilaterally mounting the attacks.
	   ``We feel deeply shocked by the military attack on Iraq launched
by the United States,'' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi
told reporters.
	   ``This is a violation of the U.N. charter and the principles of
international law and we condemn this. We appeal to the United
States to immediately stop all military actions against Iraq,'' Sun
added.
	   China's uncharacteristically strong comments underscored how the
sternest U.S. military action against Iraq in two years has
aggravated a long-running split in the Security Council.
	   China, Russia and France have called for restraint over months
of confrontations between U.N. weapons inspectors and Iraq. Britain
and the United States have repeatedly threatened force to get Iraq
to prove it has dismantled nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
programs as required at the end of the Gulf War.
	   In a possible attempt to try to split the council further,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun refrained from condemning Britain,
which supported the U.S. airstrikes. When pressed by reporters, Sun
called on all parties to resolve the crisis peacefully.
	   China also accused the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard
Butler, of withholding information showing Iraqi progress in a
report he gave to the Security Council. Butler's report criticized
Iraq for obstructing his special commission, known as UNSCOM.
Washington and London cited the report as a reason for the U.S.
airstrikes.
	   ``We have always maintained that UNSCOM should justly and
objectively reflect the substantial progress that has been made in
the Iraqi weapons inspection,'' Sun said. ``However, the report
offered by UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler's failed to reflect the
situation in its true face. We express our deep regret over this.''

	   Citing the maxim that justice must not only be done but seen to
be done, Pinochet's lawyers complained during a two-day hearing
this week that Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann _ one of the majority
judges in the Lords' 3-2 ruling Nov. 25 against Pinochet _ is the
director of Amnesty's fundraising arm.
	   In addition, Hoffmann's wife, Gillian, has worked since 1977 at
the group's London headquarters.
	   Amnesty has been a prime mover in a campaign to have Pinochet
brought to trial for murder, torture and other gross human rights
abuses committed by his secret police during his 1973-90 rule after
he overthrew an elected Marxist.
	   Pinochet, who was arrested Oct. 16 while recovering from back
surgery, remains under police guard at a rented mansion in
Wentworth, 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of London.

	   Next month, the 83-year-old general was due to start fighting
the Spanish extradition warrant at a London magistrate's court. But
that move will likely be on hold because of the new Lords' hearing.
	   An official Chilean report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of his secret police.
	   The Spanish government's lawyers called the complaint about
Hoffmann a desperate attempt to free Pinochet after his lawyers
failed to persuade Home Secretary Jack Straw, the British Cabinet
member with the final say in extradition proceedings, that the
judge was biased.
	   Straw gave the go-ahead Dec. 9 for proceedings to start.
	   On Wednesday, lawyers for Amnesty told the judges _ none of whom
took part in the first hearing _ that neither Hoffmann nor his wife
played any role in the campaign to have Pinochet brought to trial.
	   Hoffmann and his wife left their native South Africa in the
1960s and settled in Britain. They were opponents of apartheid.

General Motors starts dlrs 1.52 billion China car venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI (AP) _ General Motors Corp. launched a dlrs 1.52
billion sedan venture here Thursday, predicting that the factory
would provide a niche for the U.S. auto giant in a market that has
been long on potential but short on profits.
	   The first car produced by the venture _ an all-white 1999 Buick
_ rolled off the production line following a ceremony attended by
top GM and Chinese auto executives, senior Chinese government
officials and U.S. Ambassador James Sasser.
	   GM's partner in the venture, located in Shanghai's industrial
suburbs, is Shanghai Automotive Industrial Corp., China's most
profitable car maker.
	   ``As an extraordinary 1998 comes to a conclusion, we have good
news for Shanghai's industrial sector. The auto industry is the
pillar of our pillar industries, and this venture will help spur
growth in other industries. This day marks the start of a new era
in Shanghai's industrial sector,'' said Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi.
	   Following its belated debut in the intensely competitive Chinese
car market, the world's biggest automaker will face an uphill
battle to make its investment pay off.
	   GM is entering a market glutted by entrenched Japanese and
European rivals. Competition in some areas is so fierce that
Beijing has imposed minimum prices on its own small automakers to
keep them from bankrupting each other with price wars. A slowing
economy and shifting government policies have cut into the
luxury-car market targeted by GM.
	   Nevertheless, the company says it expects to thrive because it
is offering a model using the newest technology in a market often
used by others to recycle older models.
	   With 3,000 employees, the GM factory is to start out making
30,000 cars a year, eventually rising to 100,000.

Britain joins with United States on attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES thruout with new information from British
defense secretary and chief of staff &QL; 
 &UR; By MARA D. BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Defense Secretary George Robertson said Thursday
that the military strike on Iraq was not designed to remove Saddam
Hussein from power.
	   In a press conference Thursday morning, Robertson said the
military campaign is targeting weapons of destruction and was not
designed '' to kill, capture or remove Saddam Hussein.''
	   That would take many thousands of troops and a land campaign, he
said.
	   Robertson said television pictures he had seen Thursday morning
after missile strikes late Wednesday showed the initial attack had
gone according to plan, with minimal civilian casualties.
	   He gave no specifics, but he said ``pictures today show the
civilian population going about its business.''
	   Gen. Charles Guthrie, the chief of staff, said British forces so
far had not been involved in the campaign, but that 12 Royal Air
Force Tornado GR1 aircraft based in Kuwait would be. He did not say
when. He added that the six Tornado reconaissance aircraft based in
Saudi Arabia would not be taking part.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook warned Thursday that Wednesday
night's U.S.-British attack against Iraq ``is not the end.''
	   He said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. that
the airstrikes would continue until Britain and the United States
achieved the twin objectives of ``degrading'' Saddam Hussein's
capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction and ``diminishing
severely'' the war machine that keeps him in power.
	   ``He is not going to succeed in developing weapons with which he
can threaten the whole region and threaten humanity,'' Cook said.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair announced Britain's participation on
Wednesday night, moments after the assault began at 10 p.m. (2200
GMT) local time.
	   ``We act because we must,'' Blair told reporters outside his
official Downing Street residence.
	   The government canceled regularly scheduled Parliamentary action
Thursday for Blair to address lawmakers and hold a special debate
on the Iraqi situation.
	   The opposition Conservative Party, however, gave its immediate
support.
	   ``The behavior of Saddam Hussein is a serious danger to the
peace of the Middle East and beyond and the interests of this
country,'' Conservative Party leader William Hague said. ``Across
political parties, we unite behind this action and the brave men
and women of our armed services who have carried it out.''
	   Hague also called on both nations to step up efforts to remove
Saddam from power.
	   On Tuesday, a report by chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler accused Saddam of not meeting promises made last month to
fully cooperate with U.N. inspectors.
	   ``Despite constant lies, prevarication and breaching of the
agreed conditions, the weapons inspectors carried out their task,
uncovering in the process vast evidence of weapons of mass
destruction,'' Blair said.
	   ``Saddam has no intention whatever of keeping to his word,'' he
added. ``He is a serial breaker of promises.''
	   Cook warned Thursday that ``yes, of course, people will be
killed in this operation,'' but he said it was essential that
Britain and the United States act.
	   But about 30 demonstrators from the Islamic group Al-Muhajiroun
disagreed. They gathered outside the prime minister's office to
protest the military action.
	   A 55-year-old woman was due to appear in court Thursday in
connection with a demonstration outside Downing Street, charged
with criminal damage to the Centotaph war memorial and the Ministry
of Defense building.

Republic of Congo battles militia south of capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Ledes to restore dropped words in one but last graf

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Sporadic heavy weapons
fire boomed through the suburbs south of Brazzaville early Thursday
morning as the army battled an outlawed militia group.
	   ``We're taking control of the situation,'' said Lt. Jaques
Otalet of the Republic of Congo army. ``We have asked the civilian
population to leave the area to permit authorities to proceed with
the mopping-up operations.''
	   The shooting began Wednesday night and continued, off and on,
into early Thursday when the outlawed ``Ninja'' militia of former
Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas, who had launched scattered
ambushes, were pushed back, he said.
	   There were no details on casualties and Otelet's version of
events could not be independently confirmed.
	   The government has been battling the Ninjas in the Pool region
south of Brazzaville for the past few months, though the intensity
of the fighting has picked up in recent weeks. Pool is Kolelas'
home region.
	   Thousands of refugees have fled to neighboring Congo because of
the fighting, according to aid workers there. The Kinshasa
newspaper Palmares estimated that 10,000 refugees have crossed the
river border from Republic of Congo to Congo _ the former Zaire.
	   Kolelas and his sometime-ally, ousted president Pascal Lissouba,
fled Republic of Congo after President Denis Sassou-Nguesso and his
``Cobra'' militia _ with the help of Angolan government troops _
defeated Lissouba in a five-month civil war last year. Since then,
the Ninjas have resisted disarmament and are waging a campaign
against Sassou-Nguesso's government.
	   Since his takeover, Sassou-Nguesso has outlawed all militia
groups including the Cobras.
	   Angola turned the tide in Republic of Congo's civil war, coming
in to help Sassou-Nguesso and helping him defeat Lissouba. Many
Angolan soldiers stayed in Republic of Congo after the war ended.
	   Angola entered last year's civil war because Lissouba was
believed to be sending aid to the rebel group UNITA, a Portuguese
acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
which has been fighting the Angolan government for two decades.
	   The Republic of Congo government has said that UNITA is now
supporting the Ninjas. (lo-ad-tjs)

Philippine police beef up security around U.S. Embassy, other
</HEADLINE>
facilities
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from President Estrada, foreign
secretary in new 3rd-5th grafs

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Police stepped up security around the
U.S. Embassy and other American facilities in the Philippines on
Thursday to prevent retaliatory terrorist attacks after Washington
ordered missile strikes on Iraq.
	   ``All U.S. installations have been adequately secured even
before the attack but still, we will beef up security,'' said
national police chief Roberto Lastimoso.
	   President Joseph Estrada, who is on a state visit to Vietnam,
was quoted by the presidential palace as saying that the use of
force against Iraq was ``very unfortunate'' and expressed hope that
the crisis can be settled ``immediately to save the lives of
people.''
	   Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, who is traveling
with Estrada, said, ``We regret the use of force in Iraq.''
	   ``We have always believed that disputes should be settled
through peaceful means and through negotiations,'' he said. ``At
the same time we believe that all U.N. resolutions should be
complied with.''
	   Lastimoso said the action by the police was taken without a
request for additional security from U.S. embassy authorities.
	   He said local terrorists with links to Iraq are likely to attack
U.S. facilities after President Bill Clinton ordered air strikes on
targets suspected of concealing key elements of Iraq's biological
and chemical weapons program.
	   Lastimoso said local terrorists have attacked U.S. targets in
the country since the height of the Gulf War in 1991. During that
time, two Iraqi agents in Manila tried to bomb the Thomas Jefferson
Cultural Center in suburban Makati City, but the bomb they carried
exploded prematurely, killing one of them.
	   Security around the embassy has been raised since August,
following the bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya by
suspected followers of Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.
	   Aside from its embassy, the United States also maintains a large
residential seaside compound in Manila and a consulate in central
Cebu City.
	   Additional security will also be posted at the embassies of
Britain and Israel, Lastimoso said.
	   He did not say say if there was reason to believe the facilities
were in immediate danger.
	   He said the local Muslim extremist group, Abu Sayyaf, is
believed to be involved in bin Laden's network.
	   The group has also been linked to the convicted mastermind of
the World Trade Center bombing in New York in 1993, Ramzi Yousef,
who also allegedly plotted to kill Pope Paul II during the pope's
visit to Manila in January 1995.
	   The Philippine military and police are known to work closely
with U.S. intelligence agencies and share information.
	   Also Thursday, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, another Muslim
rebel group fighting the government, condemned the U.S, air
strikes.
	   Ghadzali Jaafar, a deputy chairman of the MILF, called Clinton a
``murderer of Islam.''

Israel cancels defense minister's visit to Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Israel's defense minister has called off a
visit to Greece due to the crisis in Iraq, the Israeli embassy said
Thursday.
	   The trip was canceled ``as a result of the critical situation in
the Middle East,'' an embassy announcement said.
	   Yitzhak Mordechai's visit was aimed at improving relations,
which soured in recent years after Israel signed a defense
cooperation agreement with Greece's traditional rival, Turkey.
	   Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, are at odds over a variety
of issues, including territorial air and sea space, mineral rights
in the Aegean and the divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus. They
have reached the brink of war three times in the last 11 years.
	   The Israeli defense minister was due to arrive Friday in the
northern city of Salonica, which was the center of a thriving Greek
Jewish community before the Holocaust. He was to travel to Athens
Sunday for meetings with government officials.
	   But there was speculation that the visit was in jeopardy even
before the strike against Iraq. The Israeli military was reluctant
to jeopardize its military ties with Turkey.
	   Concerned over the alliance, Greece has begun bolstering its
military ties with other countries in the region.
	   Greece's naval chief was in Egypt last week for a five-day
visit. The two countries also held a week-long joint naval exercise
as part of a defense pact signed earlier this year.

Ito, Li cruise into finals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Sprint stars Koji Ito of Japan and Li
Xuemei of China moved toward their third Asian Games gold medals
with strong performances in the 200-meter semifinals Thursday.
	   Ito outclassed his rivals, clocking 20.41 seconds to easily
qualify fastest, while Li was second in her semifinal behind Sri
Lanka's 400-meter gold medalist Damayanthi Darsha.
	   Li and Ito won their respective 100-meter finals and also
anchored their countries to gold medals in the 400-meter relays.
	   Li said she was still troubled by a fever and diarrhea.
	   ``My only aim today was to qualify, but I am confident I can
win,'' said Li, whose major rival, Sri Lanka's Susantika Jayasinghe
walked out before the 100 final, citing injury.
	   Veteran Indian P.T. Usha bowed out of her final Asian Games with
a disappointing fourth in her semifinal, too slow to qualify.
	   South Korea Lee Jin-il completed a long, hard road back to the
top when he defended the 800-meter title he won in the 1994 games.
	   Lee was banned for four years by the IAAF on a drugs charge but
the sentence was reduced to just under three years when the sports
governing body moved to two-year instead of four-year bans.
	   Lee had tested positive for anabolic agent Clenbuterol, which he
maintains he took in cough medicine.
	   ``It's been a very hard time for me,'' Lee said Thursday after
winning gold with a late surge. Lee clocked 1 minute, 46.56
seconds, nipping home on the inside of compatriot Kim Soon-hyung at
1:46.61.
	   ``Five meters before the finish I was sure of my gold medal
because of my speed,'' said Lee.
	   India's Jyotirmoy Sikdhar completed a middle distance double
with a commanding win in the women's 800 in 2:01.00.
	   ``There was a bit of tension of course,'' said Sikhdar, a
29-year-old enjoying the best form of her career. ``But I was quite
confident because I have good basic speed over the 400 meters.''
	   Her race marked a continuation of the poor showing by China's
runners, missing the team built by star coach Ma Junren.
	   ``I realized the Chinese went all out in the heats so I wasn't
worried about them,'' Sikdhar said.
	   India's Rosa Kutti took the bronze in 2:03.34.
	   Kazakstan's Natalya Torshina won the women's 400-meter hurdles
and reacted as if she had been only first in a heat, showing no
emotion after crossing the finish and walking straight off the
track. The Asian championship silver medalist clocked an impressive
time of 55.33, holding on down the straight after taking a huge
lead at the halfway point.
	   Taiwan's Hsu Pei-chin was second in 55.71 while China's Li
Yulian took bronze in 55.93.
	   Japan got gold and silver in the men's 400 hurdles as Hideaki
Kawamura fought back after being behind over the final barrier to
take gold in 49.59.
	   Yoshihiko Saito was second in 49.94. The pair celebrated by
sitting down next to the track together for five minutes after the
races.

Miners plan warning strike over pension changes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A warning strike in Poland's coal mines
will take place next week to protest proposed pension changes, a
union official said Thursday. An underground sit-in spread to 11
more mines overnight.
	   The two-hour warning strike Monday will allow miners to hold a
vote on a possible general strike to protest the new pension
proposal, said Henryk Nakonieczny, chairman of the Solidarity union
in the mining sector.
	   Nakonieczny refused to say when a general strike might be held.
It was unlikely that the traditionally conservative mineworkers
would plan a labor protest during the Christmas period, one of the
holiest holidays in predominantly Catholic Poland.
	   The sit-in that began a week ago has spread to 33 mines in the
Silesia region of southern Poland, with up to seven more expected
to join in till Friday morning, Nakonieczny said. At least 260
miners were involved, he said.
	   Parliament has approved changing retirement rules by setting age
limits of 65 for men and 60 for women. Under the current formula,
miners could retire with full pensions after 25 years of work, no
matter their age.
	   The measure also includes so-called ``bridge pensions'' that
cover the period from early retirement until the legal retirement
age for people working in harmful conditions, such as coal miners.
	   It still requires President Aleksander Kwasniewski's signature
to become law.
	   But unions representing miners insist on the current system
remaining unchanged. They also oppose a mining restructuring plan
adopted by the lower parliament chamber last month.
	   The restructuring plan would reduce production from 137 million
tons last year to 110 million tons in 2002. Wage increases would be
limited and the number of jobs would be cut by more than 40 percent
_ from 245,000 now to 138,000 in three years.
	   Restructuring loss-making industries such as mining, steel and
transportation is part of Poland's strategy to reform its economy
after decades of communist rule and prepare for membership in the
European Union.
	   Coal mining, once the country's leading hard-currency earner
during communist times, is still heavily subsidized under Poland's
market reforms that began in 1990.

American and British defense secretaries skip NATO meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Spanish, Polish quotes of support, TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
and his British counterpart skipped the NATO defense ministers
meeting Thursday in favor of staying at home and dealing with the
airstrikes on Iraq.
	   As the alliance's defense chiefs gathered for their two-day,
year-end meeting, the United States and Britain continued their
missile assault on Iraq, attacks that began early Thursday in
response to President Saddam Hussein's defiance of U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who was scheduled to be
at NATO headquarters on Friday for a meeting of the Russia-NATO
Permanent Joint Council, abruptly canceled his trip on orders from
President Boris Yeltsin, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``The German government has clearly said that we politically
support the approach of the United States,'' German Defense
Minister Rudolf Scharping said on arrival at NATO headquarters.
	   ``We think that Saddam Hussein has to comply fully with the U.N.
Security Council resolution. He didn't do that. That's why he is
fully responsible for the military actions, which are necessary.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana also blamed Saddam Hussein,
but in his statement did not mention the attacks. He said all
efforts by the United Nations over the past several months have
been unsuccessful.
	   ``He alone is responsible for the grave situation and for the
consequences that his defiance of the will of the international
community has entailed,'' Solana said.
	   Portuguese Defense Minister Jose Veiga Simao agreed.
	   ``I have full confidence in the judgment of our British and
American colleagues,'' Veiga Simao said.
	   Spain's Eduardo Serra Rexach said the bombing of Iraq was
``inevitable.''
	   ``Spain deeply deplores that use of force, but the Spanish
government has always chosen solidarity with the allies,'' he said.
	   Poland, which will become a member of NATO next year, also
expressed solidarity with the United States and Britain.
	   ``We deplore the fact that a peaceful solution was not
possible,'' said Polish Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz. ``As
for as American action is concerned, we fully understand the
reasons that led to this decision. We fully support this action.''
	   The attacks on Iraq are not directly related to NATO. The
ministers here were to take up questions such as rising violence in
Kosovo and the slow pace of peace efforts in Bosnia.
	   American-mediated negotiations in Kosovo, the poor southern
province of Serbia _ the dominant republic of Yugoslavia _ have
failed to bring Serbs and ethnic Albanians anywhere near an
agreement. More than three dozen deaths in the province this week
has taken ethnic tensions to new heights.
	   Those tensions were compounded by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's assertion that use of a special NATO extraction force
to pull civilian peace monitors out of Kosovo in emergency
conditions would be an act of aggression.
	   NATO has a 1,700-man rapid reaction force in place just across
the Kosovo border in Macedonia. It was created in the wake of U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke's Oct. 12 deal with Milosevic to end the
fighting between the government and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking
independence in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and as many as 300,000 forced
from their homes during fighting this year in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up about 90 percent of a population of 2 million.
	   A senior NATO military officer said Milosevic agreed during
talks to both the creation of the extraction force and to its
planned activities.
	   ``The situation in Kosovo is indeed becoming increasingly
worrying,'' said a senior NATO diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   In Bosnia, they other area where NATO is playing a direct
intervention role, implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace
agreement is going very slowly. That means ministers will not be
able to plan for any significant reduction in the 32,000-member
NATO-led force any time soon.
	   Sixty thousand troops entered the country in December 1995 on a
one-year mandate to enforce the peace agreement. That was later
extended by 18 months and the force reduced. Finally, the force was
given an open-ended mandate with reviews every six months.
	   The defense ministers also will be taking a close look at the
preparations of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for entry
into the alliance, expected sometime early next year as well as a
number of other issues that are expected to come up at the NATO
summit in Washington in April.

Germany's central bank holds last interest rate-setting meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's respected central bank, the
Bundesbank, held its last interest rate-setting meeting Thursday,
bringing to an end a highly successful chapter in the country's
postwar history.
	   From Jan. 1 the new European Central Bank will set interest
rates for the 11 European Union nations launching the single
currency, the euro.
	   No key rate cuts were expected from the meeting of the bank's
policy-making central council. Ten of the 11 countries launching
the euro set their key interest rate at 3 percent two weeks ago,
immediately after the last Bundesbank meeting.
	   The new rate will last through the launch of the euro.
	   Invited by the bank, Economics Minister Werner Mueller attended
the meeting. The Bundesbank is independent, and guards its
independence fiercely.
	   The Bundesbank was founded on Jan. 1, 1957, replacing the
immediate postwar Bank of German States.
	   It managed the new Deutsche Mark, Germany's postwar currency,
launched in 1948 when its cities were in rubble and its population
hungry.
	   Over the last 41 years, the Bundesbank has gained citizens'
respect _ affection, even _ steering the economy with a
``steady-hand'' policy. Germany flourished, and now has the biggest
economy in Europe.
	   The Bundesbank's central council will continue to meet after
Jan. 1 and to carry out refinancing operations for German credit
institutions, supervise commercial banks, issue bank notes _ coins
are controlled by the Finance Ministry _ and administer its
reserves, of which only a portion will be handed over to the ECB on
Jan. 1.
	   But with the key policy setting instrument of interest rates
gone, it will take on a much lower profile.

Britain's highest court nullified decision on Pinochet

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's highest court on Thursday set aside its
decision that Gen. Augusto Pinochet has no immunity from arrest and
ordered a new hearing because of a judge's ties with the human
rights group Amnesty International.
	   The unprecedented decision by the House of Lords means that a
panel of judges will re-hear next month the former Chilean
dictator's claim to immunity under British law.
	   It marks a setback in Spain's efforts to extradite the
83-year-old general to face charges of murder and torture.
	   Announcing the unanimous decision, Lord Justice Nicolas
Browne-Wilkinson, head of the Lords' tribunel that heard the
complaint, said the Amnesty-linked judge ``did not disclose his
links'' and thus should not have sat on the first panel.
	   ``I am satisfied that the earlier decision of this house cannot
stand and must be set aside,'' Browne-Wilkinson said.
	   He said detailed reasons for the decision would be given in the
New Year, but that it was ``essential that the parties should know
where they stand as soon as possible.''
	   Pinochet, who was arrested Oct. 16 while recovering from back
surgery, cannot leave the country and remains under police guard at
a rented mansion in Wentworth, 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of
London.
	   Citing the maxim that justice must not only be done but seen to
be done, Pinochet's lawyers complained during a two-day hearing
this week that Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann _ one of the majority
judges in the Lords' 3-2 ruling Nov. 25 against Pinochet _ is the
director of Amnesty's fundraising arm.
	   In addition, Hoffmann's wife, Gillian, has worked since 1977 at
the group's London headquarters.
	   ``These facts had not been disclosed to the parties,''
Browne-Wilkinson said.
	   Amnesty has been a prime mover in a campaign to have Pinochet
brought to trial for murder, torture and other gross human rights
abuses committed by his secret police during his 1973-90 rule after
he overthrew an elected Marxist.
	   Next month, the 83-year-old general was due to start fighting
the Spanish extradition warrant at a London magistrate's court. But
that move will likely be on hold because of the new Lords' hearing.
	   An official Chilean report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of his secret police.
	   The Spanish government's lawyers called the complaint about
Hoffmann a desperate attempt to free Pinochet after his lawyers
failed to persuade Home Secretary Jack Straw, the British Cabinet
member with the final say in extradition proceedings, that the
judge was biased.
	   Straw gave the go-ahead Dec. 9 for proceedings to start.
	   On Wednesday, lawyers for Amnesty told the judges _ none of whom
took part in the first hearing _ that neither Hoffmann nor his wife
played any role in the campaign to have Pinochet brought to trial.

Coach says cocky Thai boxer can't lose
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Soluck Kamsing, the first Thai boxer to
win an Olympic gold medal, may be a bit cocky, but he has the
punches to win Asian Games gold, his team manager said Thursday.
	   ``He likes to boast that he's eyeing the gold medal in Sydney,
and that the Asian Games will be an easy victory,'' said Thawatchai
Sajakul, manager of Thailand's team, referring to the 2000
Olympics. ``I agree with him.''
	   Boxing finals started Thursday, but Somluck's is not until
Friday, when he meets Uzbekistan's Tulkunbav Turgunov. If Somluck
wins, it would be his second Asian Games gold medal.
	   ``I can't see how he could lose, unless he injures himself in
the ring,'' said Thawatchai. ``It's beyond a doubt that he'll
win.''
	   Somluck scored a lopsided 16-2 victory over Japan's Norihisa
Tomimoto in Tuesday's semifinals.
	   Thawatchai said though some people may be turned off by
Somluck's mouth, ``he really knows how to carry himself in
public.''
	   When not boxing, Somluck has another way to stay in the public
eye.
	   Following his gold medal victory in the Atlanta Olympics,
Somluck immediately landed an acting job in a television soap opera
based on a historic fighter who led Thailand to victory against the
neighboring Burmese empire.
	   The local press said the embassy of Burma, now known as Myanmar,
protested that the show portrayed that nation's people in a
negative light and contained historical inaccuracies.

Austrian foreign minister regrets airstrikes, blames Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austrian's foreign minister said Thursday
he regretted the American- and British-led military attack on Iraq,
but placed the blame for the action entirely on Baghdad.
	   Speaking at a news conference, Wolfgang Schuessel, who leads the
European Union during Austria's turn at the EU's rotating
presidency, expressed his regrets for the overnight attack and
hoped the action would be ``limited in terms of time and aimed only
at military targets,'' the Austria Press Agency reported.
	   Schuessel criticized Saddam Huessein for failing to meet the
full demands of the United Nations over the past year and stressed
that UN sanctions against Iraq could not be lifted until the
country was ready to work together with international weapons
inspectors.
	   The strike, which started about 5:00 p.m. EST (2200 GMT), or 1
a.m. Wednesday Baghdad time, began with U.S. warships in the Gulf
launching hundreds of satellite-guided cruise missiles.
	   There were no immediate detailed accounts of damage Thursday,
and in Baghdad, children headed to school and government workers
went to offices as usual after the nightlong attacks. Downtown
streets were busy with traffic, but Saddam's whereabouts were
unknown.
	   Austria will hand over the EU presidency to Germany on Jan. 1,
1999.

President leads in Guinean elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ President Lansana Conte is far ahead of
his opponents in early elections results from the presidential
voting earlier this week, state radio said Thursday.
	   Conte, who first seized power in a 1984 coup, has won 3 of the
18 electoral districts already counted. There are 23 districts
still uncounted.
	   Further results are expected later Thursday.
	   The announcement came one day after police used teargas to
disperse a street protest in Conakry following state radio reports
of the arrests of two opposition leaders, Conte's main rival.
	   The arrest followed Monday's presidential elections in this
impoverished West African country, the second multi-party
presidential vote since independence from France in 1958.
	   While the voting passed largely peacefully, tension has been
growing in the capital since then, with opposition leaders making
vague threats of unrest if Conte wins the vote in the first round.
	   In a move that further heightened that tension, Alpha Conde,
leader of the opposition Rally of the Guinean People, was seized by
police while trying to illegally cross the border into neighboring
Ivory Coast with several unnamed associates, state radio reported.
	   Conde, one of two prominent opposition candidates, challenged
Conte in the 1993 elections and recently returned from a
self-imposed exile in Senegal.
	   Police also arrested another presidential candidate Marcel Cros,
leader of the smaller African Democratic Party of Guinea, in a
separate incident on Saturday for alleged illegal possession of
military weapons in his home, state radio said.
	   Several hundred people began marching through the streets of the
capital towards Conde's home before police cut short the protest by
firing teargas into the crowds, witnesses said.
	   Both detained men were believed to be in paramilitary quarters
in Conakry and opposition officials said on condition of anonymity
that as many as 15 other government opponents had also been seized.
	   Although election day was calm on Monday, six people were
believed killed in Conakry street clashes on Saturday after a
ruling party rally.
	   Conte seized power in 1984 after the death of Guinea's former
dictator, Sekou Toure.
	   Guinea, which has an average per capita income of just a few
hundred dollars a year and an illiteracy rate of up to 80 percent,
is still recovering from Toure's 26-year regime. Thousands of
people died in prison camps, and 2 million people fled the country.
	   While Conte has allowed greater political freedom, his critics
say he has become more autocratic since a military revolt in 1996
by soldiers angry over unpaid wages.

American and British defense secretaries skip NATO meeting

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
and his British counterpart skipped the NATO defense ministers
meeting Thursday in favor of staying at home and dealing with the
airstrikes on Iraq.
	   As the alliance's defense chiefs gathered for their two-day,
year-end meeting, the United States and Britain continued their
missile assault on Iraq, attacks that began early Thursday in
response to President Saddam Hussein's defiance of U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who was scheduled to be
at NATO headquarters on Friday for a meeting of the Russia-NATO
Permanent Joint Council, abruptly canceled his trip on orders from
President Boris Yeltsin, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``The German government has clearly said that we politically
support the approach of the United States,'' German Defense
Minister Rudolf Scharping said on arrival at NATO headquarters.
	   ``We think that Saddam Hussein has to comply fully with the U.N.
Security Council resolution. He didn't do that. That's why he is
fully responsible for the military actions, which are necessary.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana also blamed Saddam Hussein,
but in his statement did not mention the attacks. He said all
efforts by the United Nations over the past several months have
been unsuccessful.
	   ``He alone is responsible for the grave situation and for the
consequences that his defiance of the will of the international
community has entailed,'' Solana said.
	   Portuguese Defense Minister Jose Veiga Simao agreed.
	   ``I have full confidence in the judgment of our British and
American colleagues,'' Veiga Simao said.
	   Spain's Eduardo Serra Rexach said the bombing of Iraq was
``inevitable.''
	   ``Spain deeply deplores that use of force, but the Spanish
government has always chosen solidarity with the allies,'' he said.
	   Poland, which will become a member of NATO next year, also
expressed solidarity with the United States and Britain.
	   ``We deplore the fact that a peaceful solution was not
possible,'' said Polish Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz. ``As
for as American action is concerned, we fully understand the
reasons that led to this decision. We fully support this action.''
	   The attacks on Iraq are not directly related to NATO. The
ministers here were to take up questions such as rising violence in
Kosovo and the slow pace of peace efforts in Bosnia.
	   American-mediated negotiations in Kosovo, the poor southern
province of Serbia _ the dominant republic of Yugoslavia _ have
failed to bring Serbs and ethnic Albanians anywhere near an
agreement. More than three dozen deaths in the province this week
has taken ethnic tensions to new heights.
	   Those tensions were compounded by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's assertion that use of a special NATO extraction force
to pull civilian peace monitors out of Kosovo in emergency
conditions would be an act of aggression.
	   NATO has a 1,700-man rapid reaction force in place just across
the Kosovo border in Macedonia. It was created in the wake of U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke's Oct. 12 deal with Milosevic to end the
fighting between the government and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking
independence in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and as many as 300,000 forced
from their homes during fighting this year in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up about 90 percent of a population of 2 million.
	   A senior NATO military officer said Milosevic agreed during
talks to both the creation of the extraction force and to its
planned activities.
	   ``The situation in Kosovo is indeed becoming increasingly
worrying,'' said a senior NATO diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   In Bosnia, they other area where NATO is playing a direct
intervention role, implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace
agreement is going very slowly. That means ministers will not be
able to plan for any significant reduction in the 32,000-member
NATO-led force any time soon.
	   Sixty thousand troops entered the country in December 1995 on a
one-year mandate to enforce the peace agreement. That was later
extended by 18 months and the force reduced. Finally, the force was
given an open-ended mandate with reviews every six months.
	   The defense ministers also will be taking a close look at the
preparations of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for entry
into the alliance, expected sometime early next year as well as a
number of other issues that are expected to come up at the NATO
summit in Washington in April.

NATO-led force any time soon.
	   Sixty thousand troops entered the country in December 1995 on a
one-year mandate to enforce the peace agreement. That was later
extended by 18 months and the force reduced. Finally, the force was
given an open-ended mandate with reviews every six months.
	   The defense ministers also will be taking a close look at the
preparations of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for entry
into the alliance, expected sometime early next year as well as a
number of other issues that are expected to come up at the NATO
summit in Washington in April.

Asian stocks end mixed on worries over Iraq air-strike, possible
</HEADLINE>
Clinton impeachment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended mixed on Thursday
amid concerns over the U.S. and British military strike on Iraq and
U.S. President Bill Clinton's possible impeachment.
	   Most investors shrugged off the air strikes, which they believe
would have little impact on financial markets but worries about
Clinton's possible impeachment weighed slightly on the U.S. dollar.
	   In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose
30.69 points, or 0.22 percent, to close at 14,126.99.
	   The Nikkei fell below 14,000 points in early trading as the Iraq
air-strike raised fears of higher oil costs in Japan. But the index
rebounded as the Japanese yen strengthened against the dollar later
in the day.
	   The U.S. dollar _ considered a safe haven in times of
international unrest _ had surged beyond 117 yen immediately
following the military action, but slipped back in late trading.
	   In Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 116.10 yen in late trading,
up 0.48 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New
York level of 116.53 yen overnight.
	   Clinton said late Wednesday that he ordered a ``strong,
sustained series of air strikes'' against Iraq in response to
Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   With conflict expected to last only several days, dollar-buying
faded as attention shifted to the U.S. economy and Clinton's
possible impeachment.
	   ``With the impeachment still not out of the way, it's difficult
to conduct safe-haven dollar buying,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu of
Commerzbank in Tokyo.
	   In Hong Kong, news on Iraq was largely ignored as the blue-chip
Hang Seng Index rose 143.92 points, or 1.4 percent, at 10,083.31.
	   Shares were also boosted by a surge in the December Hang Seng
Index futures contract, which rose 2.6 percent.
	   ELSEWHERE:
	   BANGKOK: Shares dropped following news that the government could
sell only 10 percent of finance companies put on auction this week.
The SET Index fell 5.88 points, or 1.7 percent, to 338.65.
	   JAKARTA: Shares fell as investors cashed in on gains. The JSX
index was down 7.110 points, or 1.7 percent, at 405.584.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Shares fell, although buying into key heavyweight
stocks held back further losses. The Composite Index shed 0.21
points, or 0.03 percent, to 542.78 points.
	   MANILA: Shares rose as local investors bought into selected blue
chips. The PSE Index gained 9.06 points, or 0.5 percent, to close
at 1,878.30 points.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares rose despite earlier panic selling in reaction
to the Iraq air-strike. The STI climbed 7.09 points, or 0.52
percent, at 1,366.19.
	   SYDNEY: Shares rose as the Iraq air-strike prompted buying into
resource sector shares. The All Ordinaries Index rose 42.7 points,
or 1.6 percent, to 2,740.
	   SEOUL: Shares fell as a recent rally spurred by interest rate
cuts lost steam. The KOSPI shed 17.08 points, or 3.1 percent, at
528.89.
	   TAIPEI: Shares fell after some blue-chip companies said they
were slashing earnings forecasts. The Weighted Price Index was down
118.88 points, or 1.76 percent, to 6,650.64.
	   WELLINGTON _ Shares rose boosted by market heavyweight Telecom
Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. The index was up 41.17 points, or 2.1
percent, at 1,994.39.

Iraq attack could delay ratification of START II treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The U.S. and British attack on Iraq could derail
hopes that Russia's parliament will approve the long-delayed START
II nuclear reduction treaty, officials said Thursday.
	   Officials of President Boris Yeltsin's administration and the
parliament showed unusual unanimity in agreeing that the treaty to
cut U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals stands little hope of swift
approval.
	   The START II treaty would halve the Russian and American nuclear
arsenals to about 3,000 to 3,500 warheads each.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, head of the largest faction
in the Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, said there was no
point in discussing ratification. Instead, he said, Russia should
increase its defense budget.
	   Alexander Shokhin, head of the moderate Our Home is Russia
faction in the Duma, said it was unlikely the chamber would
consider ratification anytime soon.
	   ``We could raise the question of the treaty in January, but now
the prospects of its discussion are becoming increasingly
obscure,'' he said.
	   Russia's Communist-led parliament has repeatedly delayed action
on the START II treaty, signed by the United States and Russia in
1993. But there had been increasing hopes in recent months that the
treaty would be approve.

Austrian foreign minister regrets airstrikes, blames Saddam Hussein
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Schuessel blaming Hussein.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austrian's foreign minister said Thursday
he regretted the American- and British-led military attack on Iraq,
but placed the blame for the action entirely on Saddam Hussein.
	   Speaking at a news conference, Wolfgang Schuessel, who currently
leads the European Union, said the EU views the attack as a strike
against Hussein and not against the people of Iraq, the Austria
Press Agency reported.
	   Schuessel expressed his regrets for the overnight attack and
hoped the action would be ``limited in terms of time and aimed only
at military targets,'' APA said.
	   He criticized Saddam Hussein for failing to meet the full
demands of the United Nations over the past year and stressed that
UN sanctions against Iraq could not be lifted until the country was
ready to work together with international weapons inspectors.
	   The strike, which started about 5:00 p.m. EST (2200 GMT), or 1
a.m. Wednesday Baghdad time, began with U.S. warships in the Gulf
launching hundreds of satellite-guided cruise missiles.
	   There were no immediate detailed accounts of damage Thursday,
and in Baghdad, children headed to school and government workers
went to offices as usual after the nightlong attacks. Downtown
streets were busy with traffic, but Saddam's whereabouts were
unknown.
	   Austria hands over the EU presidency to Germany on Jan. 1, 1999.

Bookings reopen for controversial film under police security
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A film about lesbian love has been slightly
cut and will be back on the big screen in Bombay Friday under
police protection, two weeks after right-wing protesters attacked
theaters to halt showings.
	   The film ``Fire'' was referred back to the censors by the
federal government for review after screenings were disrupted in
Bombay and New Delhi. The government said screenings could continue
pending the censor's review, but cautious theater owners had until
now pulled ``Fire'' because of the controversy.
	   ``Bookings have opened for `Fire'. There is not a big crowd
today, but it will definitely pick up .... We already have police
guarding the theater,'' said Nakashe, manager of the sole Bombay
theater to screen the film.
	   ``We have cut the portion in which a Chinese man says ``bloody
Indian'', but the rest of the scenes are intact,'' said Balkrishna
Shroff, an owner of Sringar Films, the movie's distributor.
	   A conservative youth group had objected to that line, but most
of the protests have revolved around the film's sexual content.
	   ``We have not heard anything from the Censor Board .... Anyway
the film in its present form is being shown in other parts of
India,'' Shroff said.
	   ``Fire'' is the story of women in unhappy marriages to two
brothers living in New Delhi. The sisters-in-law, seeking comfort,
develops a lesbian relationship. Protesters say the film is an
affront to Hindu values.
	   Until the Shiv Sena protest, ``Fire'' showed for three weeks
with little comment in India, though sex is rarely discussed in
this traditional society and homosexuality is rarely even
acknowledged.
	   The last few weeks have seen demonstrations by supporters as
well as opponents of the film, prompting a debate about censorship
in Bombay.
	   Thursday's Bombay newspaper ads trumpeting the return of
``Fire'' asked: ``Do we as women have choices? And if we make
choices what is the price we pay for them?''

Hundreds of Egyptian students protest U.S. strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Some 3,000 angry university students poured
into the streets after hearing news of the U.S.-British military
strikes against Iraq Thursday.
	   The students, from Cairo University , shouted anti-American
slogans, police officials said.
	   ``With our souls and our blood, we sacrifice to you Iraq,''
shouted the students. They warned that their country will be the
next target of military strike.
	   ``Egypt, wake up. The next strike will be against you,'' they
shouted.
	   Two hours later, the the students dispersed peacefully, said the
police officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Security was tight around Egyptian universities Thursday morning
in a bid to prevent students from demonstrating outside campuses.

	   Only two days earlier, U.S. President Bill Clinton was cheered
during a visit to the West Bank and Gaza Strip that was widely seen
as implicit U.S. recognition of Palestinian claims to independence.
	   The U.S. attack on Iraq on Wednesday placed Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in a dilemma.
	   Arafat has been careful not to hurt his growing ties with the
United States, considered an important asset in the quest for
statehood. However, Arafat also could not afford to be seen as
going against the widespread support among his people for Iraq.
	   A senior Palestinian Authority official, Saeb Erekat, adopted a
carefully worded position of compromise. The United States should
halt its attacks and Iraq should comply with U.N. weapons
inspectors, Erekat said. In the 1991 Gulf War, Arafat had sided
with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator with Israel, said a war
in the Gulf will also cause further delays in the implementation of
the Wye River land-for-peace agreement Clinton helped negotiate.
	   In handling the public outpouring of support for Iraq, Arafat
permitted rallies and marches, but ordered his security forces to
disperse violent protests.
	   In the West Bank towns of Bethlehem and Hebron, Palestinian
police moved quickly to break up dozens of Palestinian teen-agers
who threw stones at Israeli troops. Only two days earlier, Clinton
had sung along with a Palestinian children's choir in Manger Square
in Bethlehem, the traditional birthplace of Jesus.
	   The largest pro-Iraq rally was held in the West Bank town of
Nablus where about 3,000 Palestinians took to the streets, chanting
``Death to America'' and ``Death to Clinton.
	   Protesters burned a dozen U.S. flags, including those that had
been distributed by the Palestinian Authority several days earlier
to cheer the arrival of Clinton in the Gaza Strip and Bethlehem.
	   ``Two days ago, Clinton was here and we thought he carried a
message of peace,'' said Majeda Masri, a teenage marcher. ``But now
it is clear that he is a murderer.''
	   The Nablus rally appeared spontaneous, starting out with about
200 high school students, with older people gradually joining in.
	   However, in other areas, the marches were orchestrated, with
pre-schoolers and elementary school students handed Iraqi flags by
their teachers and told what to chant.
	   In downtown Gaza City, about 300 elementary school students
assembled in Palestine Square. Some carried empty milk bottles and
others smeared fake blood on their clothes to dramatize the
suffering of the Iraqi people.
	   Most Palestinians strongly identify with the Iraqis as fellow
Arabs and fellow Muslims, though their support does not necessarily
extend to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   ``What Clinton has done is unfair,'' said Hussein Najib, who
sells bread from a cart in the West Bank town of Ramallah. ``The
only victims of such attacks are the Iraqi people.''
	   In the Gaza Strip, Iraqi flags quickly replaced U.S. banners
that had covered the streets earlier this week.
	   Safi Sayed, a Gaza City grocer who had done a brisk business
with U.S. flags was now selling Iraqi flags. Sayed said the Clinton
visit to Gaza had given him hope, but that he was now disappointed.
	   ``We are very sorry about this strike against our people in
Iraq,'' Sayed said.

Somali warlords travel to Libya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ A delegation including several
Mogadishu warlords led by Ali Mahdi Mohamed left for Libya Thursday
on short notice after receiving an invitation from Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi.
	   Ali Mahdi, who controls North Mogadishu, told reporters the
group would be joined in Tripoli by his counterpart in South
Mogadishu, Hussein Mohamed Aidid, who is currently in Cairo.
	   Ali Mahdi, who together with Aidid's late father, Gen. Mohamed
Farah Aidid, ousted longtime dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991,
plunging Somalia into a civil war that had not ended, said the
Libyan visit may pave the way for an oft-postponed national
reconciliation conference.
	   The Libyan meeting, which will also be attended by Col.
Abdullahi Yussuf Ahmed, president of the recently established
regional administration in northeastern Somalia known as Puntland,
comes a year after Ali Mahdi, Aidid and several dozen other
warlords and militia leaders agreed in Cairo to work for national
reconciliation and set up a single administration for the capital,
Mogadishu.
	   Col. Yussuf boycotted that Cairo meeting, claiming that Egypt
was not an honest broker in Somalia.
	   It is widely believed that the national reconciliation
conference has not taken place because of lack of funding, and
traditional donors _ mainly the European Union _ remain skeptical.
	   Although Ali Mahdi did not say so directly, Gadhafi, in his
quest to play a greater role in African affairs, may come up with
the funding.
	   ``Let's hope something positive will come out of the meeting,''
Ali Mahdi said.
	   Libya has been providing funds for the establishment of the
single administration in Mogadishu, including salaries for the
3,000-strong police force drawn from members of Ali Mahdi's and
Aidid's militia.
	   Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, president of the self-declared republic of
Somaliland in northwestern Somalia, was reportedly also invited to
Libya, but sources close to his office said he had declined.
	   Egal is closer to Ethiopia than are most of his Somali
counterparts.
	   Ethiopia and Egypt are traditional rivals for influence in
Somalia.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot squads fired warning shots and
tear gas when thousands of student demonstrators demanding
democratic reform tried to storm the Parliament on Thursday.
	   Many of the more than 3,000 protesters threw rocks and bottles
at troops who beat them back with clubs.
	   Some heavily bleeding students were carried to safety by their
friends through clouds of tear gas.
	   An official at the nearby Jakarta Hospital said 35 students were
injured. Most had been beaten or were overcome by gas.
	   The military said at least two soldiers were injured. Hundreds
of troops arrived at the Parliament as night fell and students lit
bonfires on a toll road.
	   Soldiers ordered reporters and news crews to leave the scene.
	   A police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
security forces wanted the students to disperse and would not
negotiate with them.
	   It was the second straight day that students have clashed with
security forces in the Indonesian capital.
	   Hours earlier President B.J. Habibie warned his country might
break up if anti-government protests escalated.
	   ``If the protests are not controlled it can lead to the
disintegration of the nation,'' Habibie said at a graduation
ceremony of new army officers.
	   Religious groups have called on students to end their protest
campaign during the forthcoming holy Islamic month of Ramadan,
which starts on Sunday.
	   Angry students pulled down and set fire to tents set up by the
troops near the legislature.
	   The students converged on the heavily guarded legislature in two
groups. Many of them carried sticks.
	   They marched to the Parliament demanding political reform and
the release of some activists arrested by police this week.
	   Outnumbered soldiers retreated briefly after the students tried
to run into the parliamentary grounds.
	   The protesters scattered when the troops responded with warning
shots and tear gas.
	   Also on Thursday, dozens of riot police and troops peacefully
blocked about 100 students about 100 meters (yards) in front of the
presidential palace.
	   On Wednesday police fired tear gas and swung batons to disperse
hundreds of rock-throwing protesters at the Defense Ministry, not
far from the palace.
	   On Nov. 13, security forces shot dead nine student protesters
when thousands tried to march on Parliament.
	   Habibie, who has promised democratic reform after decades of
authoritarian rule, said that freedom of expression that allows
protests is now guaranteed under Indonesian law.
	   ``But in carrying out these rights people must also respect
other people's rights,'' he said.
	   Indonesia, with 202 million people, is the world's fourth most
populous country. It has more than 300 ethnic groups spread over
about 17,000 islands.
	   For weeks, students have been holding street protests demanding
that Habibie force the military out of politics and put his
autocratic predecessor, ex-President Suharto, on trial for
corruption.
	   On Thursday about 200 Islamic and pro-Habibie supporters rallied
near Jakarta's National Monument and called on anti-government
students to end their protests.
	   Student protests and deadly riots last May also forced Suharto
to quit after 32 years in power. At that time students occupied the
parliament building for several days.
	   Habibie has promised to open up the tightly controlled political
system and to hold elections next year. But the students are not
satisfied and stage demonstrations almost daily in Jakarta and
other cities.
	   Anger at Habibie's seven-month old government has been sharpened
by a continuing economic crisis, which has resulted in soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and rising poverty.
	   Sporadic rioting and looting has hit some parts of the country.
There has also been violence among the Muslim majority and the
Christian minority with dozens of mosques and churches set afire or
ransacked.
	   On Wednesday mobs rioted and attacked Chinese-owned shops in
Samarinda on the island of Borneo.
	   At the same time hundreds of farmers clashed with plantation
workers during a protest over a land dispute near Medan on the
island of Sumatra.

Japan gets first Asian Games badminton gold in 28 years

 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kanako Yonekura converted her
giant-killing skills into Asian Games gold Thursday, outsmarting
China's Gong Zhichao to win Japan's first badminton title at the
games in 28 years.
	   Yonekura, ranked just 47th in the world, had downed Chinese
first seed Ye Zhaoying on her way to the final and came from behind
to beat Gong, the No. 2 seed, 1-11, 11-5, 11-6 in the match for the
singles crown.
	   ``I gave everything of myself,'' said the unseeded pony-tailed
22-year-old, who jumped up and down after her win and bowed
politely to her teammates in the stands.
	   China salvaged gold in men's singles, however, when the
fourth-seeded Dong Jiong downed Indonesia's Hendrawan, seeded
third, 17-14, 10-15, 15-8 for his first title of the year. China's
Sun Jun and Malaysia's Yong Hock-Kin, the defeated semifinalists,
shared bronze.
	   In mixed doubles, Kim Dong-moon and La Kyung-min, the
second-seeded pair, beat unseeded Lee Dong-soo and Yim Kyung-jin
15-6, 15-8 for gold in an all-South Korean final. China's Zhang Jun
and Qin Yiyuan and the first seeds, Trikus Haryanto and Minarti
Timur of Indonesia, got bronze.
	   China won the women's doubles gold, with Ge Fei and Gu Jun
defeating Indonesians Elysa Nathanael and Deyana Lomban 12-15,
15-9, 15-11. China's Qin Yiyuan and Tang Hetian, and South Korea's
La Kyung-min and Chung Jae-hee won bronze.
	   Yonekura's gold was Japan's first in Asian Games badminton since
1970, when the Chinese weren't competing, Japanese sports officials
said.
	   Yonekura had looked totally outclassed in the first game, and
the score had reached 10-0 in Gong's favor before she was able to
mark a point, earning her a congratulatory round of applause from
the packed crowd.
	   That game convinced Yonekura that she needed to force longer
rallies to give the quick-footed Gong room to make mistakes, she
said. The strategy appeared to work: having made just seven errors
in the first game, Gong made 18 in the second and a fatal 19 in the
third. Yonekura, in contrast, made just eight in that deciding last
game.
	   Yonekura also said that Gong, listed 4th in new world rankings
published Tuesday, appeared to be laboring under the strain of
being the favorite.
	   ``I was much more relaxed than the other girl because she was
under pressure to win for China,'' Yonekura said.
	   Lee Joo-Hyun of South Korea and Thailand's Sujitta
Eakmongkolpaisarn took bronze.
	   Yonekura was aided in her victory by killer drop shots to the
left and right of the court that got more accurate as the hour-long
match wore on. Gong, on the other hand, looked unable to figure a
way through Yonekura's defenses.

Turkey closes border with Iraq fearing a refugee influx
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Fearing an influx of refugees, Turkey on
Thursday closed down its border with Iraq following the air strikes
on Baghdad, a local official said.
	   ``We shut down the Habur border gate for security reasons,''
Mustafa Demir, governor in the border area, told the Anatolia news
agency.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds had fled to Turkey after
the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem implicitly confirmed that the border
had been closed. He said ``we are taking every necessary measure,
particularly not to experience the immigration problem again.''
	   But Shazad Saib, an Iraqi Kurdish spokesman of the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan, which controls part of the northern Iraq,
dismissed the possibility of a refugee influx.
	   ``Everything is calm in the region, there is no chaos, no
panic,'' Saib said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, with support from Britain, launched
the attack Wednesday night after Iraq again prevented U.N.
inspectors from hunting for weapons of mass destruction.
	   Commenting on the air strikes, Cem called on Baghdad to comply
with U.N. resolutions but added that ``our demand is to bring an
end to the suffering of the Iraqi people who pay the most heavy
price in the crisis.''
	   During the Gulf War, Turkey allowed the use of a southern
airbase for allied bombardments on Iraq, but it has been uneasy
over the loss of about dlrs 30 billion in trade with Iraq since
then.
	   Turkey also fears that a new war may lead to creation of an
independent Iraqi Kurdish state, which could boost the aspirations
of Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in Turkey.
	   ``Experiencing hot clashes just beside our borders and in a
region already under the threat of instability, is a development
that leads to anxiety,'' Cem said.
	   Cem said Washington has not asked Turkey for the right to use
the southern Incirlik airbase, which houses U.S. and British
warplanes that enforce a no-fly zone above the 36th parallel in
northern Iraq.
	   Senior Airman Adam Stump, at the base near the southern city of
Adana, confirmed that they did not participate in Wednesday's
attack.
	   ``We are not involved in the operation against Iraq,'' Stump
said. ``We continue to enforce the no-fly zone. We are performing
the same mission that we have in the past.''
	   Meanwhile, Cem said most of the personnel and families of the
Turkish embassy in Baghdad have been evacuated.

Coach says cocky Thai boxer can't lose
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Somluck, 1st graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Somluck Kamsing, the first Thai boxer
to win an Olympic gold medal, may be a bit cocky, but he has the
punches to win Asian Games gold, his team manager said Thursday.
	   ``He likes to boast that he's eyeing the gold medal in Sydney,
and that the Asian Games will be an easy victory,'' said Thawatchai
Sajakul, manager of Thailand's team, referring to the 2000
Olympics. ``I agree with him.''
	   Boxing finals started Thursday, but Somluck's is not until
Friday, when he meets Uzbekistan's Tulkunbav Turgunov. If Somluck
wins, it would be his second Asian Games gold medal.
	   ``I can't see how he could lose, unless he injures himself in
the ring,'' said Thawatchai. ``It's beyond a doubt that he'll
win.''
	   Somluck scored a lopsided 16-2 victory over Japan's Norihisa
Tomimoto in Tuesday's semifinals.
	   Thawatchai said though some people may be turned off by
Somluck's mouth, ``he really knows how to carry himself in
public.''
	   When not boxing, Somluck has another way to stay in the public
eye.
	   Following his gold medal victory in the Atlanta Olympics,
Somluck immediately landed an acting job in a television soap opera
based on a historic fighter who led Thailand to victory against the
neighboring Burmese empire.
	   The local press said the embassy of Burma, now known as Myanmar,
protested that the show portrayed that nation's people in a
negative light and contained historical inaccuracies.

Serb police arrest three Albanians in Kosovo killings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with state-run daily calling for withdrawal of

 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police were reported
Thursday to have arrested three Kosovo Albanians in the slayings of
six young Serbs whose deaths further inflamed tensions in the
province and prompted harassment against ethnic Albanians.
	   Police in Pec, where Monday's brutal barroom killings occurred,
sealed off a suburb of the western Kosovo city as well as the
nearby village of Glodjane and arrested three suspected accomplices
in the crime, the Serb-run Media Center said.
	   They were hunting for 11 other ethnic Albanians whom they said
organized and carried out the attack, the report said, citing a
police source. Police released the names of nine of those suspects
_ ethnic Albanian men between the ages of 18 and 29.
	   The political representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which is fighting to drive Serb police out of Kosovo and break the
province away from Serbia, has denied KLA involvement in Monday's
attack.
	   But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this week to arrest
the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   Serbian state-run media late Wednesday called the United States
``the biggest accomplice of the most monstrous crimes of the
Albanian terrorists.''
	   On Thursday, state-run Borba daily called, in a sharply worded
commentary, for the withdrawal of international Kosovo verifiers
and U.S. envoys for Kosovo, saying they ``are direct instigators
and helpers of the crimes committed by Albanian terrorists.''
	   ``Those people should go, and relieve us of their help. They
should return to their homes and defend them against terrorists,
separatists, and rapists.''

Thousands rally behind Chechen president and get-tough message
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Thousands of people rallied in central
Grozny today in support of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, who
has promised to clamp down on crime in the breakaway republic.
	   Maskhadov imposed a one-month state of emergency Tuesday to try
to end rampant crime and kidnappings in Chechnya. He called for
people to turn out at the rally Thursday to support his decision.
	   Hundreds of people have been taken hostage in Chechnya since the
end of a 1994-96 war with Russia. In an unusually gruesome display
of lawlessness, four Western captives were beheaded last week.
	   The hostages _ three Britons and a New Zealander _ had been in
Chechnya to install a cellular phone system. They were kidnapped
Oct. 3 and their heads were found after a rescue attempt apparently
went wrong.
	   Maskhadov blamed the leader of a prominent group of Chechen
Islamic militants for the attack and for many of the other
kidnappings that have hit the region.
	   The group, the Islamic Jamaats or Warriors of Islam, has denied
any connection with the killings, and threatened to launch attacks
on Russia if authorities clamp down on their operations, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said today.
	   In a statement made on Chechen television Wednesday night, group
leaders threatened to attack Russian sites outside Chechnya if
Maskhadov tries to fight them, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   The group does not want to fight within Chechnya because it
refuses to ``spill the blood of Moslem brothers'' or play into the
hands of Russia's secret services and enemies of Chechen
independence, ITAR-Tass said, citing remarks made during the
address.
	   The group is holed up in Chechnya's second largest city,
Urus-Martan. Fighters, led by warlord Arbi Barayev, have dug
trenches around the town and say they are ready for war.
	   Maskhadov won Chechnya's presidential elections almost two years
ago by an overwhelming margin, and still retains widespread support
among many Chechens despite his failure to restore stability in the
region.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Sprint stars Koji Ito of Japan and Li
Xuemei of China moved toward their third Asian Games gold medals
with strong performances in the 200-meter semifinals Thursday.
	   Ito outclassed his rivals, clocking 20.41 seconds to easily
qualify fastest, while Li was second in her semifinal behind Sri
Lanka's 400-meter gold medalist Damayanthi Darsha.
	   Li and Ito won their respective 100-meter finals and also
anchored their countries to gold medals in the 4x100-meter relays.
	   Li said she was still troubled by a fever and diarrhea.
	   ``My only aim today was to qualify, but I am confident I can
win,'' said Li, whose major rival, Sri Lanka's Susantika
Jayasinghe, walked out before the 100 final, citing injury.
	   Veteran Indian P.T. Usha bowed out of her final Asian Games with
a disappointing fourth in her semifinal, too slow to qualify.
	   Usha, 33, was sixth in the earlier 400 final but could not match
the pace of her rivals after missing a major part of her buildup
because of a hamstring injury.
	   South Korea Lee Jin-il completed a long, hard road back to the
top when he defended the 800-meter title he won in the 1994 games.
	   Lee was banned for four years by the IAAF on a drugs charge but
the sentence was reduced to just under three years when the sport's
governing body moved to two-year instead of four-year bans.
	   Lee had tested positive for anabolic agent Clenbuterol, which he
maintains he took in cough medicine.
	   ``It's been a very hard time for me,'' Lee said Thursday after
winning gold with a late surge. Lee clocked 1 minute, 46.56
seconds, nipping home on the inside of compatriot Kim Soon-hyung at
1:46.61.
	   ``Five meters before the finish I was sure of my gold medal
because of my speed,'' said Lee.
	   India's Jyotirmoy Sikdhar completed a middle distance double
with a commanding win in the women's 800 in 2:01.00.
	   ``There was a bit of tension of course,'' said Sikhdar, a
29-year-old enjoying the best form of her career. ``But I was quite
confident because I have good basic speed over the 400 meters.''
	   Her race marked a continuation of the poor showing by China's
runners, missing the team built by star coach Ma Junren.
	   ``I realized the Chinese went all out in the heats so I wasn't
worried about them,'' Sikdhar said. India's Rosa Kutty took the
silver in 2:03.34.
	   Kazakstan's Natalya Torshina won the women's 400-meter hurdles
and reacted as if she had been only first in a heat, showing no
emotion after crossing the finish and walking straight off the
track. The Asian championship silver medalist clocked an impressive
time of 55.33, holding on down the straight after taking a huge
lead at the halfway point.
	   Taiwan's Hsu Pei-chin was second in 55.71 while China's Li
Yulian took bronze in 55.93.
	   Japan got gold and silver in the men's 400 hurdles as Hideaki
Kawamura fought back after being behind over the final barrier to
win in 49.59.
	   Yoshihiko Saito was second in 49.94. The pair had a subdued
celebration, sitting down beside the track together for a
five-minute chat.
	   China won two events Thursday to level with Japan at 10-10 on
the gold table after 29 track and field events.
	   The victories came to Guan Yingnan in the women's long jump and
Li Shaojie in the men's discus.
	   Guan needed a last jump of 6.89 meters to overcome compatriot Yu
Yiqun at 6.77.
	   Li Shaojie was an easy winner of his event, throwing 64.58 to
beat Anil Kumar of India on 58.43 and China's Zhang Cunbiao on
57.28.

Canada's trade barriers coming down, but concerns remain

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Canada is moving towards free trade, but certain
areas still block developing countries, a trade report said
Thursday.
	   In its policy review of the country, the World Trade
Organization said Canada has a generally open economy although the
United States is by far its biggest trading partner, accounting for
83 per cent of exports and 76 per cent of imports.
	   ``Canada's new customs tariff, in effect since Jan. 1, 1998,
greatly simplified and rationalized its import regime,'' the report
says.
	   Nevertheless, it questioned the ``significant'' tariff
protection given Canadian producers of food products, textiles,
clothing and footwear which it said could well be keeping out
lower-priced competition from developing countries.
	   It also noted concern that Canada's elaborate system of
preferential trade partners discriminates against other countries.
	   The review said Canada's general openness and ``prudent''
economic policies have been important factors in the country's
``recent strong economic performance.''
	   ``Its multi-track approach to international trade and investment
relations has further opened up Canada's economy, and resulted in
greater competitiveness in many sectors of its economy,'' it said.
	   However, it said, Canada's trade relations continue to be
complicated by difficulties in balancing domestic pressures with
North American integration and across-the-board trade
liberalization.

Ministers from three oil exporters meet in Madrid

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Ministers from three top oil producers
began talks in the Spanish capital on Thursday to examine ways to
improve sagging oil prices.
	   Oil prices, buffeted by overproduction amid a global economic
crisis especially in the Asian financial markets, have hovered this
year around 12-year lows, causing pain among oil-dependent
economies of a number of countries.
	   The meeting started shortly after 12 p.m. (1100 gmt) at the
Mexican ambassador's residence in Madrid. Earlier in the morning,
the Mexican and the Saudis held bilateral talks prior to the
tripartite meeting with Venezuela.
	   ``None of the producers seek confrontation. Everybody is trying
to cooperate in his own way,'' Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi told
reporters before going into the talks. ``But to get optimum
cooperation you need continuos dialogue.''
	   After the meeting, Naimi was expected to fly to Norway, a
non-OPEC member, as part of the process of discussions. Norway has
already agreed to cut 100,000 barrels a day until the end of the
year.
	   The slide in oil prices has continued despite repeated attempts
earlier this year at production cuts to boost the price.
	   Saudi Arabia is the leading producer among the 11-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Venezuela is OPEC's
No. 3 exporter Venezuela while Mexico is not a member of the
organization.
	   Naimi, the energy ministers of Venezuela and Mexico, Erwin
Arrieta and Luis Tellez respectively, arrived in Madrid Wednesday.
	   A Gulf source close to the Saudis said the meeting was part of
an ongoing process of consultations and attempts to bring stability
to the market and to improve oil prices in different ways,
``including adherence'' to production levels.
	   ``All options are under discussion,'' he said, with one aim:
achieving a higher price,'' he said. ``This year is definitely an
exceptional year. The oil market has gone through difficult
times.''
	   But he cautioned that there should not be high or low
expectations from the meeting. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Earlier this week, crude oil prices rose slightly on hopes that
the three will find a way to curb output and boost prices.
	   The price of Brent crude stood this week at around dlrs 10 a
barrel.
	   A Gulf source said Thursday that the Saudis would like to see a
price target for Brent at between dlrs 15 and dlrs 20.
	   Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico have been responsible for two
rounds of output cuts this year, totaling about 3.2 million barrels
from world oil producers. Analysts say another 1.5 million barrels
must be taken off the market to begin having an effect on prices.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police were reported
Thursday to have arrested three Kosovo Albanians in the slayings of
six young Serbs whose deaths further inflamed tensions in the
province.
	   Police in Pec, where Monday's brutal barroom killings occurred,
sealed off a suburb of the western Kosovo city as well as the
nearby village of Glodjane and arrested three suspected accomplices
in the crime, the Serb-run Media Center said.
	   They were hunting for 11 other ethnic Albanians whom they said
organized and carried out the attack, the report said, citing a
police source. Police released the names of nine of those suspects
_ ethnic Albanian men between the ages of 18 and 29.
	   The political representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which is fighting to drive Serb police out of Kosovo and break the
province away from Serbia, has denied KLA involvement in Monday's
attack.
	   But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this week to arrest
the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   Serbian state-run media late Wednesday called the United States
``the biggest accomplice of the most monstrous crimes of the
Albanian terrorists.''
	   On Thursday, state-run Borba daily called, in a sharply worded
commentary, for the withdrawal of international Kosovo verifiers
and U.S. envoys for Kosovo, saying they ``are direct instigators
and helpers of the crimes committed by Albanian terrorists.''
	   ``Those people should go, and relieve us of their help. They
should return to their homes and defend them against terrorists,
separatists, and rapists.''

Malindi airport land allocated to private developers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Kenya Airport Authority has lost land
reserved for expansion of facilities in two popular tourists
destinations on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast to private developers,
news reports said Thursday.
	   Citing Minister Marsden Madoka, The East African Standard and
the Daily Nation said private developers had obtained at least 80
hectares reserved for the Malindi airport and the airstrip at
Ukunda.
	   Madoka, a minister of state in the office of the president, said
the placing of dwellings on the land so close to the runways
constitutes a security threat to aircraft taking off and landing.
	   Madoka told reporters in Malindi after a two-day tour of
aviation facilities at the coast that the KAA had approached the
Commissioner of Land to have the allocations revoked and the
allottees given alternative land.
	   The grabbing of government or public land by well-placed civil
servants and its subsequent resale to private interests is
commonplace in Kenya.

Iraq keeps American and British defense secretaries from NATO
</HEADLINE>
meeting &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
and his British counterpart skipped the NATO defense ministers
meeting today in favor of staying at home and dealing with the
bombing of Iraq.
	   As the alliance's defense chiefs gathered for their two-day,
year-end meeting, the United States and Britain continued their
missile assault on Iraq.
	   ``The German government has clearly said that we politically
support the approach of the United States,'' said German Defense
Minister Rudolf Scharping. ``We think that Saddam Hussein has to
comply fully with the U.N. Security Council resolution. He didn't
do that. That's why he is fully responsible for the military
actions, which are necessary.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana also blamed Saddam Hussein,
but in his statement did not mention the attacks.
	   Solana said all efforts by the United Nations over the past
several months have been unsuccessful.
	   ``He alone is responsible for the grave situation and for the
consequences that his defiance of the will of the international
community has entailed,'' Solana said.
	   During their meeting, ministers were to take up the thorny
questions of rising violence in Kosovo and the slow pace of peace
efforts in Bosnia.
	   American-mediated negotiations in Kosovo, the poor southern
province of Serbia _ the dominant republic of Yugoslavia _ have
failed to bring Serbs and ethnic Albanians anywhere near an
agreement. More than three dozen deaths in the province this week
have fueled fresh tensions.
	   Those tensions were compounded by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's assertion that use of a special NATO extraction force
to pull civilian peace monitors out of Kosovo in emergency
conditions would be an act of aggression.
	   NATO has a 1,700-man rapid reaction force in place just across
the Kosovo border in Macedonia. It was created in the wake of U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke's Oct. 12 deal with Milosevic to end the
fighting between the government and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking
independence in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and as many as 300,000 forced
from their homes during fighting this year in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up about 90 percent of a population of 2 million.
	   A senior NATO military officer said Milosevic agreed during
talks to both the creation of the extraction force and to its
planned activities.
	   ``The situation in Kosovo is indeed becoming increasingly
worrying,'' said a senior NATO diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Other senior NATO officials insisted that Milosevic himself
bears the primary responsibility for protecting the civilian peace
verifiers, who eventually may number 2,000.
	   In Bosnia, they other area where NATO is playing a direct
intervention role, implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace
agreement is going very slowly. That means ministers will not be
able to plan for any significant reduction in the 32,000-member
NATO-led force any time soon.
	   While there has been some success, the top civilian coordinator
in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, says the lingering ultranationalist
mentality that led to the 1992-1995 war is still there.
	   The Dayton accord chopped Bosnia up into a Serb Republic and a
Muslim-Croat Federation, each with their own government, and a
nominal central government linking them.
	   Sixty thousand troops entered the country in December 1995 on a
one-year mandate to enforce the peace agreement. That was later
extended by 18 months and the force reduced. Finally, the force was
given an open-ended mandate with reviews every six months.
	   Cohen also will be pushing Washington's proposal to create a
special center at NATO headquarters on weapons of mass destruction,
which the United States feels is one of the biggest threats of the
post-Cold War era.
	   Not all of the allies are enthusiastic. As one senior diplomat
put it, there is a certain skepticism about ``the degree of the
risk.''
	   The defense ministers also will be taking a close look at the
preparations of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for entry
into the alliance, expected sometime early next year as well as a
number of other issues that are expected to come up at the NATO
summit in Washington in April.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's respected central bank, the
Bundesbank, held its last interest rate-setting meeting Thursday,
bringing to an end a highly successful chapter in the country's
postwar history.
	   From Jan. 1 the new European Central Bank will set interest
rates for the 11 European Union nations launching the single
currency, the euro.
	   No key rate cuts were announced after the meeting of the bank's

the euro set their key interest rate at 3 percent two weeks ago,
immediately after the last Bundesbank meeting.

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ In a quick mood reversal, thousands of
Palestinians chanted ``Death to Clinton'' and burned U.S. flags
Thursday to protest U.S. airstrikes against Iraq.
	   Only two days earlier, U.S. President Bill Clinton was cheered
during a visit to the West Bank and Gaza Strip that was widely seen
as implicit U.S. recognition of Palestinian claims to independence.
	   The U.S. attack on Iraq placed Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
in a dilemma.
	   Arafat has been careful not to hurt his growing ties with the
United States, considered an important asset in the quest for
Palestinian statehood. However, Arafat also cannot afford to be
seen as going against the widespread support among his people for
Iraq.
	   A senior Palestinian Authority official, Saeb Erekat, adopted a
carefully worded position of compromise. The United States should
halt its attacks and Iraq should comply with U.N. weapons
inspectors, Erekat said. In the 1991 Gulf War, Arafat had sided
with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator with Israel, said a war
in the Gulf would also cause further delays in the implementation
of the Wye River land-for-peace agreement Clinton helped negotiate.
	   In handling the public outpouring of support for Iraq, Arafat
permitted rallies and marches, but ordered his security forces to
disperse violent protests.
	   In the West Bank towns of Bethlehem and Hebron, Palestinian
police moved quickly to break up dozens of Palestinian teen-agers
who threw stones at Israeli troops. Only two days earlier, Clinton
had sung along with a Palestinian children's choir in Manger Square
in Bethlehem, the traditional birthplace of Jesus.
	   The largest pro-Iraq rally was held in the West Bank town of
Nablus where about 3,000 Palestinians took to the streets, chanting
``Death to America'' and ``Death to Clinton.''
	   Protesters burned a dozen U.S. flags, including those that had
been distributed by the Palestinian Authority several days earlier
to cheer the arrival of Clinton in the Gaza Strip and Bethlehem.
	   ``Two days ago, Clinton was here and we thought he carried a
message of peace,'' said Majeda Masri, a teen-age marcher. ``But
now it is clear that he is a murderer.''
	   The Nablus rally appeared to be spontaneous, starting out with
about 200 high school students, with older people gradually joining
in.
	   However, in other areas, the marches were orchestrated, with
pre-schoolers and elementary school students handed Iraqi flags by
their teachers and told what to chant.
	   In downtown Gaza City, about 300 elementary school students
assembled in Palestine Square. Some carried empty milk bottles and
others smeared fake blood on their clothes to dramatize the
suffering of the Iraqi people.
	   Most Palestinians strongly identify with the Iraqis as fellow
Arabs and fellow Muslims, though their support does not necessarily
extend to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   ``What Clinton has done is unfair,'' said Hussein Najib, who
sells bread from a cart in the West Bank town of Ramallah. ``The
only victims of such attacks are the Iraqi people.''
	   In the Gaza Strip, Iraqi flags quickly replaced U.S. banners
that had covered the streets earlier this week.
	   Safi Sayed, a Gaza City grocer who had done a brisk business
with U.S. flags was now selling Iraqi flags. Sayed said the Clinton
visit to Gaza had given him hope, but he was now disappointed.
	   ``We are very sorry about this strike against our people in
Iraq,'' Sayed said.

Broadcasting group emerges as takeover bidder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ Media and broadcasting group NTL
emerged Thursday as the company planning to take over Newcastle
United.
	   NTL announced it had bought a 6 percent share in the club and
had reached agreement with Newcastle's main shareholder, Cameron
Hall Developments, to buy a further 51 percent if the broadcasting
company makes an offer.
	   NTL said such a decision depends on a ruling by the government's
Monopolies and Mergers Commission whether BSkyB's takeover bid for
Manchester United contravenes fair trading.
	   Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB satellite TV company has made a 623
million pound (dlrs 1 billion) bid for Manchester United but the
deal is on hold pending a ruling by the MMC.
	   When Newcastle plc announced last week that it was the target of
a takeover, newspaper speculation suggested the company involved
was the Sony electronics firm, with U.S. media group Time Warner
also reported to be interested.
	   The ownership of Newcastle has been in the headlines for the
wrong reasons during the past year.
	   Cameron Hall Developments is owned by Douglas Hall, a Newcastle
United director who resigned, along with co-director Freddie
Shepherd, after they were caught on tape making derogatory comments
about the women of Newcastle. They also mocked the club's fans and
called Magpies' top striker, England captain Alan Shearer, ``Mary
Poppins.''
	   Last week, Hall and Shepherd regained their places on the board
of directors and chairman Dennis Cassidy and directors John Josephs
and Tom Fenton resigned in protest.
	   The club's stockbrokers, BT Alex Brown, also resigned their
contract with the club because of the return of Hall and Shepherd.

Report: DaimlerChrysler considering linkup with Nissan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with company comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ DaimlerChrysler is considering taking
a stake in Japan's debt-laden Nissan Motor Co. and not in its
truck-making subsidiary as originally contemplated, a German news
magazine reported Thursday.
	   However, DaimlerChrysler Chairman Juergen Schrempp is hesitant
to do so at present, according to an advance copy of next week's
Der Spiegel.
	   ``We shouldn't take too much on board at one time,'' Schrempp
was quoted as saying. ``In three years' time we'll be measured by
whether we've made a success of DaimlerChrysler or not and less by
whether we've entered Asia.''
	   A DaimlerChrysler spokesman, Eckhard Zanger, said the company
has been in talks with Nissan and its subsidiary, Nissan Diesel,
for about a year now with a view to cooperation in the commercial
vehicle area. But he declined to comment further.
	   ``We have never commented on how the constellation of such a
cooperation would look, were it to work out,'' Zanger said.
	   Nissan too declined to comment, but said that in general, it is
``willing to consider business tie-ups to strengthen its
international competitiveness.''
	   Daimler-Benz and Nissan said in July they will jointly build a
light truck starting in 2002 as the first step toward a broader
alliance. Daimler also said then it was considering taking a stake
in Nissan Diesel.
	   Originally expected to decide by year's end, the board will miss
that deadline due to the workload surrounding the DaimlerChrysler
merger, Zanger said last week.
	   Spiegel added that Nissan is also discussing possible linkups
with France's Renault and Ford Motor Co.
	   Nissan is looking for an all-around partner and not just for a
company to take over its diesel trucks, reported Spiegel.

Canada's trade barriers coming down, but concerns remain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 1300 GMT, Dec. 17 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Canada is moving towards free trade, but certain
areas still block developing countries, a trade report said
Thursday.
	   In its policy review of the country, the World Trade
Organization said Canada has a generally open economy although the
United States is by far its biggest trading partner, accounting for
83 percent of exports and 76 percent of imports.
	   ``Canada's new customs tariff, in effect since Jan. 1, 1998,
greatly simplified and rationalized its import regime,'' the report
says.
	   Nevertheless, it questioned the ``significant'' tariff
protection given Canadian producers of food products, textiles,
clothing and footwear which it said could well be keeping out
lower-priced competition from developing countries.
	   It also noted concern that Canada's elaborate system of
preferential trade partners discriminates against other countries.
	   The review said Canada's general openness and ``prudent''
economic policies have been important factors in the country's
``recent strong economic performance.''
	   ``Its multi-track approach to international trade and investment
relations has further opened up Canada's economy, and resulted in
greater competitiveness in many sectors of its economy,'' it said.
	   However, it said, Canada's trade relations continue to be
complicated by difficulties in balancing domestic pressures with
North American integration and across-the-board trade
liberalization.

<TEXT>
	   GENOA, Italy (AP) _ Sampdoria of Genoa introduced David Platt as
its new coach Thursday, making the former England captain the
youngest bench boss in Serie A.
	   Platt, 32, replaces fired coach Luciano Spalletti and inherits a
reeling club just one spot out of the relegation zone with little
more than half the season remaining.
	   As a player, Platt was part of Sampdoria's last triumph, the
1994 Italian Cup. He retired in July after helping Arsenal to a
rare Premiership and FA Cup double.

	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The Arab League condemned the
U.S. military strikes on Iraq Thursday, and a Gulf official said
that Baghdad had reached out for Arab support to stop the attacks.
	   In Kuwait, where memories of Iraq's 1990 invasion remain fresh,
some families opted for caution and began heading for Saudi Arabia.
	   Many Kuwaitis normally head out for the weekend, but a Saudi
official near the border reported a four-fold increase Thursday in
the number of Kuwaitis trying to drive across. He spoke on
customary condition of anonymity and refused to give figures.
	   The Okaz newspaper in Saudi Arabia interviewed a number of
Kuwaitis on the border. They said they were heading out for fear of
possible Iraqi chemical weapons attacks.
	   The U.S. State Department ordered the departure of some of its
embassy personnel and their families from Kuwait. It urged 8,000
U.S. citizens who live there to ``take this information into
account in considering whether they should also depart the
country.''
	   Scattered protests erupted Thursday.
	   In Cairo, Egypt, 3,000 university students poured into the
streets after hearing news of the military strike. The students,
from Cairo University, shouted anti-American slogans, police said.
	   Nearly 250 students at American University of Beirut staged a
sit-in and urged students to boycott classes.
	   Most Saudis asked about the strikes said they were against them.
	   ``Why don't they (the Americans) strike Israel, which
continuously flouts international law. Why is it always Muslim
countries, like Sudan, Afghanistan and Iraq that are attacked?''
said Abdullah al-Daylmi, a religion professor in Riyadh.
	   Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid told an Arab
radio station that the strikes were ``an aggression against an Arab
country'' and will not ``solve the problems between Iraq and the
United Nations but will complicate them more.''
	   Iraq called several Arab states, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia,
and the Emirates, asking for help to stop the attacks, said an
official from a Gulf country, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   In Lebanon, the As-Safir daily lamented that a fellow Arab
country was under attack once more.
	   ``Once again, it is our flesh that is being eaten, and it is our
blood that is being shed. And, let the perpetrators and benefactors
(of the air strike) both go to hell,'' it said.

China says it was offered money to throw Asian Games medals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report that table tennis player was approached,
6th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chinese athletes were offered bribes to
lose in gold medal matches at the Asian Games, a senior Chinese
sports official said Thursday.
	   Li Furong, deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation, said
more than one person offered bribes to Chinese athletes and that
the athletes refused, saying they wouldn't throw a medal even for
U.S. dlrs 100,000.
	   ``Some people tried to use money to buy gold medals,'' Li said
in a telephone interview. ``It wasn't just once.''
	   ``Of course, the athletes refused,'' he added.
	   Li refused to give details about the bribes or say what
countries, sports or people were involved. He first mentioned the
bribes at a news conference for Chinese reporters, and said in the
interview that he brought the issue to light to show that Chinese
athletes were clean, not to shame others.
	   Later, China's official Xinhua news agency quoted Wei Jizhong,
chairman of the Olympic Council of Asia Sports Committee, as saying
a table tennis player was approached.
	   OCA president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah told The Associated Press
that he has asked the Chinese to provide the names of people who
allegedly offered bribes.
	   ``This is a very serious matter, if true,'' Al-Sabah said.
``Right now it is only a rumor and to nail this rumor we have asked
the Chinese to give us the names of people and countries who made
the offer.
	   ``We are studying the whole matter very carefully and if and
when we get the names, we will order a full-fledged investigation.
But we have to wait until the Chinese give us the names,'' he said.
	   Earlier, Li, the deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation
said that in refusing the bribes, Chinese athletes declared, ``If
you give me 100,000 American dollars I won't do it.''
	   ``Some athletes also said I'm not here for money but for the
glory of the country,'' Li added.
	   Asked how he felt about his athletes' response, Li said, ``Of
course I'm happy.''
	   At a news conference later on other subjects, Sports Committee
Chairman Wei said in reply to a question: ``An agent who speaks
Chinese tried to bribe the player with a certain amount of U.S.
dollars. The Chinese refused clearly the offer, saying he or she
competes under the spirit and the Bangkok Asian Games motto.
	   ``The Chinese athlete reported to chef de mission about this.
The chief immediately asked him or her to remember the face of the
agent in order to catch him.
	   ``Unfortunately they failed to do it, the agent disappeared
after the refusal by the Chinese player,'' Wei added.

Tax forms show no record of questioned scholarship fund
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, ADDS reference to KUER radio &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CARTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Tax forms filed by Salt Lake's Olympic
organizers do not include entries for the scholarship program that
sparked charges of widespread corruption in the Olympic movement.
	   Salt Lake Organizing Committee officials have said dlrs 400,000
in scholarships were paid to 13 students, including six relatives
of International Olympic Committee members. The fund was run by the
Salt Lake Olympic Bid Committee, the group that secured the 2002
Winter Olympics.
	   The documents _ Form 990s that nonprofit public charities must
file with the Internal Revenue Service _ obtained by KUER radio,
provide the only peek into the financing of Salt Lake's Olympic
pursuit because the dlrs 13 million spent on the bid was private
money.
	   In each fiscal year between 1991 to 1997, the question, ``Does
the organization make grants for scholarships, fellowships, student
loans, etc.,'' is answered ``No,'' and lines used to report grants
or assistance to individuals are left blank.
	   Between fiscal years 1992 and 1994, the bid committee reported
expenses for a National Olympic Committee program. SLOC officials
have said the scholarship program went through the NOCs.
	   ``It certainly has raised a question and we're looking at the
issue,'' said Kelly Flint, SLOC's senior vice president for legal
affairs and commerce. ``We've referred it to our special tax
counsel to look at it.''
	   Other dealings between Salt Lake's Olympic organizers and IOC
members continue to pile up.
	   On Wednesday, Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini said through
a spokesman that the son of an IOC member was given an internship
in city government sometime in the mayor's first term, between 1992
and 1996.
	   ``He worked here for six months,'' said Corradini's spokesman,
Ken Connaughton. ``It was not (the mayor's) initiative.''
	   Connaughton said the mayor believed the intern worked for the
city's director of management services.
	   Connaughton also said the mayor had a vague recollection of a
briefing on a National Olympic Committee assistance program when
she joined the Salt Lake Olympic Bid Committee shortly after taking
office in 1991.
	   Meantime, Tom Welch, who spearheaded Salt Lake's Olympic bid,
agreed Wednesday to help in an investigation of bribery allegations
and encouraged SLOC to ``deal with this in a prompt and open way.''
	   Nolan Karras, who represents Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt on the
organizing committee, said that, to ensure public confidence, SLOC
president, Frank Joklik, and senior vice president, Dave Johnson,
must not be involved in SLOC's inquiry. Both men were high-ranking
members of the bid committee.
	   ``If we're going to recover from this, there can't even be the
appearance that Frank or Dave are controlling this,'' Karras said.
	   Joklik has maintained the scholarship fund was used for
humanitarian purposes and claimed little knowledge of its
operation, but apologized last week for the embarrassment it has
caused.
	   Johnson has refused to talk to reporters. He and Welch
controlled the fund and headed the bid's IOC lobbying.
	   Welch resigned under pressure two years ago amid allegations of
spouse abuse. He remains on SLOC retainer as a dlrs 10,000-a-month
consultant.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press two weeks ago, Welch
said scholarship funds like Salt Lake's were common.
	   During a meeting Friday, the SLOC board of trustees will set the
parameters of an independent investigation by a five-member ethics
committee made up of two university professors, a former Olympic
athlete, a former U.S. Attorney and a retired chief justice of the
Utah Supreme Court.
	   One of the first orders of business, said board member Randy
Dryer, will be to establish what role Joklik should play in
establishing the committee's responsibilities. Karras believes
Joklik should remove himself from the process and let SLOC chairman
Robert Garff run the show.
	   While few SLOC members were speaking openly about the fallout
from the scandal, several privately questioned whether Johnson's
intimate involvement for more than a decade in Utah's pursuit of
the Olympics can survive the ethics panel's scrutiny.
	   In 1988, Johnson's involvement in the now-defunct Utah Sports
Foundation triggered a formal investigation by the Utah Legislature
and the state attorney general into allegations of double-billing.
He was exonerated.
	   Karras hopes Joklik and Johnson will survive in their posts. But
he added it's clear someone on the bid committee ``crossed the
line. Just how far is yet to be seen,'' he said. ``But I'm
indignant about it.
	   ``Do I worry about losing Frank or Dave? Yes,'' he said. ``It
would be a travesty to lose either of them. But if it ends up that
peoples' hands are so dirty they can't stay, then we'll have to
deal with it.''

Bank and insurer call off merger talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch bank Rabobank NV and insurer
Achmea Holding NV said Thursday they have ended merger talks after
failing to agree on how to integrate their assets management and
pension activities.
	   ``Achmea didn't want to make any arrangements to, after the
formation of the group, come to a common policy for these
activities,'' Rabobank said in a press release announcing the
breakdown of negotiations.
	   Rabobank and Achmea signed a letter of intent in July in which
both agreed to search for ways to start a merged company in a
cooperative structure within three years.
	   The institutions planned to create one group offering a broad
range of financial services ranging from banking and insurance to
asset management.
	   Following the announcement of the breakdown of talks, Rabobank,
a cooperative institute which isn't listed on the stock exchange,
said it would continue to implement its all-finance strategy and,
where possible, do this with other parties.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea, paced by the top three
from the men's and women's individual events, completed a sweep of
all the Asian Games archery gold medals Thursday by taking the team
events.
	   The women topped China in the final, while the men beat Taiwan.
	   Women's gold and silver medalists Kim Jo-sun and Lee Eun-kyung
combined with Lee Mi-jeong to beat China in the final shoot-out,
242-238.
	   Lee Mi-jeong actually finished third in the individual contest
but under rules that one country is not allowed to sweep the
medals, the bronze went to China's Lin Sang.
	   Lin combined with He Ying an Wang Xiaozhu for the silver in the
team event.
	   Kazakstan won the bronze medal.
	   In the men's event, China topped Taiwan 246-238.
	   Han Seung-hoon, Oh Kyo-moon and Kim Kyung-ho comprised the
winning team. Han and Kim won medals in the individual events. Oh,
the 1997 Asian champion, was third in the individual but had to
give up the medal to Japan's Wataru Haraguchi, again due to the the
rule preventing a team from taking all the medals in one event.
	   China took the men's team bronze.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Dozens of students staged a second hunger
strike Thursday, hours after police broke up their initial protest.
	   Early Thursday, Albanian authorities ordered police to force a
group of students to end a week-long hunger strike after one of the
participants was diagnosed with hepatitis C, officials said.
	   At 4:00 a.m. local time (0300GMT), police forced about 40
students from Tirana and Skodra universities to end their protest,
demanding better learning conditions and higher scholarships.
	   ``The only reason that the police got the order to do that was
the diagnosis of the hepatitis virus in a student. It could be
transmitted to the other hunger strikers'' said a spokeswoman for
the interior ministry.
	   But up to 30 students returned later in the day to continue the
strike in a disco in the Tirana dormitory complex. Police had
blocked off the entrance to the disco and were not permitting
anyone to enter.
	   Despite a recent government pledge to invest about dlrs 70,000
towards improving the conditions in the dormitories, known
informally as Student City, the students refuse to stop their
protest.
	   According to the Information Ministry, the 20-year-old son of
Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha is believed to be a key member
behind the group organizing the protests.
	   On Thursday, the Democratic leader gathered hundreds of
supporters in the capital's central Skenderbeg square, calling for
support of the students and their demands.
	   ``Now I am determined more than ever to defend the Albanian
ideal and the ideals of democracy,'' he told supporters at a rally.
From the rally, Berish a led the group to the dormitory complex,
where they shouted support for the students.
	   Student boycotts and hunger strikes have played an important
political role in Albania in recent years. In 1991, student
protesters were instrumental in forcing Albania's last communist
leader to call multi-party elections, and the spread of organized
student protests significantly increased pressure on the
government.
	   A hunger strike by students in the southern town of Vlora
preceded the failure of the government of Sali Berisha, who was
president of the country from 1992 to 1997. His government lost
power after pyramid schemes collapsed, creating anarchy and chaos.

German high court bans use of lie detectors in trials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's highest criminal court ruled
Thursday that lie detectors were too unreliable to be used in
German trials by defendants or prosecutors.
	   The Federal Court of Justice ruled in a case involving two men
convicted of sexually abusing children. They had sought to use
polygraph tests in their trial to prove their innocence.
	   The lower courts, however, refused to admit the lie detector
results as evidence.
	   The Federal Court of Justice upheld those rulings, saying the
polygraph test was not yet advanced enough to prove guilt or
innocence.
	   The court had already declared polygraph tests to be unreliable
in 1954 and banned prosecutors from using them by saying they would
violate the rights of the defendant.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Ministers from three top oil producers
began talks in the Spanish capital Thursday to examine ways to
boost sagging oil prices.
	   Oil prices, buffeted by overproduction amid a global economic
crisis especially in the Asian financial markets, have hovered this
year around 12-year lows, causing pain among oil-dependent
economies of a number of countries.
	   The meeting started shortly after 12 p.m. (1100 GMT) at the
Mexican ambassador's residence in Madrid. Earlier in the morning,
Mexican and Saudi representatives held bilateral talks prior to the
three-way meeting with Venezuela.
	   Saudi Arabia is the leading producer among the 11-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Venezuela is OPEC's
No. 3 exporter, while Mexico is not a member of the organization.
	   ``None of the producers seek confrontation. Everybody is trying
to cooperate in his own way,'' Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi told
reporters before going into the meeting. ``But to get optimum
cooperation you need continuous dialogue.''
	   Also taking part in the meeting were Venezuela's Energy Minister
Erwin Arrieta and his Mexican counterpaaart Luis Telez.
	   After the meeting, Naimi was expected to fly to Norway, a
non-OPEC member, as part of the process of consultations. Norway
has already agreed to cut its production by 100,000 barrels a day
until the end of the year.
	   The slide in oil prices has continued despite repeated attempts
earlier this year to agree on production cuts to boost prices.
	   A Gulf source close to the Saudis said the meeting was part of
an ongoing process of consultations aimed at stabilizing the market
and boosting oil prices in different ways, ``including adherence''
to production levels.
	   ``All options are under discussion,'' the source said, speaking
on condition of anonymity. ``This year is definitely an exceptional
year. The oil market has gone through difficult times.''
	   But he cautioned that there should not be high or low
expectations for the meeting.
	   Earlier this week, crude oil prices rose slightly on hopes that
the three countries will find a way to curb output and boost
prices.
	   The price of Brent crude stood this week at around dlrs 10 a
barrel.
	   A Gulf source said Thursday that the Saudis would like to see a
price target for Brent at between dlrs 15 and dlrs 20.
	   Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico have been responsible for two
rounds of output cuts this year, totaling about 3.2 million barrels
from world oil producers. Analysts say another 1.5 million barrels
must be taken off the market to begin having an effect on prices.

Ethiopian shelling kills three along disputed border in Eritrea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JULIA STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Three people were killed and at least 24
wounded when Ethiopian shells hit the Eritrean town of Tsorona
along the two countries' disputed common border, witnesses said
Thursday.
	   The shelling occurred Monday at the border town, about 85
kilometers (55 miles) south of Asmara, according to victims in
hospital in Asmara.
	   There was no immediate indication that Eritrea returned fire.
	   The attack threatened to raise tensions between Eritrea and
Ethiopia as a two-day summit of African leaders met Thursday in
Burkina Faso to discuss resolution of conflicts on the continent,
including the six-month standoff between Ethiopia and Eritrea over
control of border areas.
	   Troops massed on both sides of the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile)
border have exchanged artillery sporadically since two weeks of
heavy fighting in late May and early June killed hundreds of
civilians at the start of the conflict.
	   Staff at Halibet Hospital in Asmara said 12 of the 24 wounded
Monday in Tsorona were being treated there, including eight
Eritrean soldiers and four civilians.
	   Another 12 civilians were being treated at the Dekemhare
Hospital outside Asmara, and other wounded were reportedly taken to
a third medical facility. Their number could not be ascertained.
	   Two of the wounded said they were tending their vegetable
gardens when they were hit by artillery shrapnel.
	   Mebrahtu Woldemeheret, a 76 year-old farmer who had a cast on
his arm, said two small children and a villager died on the spot.
	   He said farmers have remained in the border town and try to hide
when shelling occurs.
	   Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki and Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi were to participate Thursday in the Organization of
African Unity gathering in Ouagadougou.
	   On the agenda was an 11-point proposal to resolve the conflict
presented at the last meeting. Ethiopia accepted it, but Eritrea
has rejected the plan over its call for Eritrean troops to withdraw
from disputed territory they occupied in early May.
	   Both countries have released statements prior to the summit
laying down their positions and blaming the other for a failure to
end the hostilities.

Red Cross tells governments to spare civilians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The International Committee of the Red Cross
Thursday sent a diplomatic note to the U.S., British and Iraqi
governments asking them to do everything possible to ensure
civilians and medical facilities are unaffected by military action.
	   Following airstrikes by the United States and Britain against
Iraq, the organization said it is concerned that those affected be
treated properly under international law.
	   ``Under this body of law, those conducting the hostilities must
take all necessary precautions in particular to spare civilians and
civilian objects, to treat captured persons humanely, to ensure
that the wounded and sick have access to medical care, to protect
medical facilities, staff and transport and to respect the Red
Cross and its emblem,'' an ICRC statement said.
	   In Baghdad Thursday, an ICRC team is gathering information at
hospitals and with government ministries in order to help the
victims, it added.
	   The ICRC, which helps provide clean water and deliver emergency
medical supplies, has 10 foreign staff members in the Iraqi capital
and eight in the north of the country.

Yeltsin condemns strikes on Iraq

 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain on Thursday for attacking Iraq and demanded an
immediate end to the bombing, warning it could shatter hopes of
peace in the Middle East.
	   ``Russia demands an immediate end to military action, to show
common sense and restraint and not to allow further escalation of
the conflict which could result in the most dramatic consequences
not only for the Iraqi settlement but for the stability of the
entire region,'' Yeltsin said in a statement.
	   The United States and Britain launched air and missile attacks
against Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Russian television channels showed Yeltsin looking at maps of
the Middle East and talking with several generals and senior aides.
The president spent most of Wednesday night monitoring the
situation, aides said.
	   Russia has consistently opposed military action against Iraq, an
old ally of the Soviet Union, and attempted to find a political
solution to the dispute. But Moscow is no longer a global
superpower and is able to do little more than protest U.S. actions,
goading Russian frustration.
	   Yeltsin discussed the situation in a phone call with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin. The two leaders agreed that the attack was
``unacceptable, unilateral and contradicting the U.N. charter and
the principles of international law,'' the Kremlin press service
said.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov also sharply denounced
the United States and Britain and said Russia would work in the
United Nations to end the attacks.
	   ``This time the activities of the U.S. and Great Britain have
not been provoked by Iraq. The US administration has the strikes on
its conscience,'' said Primakov, who has had close ties with Iraq
for many years.
	   Parliamentary leaders also denounced the attacks, with Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov saying, ``This is international banditry
that must be sharply denounced.''
	   The Russian president said only a political and diplomatic
solution would solve the impasse over Iraq and he condemned the
joint U.S.-British attack as unprovoked.
	   ``The settlement of the Iraq problem is possible only through
political and diplomatic means on the basis of preserving the
resolutions of the security council of the United Nations and
international law,'' he said.
	   The Yeltsin statement was highly critical of Washington and
London, underlining how relations have declined in the past year or
two.
	   ``The fact that the states which performed this forceful action
did not find it possible to continue the search for settling the
crisis through political means causes indignation,'' the statement
added.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Unemployment edged up to 5.5 percent for the
three months ended Nov. 30, the highest level since the government
began keeping records in 1981.
	   The Census and Statistics Department said 191,000 people were
out of work in the September-November period, compared with 188,700
in August-October, or 5.2 percent of the workforce.
	   Joseph Wong, the secretary for education and manpower, warned
that unemployment will rise further as the recession-mired economy
continues to shrink. The economy shrank by 7 percent in the third
quarter and is expected to contract by 5 percent for all of 1998.
	   Economists predict the economy will not rebound until the second
half of next year.
	   ``Hong Kong is undergoing a major economic adjustment brought on
largely by repercussions of the regional financial turmoil,'' Wong
said.
	   ``Unemployment will remain on the high side for some time as a
result of corporate downsizing and layoffs during this process.''
	   Unionists warn more people would be thrown out of work ahead of
the Chinese New Year in February, when most companies review their
operations and lay off unneeded staff after giving them a year-end
bonus and a traditional thank you for the year's service.
	   Many companies, including some of Hong Kong's largest employers,
have announced pay cuts of up to 20 percent and salary freezes to
cut costs.
	   Tang Kwong-yiu, the government economist, said at a news
conference the latest figures reflected higher unemployment in
decoration and maintenance, manufacturing, business services and
import and export sectors.
	   There were also substantial layoffs in the construction sector
as many private property projects have slowed down.
	   The territory's property values have fallen by as much as 50
percent since their peak last year. Property prices have rebounded
slightly in recent weeks as stock prices and interest rates
stabilize.
	   Although Hong Kong's unemployment is low compared with some
countries, people in the territory had been used to years of
healthy economic growth.
	   The government said earlier it is facing a 13 billion Hong Kong
dollar (U.S. dlrs 1.67 billion) welfare bill this year, a fivefold
increase in as many years.
	   Hoping to keep a lid on rising welfare costs, the government
recently announced controversial proposals to cut welfare payments
by up to 20 percent and encourage recipients to perform volunteer
work as a condition of receiving assistance.

Handled properly, IOC can emerge strongly from scandal: Sydney
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; EDs: adds material at end of story on voting procedure likely to

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ With the International Olympic
Committee embroiled in a corruption scandal and a world summit in
February set to discuss sports doping, Sydney 2000 organizers
denied Thursday they had been handed a poisoned chalice.
	   The three senior officers of the Sydney Organizing Committee for
the Olympic Games (SOCOG) said that if the twin scandals of
corruption in the host city bidding process and drugs in sport were
handled correctly, the Olympic movement could emerge stronger by
the time of the Sydney games.
	   ``There is every intention (that the) IOC is moving swiftly in
relation to this matter, so it is not going to be a running sore,
it will not linger,'' said Sandy Hollway, SOCOG chief executive.
	   ``It is highly likely that if we cast our minds forward to
February or March we will have seen an effective inquiry into the
corruption matters and we will have seen and effective and
intelligent attack on the doping issue.
	   ``If the IOC is able to respond intelligently to them, then (the
IOC) will come out of this stronger, fast.''
	   Dissenting sports face the possibility of being thrown out of
the Olympics.
	   At a summit in Lausanne in February, the IOC will seek uniform
support from international sporting federations for a series of
anti-doping measures, including a minimum two-year suspension for a
first major offense and life for a second.
	   IOC member Marc Hodler cast the Olympic world into turmoil with
claims that the Olympics have been systematically bought and sold
and that some IOC members accepted money or favors in return for
their votes.
	   The IOC has launched an investigation into the successful bid by
Salt Lake City, Utah for the 2002 Winter Olympics after organizers
disclosed they had made payments of nearly U.S. dlrs 400,000 in
scholarship funds to 13 people, including six relatives of IOC
members.
	   Hodler has called the process corrupt and claims as many as 25
members might have received favors or cash for votes in four recent
elections to choose sites for the games.
	   SOCOG said Thursday that Sydney should not be tarnished by
Hodler's corruption allegations.
	   ``Marc Hodler was asked to put up or shut up about Sydney and he
has shut up,'' said president Michael Knight. ``There is no taint
on Sydney, even from Marc Hodler.''
	   He said public support for the games had not faltered because of
the scandal, but ``anything that reflects negatively on the
Olympics doesn't help Sydney.
	   ``The sooner this is resolved and off the agenda the better.''
	   Knight said he was confident the IOC scandal would not deter
sponsors from the Sydney games.
	   SOCOG is facing problems meeting its U.S. dlrs 1.64 billion
budget. Its marketing boss, John Moore, has said SOCOG is almost
U.S. dlrs 124 million short of its corporate-sponsorship goal of
U.S. dlrs 542 million.
	   ``We are very confident we will raise our money and we are
confident that this matter will be resolved quickly by the IOC,''
Knight said.
	   John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee and
SOCOG vice-president, said he supported a proposal to remove the
host city vote from all of the IOC's more than 100 members to
reduce the potential for corruption.
	   ``I think there is a good chance (this will happen),'' he said.
	   Coates said he thought it was inevitable that the voting process
to determine Olympic host cities would be streamlined, with the
final decision left to the IOC's Executive Board.
	   Under the current system, all 114 IOC members can travel to
prospective host cities before voting to decide who gets to host
the Summer and Winter Games.
	   Coates said there was now much more support for streamlining the
bidding process, including from IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch.
	   ``The IOC session at Lillehammer (in 1994) talked about
rationalizing it but the IOC members at that stage weren't really
keen to do so,'' said Coates.
	   ``And I don't think the IOC board and the president really
pursued it then but I think that (Samaranch) has now put his
thoughts out there through the media and there's a fair chance they
will change the process.''
	   ``I think it's inevitable.'' (rs/djp)

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The conductor of a mini-van who was hit by
the bullet fired by a police officer that killed the van's driver
died of his injuries, doctors said.
	   Doctors at Aga Khan Hospital said Henry Musyoka Kavale, 20, died
Wednesday of injuries to the brain.
	   Police Cpl. Gordon Mukhawana Kikete, who allegedly opened fire
on the vehicle because it was obstructing the car in which he was
travelling, was charged Wednesday with the murder of the driver and
unlawfully injuring the conductor.
	   Kavale was still alive when the charge was filed.
	   Kikete, attached to the police guard of President Daniel arap
Moi, shot driver Jamal Rajab, 23, in mouth on Saturday after a
heated argument. The bullet went through Rajab's head and hit
Kavale on the head as he was trying to intervene to save his
driver.
	   The killing provoked other drivers and conductors who went on a
rampage in Nairobi Monday.
	   Meanwhile, Commissioner Duncan Wachira, the head of Kenya's
much-maligned police, has invited Kenyans ``of all walks of life''
to attend day-long celebrations at Nairobi's Uhuru Park Friday to
commemorate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the force by
British colonial authorities.

Paris criticizes air strikes but blames Saddam Hussein

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with foreign minister blaming Saddam, defending
against Albright comment
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's foreign minister on Thursday deplored U.S.
air strikes against Iraq, but he also said Saddam Hussein bore the
most blame for the conflict over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Hubert Vedrine defended France's longstanding position that a
diplomatic solution should be sought to repeated standoffs with the
Iraqi leader, conflicting with Washington's policy that resulted in
air strikes that began Wednesday night.
	   At a hastily called news conference, Vedrine read a statement
that ``France deplores the spiral of events that led to the
American military strikes against Iraq and the grave human
consequences they could have on the Iraqi population.''
	   ``But Saddam Hussein is the person who bears the main
responsibility for the conflict,'' he added. ``We regret that the
Iraqi leader and other official did not show a spirit of
cooperation.''
	   France has repeatedly clashed with Washington over how to deal
with repeated standoffs with Saddam in recent months, and France's
latest stand drew ire from Washington.
	   ``It would be very nice if those who did not support our
approach had an approach that worked,'' U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said in Washington on Wednesday night.
	   Vedrine sought to avoid a verbal shootout. ``I don't know what
the solution is,'' he said, but added that France sought ``serious
and effective checks'' for any Iraqi weapons of mass destruction
from the 1990-91 Gulf War.
	   France, which in the past had fruitful trade relations with
Iraq, has wanted the U.N. Security Council to play the leading role
in the latest crisis, and hours ahead of the strikes expressed hope
the new dispute could be solved peacefully.
	   But in a Foreign Ministry statement after the bombings began,
Paris said it ``regrets that the Iraqi leaders were not able to
prove a complete spirit of cooperation'' called for in an agreement
they reached with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Feb. 23.
	   The memorandum of understanding, signed during a trip by Annan
to Baghdad to head off an earlier crisis, allowed for unfettered
weapons inspections that averted U.S. and British air strikes.
	   That agreement ``would have rendered possible the complete
examination of Iraqi disarmament foreseen in (U.N.) Security
Council Resolution 1194,'' the Foreign Ministry said. A green light
after the global examination was to get crippling sanctions lifted.
	   ``That would have brought a more positive solution,'' Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin said Wednesday night, referring to the
statement.
	   French newspapers were sharply critical of Washington. The
conservative Le Figaro said ``won't destroy the chemical and
biological arsenals'' of Iraq.
	   The leftist Liberation, headlining with ``Clinton's War,'' said
the strikes ``punished a country already weak and permanently
humiliated,'' and it noted the air strikes led Congress to postpone
an impeachment vote against President Clinton.

Chilean Senate President praises Lords decision on Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Britain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The president of the Chilean Senate, Andrew
Zaldivar, praised a British court's decision Thursday to set aside
its ruling that Augusto Pinochet lacked immunity from arrest,
saying it opened a way to resolve the entire issue concerning the
former dictator.
	   ``I think it's a good thing,'' Zaldivar told reporters in
Madrid. ``It's gives us another possibility to resolve the
situation caused by the arrest of Pinochet.''
	   He cautioned, however, against any false hope that the decision
might create regarding Pinochet's release.
	   Zaldivar was speaking after talks with conservative Spanish
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar who would only say that he had
complete respect for the British decision.
	   Aznar has steadfastly maintained that the Pinochet matter is one
for the courts to resolve and has declined to give any opinion on
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon's efforts to extradite Pinochet,
which led to the former dictator's arrest in October in London.
	   Zaldivar was in Madrid to discuss the Pinochet case. His trip is
an exception after the Chilean government last week suspended all
official visits to Britain and Spain as a sign of protest over
Pinochet's arrest.
	   Chile insists Pinochet is entitled to immunity as a member of
the Chilean senate and argue he should be tried at home.
	   ``The first thing we have to demand is that (people) respect our
legal state and our democracy,'' Zaldivar said. ``We live in a
democracy, therefore our law courts are as strong and as legitimate
as the courts in Great Britain, Spain or anywhere else.''

Bonus offered to best time in women-only race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ London Marathon organizers are offering a dlrs
125,000 bonus for any woman who sets a world best time in next
year's race.
	   The point of the bonus is that the women's race is totally
separate from the men's, starting a half hour earlier.
	   Tegla Laroupe's world record of 2 hours, 20 minutes 47 seconds,
was set in Rotterdam this year with the aid of male pacemakers.
	   The London Marathon organizers noted that the current best time
for a women's only race was set by Japan's Naoko Takahashi at the
Asian Games earlier this month. She was clocked in 2:21:46.
	   ``Currently there is much concern about women gaining advantage
through being paced by men in mixed marathons and whether
women-only world bests should be recognized,'' said Nick Bitel,
London Marathon chief executive.
	   ``This new London bonus seeks to address this. We believe that
to maintain the integrity of women's marathon running and to
achieve a consistency throughout competition, including major
championships and big city marathons, it is essential to recognize
times set in women-only races as world bests.
	   ``We are in communication with UK Athletics and the IAAF and are
asking them to support this initiative,'' Bitel said.
	   A similar bonus of dlrs 125,000 will go to anyone who sets a
world record in the men's race when both are run April 18.
	   The field includes Brazil's world record-holder Ronaldo da
Costa, who ran 2:06:05 at the Berlin Marathon on Sept. 20, 1996
Olympic champion Josia Thugwane of South Africa and silver medalist
Lee Bong-Ju of South Korea.
	   The women's field includes the last three winners, Liz McColgan
(1996), Joyce Chepchumba ('97) and Catherina McKiernan ('98).
Women's entrants also include European champion Manuela Machado of
Portugal and Olympic 10,000-meter champion Fernanda Ribiero, who
will be making her marathon debut.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot squads fired warning shots and
tear gas when thousands of student demonstrators demanding
democratic reform tried to storm the Parliament on Thursday.
	   Many of the more than 3,000 protesters threw rocks and bottles
at police and troops who beat them back with clubs.
	   Some heavily bleeding students were carried to safety by their
friends through clouds of tear gas. Paramedics applied first aid on
the street.
	   Officials at two nearby hospitals said at least 45 students were
injured. Most were beaten or overcome by gas.
	   The military said two police officers were injured.
	   It was the second straight day that students have clashed with
security forces in the Indonesian capital. And, it was the worst
violence seen since Nov. 13 when 14 people died after troops fired
upon students who also tried to march on Parliament.
	   Hours before Thursday's street battle, President B.J. Habibie
warned his country might break up if anti-government protests
escalated.
	   ``If the protests are not controlled it can lead to the
disintegration of the nation,'' Habibie said at a graduation
ceremony of new army officers.
	   For weeks, students have taken to the streets demanding that
Habibie force the military out of politics and put his autocratic
predecessor, ex-President Suharto, on trial for corruption.
	   Habibie has promised to open up the tightly controlled political
system and to hold elections next year. But the students are not
satisfied with the pace and scope of his reforms.
	   On Wednesday police also fired tear gas and swung batons to
disperse hundreds of rock-throwing protesters at the Defense
Ministry, not far from the presidential palace.
	   Religious groups have called on the students to end their
protest campaign during the forthcoming holy Islamic month of
Ramadan, which starts on Sunday.
	   As night fell Thursday, hundreds of military reinforcements
arrived at the Parliament and students lit bonfires on a toll road
before dispersing.
	   Soldiers ordered reporters and news crews to leave the scene.
	   Angry students pulled down and set fire to tents set up by the
troops near the legislature. They also burned a portrait of
Suharto.
	   The students had converged on the heavily guarded legislature in
two groups.
	   Many of them carried sticks and marched to the Parliament
demanding political reform and the release of some activists
arrested by police during other protests this week.
	   Outnumbered soldiers and police retreated briefly after the
students tried to run into the parliamentary grounds.
	   The protesters scattered when officers responded with warning
shots and tear gas.
	   Also on Thursday, dozens of riot police and troops peacefully
blocked about 100 students about 100 meters (yards) in front of the
presidential palace.
	   Habibie, who has promised democratic reform after decades of
authoritarian rule, said that freedom of expression that allows
protests is now guaranteed under Indonesian law.
	   ``But in carrying out these rights people must also respect
other people's rights,'' he said.
	   Indonesia, with 202 million people, is the world's fourth most
populous country. It has more than 300 ethnic groups spread over
about 17,000 islands.
	   Student protests and deadly riots last May also forced Suharto
to quit after 32 years in power. At that time students occupied the
parliament building for several days.
	   Anger at Habibie's seven-month old government has been sharpened
by a continuing economic crisis, which has resulted in soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and rising poverty.
	   Sporadic rioting and looting has hit some parts of the country.
There has also been violence among the Muslim majority and the
Christian minority with dozens of mosques and churches set afire or
ransacked.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States fired hundreds of
missiles on Iraq Thursday in attacks that lasted through the night,
and Baghdad shook with explosions and anti-aircraft gunfire. Two
people were killed and 30 were wounded, a doctor said. Russia and
China called for an immediate halt to the attacks, but U.S.
officials suggested the strikes may continue. In the Iraqi capital,
government employees went to their offices and young children
headed to school in scenes that gave little indication of the
nightlong blitz. Morning traffic jams clogged some of the streets
in downtown Baghdad. But the strikes were met with defiance in
Iraqi newspapers. ``Iraqis are pulling together to go forward to
bury the strikes of aggression and continue their new crusade to
teach the enemy lessons, which they will never forget,''
al-Qadissiya, a government newspaper, said in an editorial. IRAQ
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Despite strong cynicism about the timing of
airstrikes against Iraq, House Republican leaders postponed a
history-making impeachment vote against President Bill Clinton.
They advised lawmakers to stay in town and stand by. ``We're going
to ask that all members, Republican and Democrat, remain available
... for further action possibly Friday, possibly Saturday, but
within the near future,'' said incoming Speaker Bob Livingston, a
Louisiana Republican. Before Wednesday's decision to postpone, the
president's prospects were growing increasingly dim as one
Republican moderate after another declared support for impeachment.
That outlook is not expected to change by a short delay.
CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT
	   HANGZHOU, China _ As supporters shouted and protested outside,
two of China's most prominent dissidents went on trial Thursday for
subversion for setting up an opposition group challenging Communist
Party rule. Police maintained visible presences outside the
separate trials in two cities. Despite a flurry of detentions, 200
people gathered in bold support of Wang Youcai in Hangzhou city.
But in Wuhan, police seized two people as Qin Yongmin was taken
away after his trial. Both men claimed their innocence and mounted
their own defenses after authorities scared potential attorneys
away. The trials lasted about 2 1/2 hours, and court officials said
verdicts would be issued later and carried by state-run media.
Wang, a former student leader of 1989 prodemocracy protests, and
Qin, a democracy campaigner for 20 years, could be sentenced to
life in prison if convicted in the government's most aggressive

	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's highest court on Thursday set aside its
decision that Gen. Augusto Pinochet has no immunity from arrest and
ordered a new hearing because of a judge's ties with the human
rights group Amnesty International. The unprecedented decision by
the House of Lords means that a panel of judges will re-hear next
month the former Chilean dictator's claim to immunity under British
law. It marks a setback in Spain's efforts to extradite the
83-year-old general to face charges of murder and torture.
Announcing the unanimous decision, Lord Justice Nicolas
Browne-Wilkinson, head of the Lords' tribunel that heard the
complaint, said the Amnesty-linked judge ``did not disclose his
links'' and thus should not have sat on the first panel. ``I am
satisfied that the earlier decision of this house cannot stand and
must be set aside,'' Browne-Wilkinson said. BRITAIN-PINOCHET
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police were reported
Thursday to have arrested three Kosovo Albanians in the slayings of
six young Serbs whose deaths further inflamed tensions in the
province. Police in Pec, where Monday's brutal barroom killings
occurred, sealed off a suburb of the western Kosovo city as well as
the nearby village of Glodjane and arrested three suspected
accomplices in the crime, the Serb-run Media Center said. They were
hunting for 11 other ethnic Albanians whom they said organized and
carried out the attack, the report said, citing a police source.
Police released the names of nine of those suspects _ ethnic
Albanian men between the ages of 18 and 29. YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO

	   LONDON (AP) _ Russia and China angrily denounced the
U.S.-British attack on Iraq, while allies such as Germany and
Canada offered their immediate support, placing all blame for the
crisis on Saddam Hussein.
	   Iraq's neighbor, Iran, joined Russia and China in blasting the
use of force and warning that it could shatter regional security.
	   Fearful of recriminations, the United States on Thursday closed
all but two of its African embassies, and security was stepped up
at many U.S. and British institutions worldwide, from the
Philippines to Greece to Denmark.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin demanded an immediate end to the
military campaign, while his foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said
the United States and Britain had acted without U.N. authorization.
	   ``Nobody has the right to act on their own in the name of the
United Nations and even less to pretend to be the judge of the
entire world,'' Ivanov said in Madrid, Spain.
	   China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasen was visibly angry when he
emerged from a Security Council session Wednesday evening, learning
of the attack only after the fact.
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' he said.
	   The German government noted, however, that the Iraqi leadership
``had been warned'' the international community would have to act
if it failed to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Support for the airstrikes also poured in from Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, the Netherlands,
Austria and Spain.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has brought this crisis on himself,'' Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said.
	   France, which has close ties to Iraq, deplored ``the grave human
consequences'' of the military strikes, but added its regret that
Iraqi leaders were unable to ``show proof of the spirit of complete
cooperation'' demanded by previous agreements with the United
Nations.
	   Iranian television quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying
that ``such unilateral attacks against Iraq will lead to even more
pain and misery for the people of that country and will bring about
insecurity in the region.''
	   Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi urged the U.N. Security Council to
take immediate action to prevent ``further deterioration'' of the
situation, television reported. Iran also called on Baghdad to
cooperate with the United Nations.
	   Fearing an influx of refugees, Turkey closed its border with
Iraq, the Anatolia news agency reported. Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem expressed disappointment in the attack, but also called
on Iraq to comply.
	   In Pakistan, however, the Senate passed a resolution unanimously
condemning the airstrikes as ``an attack on humanity and the
Islamic world.'' Islamic Pakistan's right-wing religious group
called the United States ``international terrorists.''
	   The strikes led news reports in Lebanon, where all newspaper,
radio and television stations carried news agency reports without
comment.
	   In Indonesia, the world's most populous Islamic nation, leaders
pleaded for restraint.
	   Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka backed the United
States and Britain, saying, ``We strongly demand that Iraq
immediately and unconditionally implement the U.N. Security
Council's resolutions.''
	   He was seconded by Misao Nozaki, a 47-year-old Tokyo restaurant
owner who called the bombing justified ``because Iraq has continued
developing nuclear weapons in a way that goes against the common
sense of the rest of the world.''
	   But Yukari Ohi, 38, an office worker in Tokyo, said she opposed
the use of force.
	   ``I think the U.S. decision to attack Iraq was apparently
intended to shift attention from the impeachment issue to war,''
Ohi said, noting that the airstrikes came as U.S. President Bill
Clinton faced an impeachment vote.
	   India condemned the attack, while Mexico expressed
disappointment.
	   In Britain, the country's largest-selling tabloid, The Sun, got
behind the attack, saying in an editorial today, ``Saddam must be
crushed. Blitz about time too.''
	   Members of U.S. Congress generally endorsed the bombing, while
noting that it conveniently took the spotlight off the Clinton
impeachment proceedings.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was noncommittal,
saying, ``Israel is outside the dispute, and in any case will take
care of defending itself if the need arises.''

Report: Germany to shut nuclear plants within 20 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and major
power companies have agreed to close Germany's nuclear plants
within 20 years, a magazine reported Thursday.
	   The accord, to be fleshed out in detailed talks starting next
month, would rule out compensation claims by utilities for scrapped
power plants, the newsweekly Der Spiegel said.
	   Schroeder's 7-week-old center-left government, which includes
the environmentalist Greens, has set shutting down the nation's 19
nuclear plants as a top goal _ a policy reversal for Germany.
	   The report said Schroeder agreed on a timetable for the exit
strategy in talks Monday with the bosses of Germany's four biggest
energy providers: RWE, Veba, Viag, and Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg.
	   Schroeder at the time described the talks as preliminary and
announced no agreements. There was no immediate government comment
on the Spiegel report.
	   If confirmed, the timetable would be much slower than sought by
the Greens, the junior partner to Schroeder's Social Democrats, but
quicker than industry has so far proposed.
	   While the Greens have talked about closing the plants in five to
10 years, an electricity industry trade group this week demanded a
40-year time span.
	   Efforts to draft a new nuclear power law have already caused a
rift in the government alliance, clouding prospects for Schroeder's
negotiations with power companies.
	   Environment Minister Juergen Trittin, a Green, insisted Thursday
he will fight for an immediate legal ban on reprocessing spent
nuclear fuel from German power plants, which could force them to
shut down more quickly than Schroeder wants.
	   Schroeder failed to settle the dispute in a Cabinet meeting
Wednesday, and both parties agreed to put off the issue until next
month.
	   At issue are contracts with reprocessing plants in France and
Britain. Germany has no such plants of its own.
	   The opposition Christian Democrats said Trittin's plans could
trigger violent protests by Germany's strong anti-nuclear movement
if the new law forces the French and British to ship back nuclear
fuel that was awaiting reprocessing.

Relief agencies: reduced malnutrition in most famine areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The condition of thousands of Sudanese in
the war-torn south of Sudan has improved since famine peaked in the
region between June and August, relief agencies said Thursday.
	   However, Operation Lifeline Sudan, the umbrella organization of
the United Nations and other aid agencies operating in Sudan, said
child malnutrition rates were still unacceptably high and warned
that large portions of populations in the area were still quite
vulnerable.
	   ``The population's condition is extremely fragile,'' OLS said in
a statement. ``A renewed outbreak of fighting or lack of access to
arable land, livestock or food and medical assistance could reverse
the progress made during the last several months.''
	   In May, aid agencies began issuing urgent worldwide appeals to
fund what has become the largest aid operation currently underway
anywhere in the world, after fighting in southern Sudan brought
about the worst famine in years.
	   Famine has become a bitter companion to the 15-year civil war
for control of southern Sudan between rebels from the Christian and
animism south and forces of the northern National Islamic Front
government.
	   A recent report by the humanitarian agency, U.S. Committee for
Refugees, says war and famine have left 1.9 million Sudanese dead
since 1983.
	   The global spotlight and international pressure induced the
Khartoum government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army to sign
a three-month cease-fire in the worst-hit western Bahr el-Ghazal
region, where thousands of civilians displaced by heavy fighting
were suffering from starvation.
	   The cease-fire was later extended to January 1999.
	   A nutritional survey conducted by the U.N. children's fund
UNICEF and other OLS agencies found that while overall malnutrition
rates had dropped, some areas were seeing continuing or worsening
conditions of malnutrition.
	   The survey conducted in 10 northern Bar el-Ghazal locations
indicated that on average, the global malnutrition rate had dropped
from 52.7 percent in May/June to 28.6 percent in September/October.
	   However in four locations, Adet, Maarial Bal, Agalgal and Akot,
malnutrition rates have remained above 30 percent, the statement
said.
	   Another recent survey by the agencies found that in the
government-held town of Wau, the capital of Bahr el-Ghazal, the
average malnutrition rates among residents, displaced and returnees
had dropped from 43.4 percent in August to 9.6 percent.
	   In the Eastern Bank Camp for displaced people, the global
malnutrition rate had dropped from 71.6 percent to 27.8 percent of
global malnutrition.
	   UNICEF and other relief agencies plan to increase household food
security projects in the coming year to assist the displaced in
planting food, fishing in the rivers and herding livestock.
	   ``OLS anticipates these measures will replenish a portion of the
resources lost during the famine and displacement that devastated
parts of southern Sudan during 1998,'' the statement said.

Russia says U.S. holding up food aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Also moving on general wires. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's agriculture minister has accused the
United States of stalling on promised food aid by introducing new
demands for control over its distribution.
	   Agriculture Minister Gennady Kulik said Russia was ready to sign
amendments to an agreement reached last month on $625 million in
food aid and loans. The new measures would include additional
controls to ensure that the 3.1 million tons of food reach those
who need it most.
	   But the United States was not satisfied with the measures, which
is causing ``unjustifiable'' delays, the ITAR-Tass news agency
quoted Kulik as saying. It gave no details of the provisions.
	   Past food aid deals have been tainted by corruption, and U.S.
officials have stressed that they want to avoid any hint of scandal
in this program. Russia has promised to keep tight control over the
food.
	   Christopher Goldthwait, general sales manager for the U.S.
Department of Agriculture foreign service, said Tuesday that the
first batch of food would likely arrive Jan. 1.
	   A poor grain harvest on top of the nation's economic crisis have
prompted fears that some Russians could go hungry this winter.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police launched a sweep
operation Thursday in the area where six young Kosovo Serbs were
killed this week, arresting 11 people and killing two ethnic
Albanian rebels in an ensuing firefight, police said.
	   International peace verifiers confirmed police were cracking
down on a KLA stronghold near Pec in western Kosovo where gunfire
and mortar fire could be heard, said a U.S. diplomatic official on
condition of anonymity.
	   The crackdown took place Thursday morning in an outlying
district of Pec and in the nearby village of Glodjane _ a suspected
stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army _ the Serb-run Media
Center in Pristina reported, citing police sources.
	   After officers conducting the search for suspects came under
fire, the report said, police killed two people wearing camouflage
uniforms bearing the KLA insignia and armed with assault rifles and
mortars. They were said to have arrestd 11 people and discovered
large quanities of arms, ammunition and KLA uniforms.
	   A police source who asked to remain unidentified confirmed
fighting was going on.
	   The international Kosovo Verification Mission sent several teams
to the area, and American and other officials were holding talks
with Serbian police.
	   ``We hope that the presence of the KVM patrols will encourage
restraint on both sides and contribute to calming down the
situation,'' the diplomatic source said.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended mixed on Thursday
amid concerns over the U.S. and British military strike on Iraq and
U.S. President Bill Clinton's possible impeachment. Most investors
shrugged off the air strikes, which they believe would have little
impact on financial markets but worries about Clinton's possible
impeachment weighed slightly on the U.S. dollar. In Tokyo, the
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 30.69 points, or 0.22
percent, to close at 14,126.99. The Nikkei fell below 14,000 points
in early trading as the Iraq air-strike raised fears of higher oil
costs in Japan. But the index rebounded as the Japanese yen
strengthened against the dollar later in the day. ASIAN-MARKETS
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ DaimlerChrysler is considering taking
a stake in Japan's debt-laden Nissan Motor Co. and not in its
truck-making subsidiary as originally contemplated, a German news
magazine reported Thursday. However, DaimlerChrysler Chairman
Juergen Schrempp is hesitant to do so at present, according to an
advance copy of next week's Der Spiegel. ``We shouldn't take too
much on board at one time,'' Schrempp was quoted as saying. ``In
three years' time we'll be measured by whether we've made a success
of DaimlerChrysler or not and less by whether we've entered Asia.''
A DaimlerChrysler spokesman, Eckhard Zanger, said the company has
been in talks with Nissan and its subsidiary, Nissan Diesel, for
about a year now with a view to cooperation in the commercial
vehicle area. But he declined to comment further.
GERMANY-DAIMLERCHRYSLER-NISSAN.
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's respected central bank, the
Bundesbank, held its last interest rate-setting meeting Thursday,
bringing to an end a highly successful chapter in the country's
postwar history. From Jan. 1 the new European Central Bank will set
interest rates for the 11 European Union nations launching the
single currency, the euro. No key rate cuts were announced after
the meeting of the bank's policy-making central council. Ten of the
11 countries launching the euro set their key interest rate at 3
percent two weeks ago, immediately after the last Bundesbank
meeting. GERMANY-CENTRAL BANK
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Ministers from three top oil producers
began talks in the Spanish capital Thursday to examine ways to
boost sagging oil prices. Oil prices, buffeted by overproduction
amid a global economic crisis especially in the Asian financial
markets, have hovered this year around 12-year lows, causing pain
among oil-dependent economies of a number of countries. The meeting
started shortly after 12 p.m. (1100 GMT) at the Mexican
ambassador's residence in Madrid. Earlier in the morning, Mexican
and Saudi representatives held bilateral talks prior to the
three-way meeting with Venezuela. Saudi Arabia is the leading
producer among the 11-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. Venezuela is OPEC's No. 3 exporter, while Mexico is not
a member of the organization. OIL MEETING
	   SHANGHAI (AP) _ General Motors Corp. launched a dlrs 1.52
billion sedan venture here Thursday, predicting that the factory
would provide a niche for the U.S. auto giant in a market that has
been long on potential but short on profits. The first car produced
by the venture _ an all-white 1999 Buick _ rolled off the
production line following a ceremony attended by top GM and Chinese
auto executives, senior Chinese government officials and U.S.
Ambassador James Sasser. GM's partner in the venture, located in
Shanghai's industrial suburbs, is Shanghai Automotive Industrial
Corp., China's most profitable car maker. ``As an extraordinary
1998 comes to a conclusion, we have good news for Shanghai's
industrial sector. The auto industry is the pillar of our pillar
industries, and this venture will help spur growth in other
industries. This day marks the start of a new era in Shanghai's
industrial sector,'' said Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi. CHINA-GM

	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The Arab League condemned the
U.S. military strikes on Iraq Thursday, and a Gulf official said
that Baghdad had reached out for Arab support to stop the attacks.
	   In Kuwait, where memories of Iraq's 1990 invasion remain fresh,
some families opted for caution and began heading for Saudi Arabia.
	   Many Kuwaitis normally head out for the weekend, but a Saudi
official near the border reported a four-fold increase Thursday in
the number of Kuwaitis trying to drive across. He spoke on
customary condition of anonymity and refused to give figures.
	   The Okaz newspaper in Saudi Arabia interviewed a number of
Kuwaitis on the border. They said they were heading out for fear of
possible Iraqi chemical weapons attacks.
	   The U.S. State Department ordered the departure of some of its
embassy personnel and their families from Kuwait. It urged 8,000
U.S. citizens who live there to ``take this information into
account in considering whether they should also depart the
country.''
	   Scattered protests erupted Thursday.
	   In Cairo, Egypt, 3,000 university students poured into the
streets after hearing news of the military strike. The students,
from Cairo University, shouted anti-American slogans, police said.
	   Nearly 250 students at American University of Beirut staged a
sit-in and urged students to boycott classes.
	   Most Saudis asked about the strikes said they were against them.
	   ``Why don't they (the Americans) strike Israel, which
continuously flouts international law. Why is it always Muslim
countries, like Sudan, Afghanistan and Iraq that are attacked?''
said Abdullah al-Daylmi, a religion professor in Riyadh.
	   Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid told an Arab
radio station that the strikes were ``an aggression against an Arab
country'' and will not ``solve the problems between Iraq and the
United Nations but will complicate them more.''
	   Iraq called several Arab states, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia,
and the Emirates, asking for help to stop the attacks, said an
official from a Gulf country, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   In Lebanon, the As-Safir daily lamented that a fellow Arab
country was under attack once more.
	   ``Once again, it is our flesh that is being eaten, and it is our
blood that is being shed. And, let the perpetrators and benefactors
(of the air strike) both go to hell,'' it said.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Malaysians won two Asian Games gold
medals Thursday in karate combat, but another of its fighters was

	   Indonesia and Japan each won one Thursday in the Japanese

	   Japan finished the competition with five of the 11 gold medals.
Malaysia ended with two, and Iran, Indonesia, Taiwan and Kuwait had
one each.
	   Malaysia's Muniandy Rajoo defeated Iran's Medhi Amouzadeh in the

Kuwait's Bader Alotaibi at 55 kilograms.
	   At 60 kilograms, Indonesia's Arif-Faufan Syamsuddin defeated
Fakhruddin Taher of the United Arab Emirates for the gold.
	   Syria's Adnan Laoundi, who was injured by a blow to the neck,
received a bronze after opponent Puvanesuaran Ramasamy, who was
leading 3-1 at the time, was disqualified.
	   Adnan hit the canvas hard, and medical personnel rushed to the
mat and carried him off on a stretcher. Adnan initially appeared to
be having trouble breathing but was not hospitalized.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Dozens of students staged a second hunger
strike Thursday, escalating tensions hours after police broke up
their initial protest.
	   Early Thursday, Albanian authorities ordered police to force a
group of students to end a week-long hunger strike after one of the
participants was diagnosed with hepatitis C, officials said.
	   ``We intervened in the hunger strike because we had information
that terrorist acts against the students had been planned,'' said
Prime Minister Pandeli Majko in a statement.
	   ``We also decided to intervene to safeguard their lives,'' after
one student was diagnosed with hepatitis C, he said, adding that no
force was used against the students.
	   At 4:00 a.m. local time (0300GMT), police forced about 40
students from Tirana and Skodra universities to end their protest,
demanding better learning conditions and higher scholarships.
	   But up to 30 students returned later in the day to continue the
strike in a disco in the Tirana dormitory complex. Police had
blocked off the entrance to the disco and were not permitting
anyone to enter, but later dispersed.
	   Despite a recent government pledge to invest about dlrs 70,000
towards improving the conditions in the dormitories, known
informally as Student City, the students refused to end their
protest.
	   According to the Information Ministry, the 20-year-old son of
Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha is believed to be a key member
behind the group organizing the hunger strikes.
	   On Thursday, the Democratic leader gathered thousands of
supporters in the capital's central Skenderbeg square, calling for
support of the students and their demands.
	   ``Now I am determined more than ever to defend the Albanian
ideal and the ideals of democracy,'' he told supporters at a rally.
From the rally, Berish a led the group to the dormitory complex,
where they shouted support for the students and called for Majko's
resignation.
	   Student boycotts and hunger strikes have played an important
political role in Albania in recent years. In 1991, student
protesters were instrumental in forcing Albania's last communist
leader to call multi-party elections, and the spread of organized
student protests significantly increased pressure on the
government.
	   A hunger strike by students in the southern town of Vlora
preceded the failure of the government of Sali Berisha, who was
president of the country from 1992 to 1997. His government lost
power after pyramid schemes collapsed, creating anarchy and chaos.

Former England captain becomes Serie A's youngest boss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENOA, Italy (AP) _ Sampdoria of Genoa introduced David Platt as
its new coach Thursday, making the former England captain the
youngest bench boss in Serie A.
	   Platt, 32, replaces the fired Luciano Spalletti and inherits a
reeling club just one spot out of the relegation zone with little
more than half the season remaining.
	   Technically, Platt will not have the title of ``coach'' because
he does not have the necessary permit from the Italian federation.
Giorgio Veneri, a veteran of Italy's lower divisions, will be
Platt's assistant.
	   As a player, Platt was part of Sampdoria's last triumph, the
1994 Italian Cup. He retired in July after helping Arsenal to a
rare Premiership and FA Cup double.
	   The midfielder totaled 209 goals in 500 games with English sides
Crewe, Aston Vill and Arsenal, plus Bari, Juventus and Sampdoria in
Serie A. He also earned 62 national team caps, scoring 27 times,
and captained England in 1993-94.
	   When he hung up his cleats, Platt made clear he was interested
in managing, and was in Hong Kong with an England youth side when
Sampdoria contacted him this week.
	   He'll have a tough task in Genoa.
	   Samp's next two games are against second-place AC Milan on
Sunday and at league-leading Fiorentina the following week.
	   In addition to needing to right the club's 3-4-6 record, which
has Sampdoria 14th in the 18-team league, Platt will have to
determine how and when to bring Argentine World Cup star Ariel
Ortega and two other suspended players back into the fold after a
drunk driving incident.
	   Salernitana's Delio Rossi, 38, was the youngest current coach in
Serie A.
	   Italy has not been kind to British coaches of late.
	   Scotland's Graeme Souness was fired by second-division Torino
last year after less than four months on the job, while Englishman
Roy Hodgson lined up a job at Premier League club Blackburn midway
through his second stormy season, 1996-97, with Internazionale of
Milan.

Red Cross tells governments to spare civilians

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The International Committee of the Red Cross
Thursday sent a diplomatic note to the U.S., British and Iraqi
governments asking them to do everything possible to ensure
civilians and medical facilities are unaffected by military action.
	   Following airstrikes by the United States and Britain against
Iraq, the organization said it is concerned that those affected be
treated properly under international law.
	   ``Under this body of law, those conducting the hostilities must
take all necessary precautions in particular to spare civilians and
civilian objects, to treat captured persons humanely, to ensure
that the wounded and sick have access to medical care, to protect
medical facilities, staff and transport and to respect the Red
Cross and its emblem,'' an ICRC statement said.
	   In Baghdad Thursday, an ICRC team is gathering information at
hospitals and with government ministries in order to help the
victims, it added.
	   The ICRC, which helps provide clean water and deliver emergency
medical supplies, has 10 foreign staff members in the Iraqi capital
and eight in the north of the country.

President Tudjman departs for Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ President Franjo Tudjman flew to Moscow
on Thursday on a two-day official visit that is to include talks
with Russian leader Boris Yeltsin.
	   The two were scheduled to meet in November, but the meeting was
postponed due to Yeltsin's health problems.
	   Though still recuperating, Yeltsin was released from the
hospital last week after receiving treatment for pneumonia. He had
stayed at a country residence most of the time since then, making
occasional trips into the Kremlin.
	   Tudjman, 76, was also taken ill in late 1996, when he underwent
medical treatment in Washington DC.
	   U.S. officials claimed then that the Croatian leader was
suffering from cancer. Tudjman denied the claims, saying he only
had minor stomach problems. Although reportedly still on therapy,
Tudjman appears often in public in a seemingly fine condition.
	   Tudjman and Yeltsin, who will meet on Friday, are expected to
sign an agreement on friendship and cooperation, aimed at boosting
the two countries' relations.
	   Tudjman has been primarily seeking good ties with the West, but
he said on Monday that Croatia ``must also develop good relations
with Russia ... Despite its recent crisis, Russia remains the world
power.''
	   The trip to Russia would be Tudjman's first since he came to
power in 1991 and led his country to independence from the former
Yugoslav federation.
	   Croatian Serbs' rebellion against independence led to a
six-month war. It effectively ended in 1995, when the government
recaptured areas that rebels seized during the war.
	   Russia has been a traditional ally of Serbs, with whom it shares
Orthodox Christian religion.
	   Russia now shows ``more balanced'' approach to the ex-Yugoslav
countries, Croatian ambassador to Moscow, Hidajet Biscevic, said
recently.
	   Tudjman also is to discuss Russia's dlrs 1.5 billion debt to the
former Yugoslav nations, which it inherited from the old Soviet
Union.
	   The debt is to be divided among the former Yugoslav republics,
with Croatia getting about 28 percent.
	   Considering Russia's other financial obligations, Croatia would
accept payment in oil and natural gas, Biscevic said.
	   Croatian businessmen, who will accompany Tudjman, will seek ways
to improve the mutual trade, amounting to dlrs 600 million in 1998.

	   Monday's brutal shootings of the Serbs, shot dead by masked
assailants who sprayed a barroom with automatic weapons fire,
further inflamed tensions in the province and prompted reports of
harassment against ethnic Albanians.
	   The political representative of the KLA, which is fighting to
drive Serb police out of Kosovo and break the province away from
Serbia, has denied rebel involvement in Monday's attack.
	   But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this week to arrest
the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   The state-run Borba daily called Thursday, in a sharply worded
commentary, for the withdrawal of international verifiers and U.S.
envoys from Kosovo, saying they are ``direct instigators and
helpers of the crimes committed by Albanian terrorists.''
	   ``Those people should go, and relieve us of their help. They
should return to their homes and defend them against terrorists,
separatists, and rapists.''
	   Serbs held a protest rally against the killings for a second
straight day Thursday, this time in front of the headquarters of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs
the verifying force.
	   On Wednesday, a policeman enroute to the emotional funeral
service for the six victims reportedly shot and killed a suspected
rebel in the latest in a wave of violence that has taken dozens of
lives since an October truce.
	   Some ethnic Albanians elsewhere complained of harassment
connected to the killings, including schoolchildren being beaten by
Serb civilians and broken Albanian shop windows.
	   The killings cast further gloom over stalled diplomatic efforts
to resolve the Serb-Albanian standoff in Kosovo, where more than
1,000 people have been killed since Milosevic began a crackdown on
separatists in February.
	   Serbian authorities say they are willing to grant only limited
autonomy for Kosovo, while most of the overwhelmingly
Albanian-populated province want independence from Serbia _ the
dominant republic remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Wednesday that Serb military and police have increased their
presence on roads and in the cities of Kosovo. Serb police deny
there has been an increase.

U.S. bombards Iraq through the night: 2 killed, 30 injured

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States fired hundreds of
missiles on Iraq Thursday in attacks that lasted through the night,
and Baghdad shook with explosions and anti-aircraft gunfire. Two
people were killed and 30 were wounded, a doctor said.
	   Russia and China called for an immediate halt to the attacks,
but U.S. President Bill Clinton suggested the strikes may continue.
	   A sense of normalcy returned to the streets of the Iraqi capital
during the day in sharp contrast to the air raid sirens and
antiaircraft fire that punctuated the night.
	   Government employees went to their offices, and young children
headed to school. Morning traffic jams clogged some of the streets
in downtown Baghdad, although fewer cars were out than usual.
	   Baghdad residents, however, lined up at gas stations to stock up
on fuel, a sign that more attacks were expected.
	   ``We are expecting the worst of Clinton because we have
discovered that he has no humanitarian principles,'' said Riad
Mamdouh al-Samarai, 36, as he stood at one station.
	   The strikes were met with defiance in Iraqi newspapers.
	   ``Iraqis are pulling together to go forward to bury the strikes
of aggression and continue their new crusade to teach the enemy
lessons, which they will never forget,'' al-Qadissiya, a government
newspaper, said in an editorial.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein visited some sites targeted by
U.S. missiles Thursday, including his daughter's house, Baghdad
Radio reported. She was safe, but the house was demolished.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said.
	   Air raid sirens broke the night's silence minutes before a
barrage of anti-aircraft fire lit up the Baghdad sky at 12:49 a.m.
(2149 GMT Wednesday), unleashing thunderous blasts like a fireworks
display and shaking windows of buildings.
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known.
	   Witnesses said another missile landed in the neighborhood of
al-Adil, about two kilometers (one mile) from Abu Ghraib where a
sprawling military camp and radio relay stations are located.
	   Both of Iraq's television stations were not broadcasting
Thursday afternoon, and three of four official radio stations were
off the air. It was not clear whether they were destroyed.
	   One stray missile hit an Iranian city, Tehran radio reported.
	   Sirens were heard twice in Baghdad, and anti-aircraft guns were
fired four times during the night. As the sounds of the last
barrage at 5:18 a.m. (0218 GMT) faded, a call for prayer floated
over the winter morning from a mosque loudspeaker.
	   Clinton said he ordered the strikes on military and security
targets to retaliate for Iraq's defiance of the U.N. Special
Commission, which is responsible for eliminating the country's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological weapons,'' he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he authorized the
participation of British forces.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in his radio
address, saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face''
but ``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   An Iraqi newspaper, Babil, suggested Clinton launched the attack
to divert attention from his impeachment hearings.
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the al-Yarmouk Hospital in Baghdad,
said two people were killed and more than 30 were wounded,
suffering mostly burns in the face, hands and legs. But the full
casualty toll was not known, and there was no official word.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
mumbled Salam Mohammed, 34, as he moaned on his hospital bed, his
face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Unlike a previous U.S. attack on the city in 1993, there was no
blackout this time. The streets were brightly lit, as were many
homes when the attack began.
	   The total damage from the attack could not be immediately
assessed, although residents in an Iranian town reportedly saw
thick smoke rising from targets across the border in Iraq.
	   Iraqi officials took foreign reporters to Karada, an upscale
commercial and residential neighborhood, where a missile had
landed. The blast burst water mains in a street, flooding a
two-kilometer (one-mile) stretch of a street.
	   Karada is across the Tigris River from the Old Presidential
Complex, but it was not clear if the palace was damaged.
	   Foreign reporters, who are based at a press center in downtown
Baghdad and can travel around the city only with a government
escort, were given selective access to the damage.
	   In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain for the attack and demanded an immediate end to
the campaign, warning it could shatter regional security.
	   At a Security Council meeting, the ambassadors of Russia and
China, both sympathetic to Iraq, urged an end to the attacks.
	   Staunch American allies _ Germany, Canada and even Japan _
supported the strikes.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the events a ``sad day
for the world,'' saying he did everything in his power to seek
peace. But he didn't say whether the attacks were justified.
	   In his speech, Clinton said the campaign against Iraq will be a
``strong sustained series of airstrikes,'' indicating that more
punishing strikes are likely in the next few days.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   In the attacks, the warships fired hundreds of Tomahawk cruise
missiles, and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck against Iraqi air
defense radars, Pentagon officials said.
	   The United States hopes the attacks will achieve what the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, says it has not been able to achieve
in seven years of work: destroy Iraq's ability to produce weapons
of mass destruction, specifically chemical and biological arms.
	   ``Instead of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam is
disarming the inspectors,'' Clinton said.
	   The U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until the
inspectors certify that Iraq is free of chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles and programs to build them.
	   Iraq accuses the chief inspector, Richard Butler, of being a
U.S. puppet who is deliberately prolonging the sanctions.
	   Butler withdrew all his weapons inspectors from Baghdad on
Wednesday, accusing Iraq of going back on its promise last month to
cooperate fully with UNSCOM. That promise had saved Iraq from an
imminent U.S. attack on Nov. 14.
	   Many of the U.N. humanitarian staff remained in Iraq, and their
spokesman, George Somerwill, said they had received no instructions
to evacuate. He said 133 U.N. staff were still in Baghdad and 233
staff had stayed in northern Iraq.
	   ``We are still waiting for instructions from New York,'' he
said.

	   HANGZHOU, China _ As supporters shouted and protested outside,
two of China's most prominent dissidents went on trial Thursday for
subversion for setting up an opposition group challenging Communist
Party rule.
	   Police maintained visible presences outside the separate trials
in two cities. Despite a flurry of detentions, 200 people gathered
in bold support of Wang Youcai in Hangzhou. In Wuhan, police broke
up a huddle of several dozen supporters of Qin Yongmin and later
detained two of them.
	   Both men pleaded innocent and mounted their own defenses after
authorities scared potential attorneys away. The trials lasted
about 2 1/2 hours, and court officials said verdicts would be
issued at a later date.
	   Wang, a former student leader of 1989 pro-democracy protests,
and Qin, a democracy campaigner for 20 years, could be sentenced to
life in prison if convicted in the government's most aggressive
crackdown on dissent in two years.
	   Since Wang announced the China Democracy Party's formation in
June, dissidents in 14 provinces and cities have tried to meet
legal requirements to register the group. But authorities have
rebuffed them.
	   Prosecutors accused both Wang and Qin of being leading figures
in the opposition party and of working with exiled dissidents to
organize the group, family members said. Foreign reporters were
barred from the trials and allowed only select family members
inside, three in Wang's case, one in Qin's.
	   Judges and prosecutors treated the defendants abruptly. In
Hangzhou, a judge cut off Wang's self-defense statement after 30
minutes, calling it irrelevant to the indictment, said his wife, Hu
Jiangxia, who emerged pale and shaken after the session.
	   Qin too was interrupted seven times by judges and prosecutors,
although he was ultimately allowed to finish his statement, said
his brother Qin Xiaoguang.
	   With 20 uniformed police flanking the Hangzhou courthouse, 200
people stood at the head of the narrow lane leading to the building
to show support for Wang. One woman carried a small banner saying
``kang yi,'' or ``protest,'' and successfully resisted efforts by
plainclothes police to grab it.
	   Local officials prevented foreign reporters from conducting
interviews and confiscated their tapes and film. China's
government-controlled news media did not report on the trials.
	   Outside the courthouse where Qin Yongmin was on trial in Wuhan,
500 kilometers (300 miles) west of Hangzhou, police detained a man
who waved and shouted ``Yongmin'' as Qin was taken away in a police
van. Another dissident who attempted to make a speech outside the
courthouse also was seized by police.
	   The shows of support came despite trial-eve police sweeps that
resulted in detentions of at least five people in Wuhan and a
dozen, including Wang's brother and sister, in Hangzhou.
	   More than 30 people associated with the China Democracy Party
have been detained or questioned in an 18-day-old crackdown against
the group.
	   The defense lawyer hired for Wang was ordered off the case after
being held temporarily, and family members say others were
pressured not to defend either man.
	   The trials began a day before a major Communist Party gathering
in Beijing to celebrate the achievements of 20 years of economic
reform. The timing of the events highlights the widening gap
between growing social and economic freedom in China and a closed
political system that deals harshly with dissent.
	   ``The government's sole concern is to maintain its unchallenged
grip on power at the cost of smothering the Chinese people's
fundamental rights and freedoms,'' said Xiao Qiang, executive
director of the New York-based group Human Rights in China.
	   In a symbolic gesture, Wei Jingsheng and other leading
dissidents living in exile said they would stage a 24-hour hunger
strike.
	   Chinese government official contend that the trials are for
criminal acts and have nothing to do with human rights.
	   Qin, 45, and Wang, 32, are among the most prominent dissidents
still active in China. A third leading figure, Xu Wenli, also has
been detained, but not charged.
	   Wang and Qin are the most well-known dissidents China has put on
trial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in 1996. He
was convicted of subversion and served less than two of an 11-year
sentence. In return for his release, he agreed to go into exile.

Ukraine protests strikes on Iraq, demands halt of bombing

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Foreign Ministry on Thursday
condemned American and British airstrikes on Iraq, and said the
United Nations Security Council should intervene to avoid a more
serious military conflict.
	   Demanding that bombing of Iraq halt immediately, the Foreign
Ministry said in a statement that the U.N. Security Council should
``do everything possible'' to prevent further military action,
which could cause ``unpredictable consequences in the region and
the entire world.''
	   The United States and Britain launched air and missile strikes
against Iraq on Wednesday in response to Saddam Hussein's refusal
to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The Foreign Ministry ``considers it necessary to remember that
it is the U.N. Security Council only that is responsible for

	   Foreign Ministry officials also met with the British and U.S.

	   OSRBLIE, Slovakia (AP) _ Germany's powerful foursome led by
Uschi Disl and Martina Zellner won the first women's relay
competition in this season's biathlon World Cup series Thursday.
	   Zellner ran the anchor leg and secured Germany's victory over
Belarus and Russia in the 4x7.5-kilometer relay.
	   Germany won the relay gold medal at the Nagano Olympics in
February. Zellner is the new member of the foursome but she had a
blistering last leg, stretching an 11-second lead into a final
winning margin of three minutes, 12.3 seconds over Belarus.
	   Disl, winner of the last two individual races, had earned a slim
2.1-second lead for Germany after the first leg, after having to
reload three times on the shooting range.
	   The Germans finished with no penalty laps in one hour, 26
minutes, 50.8 seconds.
	   Russia was third, just 0.5 seconds behind Belarus and 3:12.8
behind Germany. While Belarus had no penalty laps, Russia had
three, all by anchor Albina Achatova.

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Thousands of people rallied in central
Grozny on Thursday in support of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov,
who has promised to clamp down on crime in the breakaway republic.
	   The gathering adopted a resolution that called for broader
powers for Maskhadov, and urged him to crack down on rebel warlords
and suspected kidnappers. Protesters shouted for an end to the
crime wave.
	   Maskhadov imposed a one-month state of emergency Tuesday to try
to end rampant crime and kidnappings in Chechnya. He called for
people to turn out at the rally Thursday to support his decision.
	   Hundreds of people have been taken hostage in Chechnya since the
end of a 1994-96 war with Russia. In an unusually gruesome display
of lawlessness, four Western captives were beheaded last week.
	   The hostages _ three Britons and a New Zealander _ had been in
Chechnya to install a cellular phone system. They were kidnapped
Oct. 3 and their heads were found after a rescue attempt apparently
went wrong.
	   Maskhadov blamed the leader of a prominent group of Chechen
Islamic militants for the attack and for many of the other
kidnappings that have hit the region.
	   The group, the Islamic Jamaats or Warriors of Islam, has denied
any connection with the killings, and threatened to launch attacks
on Russia if authorities clamp down on their operations, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Thursday.
	   In a statement made on Chechen television Wednesday night, group
leaders threatened to attack Russian sites outside Chechnya if
Maskhadov tries to fight them, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   The group does not want to fight within Chechnya because it
refuses to ``spill the blood of Moslem brothers'' or play into the
hands of Russia's secret services and enemies of Chechen
independence, ITAR-Tass said, citing remarks made during the
address.
	   The group is holed up in Chechnya's second largest city,
Urus-Martan. Fighters, led by warlord Arbi Barayev, have dug
trenches around the town and say they are ready for war.
	   The resolution adopted at the rally in Grozny specifically
called for Maskhadov to disperse the armed groups in Urus-Martan
and bring the city under government control, Interfax said.
	   Maskhadov won Chechnya's presidential elections almost two years
ago by an overwhelming margin, and still retains widespread support
among many Chechens despite his failure to restore stability in the
region.

Britain's highest court nullifies decision on Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with order to judges from judiciary chief,
reaction from Amnesty and Chile, other background; trims pvs &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's highest court on Thursday set aside its
decision that Gen. Augusto Pinochet has no immunity from arrest and
ordered a new hearing because of a judge's ties with the human
rights group Amnesty International.
	   The unprecedented decision by the House of Lords to overturn its
own ruling means that a panel of judges will re-hear next month the
former Chilean dictator's claim to immunity under British law.
	   It also marks a setback in Spain's efforts to extradite the
83-year-old general to face charges of murder and torture.
	   ``I am satisfied that the earlier decision of this house cannot
stand and must be set aside,'' Lord Justice Nicolas
Browne-Wilkinson said, announcing the unanimous decision of a
second five-judge tribunal.
	   Underlining the legal debacle, the head of the judiciary, Lord
Irvine, said the law lords should in future ensure that judges
disclose any apparent conflict of interest before a case, and
withdraw if the other judges uphold objections by the parties
involved.
	   ``We must make every effort to ensure that such a state of
affairs could not occur again,'' Irvine, the Lord Chancellor, said
in a letter to Browne-Wilkinson.
	   Pinochet, who was arrested Oct. 16 while recovering from back
surgery, cannot leave the country and remains under police guard at
a rented mansion 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of London.
	   Citing the maxim that justice must not only be done but seen to
be done, the general's lawyers complained during a two-day hearing
this week that Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann _ one of the majority
judges in the Lords' 3-2 ruling Nov. 25 against Pinochet _ is the
director of Amnesty's fundraising arm.
	   In addition, Hoffmann's wife, Gillian, has worked since 1977 at
the group's London headquarters.
	   Browne-Wilkinson noted ``these facts had not been disclosed to
the parties'' and said Hoffmann should have withdrawn.
	   Amnesty has been a prime mover in a campaign to have Pinochet
brought to trial for murder, torture and other gross human rights
abuses committed by his secret police during his 1973-90 rule after
he overthrew an elected Marxist.
	   The human rights group, which has insisted the Hoffmanns played
no part in the Pinochet campaign, said it was disappointed about
``having to come back and do it all over again.''
	   ``(But) our view has always been that everyone has their right
to a fair trial, one that is also seen to be fair,'' Amnesty
chairman Andy McEntee said. ``Augusto Pinochet has very inventive
lawyers. ... They will make this a long case, one that is hard for
him to lose.''
	   In Chile, the government indicated it wants to intervene at the
new hearing on the basis that Pinochet should be freed because he
could be tried in Chile _ rather than claiming he has immunity from
prosecution.
	   Pinochet, however, has immunity from prosecution in Chile as a
senator-for-life and under laws he instigated in office.
	   ``We will not claim a legitimacy to commit crimes, but will say
which court we think is the one that has jurisdiction to try this
case,'' Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said.
	   Said Chilean House Speaker Gutenberg Martinez, ``This is
starting to look like a legal or judicial soap opera.''
	   Pinochet was due to start fighting next month the Spanish
extradition warrant at a London magistrate's court. But that move
likely will be on hold because of the new Lords hearing.
	   An official Chilean report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of his secret police.
	   Pinochet's complaint marked the first time since 1823 that the
House of Lords has been asked to sit in judgment of itself. The
previous challenge, involving a land ownership case, failed,
according to one news report.

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with resolution passed at rally new graf 2 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Thousands of people rallied in central
Grozny on Thursday in support of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov,
who has promised to clamp down on crime in the breakaway republic.
	   The gathering adopted a resolution that called for broader
powers for Maskhadov, and urged him to crack down on rebel warlords
and suspected kidnappers. Protesters shouted for an end to the
crime wave.
	   Maskhadov imposed a one-month state of emergency Tuesday to try
to end rampant crime and kidnappings in Chechnya. He called for
people to turn out at the rally Thursday to support his decision.
	   Hundreds of people have been taken hostage in Chechnya since the
end of a 1994-96 war with Russia. In an unusually gruesome display
of lawlessness, four Western captives were beheaded last week.
	   The hostages _ three Britons and a New Zealander _ had been in
Chechnya to install a cellular phone system. They were kidnapped
Oct. 3 and their heads were found after a rescue attempt apparently
went wrong.
	   Maskhadov blamed the leader of a prominent group of Chechen
Islamic militants for the attack and for many of the other
kidnappings that have hit the region.
	   The group, the Islamic Jamaats or Warriors of Islam, has denied
any connection with the killings, and threatened to launch attacks

ITAR-Tass news agency reported Thursday.
	   In a statement made on Chechen television Wednesday night, group

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot squads fired warning shots and
tear gas when thousands of student demonstrators demanding
democratic reform tried to storm the Parliament on Thursday.
	   Many of the more than 4,000 protesters threw rocks, bottles and
gasoline bombs at police and troops who beat them back with clubs.
	   Some heavily bleeding students were carried to safety by their
friends through clouds of tear gas. Paramedics applied first aid on
the street.
	   Students fought back with sticks and some soldiers hurled rocks
at protesters.
	   Officials at two nearby hospitals said at least 45 students were
injured. Most were beaten or overcome by gas.
	   The military said one soldier and one police officer were
seriously injured.
	   It was the second straight day that students have clashed with
security forces in the Indonesian capital. And, it was the worst
violence seen since Nov. 13 when 14 people died after troops fired
upon students who also tried to march on Parliament.
	   One student leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the demonstrators would protest again on Friday.
	   Hours before Thursday's street battle, President B.J. Habibie
warned his country might break up if anti-government protests
escalated.
	   ``If the protests are not controlled it can lead to the
disintegration of the nation,'' Habibie said at a graduation
ceremony of new army officers.
	   For weeks, students have taken to the streets demanding that
Habibie force the military out of politics and put his autocratic
predecessor, ex-President Suharto, on trial for corruption.
	   Habibie has promised to open up the tightly controlled political
system and to hold elections next year. But the students are not
satisfied with the pace and scope of his reforms.
	   On Wednesday police also fired tear gas and swung batons to
disperse hundreds of rock-throwing protesters at the Defense
Ministry, not far from the presidential palace.
	   Religious groups have called on the students to end their
protest campaign during the forthcoming holy Islamic month of
Ramadan, which starts on Sunday.
	   As night fell Thursday, hundreds of military reinforcements
arrived at the Parliament and students lit bonfires on a toll road
before dispersing.
	   Soldiers ordered reporters and news crews to leave the scene.
	   Angry students pulled down and set fire to tents set up by the
troops near the legislature. They also burned a portrait of
Suharto.
	   The students had converged on the heavily guarded legislature in
two groups.
	   They marched to the Parliament demanding political reform and
the release of some activists arrested by police during other
protests this week.
	   Outnumbered soldiers and police retreated briefly after the
students tried to run into the parliamentary grounds.
	   The protesters were repelled and scattered when officers
responded with warning shots and tear gas.
	   Also on Thursday, dozens of riot police and troops peacefully
blocked about 100 students about 100 meters (yards) in front of the
presidential palace.
	   Habibie, who has promised democratic reform after decades of
authoritarian rule, said that freedom of expression that allows
protests is now guaranteed under Indonesian law.
	   ``But in carrying out these rights people must also respect
other people's rights,'' he said.
	   Indonesia, with 202 million people, is the world's fourth most
populous country. It has more than 300 ethnic groups spread over
about 17,000 islands.
	   Student protests and deadly riots last May also forced Suharto
to quit after 32 years in power. At that time students occupied the
parliament building for several days.
	   Anger at Habibie's seven-month old government has been sharpened
by a continuing economic crisis, which has resulted in soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and rising poverty.
	   Sporadic rioting and looting has hit some parts of the country.
There has also been violence among the Muslim majority and the
Christian minority with dozens of mosques and churches set afire or
ransacked.

Indian naval officer brings boxing gold after 16-year drought

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A 20-year-old navy officer, who almost
was left off India's Asian Games boxing team because of squabbling
among officials, won a gold medal Thursday when his Uzbekistan
opponent threw in the towel.
	   Dingko Singh's victory provided India's first boxing gold in any
class in 16 years. The last Indian to win an Asian Games gold was
Kohhar Singh in the 1982 games in New Delhi.
	   ``I have fulfilled half of my dream today,'' light featherweight
Singh said after Uzbek officials threw in the towel, accepting
defeat for their fighter Timur Tulyakov at the beginning of the
fifth and final round. Tulyakov had no visible sign of injury, but
was seen holding his right arm, signifying injury.
	   The other half of the dream is the 2000 Olympics.
	   ``I have age in my favor and I am going to practice hard to win
a medal for India at the Olympics,'' said Singh, who comes from the
remote northeastern state of Manipur.
	   With no Indian spectators among the 20,000 Thai supporters, a
group of Indian journalists played the role of cheer group,
shouting in Hindi: ``Maro, maro, jor se maro,'' or ``Hit, hit, hit
hard.'' Cheer group leader Harpal Singh Bedi of the United News of
India held an Indian flag. By the end of the flight, all had lost
their voices.
	   ``At the end of the fourth round, Dingko had 12 punches and was
a clear favorite,'' said Indian boxing coach Gurubax Singh Sandhu.
``Probably the Uzbek officials realized that there was no point in
going for the fifth round.''
	   Singh and Tulyakov were even in the first round. But in the
second, Singh went on the offensive and landed at least four
punches. In the fourth, a left hook shook Tulyakov. His arm may
have been hurt later in that round when he shielded his face with
his hands against a strong punch.
	   Singh, fourth in a family of three sisters and one brother,
declined to comment on the controversy over his exclusion from the
original Indian contingent.
	   The Indian Olympics Association, which has many political
appointees, had ignored Singh. But he was included at the last
moment at the insistence of the Boxing Federation of India.

Serb police reportedly make arrests, kill two KLA in Kosovo sweep

 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, UPDATES with Russian defense minister
meeting Milosevic in ultimate graf.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police launched a sweep
operation Thursday in the area where six young Kosovo Serbs were
killed this week, arresting 11 people and killing two ethnic
Albanian rebels in an ensuing firefight, police said.
	   International peace verifiers confirmed police were cracking
down on a rebel Albanian stronghold near Pec in western Kosovo
where gunfire and mortar fire could be heard, said a U.S.
diplomatic official on condition of anonymity.
	   The crackdown took place Thursday morning in an outlying
district of Pec and in the nearby village of Glodjane _ a suspected
stronghold of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army _ the Serb-run Media
Center in Pristina reported, citing police sources.
	   After officers conducting the search for suspects came under
fire, the report said, police killed two people wearing camouflage
uniforms bearing the KLA insignia and armed with assault rifles and
mortars. They were said to have arrested 11 people and discovered
large quantities of arms, ammunition and KLA uniforms.
	   A police source who asked to remain unidentified confirmed
fighting was going on.
	   The international Kosovo Verification Mission sent several teams
to the area, and American and other officials were holding talks
with Serbian police.
	   ``We hope that the presence of the KVM patrols will encourage
restraint on both sides and contribute to calming down the
situation,'' the diplomatic source said.
	   Monday's brutal shootings of the Serbs, shot dead by masked
assailants who sprayed a barroom with automatic weapons fire,
further inflamed tensions in the province and prompted reports of
harassment against ethnic Albanians.
	   The political representative of the KLA, which is fighting to
drive Serb police out of Kosovo and break the province away from
Serbia, has denied rebel involvement in Monday's attack.
	   But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this week to arrest
the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   The state-run Borba daily called Thursday, in a sharply worded
commentary, for the withdrawal of international verifiers and U.S.
envoys from Kosovo, saying they are ``direct instigators and
helpers of the crimes committed by Albanian terrorists.''
	   ``Those people should go, and relieve us of their help. They
should return to their homes and defend them against terrorists,
separatists, and rapists.''
	   Serbs held a protest rally against the killings for a second
straight day Thursday, this time in front of the headquarters of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs
the verifying force.
	   On Wednesday, a policeman enroute to the emotional funeral
service for the six victims reportedly shot and killed a suspected
rebel in the latest in a wave of violence that has taken dozens of
lives since an October truce.
	   Some ethnic Albanians elsewhere complained of harassment
connected to the killings, including schoolchildren being beaten by
Serb civilians and broken Albanian shop windows.
	   The killings cast further gloom over stalled diplomatic efforts
to resolve the Serb-Albanian standoff in Kosovo, where more than
1,000 people have been killed since Milosevic began a crackdown on
separatists in February.
	   Serbian authorities say they are willing to grant only limited
autonomy for Kosovo, while most of the overwhelmingly
Albanian-populated province want independence from Serbia _ the
dominant republic remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   In Belgrade, Thursday Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev met
Milosevic as the Yugoslav President apparently sought allies and
military help in his campaign against the Kosovo Albanian
separatists.

Angolan rebels vow to keep fighting

 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The UNITA rebels said Thursday they would
maintain their offensive in Bie province and would bring up more
firepower to crack the government army's hold on the central
highland province's capital Kuito.
	   ``The military pressure on Kuito/Bie will continue,'' the UNITA
leadership said in a written statement faxed to The Associated
Press.
	   The rebel forces ``will improve their organization and increase
their firepower'' for new attacks against the besieged city, the
statement said.
	   Battles have focused on Bie since fighting between the
government and rebels restarted Dec. 4, ending a four-year peace
pact in the southwest African country.
	   Kuito reportedly was quiet Thursday. Local radio station Eclesia
reported that the army was strengthening its defensive positions
and was preparing to receive supplies dropped by parachute.
	   Planes cannot land because of anti-aircraft fire from rebels
surrounding the city.
	   The army said it had captured seven rebel tanks during battles
for Kuito and had killed white mercenaries and Congolese rebels
fighting on the rebel side.
	   Brig. Simione Mucume said in an interview published Thursday in
state-controlled daily Jornal de Angola that there were 200 rebel
casualties in a 12-hour battle on Wednesday outside Kuito, which
lies 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the capital, Luanda.
	   Unconfirmed reports said UNITA earlier this year bought up to 50
Ukrainian tanks via Uganda, a longtime UNITA ally. Angola's rebels,
along with Uganda, reportedly are aiding the insurgency in
neighboring Congo, where the Angolan army is fighting on the side
of President Laurent Kabila.
	   Also, the government of the Republic of Congo, north of Angola,
has said UNITA is supporting outlawed militia groups in fighting
there. The Angolan army has about 400 troops in the Republic of
Congo to support President Denis Sassou-Nguesso.
	   Western diplomats said UNITA apparently was seeking to spur
rebel military activity in those two countries so as to prevent the
return of Angolan army troops stationed there.
	   The Angolan government has accused UNITA of employing
mercenaries from Ukraine, Serbia, Israel and South Africa who are
used to help operate the tanks and sophisticated weaponry the
rebels have bought over the past year with revenue from their
illegal diamond operations in Angola.
	   The UNITA statement said that due to ``an error of
coordination,'' rebel forces strayed into a minefield Wednesday in
Bie province.
	   Ten rebel soldiers, including Lt. Col. Joao Chiwisi, were killed
and 25 were wounded by mines which also destroyed three rebel
military vehicles and artillery.
	   The statement also claimed that between Dec. 5 and 16 rebel
forces shot down five government jet fighters and knocked out five
tanks and 20 assault vehicles.
	   Neither side has acknowledged the collapse of the United
Nations-brokered 1994 peace agreement designed to end a two-decade
civil war that broke out after independence in 1975.
	   The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement
collapsed a year later after UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ refused to
accept its defeat in the country's first elections.

 &UR; Russian defense minister meets Milosevic

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev met Slobodan Milosevic Thursday as the Yugoslav President
apparently sought allies and military help in his campaign against
Kosovo's Albanian separatists.
	   During the talks, the two indirectly criticized U.S. and British
airstrikes against Iraq, saying in a statement that ``the respect
of ... sovereignty and integrity should prevail over the acts which
are jeopardizing basic international principles and norms.''
	   Those acts ``have far-reaching consequences for peace, stability
and cooperation in the world,'' the statement from Milosevic's
office said.
	   It added that Milosevic and Sergeyev called for a peaceful
solution of the Kosovo crisis, ``which excludes any existence of
terrorism, as well as the support for separatism'' in the troubled
Serbian province.
	   Milosevic and his officials regularly accuse the United States
and other Western envoys active in the region of supporting ethnic
Albanian ``terrorists and separatists'' who want to secede Kosovo
from the dominant Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   Despite an international arms embargo stemming from the Kosovo
crisis, Yugoslavia has been seeking Russian political and military
aid to combat ethnic Albanians fighting to secede the province,
Yugoslav military sources said.
	   Since February, more than 1,000 people have been killed and up
to 300,000 others forced from their homes in the southern Serb
province.
	   Sergeyev arrived in Belgrade late Wednesday after visiting
Russian peace-keeping troops serving in neighboring Bosnia. He was
accompanied by several Russian generals and military experts.

Germany's 100 words of the century include many in English
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Need more evidence of how English is conquering
the world? Look at a new list compiled by German intellectuals of
the 100 words that best reflect the 20th century.
	   AIDS, Beat, Bikini, Camping, Comics, Computer, Design ...
Holocaust, Image, Jeans, Pop ... Single, Sex, Star and Stress _
just some of the English words and ideas that have wiggled their
way into German over the past 100 years.
	   The head of the Society for the German Language, one of the
sponsors of the project, said the preponderance of anglicisms on
the list released this week didn't surprise her.
	   ``I think that language is also a mirror of the history and
these words reflect that,'' Karin Frank-Cyrus said in a telephone
interview Thursday.
	   The 20th century has been dominated by the United States, and
hence most of the foreign words on the list are English. By
contrast, she said, the Russians have only a couple entries,
Perestroika and Sputnik. Both sides can claim Molotov cocktail.
	   Unlike the fastidious French, who are constantly waging
campaigns to protect the purity of their language, Germans adopt
foreign words _ especially English _ easily.
	   Sometimes they get a little Germanified, as seen on the list
with words like ``Globalisierung'' for globalization or
``Demokratisierung'' for democratization.
	   Sometimes the Germans get so carried away they make up
English-sounding words that leave native speakers wondering what
they're talking about, like calling a mobile phone a ``Handy.''
	   Frank-Cyrus said her society, charged with caring for the German
language, has nothing against foreign words, but is worried about
the current flood.
	   ``The English language has become a lingua franca, a language
that the whole world understands,'' she says. ``And that I think is
very good and makes sense. But this language-mixing, that's not
always necessary.''
	   While there's no good German word for recycling, she said, a
computer could be called a Rechner. ``And why not, when it's so
easy?''
	   Of course, there's no shortage of purely German entries on the
list, some that even English speakers can understand: Autobahn,
Fuehrer, Panzer and U-Boot.
	   A seven-member jury of journalists, professors and writers
winnowed it down from 811 suggestions, choosing those words they
felt best outline and describe the past 100 years.
	   Along with the language society, the project was sponsored by
3Sat public television, Suhrkamp publishers, Deutschland Radio and
the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.

Acquitted Mikhailov asked for asylum before deportation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Laywers for Sergei Mikhailov, allegedly a leader
of the Russian mafia, have asked Switzerland to grant him asylum,
it was reported Thursday.
	   The application, made to prevent Mikhailov's deportation,
arrived too late but is still pending and means that in theory
Mikhailov could return to Switzerland as an asylum seeker.
	   However, he really wants to go to Hungary, his lawyer Alec
Reymond was quoted as saying in the daily Tribune de Geneve.
	   Swiss authorities deported Mikhailov, 40, to Russia last
Saturday, hours after a jury at Geneva Correctional Court cleared
him of charges he was a member of a criminal organization.
	   Geneva prosecutors maintained that Mikhailov, who was held in
custody for more than two years, was a leader of the Solntsevskaya
mafia organization, based in Moscow.
	   Reymond said he and other lawyers for Mikhailov filed the asylum
application in the hours after the trial when they became alarmed
that they were unable to see their client.
	   Police said they sent him back to Russia because his passport
had expired and he had no other valid identity papers.
	   Mikhailov feared for his life in Russia, Reymond said.
	   The lawyers made the request for asylum as a last resort to keep
him in the country until he could obtain a passport, Reymond added.
	   Police spokesman Pascal di Camillo told the newspaper that the
notice of the asylum application arrived at the airport before the
plane took off.
	   But he said officers needed a reply from the federal office of
refugees before they could take Mikhailov off the plane.
	   During the two-week trial, the jury heard evidence that the
mafia organization operated ``combat brigades'' specializing in
assassination and ran extortion and drugs operations.
	   Mikhailov denied all the charges, claiming that he was an
ordinary businessman.

Iraq attack could delay ratification of START II treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS new 5th graf with legislator predicting START II shelved

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The U.S. and British attack on Iraq could derail
hopes that Russia's parliament will approve the long-delayed START
II nuclear reduction treaty, officials said Thursday.
	   Officials of President Boris Yeltsin's administration and the
parliament showed unusual unanimity in agreeing that the treaty to
cut U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals stands little hope of swift
approval.
	   The START II treaty would halve the Russian and American nuclear
arsenals to about 3,000 to 3,500 warheads each.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, head of the largest faction
in the Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, said there was no
point in discussing ratification. Instead, he said, Russia should
increase its defense budget.
	   Valentin Kuptsov, a Communist leader in the Duma, predicted
discussion on approving the treaty would be shelved for at least
six months.
	   Alexander Shokhin, head of the moderate Our Home is Russia
faction in the Duma, said it was unlikely the chamber would
consider ratification anytime soon.
	   ``We could raise the question of the treaty in January, but now
the prospects of its discussion are becoming increasingly
obscure,'' he said.
	   Russia's Communist-led parliament has repeatedly delayed action
on the START II treaty, signed by the United States and Russia in
1993. But there had been increasing hopes in recent months that the
treaty would be approve.

<SLUG> Argentine says he'll be with Fiorentina until 2003 </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta has announced he will stay with
Italian League leader Fiorentina through 2003.
	   ``Italy's is the most important league in the world,'' the
Argentine star told reporters Wednesday night, ``and I really enjoy
playing in Florence.''
	   Batistuta leads Serie A with 13 goals in 13 games, putting him
on pace to break the single-season record of 33 goals. He also
could become the fifth player in the last 20 years to top the
scoring chart while playing for a title winner.
	   ``I really think we can win the championship,'' said Batistuta,
in his eighth season with Fiorentina.
	   The 29-year-old has come close to leaving in recent years, with
his biggest complaint being the club's failure to compete for a
league crown.
	   But with legendary coach Giovanni Trapattoni helping turn things
around this season, Fiorentina (9-1-3) sits alone atop the Serie A
standings for the first time since 1982.

Vatican expresses dismay over Ango-American attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican expressed its dismay Thursday
over the Anglo-American airstrikes on Iraq.
	   It said it fully agreed with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
that it was ``a sad day for the United Nations and for the world.''
	   ``The Holy See hopes that this aggression ends as soon as
possible and that international order is restored,'' said spokesman
Joaquin-Navarro Valls.
	   Pope John Paul II, who had spoken out against the 1991 Gulf War,
referred to the latest hostilities in what sources said was a
last-minute insertion in a speech to a group of ambassadors
Thursday.
	   ``Peace is again threatened in the Middle East. Reconciliation
based on dialogue, justice and the right of every people to live in
security is more than ever urgent,'' John Paul said.
	   He said the international community is responsible for favoring
peaceful solutions that prevent the loss of innocent lives.

ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Parliament dealt a severe
blow to the European Union's Commission on Thursday by rejecting
its 1996 accounts amid allegations of fraud and spending
irregularities.
	   A total 270 members of the 518 parliamentians present voted to
withhold approval of the 1996 budget; 225 voted in favor of
approving the budget and 23 abstained.
	   ``It's very clear the vote was a loss for the Commission,'' the
EU's Budget Commissioner Erkki Liikanen told a news conference in
Strasbourg, France, where the 626-legislature is meeting. But, he
added, the Parliament ``has not asked the Commission to resign, and
the Commission has no intention of resigning,'' he added.
	   The vote has no direct impact on the Commission's day-to-day
activities.
	   But Pauline Green, the leader of the Socialist Group, said her
party will call for a motion of censure - in other words, a vote on
the dismissal of the whole Commission. The parliament next meets
again in January. The Socialists are the largest faction in
Parliament and a majority of them favored closing the 1996
accounts.
	   During a heated debate preceding the vote, Green accused
supporters of the rejection of inconsistency, saying if they have
no confidence in the Commission's handling of its funds they should
be consistent and vote for its dismissal.
	   ``I have never heard such hypocritical rubbish,'' she told
colleagues. Green said she called for the motion herself and hopes
the Commission will survive it.
	   Under the EU treaty, the parliament can only fire the entire
20-member EU executive panel, not individual commissioners.
	   James Elles, rapporteur for the Parliament's budget control
committee, told a news conference after the vote he sees no need
for a motion of censure.
	   ``Not to give discharge is a way of putting pressure on the
Commission to carry out reforms,'' said Elles, a member of the
second largest group in Parliament, the European People's Party.
	   Under Parliament procedure, the issue is going back to the
budget control committee which will put it to vote again next
March. The Parliament will also have to look at the Socialists'
call for a motion of censure before then.
	   ``We've never been here before. We will look at rules of
procedure,'' Elles said.
	   The European Union has long been hounded by reports and
allegations of fraud. On Nov. 17, the EU Court of Auditors
estimated fraud and financial irregularities amounted to 5 percent
of the EU's 1997 budget of 83 billion European currency units (dlrs
97 billion) budget.
	   The EU Commission has defended itself against these attacks.
Liikanen argues he has met all demands for tighter financial
controls.
	   Yet many in the parliament deny he has gone far enough to
guarantee regular fraud reports, to keep national justice officials
informed of investigations or to create an independent anti-fraud
office.
	   ``The Commission's proposal to fight fraud did not live up to
our requirements,'' said Diemut Theato, a German member of the EPP.

South Korean scientists claim a step forward in human cloning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Shorter version without outside comment and further detail and
explanation moved to some points in the Dec. 16 news cycle. &QL; 
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean medical team said it
has made an important advance in cloning human cells to create
replacement organs. The development could also serve as a first
step in cloning people.
	   The team said Wednesday that it had replaced the nucleus of a
woman's egg with the nucleus of one of her body cells, transferring
her DNA to the egg.
	   The team then cultivated the egg until it grew into four cells,
an early embryonic stage. The team stopped there because a
resolution adopted by South Korean scientists in 1993 banned taking
the experiment farther.
	   The next step would have been implanting the egg into a woman's
uterus and letting it grow to create stem cells _ primordial cells
from which all of a human's body tissues and organs develop.
Scientists want to use stem cells as raw material for growing
organs for transplant.
	   The South Korean team was headed by Dr. Lee Bo-yeon, a professor
at the fertility clinic of Kyonghee University Hospital in Seoul.
	   American cloning experts said it was the first time they knew of
that human DNA had been transferred from a body cell into a human
egg, with the egg then developing into embryonic cells. Body cells,
as opposed to eggs or sperm, contain the full complement of a
person's DNA.
	   ``It's the first step in the Richard Seed experiment,'' the
highly publicized announcement by a Chicago scientist that he
planned to clone a human, said Randall Prather, an associate
professor of animal science at the University of Missouri at
Columbia.
	   ``They stopped it before they got very far,'' Prather noted.
``They could have just let it go, potentially it could have created
an individual.''
	   He and Mark Westhusin of Texas A and M University said they
didn't know how likely it was that such an experiment could go all
the way to making a person.
	   ``Four cells is a long way from a fetus,'' Westhusin said. It's
no surprise that the experiment would succeed in going at least to
four cells, he said.
	   In initially announcing the results of the research on Tuesday,
Lee said a team of British scientists previously succeeded in a
similar experiment. But he said Wednesday that he may have been
misinformed. Britain has laws banning research into human
reproductive cloning.
	   ``The cloning of human embryos should be encouraged for
scientific research to create replacement hearts and other organs.
It will eventually help human beings,'' Lee said.
	   He said his work needed more research before being reported to
international medical journals. So far, there has been no peer
review of his claims, Lee said.
	   Following the announcement by the South Korean scientists, about
two dozen religious and civic activists held a rally in front of
Kyunghee Hospital, shouting for discontinuation of the ``inhuman
research.''
	   One protest sign read: ``Who am I? I don't want to be a cloned
human being.''
	   The announcement comes as South Korea's Parliament is pushing
legislation banning cloning of human cells except for research on
cancer or other diseases.

Serb police reportedly make arrests, kill two KLA in Kosovo sweep
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, UPDATES with Russian defense minister
meeting Milosevic in ultimate graf.
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police launched a sweep
operation Thursday in the area where six young Kosovo Serbs were
killed this week, arresting 11 people and killing two ethnic
Albanian rebels in an ensuing firefight, police said.
	   International peace verifiers confirmed police were cracking
down on a rebel Albanian stronghold near Pec in western Kosovo
where gunfire and mortar fire could be heard, said a U.S.
diplomatic official on condition of anonymity.
	   The crackdown took place Thursday morning in an outlying
district of Pec and in the nearby village of Glodjane _ a suspected
stronghold of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army _ the Serb-run Media
Center in Pristina reported, citing police sources.
	   After officers conducting the search for suspects came under
fire, the report said, police killed two people wearing camouflage
uniforms bearing the KLA insignia and armed with assault rifles and
mortars. They were said to have arrested 11 people and discovered
large quantities of arms, ammunition and KLA uniforms.
	   A police source who asked to remain unidentified confirmed
fighting was going on.
	   The international Kosovo Verification Mission sent several teams
to the area, and American and other officials were holding talks
with Serbian police.
	   ``We hope that the presence of the KVM patrols will encourage
restraint on both sides and contribute to calming down the
situation,'' the diplomatic source said.
	   Monday's brutal shootings of the Serbs, shot dead by masked
assailants who sprayed a barroom with automatic weapons fire,
further inflamed tensions in the province and prompted reports of
harassment against ethnic Albanians.
	   The political representative of the KLA, which is fighting to
drive Serb police out of Kosovo and break the province away from
Serbia, has denied rebel involvement in Monday's attack.
	   But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this week to arrest
the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   Serbs held a protest rally against the killings for a second
straight day Thursday, this time in front of the headquarters of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs
the verifying force.
	   The killings cast further gloom over stalled diplomatic efforts
to resolve the Serb-Albanian standoff in Kosovo, where more than
1,000 people have been killed since Milosevic began a crackdown on
separatists in February.
	   Serbian authorities say they are willing to grant only limited
autonomy for Kosovo, while most of the overwhelmingly
Albanian-populated province want independence from Serbia _ the

Serb police reportedly make arrests, kill two KLA in Kosovo sweep
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, UPDATES with Russian defense minister
meeting Milosevic in ultimate graf.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police launched a sweep
operation Thursday in the area where six young Kosovo Serbs were
killed this week, arresting 11 people and killing two ethnic
Albanian rebels in an ensuing firefight, police said.
	   International peace verifiers confirmed police were cracking
down on a rebel Albanian stronghold near Pec in western Kosovo
where gunfire and mortar fire could be heard, said a U.S.
diplomatic official on condition of anonymity.
	   The crackdown took place Thursday morning in an outlying
district of Pec and in the nearby village of Glodjane _ a suspected
stronghold of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army _ the Serb-run Media
Center in Pristina reported, citing police sources.
	   After officers conducting the search for suspects came under
fire, the report said, police killed two people wearing camouflage
uniforms bearing the KLA insignia and armed with assault rifles and
mortars. They were said to have arrested 11 people and discovered
large quantities of arms, ammunition and KLA uniforms.
	   A police source who asked to remain unidentified confirmed
fighting was going on.
	   The international Kosovo Verification Mission sent several teams
to the area, and American and other officials were holding talks
with Serbian police.
	   ``We hope that the presence of the KVM patrols will encourage
restraint on both sides and contribute to calming down the
situation,'' the diplomatic source said.
	   Monday's brutal shootings of the Serbs, shot dead by masked
assailants who sprayed a barroom with automatic weapons fire,
further inflamed tensions in the province and prompted reports of
harassment against ethnic Albanians.
	   The political representative of the KLA, which is fighting to
drive Serb police out of Kosovo and break the province away from
Serbia, has denied rebel involvement in Monday's attack.
	   But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this week to arrest
the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   Serbs held a protest rally against the killings for a second
straight day Thursday, this time in front of the headquarters of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs
the verifying force.
	   The killings cast further gloom over stalled diplomatic efforts
to resolve the Serb-Albanian standoff in Kosovo, where more than
1,000 people have been killed since Milosevic began a crackdown on
separatists in February.
	   Serbian authorities say they are willing to grant only limited
autonomy for Kosovo, while most of the overwhelmingly
Albanian-populated province want independence from Serbia _ the
dominant republic remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   In Belgrade, Thursday Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev met
Milosevic as the Yugoslav President apparently sought allies and
military help in his campaign against the Kosovo Albanian
separatists.

Kosovo Albanians protest failure to identify border clash victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An ethnic Albanian human rights
organization protested to international verifiers Thursday for
failing to identify the bodies of 36 people killed in a border
clash Monday.
	   The bodies, which both the Yugoslav army and international peace
monitors have said are those of Kosovo Albanian rebel fighters
attempting to smuggle arms into the country from Albania, remained
in the morgue in the southwestern town of Prizren Thursday.
	   ``For three days we've been waiting for the names now, and we
are handing over a protest to the chief of the verifiers,'' said
Masar Shala of the Prizren-based Committee for the Protection of
Human Rights and Freedoms.
	   ``The authorities wanted to silence this case so as not to
inflame passions,'' he said. ``The cease-fire doesn't exist any
more.''
	   He said four Albanians were arrested in Prizren on Wednesday.
	   ``It's very irritating, and we are asking what's the point of
the verifiers being here if systematic violence and ongoing
repression forces the youths to take up arms,'' Shala said.
	   A senior police source who asked to remain unidentified said 14
of the bodies had been identified through fingerprinting. He said
the bodies would be released after all were identified.
	   Weapons in sufficient quantity to arm 200 people were
confiscated, he said, including sniper rifles, rocket-propelled
grenade launchers and anti-aircraft weapons.

Food outlook in Africa improved, U.N. agency says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The food outlook for
sub-Saharan Africa has improved with recent bumper crops, but 13
countries face emergencies, the U.N. food agency said Thursday.
	   In Somalia, Sudan, Congo and Angola, war and civil unrest
continue to disrupt food supplies, the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization said.
	   The agency singled out Somalia, where a major food crisis is
developing for 700,000 people following five reduced harvests
caused by drought, civil strife, floods and pests.
	   Somalia has lacked a central government since the ouster of
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Rival clan-based militia have
since divided the country into armed fiefdoms.
	   ``In Angola, despite an improvement in production, the food
supply situation is expected to tighten in the coming months ...
reflecting the volatile security situation,'' the statement said.
	   The rebel UNITA army has stepped up attacks on Angolan
government areas.
	   Throughout Africa, food production has improved with above-
average harvests, particularly in western Africa, the agency said.
	   But in Congo, the former Zaire, civil war that now involves at
least five other countries and large-scale population movements
have hampered farming activities.
	   Military activity during the growing season also disrupted food
production in Sudan, the agency said.
	   Nine other countries facing exceptional food shortages are
Zambia, Burundi, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania,
Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Uganda.
	   The agency will release a full report on the situation on
Monday.

Chilean government will support Pinochet in new hearing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The Chilean government said Thursday it
will support Gen. Augusto Pinochet in the new hearing he won
Thursday from the British House of Lords in his efforts to fight
extradition to Spain.
	   But, Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said, the government
will not claim that Pinochet has full immunity for his acts as a
chief of state, as his lawyers insisted during the first trial.
	   At that time, the Lords voted 3-2 against Pinochet, saying that
Spain could try to extradite him for trial on genocide and torture
charges.
	   ``We didn't like'' that strategy, Insulza said. ``We will not
claim a legitimacy to commit crimes, but will say which court we
think is the one that has jurisdiction to try this case.''
	   The government has denied the jurisdiction of any foreign court
to try a Chilean citizen for crimes committed in Chile.
	   On Thursday, the House of Lords set aside its Nov. 25 ruling
that Pinochet has no immunity from arrest and granted him a new
hearing because one of the voting lords, Leonard Hoffman, has ties
to Amnesty International, the human rights group.
	   The unprecedented decision means that the 83-year-old former
dictator will have a new hearing next month before a different
panel of judges.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London while recovering from
back surgery on a warrant from Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, who
charged him with genocide and torture.
	   According to an official report by the civilian government that
succeeded Pinochet's in 1990, more than 3,000 people were killed or
disappeared during his dictatorship.
	   Insulza refused to elaborate on the possibility of Pinochet
getting a different ruling from the Lords, because ``this entire
case has been full of surprises, beginning with the arrest
itself.''
	   The Speaker of the House, Gutenberg Martinez, said, ``This is
starting to look like a legal or judicial soap opera. But the
ruling appears reasonable. The lord should have excluded himself.
	   ``The most important thing now would for this situation to end
once and for all, within a framework of respect for international
law, so we can recover normalcy and tranquility in our country.''
	   Speaking from Madrid, the second leg of a European tour to
explain Chile's position, Senate President Andres Zaldivar said the
new ruling ``may open the door for a way out of this crisis.''
	   At the Pinochet Foundation, a private group of Pinochet
loyalists, the news triggered ``a wave of optimism and renewed
faith,'' said its director, retired Gen. Luyis Cortes. ``This is a
great step forward in the difficult road.''
	   Cortes phoned Pinochet's house in London and was told that ``the
general was extremely happy, sharing the moment with his wife and a
number of visitors.''

American and British defense secretaries skip NATO meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh details on Kosovo, Bosnia, TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
and his British counterpart skipped the NATO defense ministers
meeting Thursday in favor of staying at home and dealing with the
airstrikes on Iraq.
	   As the alliance's defense chiefs gathered for their two-day,
year-end meeting, the United States and Britain continued their
missile assault on Iraq, attacks that began early Thursday in
response to President Saddam Hussein's defiance of U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who was scheduled to be
at NATO headquarters on Friday for a meeting of the Russia-NATO
Permanent Joint Council, abruptly canceled his trip on orders from
President Boris Yeltsin, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``The German government has clearly said that we politically
support the approach of the United States,'' German Defense
Minister Rudolf Scharping said on arrival at NATO headquarters.
	   ``We think that Saddam Hussein has to comply fully with the U.N.
Security Council resolution. He didn't do that. That's why he is
fully responsible for the military actions, which are necessary.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana also blamed Saddam Hussein,
but in his statement did not mention the attacks. He said all
efforts by the United Nations over the past several months have
been unsuccessful.
	   ``He alone is responsible for the grave situation and for the
consequences that his defiance of the will of the international
community has entailed,'' Solana said.
	   Portuguese Defense Minister Jose Veiga Simao agreed.
	   ``I have full confidence in the judgment of our British and
American colleagues,'' Veiga Simao said.
	   Spain's Eduardo Serra Rexach said the bombing of Iraq was
``inevitable.''
	   ``Spain deeply deplores that use of force, but the Spanish
government has always chosen solidarity with the allies,'' he said.
	   Poland, which will become a member of NATO next year, also
expressed solidarity with the United States and Britain.
	   ``We deplore the fact that a peaceful solution was not
possible,'' said Polish Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz. ``As
for as American action is concerned, we fully understand the
reasons that led to this decision. We fully support this action.''
	   NATO officials were at pains to point out, however, that ``Iraq
is not a NATO responsibility'' even if NATO members are involved.
	   The ministers here expressed their deep concern at the rising
violence in Kosovo and the slow pace of peace efforts in Bosnia.
	   American-mediated negotiations in Kosovo, the poor southern
province of Serbia _ the dominant republic of Yugoslavia _ have
failed to bring Serbs and ethnic Albanians anywhere near an
agreement. More than three dozen deaths in the province this week
has taken ethnic tensions to new heights.
	   Those tensions were compounded by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's assertion that use of a special NATO extraction force
to pull civilian peace monitors out of Kosovo in emergency
conditions would be an act of aggression.
	   A NATO official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted the
``growing noncompliance'' by both sides in Kosovo, ``the Albanians
willingness to continue the struggle'' as well as the Serbs' ``very
heavy-handed approach.''
	   NATO is creating a 1,700-man rapid reaction force just across
the Kosovo border in Macedonia, a force the NATO official said ``is
ready to go now.''
	   It was created in the wake of U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke's
Oct. 12 deal with Milosevic to end the fighting between the
government and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking independence in
Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and as many as 300,000 forced
from their homes during fighting this year in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up about 90 percent of a population of 2 million.
	   A senior NATO military officer said Milosevic agreed during
talks to both the creation of the extraction force and to its
planned activities.
	   In Bosnia, they other area where NATO is playing a direct
intervention role, implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace
agreement is going very slowly.
	   ``There is a sense that 1999 is a make or break year in Bosnia
for the Dayton peace agreement,'' the NATO official said. ``In 1999
the degree of impatience is going to be very high.''
	   Ministers approved a ``structural adjustment'' to the
32,000-member that will reduce the force by 10 to 11 percent in the
next few months, the official said.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta has announced he will stay with
Italian League leader Fiorentina through 2003.
	   ``Italy's is the most important league in the world,'' the
Argentine star told reporters Wednesday night, ``and I really enjoy
playing in Florence.''
	   Batistuta leads Serie A with 13 goals in 13 games, putting him
on pace to break the single-season record of 33 goals. He also
could become the fifth player in the last 20 years to top the
scoring chart while playing for a title winner.
	   ``I really think we can win the championship,'' said Batistuta,
in his eighth season with Fiorentina.
	   The 29-year-old has come close to leaving in recent years, with
his biggest complaint being the club's failure to compete for a
league crown.
	   But with legendary coach Giovanni Trapattoni helping turn things
around this season, Fiorentina (9-1-3) sits alone atop the Serie A
standings for the first time since 1982.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot squads fired warning shots and
tear gas when thousands of student demonstrators demanding
democratic reform tried to storm the Parliament on Thursday.
	   Many of the more than 4,000 protesters threw rocks, bottles and
gasoline bombs at police and troops who beat them back with clubs.
	   Some heavily bleeding students were carried to safety by their
friends through clouds of tear gas. Paramedics applied first aid on
the street.
	   Students fought back with sticks and some soldiers hurled rocks
at protesters.
	   Officials at three nearby hospitals said at least 48 students
were injured. Most were beaten or overcome by gas.
	   The military said four security personnel were seriously
injured.
	   It was the second straight day that students have clashed with
security forces in the Indonesian capital. And, it was the worst
violence seen since Nov. 13 when 14 people died after troops fired
upon students who also tried to march on Parliament.
	   One student leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the demonstrators would protest again on Friday.
	   Hours before Thursday's street battle, President B.J. Habibie
warned his country might break up if anti-government protests
escalated.
	   ``If the protests are not controlled it can lead to the
disintegration of the nation,'' Habibie said at a graduation
ceremony of new army officers.
	   For weeks, students have taken to the streets demanding that
Habibie force the military out of politics and put his autocratic
predecessor, ex-President Suharto, on trial for corruption.
	   Habibie has promised to open up the tightly controlled political
system and to hold elections next year. But the students are not
satisfied with the pace and scope of his reforms.
	   On Wednesday police also fired tear gas and swung batons to
disperse hundreds of rock-throwing protesters at the Defense
Ministry, not far from the presidential palace.
	   Religious groups have called on the students to end their
protest campaign during the forthcoming holy Islamic month of
Ramadan, which starts on Sunday.
	   As night fell Thursday, hundreds of military reinforcements
arrived at the Parliament and students lit bonfires on a toll road
before dispersing.
	   Soldiers ordered reporters and news crews to leave the scene.
	   Angry students pulled down and set fire to tents set up by the
troops near the legislature. They also burned a portrait of
Suharto.
	   The students had converged on the heavily guarded legislature in
two groups.
	   They marched to the Parliament demanding political reform and
the release of some activists arrested by police during other
protests this week.
	   Outnumbered soldiers and police retreated briefly after the
students tried to run into the parliamentary grounds.
	   The protesters were repelled and scattered when officers
responded with warning shots and tear gas.
	   Also on Thursday, dozens of riot police and troops peacefully
blocked about 100 students about 100 meters (yards) in front of the
presidential palace.
	   Habibie, who has promised democratic reform after decades of
authoritarian rule, said that freedom of expression that allows
protests is now guaranteed under Indonesian law.
	   ``But in carrying out these rights people must also respect
other people's rights,'' he said.
	   Indonesia, with 202 million people, is the world's fourth most
populous country. It has more than 300 ethnic groups spread over
about 17,000 islands.
	   Student protests and deadly riots last May also forced Suharto
to quit after 32 years in power. At that time students occupied the
parliament building for several days.
	   Anger at Habibie's seven-month old government has been sharpened
by a continuing economic crisis, which has resulted in soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and rising poverty.
	   Sporadic rioting and looting has hit some parts of the country.
There has also been violence among the Muslim majority and the
Christian minority with dozens of mosques and churches set afire or
ransacked.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Kenya Airport Authority has lost land
reserved for expansion of facilities in two popular tourists
destinations on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast to private developers,
news reports said Thursday.
	   Citing Minister Marsden Madoka, The East African Standard and
the Daily Nation said private developers had obtained at least 80
hectares reserved for the Malindi airport and the airstrip at
Ukunda.
	   Madoka, a minister of state in the office of the president, said
the placing of dwellings on the land so close to the runways
constitutes a security threat to aircraft taking off and landing.
	   Madoka told reporters in Malindi after a two-day tour of
aviation facilities at the coast that the KAA had approached the
Commissioner of Land to have the allocations revoked and the
allottees given alternative land.
	   The grabbing of government or public land by well-placed civil
servants and its subsequent resale to private interests is
commonplace in Kenya.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The conductor of a mini-van who was hit by
the bullet fired by a police officer that killed the van's driver
died of his injuries, doctors said.
	   Doctors at Aga Khan Hospital said Henry Musyoka Kavale, 20, died
Wednesday of injuries to the brain.
	   Police Cpl. Gordon Mukhawana Kikete, who allegedly opened fire
on the vehicle because it was obstructing the car in which he was
travelling, was charged Wednesday with the murder of the driver and
unlawfully injuring the conductor.
	   Kavale was still alive when the charge was filed.
	   Kikete, attached to the police guard of President Daniel arap
Moi, shot driver Jamal Rajab, 23, in mouth on Saturday after a
heated argument. The bullet went through Rajab's head and hit
Kavale on the head as he was trying to intervene to save his
driver.
	   The killing provoked other drivers and conductors who went on a
rampage in Nairobi Monday.
	   Meanwhile, Commissioner Duncan Wachira, the head of Kenya's
much-maligned police, has invited Kenyans ``of all walks of life''
to attend day-long celebrations at Nairobi's Uhuru Park Friday to
commemorate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the force by
British colonial authorities.
	   --
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Norway donated 8 million rand
(dlrs 1.4 million) to the South African government for oil and gas
development, officials said Thursday.
	   The Mineral and Energy Affairs Department and Norwegian Embassy
made the announcement. The money will go to the department for a 3
1-2-year project for oil and gas exploration and development, as
well as oil refining, distribution and retailing.
	   --
	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ President Lansana Conte was far ahead of
his opponents in early elections results from the presidential
voting earlier this week, state radio said Thursday.
	   Conte, who first seized power in a 1984 coup, has won 15 of the
18 electoral districts already counted. There are 20 districts
still uncounted.
	   --
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The food outlook for
sub-Saharan Africa has improved with recent bumper crops, but 13
countries face emergencies, the U.N. food agency said Thursday.
	   In Somalia, Sudan, Congo and Angola, war and civil unrest
continue to disrupt food supplies, the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization said.
	   The agency singled out Somalia, where a major food crisis is
developing for 700,000 people following five reduced harvests
caused by drought, civil strife, floods and pests.
	   ``In Angola, despite an improvement in production, the food
supply situation is expected to tighten in the coming months ...
reflecting the volatile security situation,'' the statement said.
	   Throughout Africa, food production has improved with
above-average harvests, particularly in western Africa, the agency
said.
	   But in Congo, the former Zaire, civil war that now involves at
least five other countries and large-scale population movements
have hampered farming activities.
	   Military activity during the growing season also disrupted food
production in Sudan, the agency said.
	   Nine other countries facing exceptional food shortages are
Zambia, Burundi, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania,
Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Uganda.
	   --
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Congolese African music star Kanda
Bongoman was arrested on allegations of dealing in counterfeit
currency, police said.
	   His arrest Tuesday followed a raid by Zimbabwean fraud squad
detectives at his hotel room in downtown Harare.
	   Police said detectives removed ``a substantial amount'' of
foreign currency bills, mainly U.S. dollars, from his hotel and
were testing the bills.
	   The musician, known for his sexually explicit Congolese Kwasa
Kwasa music, was scheduled to appear in court on fraud and currency
charges, said police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena.
	   He was free on bail. No court date was given.
	   Kanda Bongoman has toured Zimbabwe regularly in recent years and
has performed at sell-out concerts in Harare and provincial
centers.

Japan gets first Asian Games badminton gold in 28 years

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kanako Yonekura converted her
giant-killing skills into Asian Games gold Thursday, outsmarting
China's Gong Zhichao to win Japan's first badminton title at the
games in 28 years.
	   Yonekura, ranked just 47th in the world, had downed Chinese
first seed Ye Zhaoying on her way to the final and came from behind
to beat Gong, the No. 2 seed, 1-11, 11-5, 11-6 in the match for the
singles crown.
	   ``I gave everything of myself,'' said the unseeded pony-tailed
22-year-old, who jumped up and down after her win and bowed
politely to her teammates in the stands.
	   China salvaged gold in men's singles, however, when the
fourth-seeded Dong Jiong downed Indonesia's Hendrawan, seeded
third, 17-14, 10-15, 15-8 for his first title of the year. China's
Sun Jun and Malaysia's Yong Hock-Kin, the defeated semifinalists,
shared bronze.
	   China also won women's doubles gold, with Ge Fei and Gu Jun
defeating Indonesians Elysa Nathanael and Deyana Lomban 12-15,
15-9, 15-11. China's Qin Yiyuan and Tang Hetian, and South Korea's
La Kyung-min and Chung Jae-hee won bronze.
	   In mixed doubles, Kim Dong-moon and La Kyung-min, the
second-seeded pair, beat unseeded Lee Dong-soo and Yim Kyung-jin
15-6, 15-8 for gold in an all-South Korean final. China's Zhang Jun
and Qin Yiyuan and the first seeds, Trikus Haryanto and Minarti
Timur of Indonesia, got bronze.
	   Men's doubles went to defending champions Rexy Ronald-Mainaky
and Ricky Achmad-Subagdja, the top-seeded Indonesians, who easily
beat Pramote Teerawiwatana and Siripong Siripool of Thailand 15-5,
15-10. Liu Yong and Yu Jinhao of China and South Korea's Lee
Dong-soo and Yoo Yong-sung won bronze.
	   Yonekura's gold was Japan's first in Asian Games badminton since
1970, when the Chinese weren't competing, Japanese sports officials
said.
	   Yonekura had looked totally outclassed in the first game, and
the score had reached 10-0 in Gong's favor before she was able to
mark a point, earning her a congratulatory round of applause from
the packed crowd.
	   That game convinced Yonekura that she needed to force longer
rallies to give the quick-footed Gong room to make mistakes, she
said. The strategy appeared to work: having made just seven errors
in the first game, Gong made 18 in the second and a fatal 19 in the
third. Yonekura, in contrast, made just eight in that deciding last
game.
	   Yonekura also said that Gong, listed 4th in new world rankings
published Tuesday, appeared to be laboring under the strain of
being the favorite.
	   ``I was much more relaxed than the other girl because she was
under pressure to win for China,'' Yonekura said.
	   Lee Joo-Hyun of South Korea and Thailand's Sujitta
Eakmongkolpaisarn took bronze.
	   Yonekura was aided in her victory by killer drop shots to the
left and right of the court that got more accurate as the hour-long
match wore on. Gong, on the other hand, looked unable to figure a
way through Yonekura's defenses.

U.S. bombards Iraq through the night: 2 killed, 30 injured

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States fired hundreds of
missiles on Iraq Thursday in attacks that lasted through the night,
and Baghdad shook with explosions and anti-aircraft gunfire. Two
people were killed and 30 were wounded, a doctor said.
	   Russia and China called for an immediate halt to the attacks,
but U.S. President Bill Clinton suggested the strikes may continue.
	   The Iraqi capital was calm during the day in contrast to the air
raid sirens and antiaircraft fire that punctuated the night.
	   Government employees went to their offices, and children headed
to school. Morning traffic jams clogged some streets in downtown
Baghdad, although fewer cars were on the streets.
	   Baghdad residents lined up at gas stations to stock up on fuel,
a sign that more attacks were expected.
	   ``We are expecting the worst of Clinton because we have
discovered that he has no humanitarian principles,'' said Riad
Mamdouh al-Samarai, 36, as he stood at one station.
	   The strikes were met with defiance in Iraqi newspapers.
	   ``Iraqis are pulling together to go forward to bury the strikes
of aggression and continue their new crusade to teach the enemy
lessons, which they will never forget,'' al-Qadissiya, a government
newspaper, said in an editorial.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein visited some sites targeted by
U.S. missiles Thursday, including his daughter's house, Baghdad
Radio reported. She was safe, but the house was demolished.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said.
	   Air raid sirens broke the night's silence minutes before a
barrage of anti-aircraft fire lit up the Baghdad sky at 12:49 a.m.
(2149 GMT Wednesday), unleashing thunderous blasts like a fireworks
display and shaking windows of buildings.
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known.
	   Witnesses said another missile landed in the neighborhood of
al-Adil, about two kilometers (one mile) from Abu Ghraib where a
sprawling military camp and radio relay stations are located.
	   Neither of Iraq's television stations broadcast Thursday
afternoon, and three of four official radio stations were silent.
It was not clear whether they were destroyed.
	   One stray missile hit an Iranian city, Tehran radio reported.
	   Sirens were heard twice in Baghdad, and anti-aircraft guns were
fired four times during the night. As the sounds of the last
barrage at 5:18 a.m. (0218 GMT) faded, a call for prayer floated
over the winter morning from a mosque loudspeaker.
	   Clinton said he ordered the strikes on military and security
targets to retaliate for Iraq's defiance of the U.N. Special
Commission, which is responsible for eliminating the country's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological weapons,'' he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he authorized the
participation of British forces.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in his radio
address, saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face''
but ``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   An Iraqi newspaper, Babil, suggested Clinton launched the attack
to divert attention from his impeachment hearings.
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the al-Yarmouk Hospital in Baghdad,
said two people were killed and more than 30 were wounded,
suffering mostly burns in the face, hands and legs. But the full
casualty toll was not known, and there was no official word.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
mumbled Salam Mohammed, 34, as he moaned on his hospital bed, his
face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Unlike a previous U.S. attack on the city in 1993, there was no
blackout this time. The streets were brightly lit, as were many
homes when the attack began.
	   The total damage from the attack could not be immediately
assessed, although residents in an Iranian town reportedly saw
thick smoke rising from targets across the border in Iraq.
	   Iraqi officials took foreign reporters to Karada, an upscale
commercial and residential neighborhood, where a missile had
landed. The blast burst water mains in a street, flooding a
two-kilometer (one-mile) stretch of a street.
	   Karada is across the Tigris River from the Old Presidential
Complex, but it was not clear if the palace was damaged.
	   Foreign reporters, who are based at a press center in downtown
Baghdad and can travel around the city only with a government
escort, were given selective access to the damage.
	   In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain for the attack and demanded an immediate end to
the campaign, warning it could shatter regional security.
	   At a Security Council meeting, the ambassadors of Russia and
China, both sympathetic to Iraq, urged an end to the attacks.
	   Staunch American allies _ Germany, Canada and even Japan _
supported the strikes.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the events a ``sad day
for the world,'' saying he did everything in his power to seek
peace. But he didn't say whether the attacks were justified.
	   In his speech, Clinton said the campaign against Iraq will be a
``strong sustained series of airstrikes,'' indicating that more
punishing strikes are likely in the next few days.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   In the attacks, the warships fired hundreds of Tomahawk cruise
missiles, and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck against Iraqi air
defense radars, Pentagon officials said.
	   The United States hopes the attacks will achieve what the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, says it has not been able to achieve
in seven years of work: destroy Iraq's ability to produce weapons
of mass destruction, specifically chemical and biological arms.
	   ``Instead of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam is
disarming the inspectors,'' Clinton said.
	   The U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until the
inspectors certify that Iraq is free of chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles and programs to build them.
	   Iraq accuses the chief inspector, Richard Butler, of being a
U.S. puppet who is deliberately prolonging the sanctions.
	   Butler withdrew all his weapons inspectors from Baghdad on
Wednesday, accusing Iraq of going back on its promise last month to
cooperate fully with UNSCOM. That promise had saved Iraq from an
imminent U.S. attack on Nov. 14.
	   Many of the U.N. humanitarian staff remained in Iraq, and their
spokesman, George Somerwill, said they had received no instructions
to evacuate. He said 133 U.N. staff were still in Baghdad and 233
staff had stayed in northern Iraq.
	   ``We are still waiting for instructions from New York,'' he
said.

Angolan rebels vow to keep fighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angola's UNITA rebels said Thursday they
would maintain their offensive in the province of Bie and will
bring up more firepower to try to crack the government's hold on
the provincial capital of Kuito.
	   ``The military pressure on Kuito-Bie will continue,'' the UNITA
leadership said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press.
	   The rebel forces ``will improve their organization and increase
their firepower'' for new attacks on the besieged city, the
statement said.
	   Battles have focused on Bie, in the central highlands, since
fighting restarted on Dec. 4, ending a four-year peace pact in the
southwestern African country.
	   Kuito was reportedly quiet Thursday. Local radio station Eclesia
reported that the army was strengthening its defensive positions
and was preparing to receive supplies dropped by parachute.
	   Planes cannot land because of anti-aircraft fire from rebels
surrounding the city.
	   The army said it had captured seven rebel tanks during battles
for Kuito and had killed white mercenaries and Congolese rebels
fighting on the rebel side.
	   Neither side has acknowledged the collapse of the United
Nations-brokered 1994 peace agreement designed to end a two-decade
civil war that broke out after independence in 1975.
	   The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement
collapsed a year later after UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ refused to
accept its defeat in the country's first elections.
	   Brig. Simione Mucume said in an interview published Thursday in
the state-controlled daily Jornal de Angola that there were 200
rebel casualties Wednesday in a 12-hour battle outside Kuito, which
lies 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the capital, Luanda.
	   Unconfirmed reports said UNITA earlier this year bought up to 50
Ukrainian tanks via Uganda, a longtime UNITA ally. Angola's rebels,
along with Uganda, are reportedly aiding the insurgency in
neighboring Congo, where the Angolan army is fighting on the side
of President Laurent Kabila.
	   Also, the government of the Republic of Congo, north of Angola,
has said that UNITA is supporting outlawed militia groups in
fighting there. The Angolan army has about 400 troops in the
Republic of Congo to support President Denis Sassou-Nguesso.
	   Western diplomats said UNITA was apparently seeking to spur
rebel military activity in those two countries as a way to prevent
the return of Angolan army troops stationed there.
	   The Angolan government has accused UNITA of employing
mercenaries from Ukraine, Serbia, Israel and South Africa to help
operate the tanks and sophisticated weaponry the rebels have bought
over the past year with revenue from their illegal diamond
operations in Angola.
	   The UNITA statement said that due to ``an error of
coordination,'' rebel forces strayed into a minefield Wednesday in
Bie.
	   Ten rebel soldiers, including Lt. Col. Joao Chiwisi, were killed
and 25 were wounded by mines which also destroyed three rebel
military vehicles and artillery.
	   The statement also claimed that between Dec. 5 and Dec. 16,
rebel forces shot down five government jet fighters and knocked out
five tanks and 20 assault vehicles.

South Korea beats Pakistan 3-2 in men's hockey semifinal

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A fast and aggressive South Korean team
defeated Pakistan 3-2 Thursday, advancing to the gold medal match
of Asian Games men's field hockey tournament.
	   The Koreans will face the winner of the Japan-India semifinal,
being played later Thursday. Korea scored two field goals and
converted one of five penalty corners while Pakistan scored on two
penalty conversions.
	   Pakistan showed off its ball-stealing abilities in the first
half, and the first score was set up when Haider Hussain and Atif
Bashir double-teamed a Korean player to take the action back to
Korea's goal area. Sohail Abbas then converted the corner in the
4th minute.
	   In the 8th minute, Pakistan goalkeeper Muhammad Qasim made a
fine save of a shot from about three meters out on the left side.
	   But Korea's more aggressive play was starting to put pressure on
the Pakistanis. Korea failed to score from another penalty corner
in the 10th minute, but began frequent charges on Pakistan's area.
	   In the 18th minute, the Koreans finally equalized on a field
goal by Kang Keon-wook.
	   Five minutes later, Korea's Yeo Woon-kon put his team up 2-1 and
Kang scored again in the 31st minute for a 3-1 lead.
	   Pakistan had four corners in the last two minutes of the half,
but failed to score.
	   In the second half, the Pakistanis began taking the ball to the
Korean side more. Pakistan failed on a penalty shot in the 13th
minute, but Sohail Abbas was successful on another chance half a
minute later, narrowing Korea's advantage to 3-2.

Malaysian prime minister advised to choose new deputy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister said
Thursday that senior members of his ruling party were advising him
to appoint a new deputy before party elections next year, a news
report said.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he wanted his United Malays
National Organization to decide who should be his deputy at the
next party election, expected in June 1999. But, some party members
thought the decision should be made earlier.
	   ``I wanted to let the party decide in the next party election,
but certain people including senior members of the party have
expressed the view that it is too long to wait,'' Mahathir was
quoted as saying by the Bernama news agency before returning from a
trip to Vietnam.
	   The 72-year-old prime minister added that certain party members
feared that ``anything might happen to me.''
	   The absence of an heir to Mahathir, who has been in poor health
in recent weeks, has added to the uncertainty caused by Malaysia's
economic problems.
	   Mahathir has been without a successor since he fired Anwar
Ibrahim as his deputy on Sept. 2, saying Anwar was morally unfit to
lead.
	   Anwar, now on trial for abuse of power and sexual misconduct,
says the charges were fabricated to end the political challenge he
posed to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Last week after a national UMNO convention, Mahathir said he had
not yet decided on a deputy but that it would be someone he felt
would continue his policies.
	   Mahathir was in Hanoi for a summit of leaders from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which ended Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Sporadic heavy weapons
fire boomed through the suburbs south of Brazzaville early Thursday
morning as the army battled an outlawed militia group.
	   ``We're taking control of the situation,'' said Lt. Jaques
Otalet of the Republic of Congo army. ``We have asked the civilian
population to leave the area to permit authorities to proceed with
the mopping-up operations.''
	   The shooting began Wednesday night and continued, off and on,
into early Thursday when the outlawed ``Ninja'' militia of former
Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas, who had launched scattered
ambushes, were pushed back, he said.
	   There were no details on casualties and Otalet's version of
events could not be independently confirmed.
	   Taking advantage of the disorder, a group of young army recruits
fired machineguns into the air in parts of Brazzaville early
Thursday morning and looted a number of stores. Hundreds of people
panicked in downtown Brazzaville, believing the Ninjas had launched
an all-out attacks. Soldiers were dispatched and quickly stopped
the looting and anti-looting squads remained on patrol throughout
the day.

Report: DaimlerChrysler considering linkup with Nissan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES at end with Renault denying talks with Nissan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ DaimlerChrysler is considering taking
a stake in Japan's debt-laden Nissan Motor Co. and not in its
truck-making subsidiary as originally contemplated, a German news
magazine reported Thursday.
	   However, DaimlerChrysler Chairman Juergen Schrempp is hesitant
to do so at present, according to an advance copy of next week's
Der Spiegel.
	   ``We shouldn't take too much on board at one time,'' Schrempp
was quoted as saying. ``In three years' time we'll be measured by
whether we've made a success of DaimlerChrysler or not and less by
whether we've entered Asia.''
	   A DaimlerChrysler spokesman, Eckhard Zanger, said the company
has been in talks with Nissan and its subsidiary, Nissan Diesel,
for about a year now with a view to cooperation in the commercial
vehicle area. But he declined to comment further.
	   ``We have never commented on how the constellation of such a
cooperation would look, were it to work out,'' Zanger said.
	   Nissan too declined to comment, but said that in general, it is
``willing to consider business tie-ups to strengthen its
international competitiveness.''
	   Daimler-Benz and Nissan said in July they will jointly build a
light truck starting in 2002 as the first step toward a broader
alliance. Daimler also said then it was considering taking a stake
in Nissan Diesel.
	   Originally expected to decide by year's end, the board will miss
that deadline due to the workload surrounding the DaimlerChrysler
merger, Zanger said last week.
	   Spiegel said Nissan is looking for an all-around partner and not
just for a company to take over its diesel trucks, and is also
discussing possible linkups with France's Renault and Ford Motor
Co.
	   In Paris, a Renault spokesman denied the company was in any
talks for a linkup with Nissan.

Prince Charles unveils plaque made of recycled material
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ In a tribute to a charity's recycling
skills, Prince Charles unveiled a plaque Thursday sporting his
crest _ fashioned from a broken coffee table.
	   Charles, a keen conservationist, toured a former defunct factory
that now is the headquarters of Track 2000, a charity that restores
donated household appliances, beds and furniture.
	   The restored coffee table, varnished and carved with the Prince
of Wales' crest, was the main attraction of Charles' tour.
	   The charity, which has distributed 4,000 tons of recycled goods
to the needy, also oversees training programs in carpentry and
electronics for disabled and disadvantaged people.
	   ``Track 2000 deserves enormous credit because the result is very
much after my own heart,'' Charles said. ``It eliminates as much
waste as possible, recycling useful things for other peoples'
benefit.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Russia and China angrily denounced the
U.S.-British attack on Iraq, while allies such as Germany and
Canada offered their immediate support, placing all blame for the
crisis on Saddam Hussein.
	   Iraq's neighbor, Iran, joined Russia and China in blasting the
use of force and warning that it could shatter regional security.
	   Fearful of recriminations, the United States today closed all
but two of its African embassies, and security was stepped up at
many U.S. and British institutions worldwide, from the Philippines
to Greece and Denmark.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin demanded an immediate end to the
military campaign, while his foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said
the United States and Britain had acted without U.N. authorization.
	   ``Nobody has the right to act on their own in the name of the
United Nations and even less to pretend to be the judge of the
entire world,'' Ivanov said in Madrid, Spain.
	   China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasen was visibly angry when he
emerged from a Security Council session Wednesday evening, learning
of the attack only after the fact.
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' he said.
	   The German government noted, however, that the Iraqi leadership
``had been warned'' the international community would have to act
if it failed to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Support for the airstrikes also poured in from Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, the Netherlands,
Austria and Spain.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has brought this crisis on himself,'' Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said.
	   France, which has close ties to Iraq, deplored ``the grave human
consequences'' of the military strikes, but added its regret that
Iraqi leaders were unable to ``show proof of the spirit of complete
cooperation'' demanded by previous agreements with the United
Nations.
	   Iranian television quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying
that ``such unilateral attacks against Iraq will lead to even more
pain and misery for the people of that country and will bring about
insecurity in the region.''
	   Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi urged the U.N. Security Council to
take immediate action to prevent ``further deterioration'' of the
situation, television reported. Iran also called on Baghdad to
cooperate with the United Nations.
	   In a statement today, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
blamed Saddam for ``the grave situation'' while Turkey, fearing an
influx of refugees, closed its border with Iraq, the Anatolia news
agency reported. Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem expressed
disappointment in the attack, but also called on Iraq to comply.
	   In Pakistan, however, the Senate passed a resolution unanimously
condemning the airstrikes as ``an attack on humanity and the
Islamic world.'' Islamic Pakistan's right-wing religious group
called the United States ``international terrorists.''
	   The strikes led news reports in Lebanon, where all newspaper,
radio and television stations carried news agency reports without
comment.
	   In Indonesia, the world's most populous Islamic nation, leaders
pleaded for restraint.
	   Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka backed the United
States and Britain, saying, ``We strongly demand that Iraq
immediately and unconditionally implement the U.N. Security
Council's resolutions.''
	   He was seconded by Misao Nozaki, a 47-year-old Tokyo restaurant
owner who called the bombing justified ``because Iraq has continued
developing nuclear weapons in a way that goes against the common
sense of the rest of the world.''
	   But Yukari Ohi, 38, an office worker in Tokyo, said she opposed
the use of force.
	   ``I think the U.S. decision to attack Iraq was apparently
intended to shift attention from the impeachment issue to war,''
Ohi said, noting that the airstrikes came as President Clinton
faced an impeachment vote.
	   India condemned the attack, while Mexico expressed
disappointment.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was noncommittal,
saying, ``Israel is outside the dispute, and in any case will take
care of defending itself if the need arises.''

Serb police launch Kosovo sweep against KLA over Pec slayings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new 14th graf with Pristina protesters chanting,
whistling, demanding meeting with OSCE mission chief
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police launched a sweep
operation Thursday in the area where six young Kosovo Serbs were
killed this week, arresting 11 people and killing two ethnic
Albanian rebels in an ensuing firefight, police said.
	   International peace verifiers confirmed police were cracking
down on a rebel Albanian stronghold near Pec in western Kosovo
where gunfire and mortar fire could be heard, said a U.S.
diplomatic official on condition of anonymity.
	   The crackdown took place Thursday morning in an outlying
district of Pec and in the nearby village of Glodjane _ a suspected
stronghold of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army _ the Serb-run Media
Center in Pristina reported, citing police sources.
	   After officers conducting the search for suspects came under
fire, the report said, police killed two people wearing camouflage
uniforms bearing the KLA insignia and armed with assault rifles and
mortars. They were said to have arrested 11 people and discovered
large quantities of arms, ammunition and KLA uniforms.
	   A police source who asked to remain unidentified confirmed
fighting was going on.
	   The international Kosovo Verification Mission sent several teams
to the area, and American and other officials were holding talks
with Serbian police.
	   ``We hope that the presence of the KVM patrols will encourage
restraint on both sides and contribute to calming down the
situation,'' the diplomatic source said.
	   Monday's brutal shootings of the Serbs, shot dead by masked
assailants who sprayed a barroom with automatic weapons fire,
further inflamed tensions in the province and prompted reports of
harassment against ethnic Albanians.
	   The political representative of the KLA, which is fighting to
drive Serb police out of Kosovo and break the province away from
Serbia, has denied rebel involvement in Monday's attack.
	   But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this week to arrest
the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   The state-run Borba daily called Thursday, in a sharply worded
commentary, for the withdrawal of international verifiers and U.S.
envoys from Kosovo, saying they are ``direct instigators and
helpers of the crimes committed by Albanian terrorists.''
	   ``Those people should go, and relieve us of their help. They
should return to their homes and defend them against terrorists,
separatists, and rapists.''
	   Serbs held a protest rally against the killings for a second
straight day Thursday, this time in front of the headquarters of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs
the verifying force.
	   About 300 Serbs whistled derisively and booed, and demanded an
immediate meeting with mission chief William Walker, an American
diplomat, who said he would meet with them Friday. Complaining that
the international verifiers are failing to ease tensions and not
responding sufficiently to the Pec killings, they chanted, ``Put
them in chains!''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian legislators agreed Thursday to consider a
motion appealing to Monica Lewinsky to help halt the American
attack on Iraq.
	   ``The State Duma appeals to Ms. Lewinsky to undertake
corresponding measures to restrain the emotions of Bill Clinton,''
said the motion by nationalist lawmaker Alexander Filatov.
	   The motion was approved on a vote in the Duma, the lower chamber
of parliament, to be considered for inclusion in a broader
resolution denouncing the attack on Iraq.
	   The attack by the United States and Britain on Iraq was
condemned by almost all major political groups in Russia. The
Communists, the largest party in the Duma, also mentioned Clinton
and his relationship with the former White House intern.
	   ``Many people link it with Clinton's impeachment and his
intimate relations with a certain person, but if these relations
develop into such acts of vandalism, than all of U.S. democracy is
worth a penny,'' Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov told a Duma
debate on the Iraqi crisis.

Serb police launch Kosovo sweep against KLA over Pec slayings

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police launched a sweep
operation Thursday in the area where six young Kosovo Serbs were
killed this week, arresting 11 people and killing two ethnic
Albanian rebels in an ensuing firefight, police said.
	   International peace verifiers confirmed police were cracking
down on a rebel Albanian stronghold near Pec in western Kosovo
where gunfire and mortar fire could be heard, said a U.S.
diplomatic official on condition of anonymity.
	   The crackdown took place Thursday morning in an outlying
district of Pec and in the nearby village of Glodjane _ a suspected
stronghold of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army _ the Serb-run Media
Center in Pristina reported, citing police sources.
	   After officers conducting the search for suspects came under
fire, the report said, police killed two people wearing camouflage
uniforms bearing the KLA insignia and armed with assault rifles and
mortars. They were said to have arrested 11 people and discovered
large quantities of arms, ammunition and KLA uniforms.
	   A police source who asked to remain unidentified confirmed
fighting was going on.
	   The international Kosovo Verification Mission sent several teams
to the area, and American and other officials were holding talks
with Serbian police.
	   ``We hope that the presence of the KVM patrols will encourage
restraint on both sides and contribute to calming down the
situation,'' the diplomatic source said.
	   Monday's brutal shootings of the Serbs, shot dead by masked
assailants who sprayed a barroom with automatic weapons fire,
further inflamed tensions in the province and prompted reports of
harassment against ethnic Albanians.
	   The political representative of the KLA, which is fighting to
drive Serb police out of Kosovo and break the province away from
Serbia, has denied rebel involvement in Monday's attack.
	   But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this week to arrest
the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   The state-run Borba daily called Thursday, in a sharply worded
commentary, for the withdrawal of international verifiers and U.S.
envoys from Kosovo, saying they are ``direct instigators and
helpers of the crimes committed by Albanian terrorists.''
	   ``Those people should go, and relieve us of their help. They
should return to their homes and defend them against terrorists,
separatists, and rapists.''

American and British defense secretaries skip NATO meeting

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
and his British counterpart skipped the NATO defense ministers
meeting Thursday in favor of staying at home and dealing with the
airstrikes on Iraq.
	   As the alliance's defense chiefs gathered for their two-day,
year-end meeting, the United States and Britain continued their
missile assault on Iraq, attacks that began early Thursday in
response to President Saddam Hussein's defiance of U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who was scheduled to be
at NATO headquarters on Friday for a meeting of the Russia-NATO
Permanent Joint Council, abruptly canceled his trip on orders from
President Boris Yeltsin, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``The German government has clearly said that we politically
support the approach of the United States,'' German Defense
Minister Rudolf Scharping said on arrival at NATO headquarters.
	   ``We think that Saddam Hussein has to comply fully with the U.N.
Security Council resolution. He didn't do that. That's why he is
fully responsible for the military actions, which are necessary.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana also blamed Saddam Hussein,
but in his statement did not mention the attacks. He said all
efforts by the United Nations over the past several months have
been unsuccessful.
	   ``He alone is responsible for the grave situation and for the
consequences that his defiance of the will of the international
community has entailed,'' Solana said.
	   Portuguese Defense Minister Jose Veiga Simao agreed.
	   ``I have full confidence in the judgment of our British and
American colleagues,'' Veiga Simao said.
	   Spain's Eduardo Serra Rexach said the bombing of Iraq was
``inevitable.''
	   ``Spain deeply deplores that use of force, but the Spanish
government has always chosen solidarity with the allies,'' he said.
	   Poland, which will become a member of NATO next year, also
expressed solidarity with the United States and Britain.
	   ``We deplore the fact that a peaceful solution was not
possible,'' said Polish Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz. ``As
for as American action is concerned, we fully understand the
reasons that led to this decision. We fully support this action.''
	   NATO officials were at pains to point out, however, that ``Iraq
is not a NATO responsibility'' even if NATO members are involved.
	   The ministers here expressed their deep concern at the rising
violence in Kosovo and the slow pace of peace efforts in Bosnia.
	   American-mediated negotiations in Kosovo, the poor southern
province of Serbia _ the dominant republic of Yugoslavia _ have
failed to bring Serbs and ethnic Albanians anywhere near an
agreement. More than three dozen deaths in the province this week
has taken ethnic tensions to new heights.
	   Those tensions were compounded by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's assertion that use of a special NATO extraction force
to pull civilian peace monitors out of Kosovo in emergency
conditions would be an act of aggression.
	   A NATO official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted the
``growing noncompliance'' by both sides in Kosovo, ``the Albanians
willingness to continue the struggle'' as well as the Serbs' ``very
heavy-handed approach.''
	   NATO is creating a 1,700-man rapid reaction force just across
the Kosovo border in Macedonia, a force the NATO official said ``is
ready to go now.''
	   It was created in the wake of U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke's
Oct. 12 deal with Milosevic to end the fighting between the
government and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking independence in
Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and as many as 300,000 forced
from their houses during fighting this year in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up about 90 percent of a population of 2 million.
	   A senior NATO military officer said Milosevic agreed during
talks to both the creation of the extraction force and to its
planned activities.
	   In Bosnia, the other area where NATO is playing a direct
intervention role, implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace
agreement is going very slowly.
	   ``There is a sense that 1999 is a make or break year in Bosnia
for the Dayton peace agreement,'' the NATO official said. ``In 1999
the degree of impatience is going to be very high.''
	   Ministers approved a ``structural adjustment'' to the
32,000-member that will reduce the force by 10 to 11 percent in the
next few months, the official said.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Parliament dealt a severe
blow to the European Union's Commission on Thursday by rejecting
its 1996 accounts amid allegations of fraud and spending
irregularities.
	   A total 270 members of the 518 parliamentians present voted to
withhold approval of the 1996 budget; 225 voted in favor of
approving the budget and 23 abstained.
	   ``It's very clear the vote was a loss for the Commission,'' the
EU's Budget Commissioner Erkki Liikanen told a news conference in
Strasbourg, France, where the 626-legislature is meeting. But, he
added, the Parliament ``has not asked the Commission to resign, and
the Commission has no intention of resigning,'' he added.
	   The vote has no direct impact on the Commission's day-to-day
activities.
	   But Pauline Green, the leader of the Socialist Group, said her
party will call for a motion of censure - in other words, a vote on
the dismissal of the whole Commission. The parliament next meets
again in January. The Socialists are the largest faction in
Parliament and a majority of them favored closing the 1996
accounts.
	   During a heated debate preceding the vote, Green accused
supporters of the rejection of inconsistency, saying if they have
no confidence in the Commission's handling of its funds they should
be consistent and vote for its dismissal.
	   ``I have never heard such hypocritical rubbish,'' she told
colleagues. Green said she called for the motion herself and hopes
the Commission will survive it.
	   Under the EU treaty, the parliament can only fire the entire
20-member EU executive panel, not individual commissioners.
	   James Elles, rapporteur for the Parliament's budget control
committee, told a news conference after the vote he sees no need
for a motion of censure.
	   ``Not to give discharge is a way of putting pressure on the
Commission to carry out reforms,'' said Elles, a member of the
second largest group in Parliament, the European People's Party.
	   Under Parliament procedure, the issue is going back to the
budget control committee which will put it to vote again next
March. The Parliament will also have to look at the Socialists'
call for a motion of censure before then.
	   ``We've never been here before. We will look at rules of
procedure,'' Elles said.
	   The European Union has long been hounded by reports and
allegations of fraud. On Nov. 17, the EU Court of Auditors
estimated fraud and financial irregularities amounted to 5 percent
of the EU's 1997 budget of 83 billion European currency units (dlrs
97 billion) budget.
	   The EU Commission has defended itself against these attacks.
Liikanen argues he has met all demands for tighter financial
controls.
	   Yet many in the parliament deny he has gone far enough to

our requirements,'' said Diemut Theato, a German member of the EPP.

Israel deploys Patriot batteries; security Cabinet meets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to UPDATE with Patriot anti-missile systems
deployed, Netanyahu convening security Cabinet &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Just hours after the United States bombed Iraq,
Israel deployed Patriot anti-missile batteries Thursday as defense
against possible attack by Baghdad and Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu met with key Cabinet ministers to map strategy.
	   Netanyahu said Israel does not want to get involved in the
escalating U.S.-Iraqi conflict, but reserved the right to defend
itself if attacked by Iraq. ``We have no intention of being part of
this conflict, but we are preparing for every eventuality,''
Netanyahu told Israel radio.
	   In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein fired 39 Scud
missiles at Israel after being attacked by the United States. At
the time, Saddam hoped to provoke an Israeli response and thus
break up the Arab coalition that had formed against him. However,
at the urging of the United States, Israel did not strike back.
	   Israeli military commanders said Thursday that the probability
of an Iraqi strike was very low. However, if pushed to the verge of
collapse by U.S. airstrikes, Saddam might fire missiles with
chemical or biological warheads at Israel, said Gen. Amos Gilad,
the head of research in Israel's military intelligence.
	   ``If he is on the brink of extinction, he certainly may take
suicidal steps involving the launching of a few missiles against
Israel,'' Gilad told a news conference.
	   The army said it would open 65 gas mask distribution stations by
the end of the day and called on the public to check whether gas
masks were still serviceable or had to be replaced.
	   Israelis were first given gas masks in the weeks before the Gulf
War when Saddam threatened to hit Israel with chemical weapons. He
did not make good on his threat, firing missiles with conventional
warheads instead.
	   Netanyahu said U.S. President Bill Clinton raised the
possibility of a U.S. attack on Iraq already on Tuesday when he
first learned that Iraq was not cooperating with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   At the time, Netanyahu was standing with Clinton on the tarmac
of Ben-Gurion International Airport, waiting to see him off after a
visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas.
	   Asked by Israel army radio whether at that time Clinton talked
to him about a possible attack on Iraq, Netanyahu said: ``Yes, we
talked about this possibility.''
	   ``He told me that he was about to get a very difficult report by
(chief U.N. weapons inspector) Richard Butler on Iraq's failure to
fulfill its commitments, and that it apparently would obligate him
to act,'' Netanyahu said of his conversation with Clinton.
	   On Thursday, Netanyahu convened his so-called security Cabinet,
including Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon, to map strategy.
	   Gilad, the intelligence officer, said that in spite of Iraq's
denials, it still possesses a few missile launchers, several dozen
missiles and a chemical warfare capability.
	   The army announced a decision to deploy Patriot anti-missile
systems. Israel TV's Channel Two said Patriot batteries were moved
Thursday from sparsely populated southern Israel to central Israel
and near the northern port city of Haifa.
	   Patriots proved largely ineffective in the 1991 Gulf War.
	   However, Israel is much better prepared to deal with an Iraqi
missile attack than it was in 1991, a defense official said.
	   ``Today we have a satellite terminal which enables us to receive
early warning in a much shorter time and we are linked directly to
the American radar,'' said Avi Benayahu, adviser to Mordechai.
	   The radar system of the Arrow anti-missile missile, which Israel
is developing, is already operational, Benayahu told Israel radio.
The system, code-named Green Pine, is capable of tracking a
ballistic missile in flight, he said.
	   ``We also have something moving around in space which can see
all sorts of things,'' Benayahu said, in an apparent reference to
the Israeli satellite Amos.

Report: North Korea to test another ballistic missile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ North Korea is planning another ballistic missile
test, and is likely to again present it as a satellite launch, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Thursday, citing the Russian Defense
Ministry.
	   A center for control over missile launches, run jointly by
Russia and the United States, has received information that a
medium-range ballistic missile will be launched from the North
Korean test site on Cape Musudan, sources in the Defense Ministry
said.
	   North Korea launched a rocket on Aug. 31 that flew over Japan
and fell into the Pacific Ocean. U.S. and Japanese defense
officials said it was a new, two-stage ballistic missile, but North
Korea contends the launch simply sent a scientific satellite into
orbit.
	   The new rocket will have a range of 3,500-kilometers
(2,170-miles), ITAR-Tass said. North Korea will try to present the
test as a missile launch, Defense Ministry sources said.
	   The report did not say when the test was expected to take place.

Germany backs strikes against Saddam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS 4 grafs with windows broken at U.S. building, security
tightened, other protests &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder expressed
support for the U.S. missile strikes on Iraq Thursday, saying
Saddam Hussein had only himself to blame.
	   ``The use of military force is the consequence of Saddam
Hussein's stubborn refusal to cooperate with weapons inspectors as
foreseen by U.N. resolutions,'' Schroeder said on German
television.
	   He said the Iraqi leader ``bears the responsibility for the
reaction of the international community.''
	   ``There can be no doubt about our solidarity with the
international community and our U.S. and British allies,''
Schroeder said.
	   Security was tightened around U.S. and British centers in Berlin
and elsewhere in Germany.
	   In the north German city of Kiel, stones were thrown at the
Kennedy House early Thursday, breaking five windows. Police said
they could not rule out a connection with the airstrikes on Iraq.
	   The building houses the German-American Institute, which offers
programs such as language courses.
	   About 150 leftists staged a short protest in front of the U.S.
Embassy in Berlin. No incidents were reported.
	   The Party for Democratic Socialism, successor to the East German
communists, hung white flags from the windows of its Berlin
headquarters. A party spokesman said the flags were meant as a
``protest against the bombardment.''

China condemns US bombing, calls for halt to strikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and LEADS with UPDATES throughout with Chinese
president message to Clinton, discussions with Yeltsin

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Stung by U.S. airstrikes against Iraq, China's
president urged U.S. President Bill Clinton Thursday to refrain
from launching further attacks.
	   In a day of crisis-level diplomacy unusual for China's Communist
Party leadership, President Jiang Zemin sent a message to Clinton
and discussed the bombings over the telephone with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, Chinese state-run media reported.
	   Jiang called on Clinton to halt any U.S. and British military
action against Iraq to lay the groundwork for a diplomatic
solution, state media reported.
	   Jiang's message was a response to one sent by Clinton explaining
the U.S.-led attack early Thursday, the Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Although Xinhua did not provide a text of the message nor say
how it was conveyed, a statement issued earlier in the day by
China's Foreign Ministry condemned Washington for acting alone
without consulting the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``We feel deeply shocked by the military attack on Iraq launched
by the United States,'' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi
told reporters.
	   ``This is a violation of the U.N. charter and the principles of
international law and we condemn this. We appeal to the United
States to immediately stop all military actions against Iraq,'' Sun
added.
	   China's uncharacteristically strong comments underscored how the
sternest U.S. military action against Iraq in two years has
aggravated a split in the Security Council over U.N. weapons
inspections and economic sanctions on Baghdad.
	   China, Russia and France have argued a more conciliatory line to
persuade Baghdad to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors and have
resisted urgings to use force by the other two permanent members of
the council, Britain and the United States.
	   In the wake of Thursday's airstrikes, China and Russia have
openly condemned the United States, while France laid blame on
Washington and Baghdad.
	   Jiang and Yeltsin, in their phone conversation, agreed that
military actions should cease and that a political solution was
needed, Xinhua reported.
	   Russia's U.N. ambassador has suggested the removal of Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. weapons inspections commission, known as
UNSCOM. China too accused Butler of withholding information showing
Iraqi progress in dismantling its nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons in a report he gave to the Security Council.
	   ``We have always maintained that UNSCOM should justly and
objectively reflect the substantial progress that has been made in
the Iraqi weapons inspection,'' Sun said. ``However, the report
offered by UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler's failed to reflect the
situation in its true face. We express our deep regret over this.''

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Hisham al-Otaibi has been appointed minister of
commerce and industry, Al-Rai Al-Amm daily reported Thursday.
	   Al-Otaibi was the director general of the Kuwait Stock Exchange.
He replaces Abdul-Aziz al-Dakheel, who has become minister of state
for Cabinet affairs. The decrees with the appointments were issued
Wednesday, the paper said.
	   Al-Rai Al-Amm quoted Al-Otaibi as saying he was going to
continue to carry out his predecessor's policy of activating trade
and industry.
	   ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed at 1,629.4 points at the end of the trading week, up 22.3
points, or 1.39 percent, from last week, the National Investments
Co. said Thursday.
	   In a weekly report about the market, the company said the rise
was caused by selective speculation on ``some excellent and cheap''
stocks. Share prices had for several weeks hit record lows due to
lack of liquidity and to indecision about steps needed to energize
the exchange.
	   Some 315.89 million shares changed hands this week, 88.44
percent higher than last week. The value of these shares rose by
66.29 percent to 52.82 million dinars (dlrs 174.90 million).
	   Of the 77 companies listed on the exchange, 71 were traded,
according to the report. Forty-five closed higher, 17 closed lower
and the rest were unchanged.
	   Trading on the exchange is restricted to Kuwaitis and nationals
of the other five Arab states in the Gulf: Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman.
	   ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices and turnover further rose on
the stock exchange this week, a market report said Thursday.
	   Brokers attributed the increase due to the active trading in
profitable shares of industry and commercial banks following the
visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Israel and the Palestinian
territories.
	   The market report, reflecting five business days ending
Wednesday, said that 60-company general share prices index nudged
up by 2.37 percent to 169.71 points.
	   Shares of industrial firms increased by 5.97 percent, services
sector by 3.54 percent, commercial banks by 1.19 percent, and
insurance sector by 0.03 percent.
	   Turnover also increased by 129.3 percent to 21.1 million
Jordanian dinars (dlrs 29.7 million), the report said.
	   It also said stocks of 109 firms were traded during the week.

Government announces crackdown on Albanian-language media
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian information minister
announced Thursday an imminent government crackdown against
Albanian-language media in Kosovo, Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Aleksandar Vucic said ``tomorrow or one of these days'' Yugoslav
authorities will take measures against the Kosovo newspapers,
magazines, radio and television who have violated a restrictive
Serbian media law, Tanjug said.
	   The law, passed by the Serbian parliament last October,
envisages enormous fines for publishing reports considered by the
government to be against the state.
	   Some independent media in Serbia already have been fined under
the new law, but Vucic said the government decided to give the
Albanian-language media ``some time'' to adjust their writing to
``respect territorial integrity of the country,'' following an
October agreement which ended heavy fighting in the province.
	   Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are seeking independence for the
province from Serbia. Kosovo's Albanian-language media have
supported the Albanians' quest, considered illegal by the state.

PKK leader says he's willing to be questioned about Palme killing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan
says he is willing to be questioned by Swedish officials in the
killing of Prime Minister Olof Palme, the newspaper Aftonbladet
reported Thursday.
	   One of several theories that have emerged in the 1986
assassination of the Swedish leader while walking down a Stockholm
avenue is that the killing was in revenge for Sweden's extradition
of two members of the PKK rebel group, which Ocalan leads.
	   After Ocalan was detained in Rome on Nov. 12, Swedish
investigators said they were interested in questioning him.
Officials at the national prosecutor's office, which is leading the
investigation, could not immediately be reached for comment on
Thursday.
	   In an interview conducted in Rome, the newspaper asked Ocalan if
he would be willing to talk with Swedish investigators.
	   ''Naturally. This loathsome murder was part of a plot directed
against those who tried to bring about a peaceful solution,'' the
newspaper quoted him as saying. ''Olof Palme was a true friend of
the Kurdish people.''
	   Ocalan said he believes the killing of Palme was part of a
campaign to ''paint in black terms those who in one way or another
support the Kurdish people's fight.''
	   The newspaper said the interview was conducted in the villa
where Ocalan was being detained. A court on Wednesday lifted
restrictions on him, leaving him free to leave the country.
	   Other theories in Palme's death have included his being killed
by South African agents in retaliation for his vehement opposition
to apartheid.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot squads fired shots and tear gas
when thousands of student demonstrators demanding democratic reform
tried to storm the Parliament on Thursday.
	   One student was shot to death and 10 others had gunshot wounds,
an official at Jakarta's navy hospital said.
	   Another 60 were reported injured at three other hospitals, he
said. Most were beaten or overcome by gas.
	   Many of the more than 4,000 protesters threw rocks, bottles and
gasoline bombs at police and troops who beat them back with clubs.
	   The military said four security personnel were seriously
injured.
	   Some heavily bleeding students were carried to safety by their
friends through clouds of tear gas. Paramedics applied first aid on
the street to dozens of other demonstrators.
	   Students fought back with sticks and some soldiers hurled rocks
at protesters.
	   It was the second straight day that students have clashed with
security forces in the Indonesian capital. And, it was the worst
violence seen since Nov. 13 when 14 people died after troops fired
upon students who also tried to march on Parliament.
	   Thursday's death happened despite assurances by the military
that troops and police have been issued with plastic or blank
ammunition.
	   One student leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the demonstrators would protest again on Friday.
	   Hours before Thursday's street battle, President B.J. Habibie
warned his country might break up if anti-government protests
escalated.
	   ``If the protests are not controlled it can lead to the
disintegration of the nation,'' Habibie said at a graduation
ceremony of new army officers.
	   For weeks, students have taken to the streets demanding that
Habibie force the military out of politics and put his autocratic
predecessor, ex-President Suharto, on trial for corruption.
	   Habibie has promised to open up the tightly controlled political
system and to hold elections next year. But the students are not
satisfied with the pace and scope of his reforms.
	   On Wednesday police also fired tear gas and swung batons to
disperse hundreds of rock-throwing protesters at the Defense
Ministry, not far from the presidential palace.
	   Religious groups have called on the students to end their
protest campaign during the forthcoming holy Islamic month of
Ramadan, which starts on Sunday.
	   As night fell Thursday, hundreds of military reinforcements
arrived at the Parliament and students lit bonfires on a toll road
before dispersing.
	   Soldiers ordered reporters and news crews to leave the scene.
	   Angry students pulled down and set fire to tents set up by the
troops near the legislature. They also burned a portrait of
Suharto.
	   The students had converged on the heavily guarded legislature in
two groups.
	   They marched to the Parliament demanding political reform and
the release of some activists arrested by police during other
protests this week.
	   Outnumbered soldiers and police retreated briefly after the
students tried to run into the parliamentary grounds.
	   The protesters were repelled and scattered when officers
responded with warning shots and tear gas.
	   Also on Thursday, dozens of riot police and troops peacefully
blocked about 100 students about 100 meters (yards) in front of the
presidential palace.
	   Habibie, who has promised democratic reform after decades of
authoritarian rule, said that freedom of expression that allows
protests is now guaranteed under Indonesian law.
	   ``But in carrying out these rights people must also respect
other people's rights,'' he said.
	   Indonesia, with 202 million people, is the world's fourth most
populous country. It has more than 300 ethnic groups spread over
about 17,000 islands.
	   Student protests and deadly riots last May also forced Suharto
to quit after 32 years in power. At that time students occupied the
parliament building for several days.
	   Anger at Habibie's seven-month old government has been sharpened
by a continuing economic crisis, which has resulted in soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and rising poverty.
	   Sporadic rioting and looting has hit some parts of the country.
There has also been violence among the Muslim majority and the
Christian minority with dozens of mosques and churches set afire or
ransacked.

Reds' Beckham gets over the booing blues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ David Beckham endured months of jeers from
opposing fans after his World Cup expulsion made him public enemy
No. 1 in English soccer.
	   Now he believes that's all behind him and he can concentrate on
making Manchester United a winning team again. Right now, all
United can do is draw.
	   Beckham was sent off in the game against Argentina, which
England eventually lost on penalties after surviving for 70 minutes
with 10 men. Many fans blamed Beckham for England's elimination
and, when the season started, he was booed and jeered wherever he
played.
	   ``A lot of people have said the treatment I got after the World
Cup was unfair and I think it was, but I can't do anything about
that,'' the Manchester United midfielder said.
	   ``A lot of people really blew it out of proportion.''
	   But Beckham said it was not all down to the World Cup debacle,
when he was sent off for petulantly kicking Argentina's Diego
Simeone after he had been fouled.
	   ``The reason fans abuse me is because they are jealous of me
most of the time,'' said the fiance of Spice Girl Victoria (Posh)
Adams.
	   ``They see me doing well on the pitch, playing for Manchester
United, playing for England, enjoying my life, playing football
with a smile on my face.
	   ``I suppose booing is a way of getting back at me. I think when
people boo you it's a sign of respect really.''
	   Beckham is unlikely to face any booing on Saturday when he turns
out for Manchester United against Middlesbrough before 55,000
mainly United fans at Old Trafford.
	   That's unless the Reds fail to win for a fifth time in a row
since the departure of assistant manager Brian Kidd.
	   Kidd left to take over as manager of Blackburn Rovers two weeks
ago and United, with Alex Ferguson in sole charge, has tied with
Aston Villa, Tottenham and Chelsea in the league and Bayern Munich
in the Champions Cup.
	   If United had turned any of those Premier League draws into
victories, it would have been sitting top of the standings instead
of two points behind Villa in second place.
	   A victory over a fifth-place Middlesbrough team managed by
former United star Bryan Robson will put Ferguson's team top only
because Villa isn't in action until Monday, when it goes to sliding
Charlton.
	   If United slips up on Saturday, Chelsea can move to the top by
beating Tottenham at home. Gianluca Vialli's team would be level
with Villa on points and go top on goal difference.
	   Chelsea underlined its title potential by scoring a 1-1 tie at
United on Wednesday. Vialli's team fell behind at Old Trafford but
produced a strong second half fightback and fully deserved its
equalizer through Gianfranco Zola seven minutes from the end.
	   Zola's form has returned after a barren 12-month spell in which
he lost his place on Italy's World Cup team. He puts it down to
becominy more of a team player than just a striker and goalmaker.
	   ``I'm more devoted to the Chelsea cause,'' said the former
Napoli and Parma forward, who scored his ninth goal of the season
on Wednesday.
	   ``I'm more important in this team and I think I have never
scored as many goals in the first few games as I did this season.''
	   Another big game at the weekend is sixth-place Arsenal against
fourth-place Leeds on Sunday. The Gunners, who had eight regular
first-teamers out through injury and suspension recently, are
getting some of their star players back to full fitness.
	   Leeds, fielding six players under age 21, are going well under
new manager David O'Leary and Monday's 2-0 victory over struggling
Coventry was its fourth win in five games.
	   The Sky Blues are one of five teams falling away from the rest
at the foot of the standings.
	   A five-point gap separates 15th place Newcastle from Charlton,
which is 16th. Coventry is 17th and hopes for a home victory over
mid-standings Derby on Saturday to stay away from the relegation
zone.
	   Last place Southampton, only 10 points from 17 games, hosts
mid-standings Wimbledon while next-to-last Nottingham Forest, which
has only one one point more, hosts Blackburn, which is one place
above.
	   Other games Saturday are Liverpool-Sheffield Wednesday,
Newcastle-Leicester and West Ham-Everton.
	   Division One leader Sunderland, which already has a 10-point
lead atop the standings, has a tough game at fourth-place
Birmingham, which last week won 7-1 at Oxford. Second place Ipswich
goes to Sheffield United on Sunday.
	   Three points clear in the Scottish Premier League, Glasgow
Rangers goes to fifth place Hearts Saturday while Kilmarnock hosts
Dundee United on Sunday.
	   Defending champion Celtic, which has seven points to make up on
Rangers and lies third, has a home game against last place
Dunfermline Saturday.

Killy calls for quick action to restore credibility of IOC
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Expressing shock at the latest allegations of
corruption in the Olympic movement, French IOC member Jean-Claude
Killy said Thursday the movement needs to act quickly and firmly to
restore credibility.
	   The Olympic movement is in shock following Marc Hodler's
allegations of corruption in the bidding and selection process for
host cities.
	   Hodler, a high-ranking International Olympic Committee member,
claimed misconduct in Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002
winter games, describing a scholarship fund formed by organizers as
a bribe.
	   He then escalated the scandal by alleging misconduct in the
awarding of the summer games to Atlanta (1996) and Sydney (2000)
and winter games to Nagano (1998).
	   Killy, attending the official launch of Paris' bid to stage the
2008 games, said he was surprised at the breadth of Hodler's
allegations.
	   ``I am surprised he spoke about Atlanta. There is only proof in
the case of Salt Lake City,'' Killy told The Associated Press.
``Hodler has generalized, and I don't like to do that.''
	   Killy serves on the IOC's finance and the Salt Late City control
committee, both chaired by Hodler, and headed Albertville's
successful bid for the 1992 Winter Games.
	   ``Hodler is very honest and I have enormous respect for him,''
Killy said. ``But what he said surprised me.''
	   Killy, a French IOC member, expects a new system of host city
selection to be in place by 2001, the year when the 2008 venue will
be decided.
	   Hodler's suggestion of taking the decision away from the general
IOC membership and assigning it to a smaller panel has its merits,
Killy said.
	   But he added that concentrating decision-making would prove
controversial.
	   ``The universalism of the Olympic movement is very important,''
he said. ``I believe that the IOC will take adequate measures. But
it must act quickly. We must face a real problem.''
	   Killy said he personally was unaware of corruption in the
selection of host venues. However, ``I am not saying that it
doesn't exist,'' he added.
	   Organizers of the Paris bid sought to separate themselves from
the scandal rocking the Olympic movement.
	   ``It doesn't worry me,'' said Paris mayor Jean Tiberi at the
launch. ``It changes nothing.''
	   Other candidates for the 2008 games include early favorite
Beijing; Toronto; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Buenos Aires, Argentina;
Istanbul, Turkey; Osaka, Japan, and Seville, Spain.

Report: Stuttgart to sign Macedonian, still looking for coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart is
set to sign Macedonian international midfielder Srdjan Zaharievski,
the Kicker magazine reported Thursday.
	   Zaharievski, 25, is expected to sign with Stuttgart during the
Bundesliga's winter break, which starts after this weekend's round,
for an expected transfer fee of 800,000 marks (dlrs 480,000) from
Sileks Kratovo.
	   The Macedonian is set to replace Gerhard Poschner, who is
joining the Italian Serie A club Venezia.
	   Stuttgart is still looking for a new coach after firing Winfried
Schaefer earlier this month.
	   Kicker said that Ivica Osim, the former Yugoslav coach who is at
Sturm Graz in Austria now, was likely to turn down Stuttgart's
offer.
	   The latest candidate, Kicker said, was Bernd Schuster, a former
star in Spain who is now coach of second-division Cologne.

	   FAISALABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Heavy fog canceled play on the first
day of the third and decisive test between Pakistan and Zimbabwe on
Thursday.
	   Dense fog enveloped the field. New Zealand umpire Dough Cowie
and Salim Badar made inspections every half and hour. But not a
single ball could be bowled.
	   Zimbabwe leads the three-match series 1-0 after winning the
first test by seven wickets. The second test also was marred by
dense fog in Lahore and 13 hours were lost in the drawn game due to
poor visibility and fog.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean medical team said it
has made an important advance in cloning human cells to create
replacement organs. The development could also serve as a first
step in cloning people.
	   The team said Wednesday that it had replaced the nucleus of a
woman's egg with the nucleus of one of her body cells, transferring
her DNA to the egg.
	   The team then cultivated the egg until it grew into four cells,
an early embryonic stage. The team stopped there because a
resolution adopted by South Korean scientists in 1993 banned taking
the experiment farther.
	   The next step would have been implanting the egg into a woman's
uterus and letting it grow to create stem cells _ primordial cells
from which all of a human's body tissues and organs develop.
Scientists want to use stem cells as raw material for growing
organs for transplant.
	   The South Korean team was headed by Dr. Lee Bo-yeon, a professor
at the fertility clinic of Kyonghee University Hospital in Seoul.
	   American cloning experts said it was the first time they knew of
that human DNA had been transferred from a body cell into a human
egg, with the egg then developing into embryonic cells. Body cells,
as opposed to eggs or sperm, contain the full complement of a
person's DNA.
	   ``It's the first step in the Richard Seed experiment,'' the
highly publicized announcement by a Chicago scientist that he
planned to clone a human, said Randall Prather, an associate
professor of animal science at the University of Missouri at
Columbia.
	   ``They stopped it before they got very far,'' Prather noted.
``They could have just let it go, potentially it could have created
an individual.''
	   He and Mark Westhusin of Texas A and M University said they
didn't know how likely it was that such an experiment could go all
the way to making a person.
	   ``Four cells is a long way from a fetus,'' Westhusin said. It's
no surprise that the experiment would succeed in going at least to
four cells, he said.
	   Others were even more dubious. Steven Stice, who developed a
technique for cloning genetically customized calves, questioned the
accuracy of the Koreans' claim. He was quoted in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution on Thursday.
	   ``I haven't seen any information that suggests that they've
actually accomplished this,'' said Stice, who is at the University
of Georgia. ``And to say you have four cells is a far cry from
saying you have succeeded at cloning humans.''

Meissnitzer and Goetschl face-off in weekend double downhills
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VV*JJi Switzerland (AP) _ World Cup leader Alexandra Meissnitzer
of Austria will fight off the challenge of teammate Renate Geotschl
this weekend as the alpine ski circuit moves to Switzerland for
back-to-back downhills.
	   But Geotschl, the winner of both races in the season opening
downhill double-header in Lake Louise, Canada, last month, won't be
the only threat to Meissnitzer's lead.
	   A slalom and the season's first combined could allow several
other skiers to jump into contention for the coveted overall crown
as the White Circus heads into its short Christmas break.
	   As her compatriot Hermann Maier did last year on the men's
circuit, Meissnitzer has unexpectedly leapt to the fore-front of
the women's scene this season, winning 4-of-10 races so far,
grabbing a substantial lead in the overall standings.
	   Winner of back-to-back races in Val d'Isere last weekend, the
Austrian will attempt to add to her 625-point total in the overall
rankings by recording her first career downhill victory.
	   The 25-year-old Austrian holds a whopping 242 advantage over her
closest challenger Martina Ertl of Germany.
	   ``When I stand at the start I just feel nothing can go wrong,''
said MeissI the giant slalom runnerup and super-G bronze medallist
at the Nagano Olympics last February. ``My confidence is thriving.
I have no doubts in my head.
	   ``There's only one way to go when I'm in this state and that's
by taking all the risks. I can't explain it. I'm just on a roll.''
	   But while Meissnitzer exterted her dominance in both the super-G
and giant slalom this season, leading in both disciplines, she has
yet to show the same skill in skiing's glamor event, finishing
fifth and third in the Lake Louise downhills.
	   Goetschl, meanwhile, has indicated she's unready to give up her
current reign in the downhill, posting the fastest time in
Wednesday's training run.
	   But while Austrian skiers have won 7-of-10 events this season,
the fight is hardly limited to the one nation.
	   Also factoring into the equation is Italy's Isolde Kostner,
runnerup behind Goetschl in Lake Louise, and third in
Wednesday's%9%9
	   All-rounder Pernilla Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup
champion, will banish last year's injury-plagued campaign from her
mind as she seeks her first win of the season, in a fresh attempt
at a second overall crown.
	   Ertl, ever in the shadow of her illustrious teammate, World Cup
overall champion Katja Seizinger, is taking advantage of her
compatriot's season-long absence due to knee injury to pursue her
long-time dream.
	   Runnerup in the overall in 1996 and last year, Ertl has made it
clear she intends to make the title hers this time around.
	   ``Of course I'm going for the ov:&AMP;Ertl, the World Cup giant
slalom champion last season.
	   ``I'm astonished at my results in the downhill,'' said Ertl, who
finished fourth and seventh in the season's two downhills. ``I hope
my skills in the slalom will give me an edge in the overall.''
	   The German will get an extra opportunity this weekend, with the
slalom also counting towards a combined event.
	   Meissnitzer, though hinting she may race in the combined events,
generally shies away from the slalom, giving her opponents an extra
jump in the chase for the overall crown.
	   The event will give Goetschl, the reigning combined champion,
and Wiberg, the 1994 Olympic gold medallist in the event, another
chance for vauable points.

Appeals court confirms ruling on Montand paternity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An appeals court on Thursday ruled that Yves
Montand did not father a young woman who claims to be his daughter,
relying on a DNA test on the corpse of legendary French singer.
	   Throughout his life, Montand had denied that Aurore Drossart,
24, was his daughter and refused to undergo DNA tests.
	   After years of trying, Drossart and her mother, Anne, won a
court-ordered exhumation of Montand's corpse from Paris'
Pere-Lachaise cemetery. It was carried out in March, and came out
negative.
	   Four years ago, a Paris court concluded Montand was Aurore's
father, on the basis of physical resemblance as well as the fact
the Montand had refused twice to undergo blood tests to verify the
claim.
	   Aurore's mother, Anne Fleurange, said Thursday she would appeal
to the highest court, the Cour de Cassation.
	   ``Aurore Drossart is the daughter of Yves Montand,'' she said.
	   Montand's heirs were horrified by the exhumation so long after
his death in 1991. He died of a massive heart attack at age 70,
three days before he was to testify in Drossart's paternity suit.
	   The singer was beloved in France, where his melancholy love
songs and cabaret-style ditties won him a loyal following. He also
was a versatile screen actor, starring in movies such as Claude
Berri's ``Jean de Florette'' and ``Z,'' by Costa Gavras.

Mohamed Al Fayed settles suit with bodyguard in Diana crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mohamed Al Fayed agreed Thursday to pay an
unspecified amount to a former bodyguard who claims he was
pressured to quit after refusing to appear in a documentary about
the Paris car crash that killed Princess Diana and Al Fayed's son.
	   Alexander Wingfield had testified during a hearing this week
that the billionaire owner of the Harrods department store wanted
him to help advance the theory that Diana and boyfriend Dodi Fayed
were murdered.
	   As a result of his reluctance, Wingfield said, he felt pressured
to resign. He then sued one of Al Fayed's companies, Hyde Park
Residence, for breach of contract.
	   The settlement was announced on the second day of a hearing on
the suit.
	   During the hearing, Wingfield also testified that Al Fayed had
introduced him to the maker of the documentary as the person
responsible for the Aug. 31, 1997, crash.
	   Al Fayed has publicly blamed Wingfield and bodyguard Trevor
Rees-Jones, the sole survivor in the wrecked Mercedes, for the
accident.
	   He has said they should have insisted on a backup car and should
not have allowed driver Henri Paul, who also died, to take the
route he did. He also said Rees-Jones should have insisted Diana
and his son wear a seat belt, as the bodyguard did.
	   ``The parties accept that in good faith their recollections
differ about the circumstances leading to Mr. Wingfield's
resignation,'' a joint statement on the settlement said.

Thai fighters win three golds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai fighters, cheered on by ecstatic
flag-waving fans and Santa Claus, gave the home crowd a present
with three wins in three bouts at the Asian Games Thursday.
	   Thailand won half of the Asian Games boxing gold medals on offer
Thursday.
	   Uzbekistan had four fighters in action, but only heavyweight
Ruslan Chagaev was a winner. India and Kazakstan also won one each,
with six more golds to be decided Friday night.
	   In light-flyweight division, Thailand's Suban Punon defeated
China's Yang Xiang-zhong 14-1, bringing the near-packed auditorium
to its feet.
	   The first on the card, Suban, like other Thai fighters, was led
to the ring by trainers and teammate, a man dressed in a Santa
Claus outfit and a comedian, as scores of local press surrounded
around him, filming his every step.
	   It was an action packed five rounds, with the Chinese fighter
taking the fight up to the Thai, whose counter punches and vicious
right hand proved too much.
	   The bronze medal went to North Korea's Pak Chun and South
Korea's Kim Sun-soo.
	   In bantamweight division, India's Dingko Singh defeated
Uzbekistan's Timur Tuylyakov, whose trainers threw in the towel.
	   Singh, who defeated Thailand's Sontaya Wongprathes 18-14 three
nights ago to qualify for the final, was warmly greeted by the
homecrowd as he bowed down in a Thai traditional style after his
victory. His superior hand speed and footwork proved too much for
the Uzbek fighter.
	   Sontaya and Kazakstan's Marat Mazimbayev won the bronze.
	   In lightweight division, Thailand southpaw Pongsit Wiangwesas
defeated Uzbekistan's Temur Suleymanov 8-2.
	   The Thai fighter started off conservatively, moving side to side
and countering with stiff left.
	   In the last two rounds, Suleymanov took the fight to the Thai
but kept running into to stiff jab, followed by straight right that
frustrated him from time to time.
	   ``I don't mind about the low scores. He kept walking into my
punches and I kept doing my own thing and kept to my game plan,''
said Pongsit, who carried his baby boy to the press conference.
	   Mongolia's T. Uitumen and South Korea's Shin Eun-chul shared the
bronze.
	   In the welterweight division, another southpaw Thai boxer
Parkpoom Jangphonak defeated Kazakstan's Zurzhan Smanov 10-4.
	   Parkpoom dropped Smanov in the first round with a hard left and
continue to frustrate the Kazak fighter with counter punches.
	   ``I felt some pressure coming into the fight because of the home
crowd. But after the first round, I knew I would win,'' Parkpoom
said. ``He was too slow.''
	   South Korea's Bae Ho-jo and Uzbekistan's Nariman Ataeu won the
bronze.
	   Kazakstan Vyacheslav Burba defeated Dilshod Yarbekov 6-5 in an
all-out five-round brawl to win the middleweight gold. Both
fighters slugged it out for nearly every second of the five rounds.
The bronze went to South Korea's Kim Ho-chul and Syria's Mohammad
Kadour.
	   In what appeared to be the biggest mismatch on the card,
Uzbekistan's heavyweight Chagaev defeated Pakistan's Muzaffar
Mirza.
	   Referee gave Mirza a standing eight count after several blows
were delivered to Mirza's head and stopped the fight shortly
afterwards.
	   Iran's Rohollah Hosseini and Jordan's Mohd Abukhadijeh received
the bronze.

In search of peace in warring Africa

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Insurgents, dignitaries,
presidents and prime ministers gathered in Burkina Faso's capital
Thursday in search of seemingly elusive peace on a continent
scarred by war.
	   Delegates from the Organization of African Unity began closed
door talks that will focus on conflicts from the Congo and Angola
to the Horn of Africa, where Ethiopia and Eritrea continue to
grapple over a land dispute.
	   Citing the OAU's charter, Burkina Faso's President Blaise
Compaore said African nations must take responsibility for their
future to ensure peace and security for development.
	   ``As we near the end of the 20th century, with certain regions
of our continent facing crisis and complexity we must ask the
question of ourselves: `What have we done to reach this
objective?''' Compaore said during the summit's opening ceremony.
	   The theme of the gathering _ peace and conflict resolution _
appeared lost, however, on summit security agents and Chadian
presidential bodyguards who began brawling on the front steps of
the conference center.
	   The fight began when the Chadians were told they could not
accompany their president into the conference center.
	   With delegates arriving for a red carpet reception, the battling
bodyguards rolled in the the dirt while grappling over a loose
handgun that was tossed through the air like a hot potato.
	   Several members of Chad's security team were subdued by
commandos clad in black ski masks.
	   The fight outside of the peace summit delayed the start of the
opening ceremonies.
	   Of central focus during the talks is Congo, where at least five
countries are embroiled in bitter fighting.
	   Congolese President Laurent Kabila was among other warring
leaders attending the summit.
	   A rebel uprising earlier this year threatened to topple Kabila's
regime until troops and warplanes from Angola and Zimbabwe
intervened on the government's behalf.
	   Rwandan and Ugandan backing has helped prop up the rebel
movement, which continues to control portions of eastern Congo.
	   Heads of state or delegates representing all sides, including a
team from the rebels, are in Ouagadougou for the two-day meeting.
	   ``What we've done at this meeting is invite everyone,'' a senior
official from OAU host country Burkina Faso said on condition of
anonymity. ``We want to make every chance for a breakthrough
possible.''
	   Congo is not the only scene of fighting on the continent.
Ethiopia and Eritrea continue to search for a resolution to their
territorial dispute; rebels and government troops in Guinea-Bissau
are locked in a tense standoff; and Angola's longstanding rebel war
is lurching back into gear.
	   And there are more, including growing hostilities in the
Republic of Congo, where government forces are battling an outlawed
militia force called the Ninjas.

Killy calls for quick action to restore credibility of IOC
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to fix slug
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Expressing shock at the latest allegations of
corruption in the Olympic movement, French IOC member Jean-Claude
Killy said Thursday the movement needs to act quickly and firmly to
restore credibility.
	   The Olympic movement is in shock following Marc Hodler's
allegations of corruption in the bidding and selection process for
host cities.
	   Hodler, a high-ranking International Olympic Committee member,
claimed misconduct in Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002
winter games, describing a scholarship fund formed by organizers as
a bribe.
	   He then escalated the scandal by alleging misconduct in the
awarding of the summer games to Atlanta (1996) and Sydney (2000)
and winter games to Nagano (1998).
	   Killy, attending the official launch of Paris' bid to stage the
2008 games, said he was surprised at the breadth of Hodler's
allegations.
	   ``I am surprised he spoke about Atlanta. There is only proof in
the case of Salt Lake City,'' Killy told The Associated Press.
``Hodler has generalized, and I don't like to do that.''
	   Killy serves on the IOC's finance and the Salt Late City control
committee, both chaired by Hodler, and headed Albertville's
successful bid for the 1992 Winter Games.
	   ``Hodler is very honest and I have enormous respect for him,''
Killy said. ``But what he said surprised me.''
	   Killy, a French IOC member, expects a new system of host city
selection to be in place by 2001, the year when the 2008 venue will
be decided.
	   Hodler's suggestion of taking the decision away from the general
IOC membership and assigning it to a smaller panel has its merits,
Killy said.
	   But he added that concentrating decision-making would prove
controversial.
	   ``The universalism of the Olympic movement is very important,''
he said. ``I believe that the IOC will take adequate measures. But
it must act quickly. We must face a real problem.''
	   Killy said he personally was unaware of corruption in the
selection of host venues. However, ``I am not saying that it
doesn't exist,'' he added.
	   Organizers of the Paris bid sought to separate themselves from
the scandal rocking the Olympic movement.
	   ``It doesn't worry me,'' said Paris mayor Jean Tiberi at the
launch. ``It changes nothing.''
	   Other candidates for the 2008 games include early favorite
Beijing; Toronto; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Buenos Aires, Argentina;
Istanbul, Turkey; Osaka, Japan, and Seville, Spain.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police have busted three counterfeiting
rings that smuggled in dlrs 145 million in fake U.S. dollars,
German marks and Chinese yuan, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported Thursday.
	   Police arrested 13 people from Taiwan and China in raids dating
back to July, Xinhua said.
	   One of those arrested, Yang Jimao, was sentenced to death in
September in southwestern Sichuan province for smuggling dlrs 26.7
million and 180 million marks (dlrs 109 million) in fake notes,
Xinhua said.
	   Maritime police in southeastern Guangdong province seized a
Taiwan fishing boat in July carrying 62.6 million counterfeit yuan
notes (dlrs 7.5 million), Xinhua said.
	   A third ring operated in northeastern Heilongjiang province and
smuggled in 18.3 million yuan (dlrs 2.2 million).
	   No details were given on the source of the counterfeit currency.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain on Thursday for attacking Iraq and demanded an
immediate end to the bombing, warning it could shatter hopes of
peace in the Middle East.
	   ``Russia demands an immediate end to military action, to show
common sense and restraint and not to allow further escalation of
the conflict which could result in the most dramatic consequences
not only for the Iraqi settlement but for the stability of the
entire region,'' Yeltsin said in a statement.
	   The United States and Britain launched air and missile attacks
against Iraq early Thursday in response to Saddam Hussein's
continued defiance of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   In response, Russia's parliament urged the government Thursday
to increase funding for the country's military and defense
industry. The State Duma voted 394-1 to give tentative approval to
the non-binding resolution.
	   Russian television channels showed Yeltsin looking at maps of
the Middle East and talking with several generals and senior aides.
The president spent most of Wednesday night monitoring the
situation, aides said.
	   Russia has consistently opposed military action against Iraq, an
old ally of the Soviet Union, and attempted to find a political
solution to the dispute. But Moscow is no longer a global
superpower and is able to do little more than protest U.S. actions,
goading Russian frustration.
	   Yeltsin discussed the situation in a phone call with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin. The two leaders agreed that the attack was
``unacceptable, unilateral and contradicting the U.N. charter and
the principles of international law,'' the Kremlin press service
said.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov also sharply denounced
the United States and Britain and said Russia would work in the
United Nations to end the attacks.
	   ``This time the activities of the U.S. and Great Britain have
not been provoked by Iraq. The U.S. administration has the strikes
on its conscience,'' said Primakov, who has had close ties with
Iraq for many years.
	   Parliamentary leaders also denounced the attacks, with Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov saying, ``This is international banditry
that must be sharply denounced.''
	   Vladimir Zhirinovsky, an ultranationalist leader and a
long-standing supporter of Saddam, called for Russia to
unilaterally stop abiding by the sanctions against Iraq, and
temporarily recall its ambassador to the United States, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Zhirinovsky, who is given to flamboyant remarks, also called
U.S. President Bill Clinton an ``international bandit who ought to
be tried.''
	   Yeltsin said only a political and diplomatic solution would
solve the impasse over Iraq and he condemned the attack as
unprovoked.
	   ``The settlement of the Iraq problem is possible only through
political and diplomatic means on the basis of preserving the
resolutions of the security council of the United Nations and
international law,'' he said.
	   The Yeltsin statement was highly critical of Washington and
London, underlining how relations have declined in the past year or
two.
	   ``The fact that the states which performed this forceful action
did not find it possible to continue the search for settling the
crisis through political means causes indignation,'' the statement
added.

Two believed killed in crash of Eritrean training plane

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ An Eritrean air force training plane
crashed about 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of the capital Asmara,
killing the two pilots, an official said Thursday.
	   A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the crash occurred Tuesday, and a diplomat, who also asked not to
be identified, said the plane was a Finnish Rodigo trainer.
	   The official said one of the pilots was Eritrean; the diplomat
said the other was believed to be Rwandan.
	   No other details were available.
	   Eritrea recently obtained as many as 10 MiG-29 jet fighters.
Prior to the crash, the air force also had six Italian Aermacchi
trainers converted to attack aircraft, eight Rodigo trainers and
two Mi-17 helicopters.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ The German eagle landed Thursday in the historic
Reichstag, bigger and heavier than he was in Bonn.
	   Parliamentary president Wolfgang Thierse oversaw the unveiling
of the 2 1/2 ton aluminum bird, symbol of Germany, in the
Reichstag's assembly hall.
	   The installation is part of the final rush of renovations to the
long-empty building in preparation for next year's government move.
Parliament hopes to hold its first session in the newly renovated
building in April.
	   At 8.5 by 6.8 meters (26 by 21 feet), the eagle is almost 60
percent bigger than its counterpart in the parliament building in
Bonn.
	   The British architect responsible for the Reichstag renovation,
Sir Norman Foster, wanted to redesign it for the new building, but
the heirs of the original artist, Ludwig Gies, objected.
	   They did, however, allow Foster to add a backside to the bird,
since it hangs in front of a glass wall in Berlin.

Meissnitzer and Goetschl face-off in weekend double downhills
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix garble &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ World Cup leader Alexandra
Meissnitzer of Austria will fight off the challenge of teammate
Renate Geotschl this weekend as the alpine ski circuit moves to
Switzerland for back-to-back downhills.
	   But Geotschl, the winner of both races in the season opening
downhill double-header in Lake Louise, Canada, last month, won't be
the only threat to Meissnitzer's lead.
	   A slalom and the season's first combined could allow several
other skiers to jump into contention for the coveted overall crown
as the White Circus heads into its short Christmas break.
	   As her compatriot Hermann Maier did last year on the men's
circuit, Meissnitzer has unexpectedly leapt to the fore-front of
the women's scene this season, winning 4-of-10 races so far,
grabbing a substantial lead in the overall standings.
	   Winner of back-to-back races in Val d'Isere last weekend, the
Austrian will attempt to add to her 625-point total in the overall
rankings by recording her first career downhill victory.
	   The 25-year-old Austrian holds a whopping 242 advantage over her
closest challenger Martina Ertl of Germany.
	   ``When I stand at the start I just feel nothing can go wrong,''
said Meissnitzer, the giant slalom runnerup and super-G bronze
medallist at the Nagano Olympics last February. ``My confidence is
thriving. I have no doubts in my head.
	   ``There's only one way to go when I'm in this state and that's
by taking all the risks. I can't explain it. I'm just on a roll.''
	   But while Meissnitzer exterted her dominance in both the super-G
and giant slalom this season, leading in both disciplines, she has
yet to show the same skill in skiing's glamor event, finishing
fifth and third in the Lake Louise downhills.
	   Goetschl, meanwhile, has indicated she's unready to give up her
current reign in the downhill, posting the fastest time in
Wednesday's training run.
	   But while Austrian skiers have won 7-of-10 events this season,
the fight is hardly limited to the one nation.
	   Also factoring into the equation is Italy's Isolde Kostner,
runnerup behind Goetschl in Lake Louise, and third in Wednesday's
training.
	   All-rounder Pernilla Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup
champion, will banish last year's injury-plagued campaign from her
mind as she seeks her first win of the season, in a fresh attempt
at a second overall crown.
	   Ertl, ever in the shadow of her illustrious teammate, World Cup
overall champion Katja Seizinger, is taking advantage of her
compatriot's season-long absence due to knee injury to pursue her
long-time dream.
	   Runnerup in the overall in 1996 and last year, Ertl has made it
clear she intends to make the title hers this time around.
	   ``Of course I'm going for the overall,'' said Ertl, the World
Cup giant slalom champion last season.
	   ``I'm astonished at my results in the downhill,'' said Ertl, who
finished fourth and seventh in the season's two downhills. ``I hope
my skills in the slalom will give me an edge in the overall.''
	   The German will get an extra opportunity this weekend, with the
slalom also counting towards a combined event.
	   Meissnitzer, though hinting she may race in the combined events,
generally shies away from the slalom, giving her opponents an extra
jump in the chase for the overall crown.
	   The event will give Goetschl, the reigning combined champion,
and Wiberg, the 1994 Olympic gold medallist in the event, another
chance for vauable points.

Ortlieb outpaces Ghedina in final downhill practice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Veteran Patrick Ortlieb, pushing hard
and taking risks to get a place on the Austrian team, outpaced
Christian Ghedina and Werner Franz Thursday in the final practice
for consecutive World Cup downhill races in Val Gardena.
	   The 31-year-old Austrian, a former Olympic champion, took
advantage of racing at one of his favorite tracks as he led the run
in two minutes, 4.40 seconds, reaching peak speeds of up to 120
kph.
	   Ortlieb's time down the 3,495-meter long Saslong course,
dropping 839 meters, was nearly five seconds faster than the best
time of Wednesday's practice set by his teammate Fritz Strobl.
	   Strobl did not finish Thursday's run as he fell at the S-shaped
Ciaslat bend. He escaped unhurt.
	   ``No doubt I like this course,'' said Ortlieb, who clinched two
of his four World Cup career wins in Val Gardena, in 1993 and 1995.
	   ``The track was icy and much faster than yesterday. The jumps
are demanding and I expect a close, tough race tomorrow,'' said
Ortlieb, who won the Olympic downhill title in 1992.
	   Friday's downhill makes up for the season opener canceled in
Whistler Mountain, Canada, earlier this month. Saturday's race is
the original Val Gardena downhill, the third of the World Cup
season, in northeast Italy.
	   Ghedina, the defending champion in Val Gardena, trailed the
Austrian veteran by 0.15 seconds in second place.
	   ``Practice is like a race for the Austrians, who need to
qualify. They are always very fast,'' said Ghedina, who's seeking
his first season win. ``I made several mistakes at the bumps, and
I'm really surprised with my second place today. But I feel
competitive for the race.''
	   Franz, one of the five Austrians to finish within the top 11,
came in third, 0.41 seconds behind.
	   Franco Cavegn edged his younger Swiss teammate Ambrosi Hoffmann
for fourth place.
	   Hoffmann, a 1996 world junior champion, was third in Wednesday's
practice and was considered a potential threat to the favored
starters.
	   Olympic downhill champion Jean-Luc Cretier of France came in
sixth, 0.67 seconds behind Ortlieb.
	   ``I'm skiing well and I have high hopes for the two races
here,'' the Frenchman said.
	   Defending World Cup champion Hermann Maier and overall leader
Stephan Eberharter, both of Austria, did not take risks as they
finished 17th and 19th respectively, nearly two seconds slower than
Ortlieb. Both were among the 10 Austrians qualified for the
back-to-back downhills.
	   Eberharter enters Friday's race with 368 points.
	   Norwegian Lasse Kjus, a surprise winner in last Saturday's
downhill at Val d'Isere, and Maier have 313 and 280 points overall.
	   Kjus placed 13th in Thursday's practice, in a tie with Canada's
Brian Stemmle, the top north American finisher.
	   Stemmle said he was not afraid following Wednesday's accident
which possibly knocked out his teammate Ed Podivinsky for the rest
of the season.
	   Podivinsky torn his left knee cruciate ligament.
	   ``You know it can happen every day in downhill ... I love this
course. I can do well here,'' said Stemmle, who finished three
times among the top ten in Val Gardena.
	   Chad Fleischer was the best American in 23rd place, still losing
13 places from the previous day.
	   Friday's race is scheduled to start at 1130gmt.

	   Russia and China had called for a halt to the attacks, but U.S.
President Bill Clinton suggested the strikes may continue.
	   Earlier, a sense of normalcy had returned to the streets of the
Iraqi capital in sharp contrast to the air raid sirens and
antiaircraft fire that punctuated the night.
	   Government employees went to their offices, and young children
headed to school. Morning traffic jams clogged some of the streets
in downtown Baghdad, although fewer cars were out than usual.
	   Baghdad residents, however, lined up at gas stations to stock up
on fuel, a sign that more attacks were expected.
	   ``We are expecting the worst of Clinton because we have
discovered that he has no humanitarian principles,'' said Riad
Mamdouh al-Samarai, 36, as he stood at one station.

	   The strikes were met with defiance in Iraqi newspapers.
	   ``Iraqis are pulling together to go forward to bury the strikes
of aggression and continue their new crusade to teach the enemy
lessons, which they will never forget,'' al-Qadissiya, a government
newspaper, said in an editorial.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein visited some of the targeted
sites Thursday, including the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad

safe, but the house was demolished, it said.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their

Muslim fasting month of Ramadan begins this weekend
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The world's 1 billion Muslims begin the fasting month of Ramadan
this weekend, during which they abstain from food, drink, smoking
and sex from dusk to dawn as an act of sacrifice and purification.
	   Out of deference to allies in the Muslim world, President Bill
Clinton said he launched his air and missile attacks on Iraq so as
not to coincide with the beginning of Ramadan.
	   Ramadan _ which marks God's revelation of the Koran, Islam's
holy book, to the Prophet Mohammed some 1,400 years ago _ begins
Saturday or Sunday, depending on the sighting of the moon.
	   Most clerics expect Ramadan to begin Sunday in Iraq and in most
of the 53 member states of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, which represents the world's Muslim populace.
	   Since Ramadan's timing is based on the lunar calendar _ shorter
than the Western Gregorian one _ its dates change each year.
	   Ramadan lasts 29 or 30 days, again depending on the sighting of
the crescent moon. The fast will end with the three-day feast of
Eid al-Fitr, one of the Muslim world's biggest holidays.
	   Muslim countries begin and end Ramadan with a difference of a
day because they rely on their own clerics' sighting of the moon.
	   Iran, which is predominantly of the Shiite Muslim sect, usually
begins and ends Ramadan a day after most Sunni Muslim countries.
	   Throughout the month of Ramadan, extended families gather at
sunset, awaiting the blast of a cannon or the start of the evening
prayer that allows them to break their fast.
	   In Iraq, people who eat, drink or smoke in public during the day
face up to one month in prison during Ramadan.
	   Police can arrest people who eat in public in the more observant
Muslim countries like Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi
Arabia. In Bahrain, violators can be punished by having their heads
shaved. In Saudi Arabia, foreign violators are deported.

Israel deploys Patriot batteries; security Cabinet meets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to UPDATE with Patriot anti-missile systems
deployed, Netanyahu convening security Cabinet &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Just hours after the United States bombed Iraq,
Israel deployed Patriot anti-missile batteries Thursday as defense
against possible attack by Baghdad and Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu met with key Cabinet ministers to map strategy.
	   Netanyahu said Israel does not want to get involved in the
escalating U.S.-Iraqi conflict, but reserved the right to defend
itself if attacked by Iraq. ``We have no intention of being part of
this conflict, but we are preparing for every eventuality,''
Netanyahu told Israel radio.
	   In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein fired 39 Scud
missiles at Israel after being attacked by the United States. At
the time, Saddam hoped to provoke an Israeli response and thus
break up the Arab coalition that had formed against him. However,
at the urging of the United States, Israel did not strike back.
	   Israeli military commanders said Thursday that the probability
of an Iraqi strike was very low. However, if pushed to the verge of
collapse by U.S. airstrikes, Saddam might fire missiles with
chemical or biological warheads at Israel, said Gen. Amos Gilad,
the head of research in Israel's military intelligence.
	   ``If he is on the brink of extinction, he certainly may take
suicidal steps involving the launching of a few missiles against
Israel,'' Gilad told a news conference.
	   The army said it would open 65 gas mask distribution stations by
the end of the day and called on the public to check whether gas
masks were still serviceable or had to be replaced.
	   Israelis were first given gas masks in the weeks before the Gulf
War when Saddam threatened to hit Israel with chemical weapons. He
did not make good on his threat, firing missiles with conventional
warheads instead.
	   Netanyahu said U.S. President Bill Clinton raised the
possibility of a U.S. attack on Iraq already on Tuesday when he
first learned that Iraq was not cooperating with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   On Thursday, Netanyahu convened his so-called security Cabinet,
including Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon, to map strategy.
	   Gilad, the intelligence officer, said that in spite of Iraq's
denials, it still possesses a few missile launchers, several dozen
missiles and a chemical warfare capability.
	   The army announced a decision to deploy Patriot anti-missile
systems. Israel TV's Channel Two said Patriot batteries were moved
Thursday from sparsely populated southern Israel to central Israel
and near the northern port city of Haifa.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Following the American and
British-led air strikes against Baghdad, the Prague-based Radio
Free Europe/Radio Liberty has amplified its broadcasts to Iraq, an
official said Thursday.
	   ``We had two hours of live broadcast to Iraq overnight, but we
also strengthened our Russian and Iranian broadcasts and broadcast
to Central Asia,'' CTK news agency quoted RFE spokeswoman Sonia
Winter as saying.
	   Winter said that for the time being, the Iraqi program will be
extended from two hours to four hours daily.
	   The U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty began
transmitting from Munich, Germany, in 1951, spreading uncensored
news to Soviet-controlled countries behind the Iron Curtain during
the Cold War between the West and the Communist East.
	   It moved its headquarters to Prague in 1995 following the
collapse of communism six years earlier.
	   In October, the Czech government allowed broadcasts into Iraq,
and the Farsi-language service into Iran was approved in August.
The government, however, expressed serious concerns about possible
security risks.
	   Following the airstrikes Thursday, the Czech Interior Ministry
has adopted extra security measures around the radio's building in
downtown Prague following the air strikes, CTK said.

U.S. bombards Iraq through the night: 2 killed, 30 injured

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States fired hundreds of
missiles on Iraq Thursday in attacks that lasted through the night,
and Baghdad shook with explosions and anti-aircraft gunfire. Two
people were killed and 30 were wounded, a doctor said.
	   Air raid sirens sounded again Thursday afternoon. It was the
first time since attacks ended early Thursday morning. But no
explosion were heard, and no antiaircraft guns were fired, either.
	   Russia and China had called for a halt to the attacks, but U.S.
President Bill Clinton suggested the strikes would continue.
	   Earlier, a sense of normalcy had returned to the streets of the
Iraqi capital in sharp contrast to the sirens and antiaircraft fire
that had punctuated the night.
	   Government employees went to their offices, and young children
headed to school. Morning traffic jams clogged some of the streets
in downtown Baghdad, although fewer cars were out than usual.
	   Baghdad residents, however, lined up at gas stations to stock up
on fuel, a sign that more attacks were expected.
	   ``We are expecting the worst of Clinton because we have
discovered that he has no humanitarian principles,'' said Riad
Mamdouh al-Samarai, 36, as he stood at one station.
	   The strikes were met with defiance in Iraqi newspapers.
	   ``Iraqis are pulling together to go forward to bury the strikes
of aggression and continue their new crusade to teach the enemy
lessons, which they will never forget,'' al-Qadissiya, a government
newspaper, said in an editorial.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein visited some of the targeted
sites Thursday, including the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad
Radio reported. Hala, the youngest of his three daughters, was
safe, but the house was demolished, it said.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said.
	   Air raid sirens had broken the night's silence minutes before a
barrage of anti-aircraft fire lit up the Baghdad sky at 12:49 a.m.
(2149 GMT Wednesday), unleashing thunderous blasts like a fireworks
display and shaking windows of buildings.
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known.
	   Witnesses said another missile landed in the neighborhood of
al-Adil, about two kilometers (one mile) from Abu Ghraib where a
sprawling military camp and radio relay stations are located.
	   Both of Iraq's television stations were not broadcasting
Thursday afternoon, and three of four official radio stations were
off the air. It was not clear whether they were destroyed.
	   One stray missile hit an Iranian city, Tehran radio reported.
	   Sirens were heard twice in Baghdad, and anti-aircraft guns were
fired four times during the night. As the sounds of the last
barrage at 5:18 a.m. (0218 GMT) faded, a call for prayer floated
over the winter morning from a mosque loudspeaker.
	   Clinton said he ordered the strikes on military and security
targets to retaliate for Iraq's defiance of the U.N. Special
Commission, which is responsible for eliminating the country's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological weapons,'' he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he authorized the
participation of British forces.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in his radio
address, saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face''
but ``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   An Iraqi newspaper, Babil, suggested Clinton launched the attack
to divert attention from his impeachment hearings.
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the al-Yarmouk Hospital in Baghdad,
said two people were killed and more than 30 were wounded,
suffering mostly burns in the face, hands and legs. But the full
casualty toll was not known, and there was no official word.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
mumbled Salam Mohammed, 34, as he moaned on his hospital bed, his
face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Unlike a previous U.S. attack on the city in 1993, there was no
blackout this time. The streets were brightly lit, as were many
homes when the attack began.
	   The total damage from the attack could not be immediately
assessed, although residents in an Iranian town reportedly saw
thick smoke rising from targets across the border in Iraq.
	   Iraqi officials took foreign reporters to Karada, an upscale
commercial and residential neighborhood, where a missile had
landed. The blast burst water mains in a street, flooding a
two-kilometer (one-mile) stretch of a street.
	   Karada is across the Tigris River from the Old Presidential
Complex, but it was not clear if the palace was damaged.
	   Foreign reporters, who are based at a press center in downtown
Baghdad and can travel around the city only with a government
escort, were given selective access to the damage.
	   In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain for the attack and demanded an immediate end to
the campaign, warning it could shatter regional security.
	   At a Security Council meeting, the ambassadors of Russia and
China, both sympathetic to Iraq, urged an end to the attacks.
	   Staunch American allies _ Germany, Canada and even Japan _
supported the strikes.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the events a ``sad day
for the world,'' saying he did everything in his power to seek
peace. But he didn't say whether the attacks were justified.
	   In his speech, Clinton said the campaign against Iraq will be a
``strong sustained series of airstrikes,'' indicating that more
punishing strikes are likely in the next few days.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   In the attacks, the warships fired hundreds of Tomahawk cruise
missiles, and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck against Iraqi air
defense radars, Pentagon officials said.
	   The United States hopes the attacks will achieve what the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, says it has not been able to achieve
in seven years of work: destroy Iraq's ability to produce weapons
of mass destruction, specifically chemical and biological arms.
	   ``Instead of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam is
disarming the inspectors,'' Clinton said.
	   The U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until the
inspectors certify that Iraq is free of chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles and programs to build them.
	   Iraq accuses the chief inspector, Richard Butler, of being a
U.S. puppet who is deliberately prolonging the sanctions.
	   Butler withdrew all his weapons inspectors from Baghdad on
Wednesday, accusing Iraq of going back on its promise last month to
cooperate fully with UNSCOM. That promise had saved Iraq from an
imminent U.S. attack on Nov. 14.
	   Many of the U.N. humanitarian staff remained in Iraq, and their
spokesman, George Somerwill, said they had received no instructions
to evacuate. He said 133 U.N. staff were still in Baghdad and 233
staff had stayed in northern Iraq.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's foreign exchange reserves are the
third highest in the world at U.S. dlrs 88.6 billion, monetary
officials said Thursday.
	   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority _ the territory's de facto
central bank _ said that foreign reserves fell slightly to U.S.
dlrs 88.6 billion at the end of November from U.S. dlrs 88.7
billion a month earlier.
	   Total foreign currency assets still remain the third largest in
the world after Japan's and China's, and represent ``over seven
times the currency in circulation,'' the HKMA said in a statement.
	   The Hong Kong government has come under criticism for scooping
up shares and futures contracts in mid-August in an effort to drive
up share prices to levels at which speculators _ who bet the market
would fall _ would be stuck with huge losses.
	   The government later reported that it spent U.S. dlrs 4.4
billion of its reserves in the unprecedented market intervention.
Officials claimed victory and later introduced a series of
regulations to restrict speculative activity and stabilize the
markets.

IRS seeks dlrs 6.5 million from Nicole Brown Simpson estate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The U.S. federal tax agency wants the estate
of Nicole Brown Simpson to pay dlrs 6.5 million in taxes, a claim
based on a dlrs 12 million civil judgment against O.J. Simpson that
was never paid, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.
	   Brown said Wednesday he is appealing the Internal Revenue
Service demand, which was made in September, because ex-football
star O.J. Simpson has ``not paid one penny'' of the dlrs 12 million
wrongful-death judgment against him.
	   ``There's been no money collected, and no basis for that lien.
So we said, `IRS, you're nuts,''' said Louis H. Brown, Ms.
Simpson's father and administrator of her trust.
	   The estate, created to support the Simpsons' two children,
petitioned the U.S. Tax Court in Washington last week to intervene
after failing to reach an agreement with IRS officials, Brown said.
	   IRS spokeswoman Laurie Kellerman said the agency is seeking to
collect dlrs 6.5 million in estate taxes, but declined to comment
further. Lawyers for Simpson also declined comment.
	   O.J. Simpson was ordered to pay dlrs 33.5 million to the estates
and heirs of Ms. Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. The two
were knifed to death June 12, 1994.
	   Simpson was acquitted of murder, but a civil jury found him
liable for the deaths and awarded the victims' families dlrs 33.5
million in damages.

British tour operators evacuate tourists from Red Sea resort
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By REVITAL LEVY STEIN
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EILAT, Israel (AP) _ Fearing a possible Iraqi missile attack
against Israel, British tourist operators evacuated their clients
from this Red Sea resort Thursday while airline companies postponed
flights to Israel.
	   Air 2000 and Britannia sent shuttle buses to Eilat hotels to
collect 600-700 of their passengers to be flown back on specially
arranged flights.
	   ``I had 12 British tourists on a scuba diving course and the
representatives of the British tour operators came and ordered them
back to their hotels to pack,'' said Uri Prigal, director of
Eilat's Red Sea Sports Club. ``They practically peeled the rubber
suits off them.''
	   Airline companies told their clients that if they didn't leave
Thursday, they would forfeit their seats on the flights, said Clive
Newton of Longwood Holidays, one of the tour companies evacuating
the tourists.
	   ``This is ridiculous,'' said Julius Benton as he waited for the
shuttle bus to bring him to the airport. ``I feel less safe in
Manchester.''
	   Michelle Peters of London, who not flying with the British
airline companies, planned to stay in Eilat with her husband and
newborn baby.
	   ``We're close to Jordan and Egypt,'' she said. ``Eilat is the
safest place in the area.''
	   The British government, like the United States, has advised its
citizens not to travel to Israel but has not instructed those
already there to return home.
	   A British Airways Boeing 777 due to arrive in Israel Wednesday
night was held until Thursday because of the bombings, British
Airways confirmed.
	   And a Swiss Air was holding back a flight scheduled to land
after sundown Thursday until Friday morning, presumably when an
anticipated U.S. air strike Thursday night would be over, Swiss Air
spokeswoman Dorit Tzup said.
	   While some Israeli tourists in Eilat also packed their bags,
others arrived for a long week-end during the Jewish holiday of
Hannukah.
	   During the 1991 Gulf War, Israelis flocked to Eilat, believing
its location at the southern tip of Israel kept it safely out of
Iraqi missile range. Iraq fired 39 scud missiles with conventional
warheads at Israel during the Gulf War, most of which landed in or
near Tel Aviv.
	   Canada also advised its citizens Thursday not to travel to
Israel or the Palestinian areas. Those already there should
``consider departing if their presence is not essential,'' the
embassy said in a statement.
	   The U.S. was evacuating all State Department personnel and their
dependents under the age of 18 or over the age of 65, U.S.
spokesman Larry Schwartz said.
	   Trying to calm visitors, the Tourism Ministry announced that
Israel had enough gas masks for all tourists visiting Israel and
that masks would be distributed if and when the need arose.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Russia and China angrily denounced the
U.S.-British attack on Iraq, while allies such as Germany and
Canada offered their immediate support, placing all blame for the
crisis on Saddam Hussein.
	   Iraq's neighbor, Iran, joined Russia and China in blasting the
use of force and warning that it could shatter regional security.
	   ``Nobody has the right to act on their own in the name of the
United Nations and even less to pretend to be the judge of the
entire world,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said in
Madrid, Spain.
	   Fearful of recriminations, the United States on Thursday closed
all but two of its African embassies, and security was stepped up
at many U.S. and British institutions worldwide, from the
Philippines to Greece and Denmark.
	   The U.S. State Department ordered the departure of some of its
embassy personnel in Kuwait and warned other Americans living there
to consider leaving.
	   The Arab League condemned the strikes, and a Gulf official said
Baghdad had reached out for Arab support to stop the attacks.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin demanded an immediate end to the
military campaign, and Chinese President Jiang Zemin also asked
U.S. President Bill Clinton to refrain from further attacks.
	   ``This is a violation of the U.N. charter and the principles of
international law, and we condemn this,'' said Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi.
	   The German government noted, however, that the Iraqi leadership
``had been warned'' the international community would have to act
if it failed to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Support for the airstrikes also poured in from Canada, Japan,
Australia, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, the Netherlands,
Austria, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic and Spain.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has brought this crisis on himself,'' Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said.
	   France, which has close ties to Iraq, deplored ``the grave human
consequences'' of the military strikes, but added its regret that
Iraqi leaders were unable to ``show proof of the spirit of complete
cooperation'' demanded by previous agreements with the United
Nations.
	   Iranian television quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying
that ``such unilateral attacks against Iraq will lead to even more
pain and misery for the people of that country and will bring about
insecurity in the region.''
	   Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi urged the U.N. Security Council to
take immediate action to prevent ``further deterioration'' of the
situation, television reported. Iran also called on Baghdad to
cooperate with the United Nations.
	   Fearing an influx of refugees, both Jordan and Turkey closed the
borders they share with Iraq. Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
expressed disappointment in the attack, but also called on Iraq to
comply.
	   In Pakistan, however, the Senate passed a resolution unanimously
condemning the airstrikes as ``an attack on humanity and the
Islamic world.'' Islamic Pakistan's right-wing religious group
called the United States ``international terrorists.''
	   India also condemned the use of force.
	   The strikes led news reports in Lebanon, where all newspaper,
radio and television stations carried news agency reports without
comment.
	   In Indonesia, the world's most populous Islamic nation, leaders
pleaded for restraint.
	   Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka backed the United
States and Britain, saying, ``We strongly demand that Iraq
immediately and unconditionally implement the U.N. Security
Council's resolutions.''
	   He was seconded by Misao Nozaki, a 47-year-old Tokyo restaurant
owner who called the bombing justified ``because Iraq has continued
developing nuclear weapons in a way that goes against the common
sense of the rest of the world.''
	   But Yukari Ohi, 38, an office worker in Tokyo, said she opposed
the use of force.
	   ``I think the U.S. decision to attack Iraq was apparently
intended to shift attention from the impeachment issue to war,''
Ohi said, noting that the airstrikes came as Clinton faced an
impeachment vote.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was noncommittal,
saying, ``Israel is outside the dispute, and in any case will take
care of defending itself if the need arises.''
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross sent a diplomatic
note to the U.S., British and Iraqi governments asking them to do
everything possible to ensure civilians and medical facilities are
unaffected by military action.

Van Gaal's job at Barcelona on the line as side faces Valladolid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ With four consecutive defeats behind him
and almost every Barcelona fan against him, Dutch coach Louis Van
Gaal could be looking for a new job this Sunday if the Spanish
powerhouse club slumps against Valladolid.
	   Among the first to be eliminated from the prestigious European
Champion's league, Barcelona lies in 10th place in the 20-team
Spanish first division, a yawning nine points behind leader
Mallorca.
	   But while club chairman Luis Nunez last week ruled out sacking
the 47-year-old Dutchman before the season is out, the fans are up
in arms.
	   Last week's 14th-round 3-1 defeat to division newcomer Villareal
had fans waving their white handkerchiefs wildly in protest.
	   The city's sports daily El Mundo Deportivo this week ran a
survey showing 86 percent of fans opposed Van Gaal continuing at
the club and most favored the return of Dutch legend Johan Cruyff,
under whom Barcelona won its only European Champions Cup in 1992.
	   Few coaches have plunged so low so fast as Van Gaal. He was
welcomed with open arms last season when he came from a glorious
spell with Ajax of Amsterdam and was pardoned the side's early exit
from the Champion's league last year as the side pummelled ahead to
take the domestic league and Spanish King's Cup.
	   But Barcelona is a demanding club and warning signs sprang up
last month when Barcelona fell again from the European Champion's
league. The first division performances exacerbated the matter.
	   ``Van Gaal has not fulfilled any of the expectations he
created,'' Spain's leading daily El Pais wrote Thursday. ``The club
cannot become healthy again as long as it keeps Van Gaal.''
	   Unable to chuckle at Barcelona's woes is fellow Dutchman Guus
Hiddink at Real Madrid which lies a poor No. 6 in the division and
six points behind Mallorca.
	   On Sunday, Madrid takes on a No. 7 Oviedo which lies just one
point behind it.
	   Meanwhile, Mallorca will be looking to hold onto the leadership
for a fifth consecutive week when it hosts lowly Racing de
Santander. Mallorca has 28 points from a an 8-4-2 record.
	   Trailing closely behind is Celta de Vigo which has 25 points as
it travels Sunday to face mid-ranking Real Sociedad.
	   Also on 25 points is Claudio Raineri's Valencia which goes to a
struggling Espanyol.
	   In Saturday's only game, No. 4 Deportivo de la Coruna, which has
23 points, receives a resurgent Betis.
	   Sunday's other 15th-round games are: Villareal vs. Athletic de
Bilbao; Atletico de Madrid vs. Zaragoza; Alaves vs. Salamanca and
Tenerife vs. Extremadura.

Bribery allegations hit games

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with track, boxing, other late medals &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ As China passed the 100 gold medal mark
at the Asian Games Thursday, one of its team leaders said Chinese
athletes had been offered bribes to lose in gold medal matches.
	   Li Furong, deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation, gave
no names or other details, but said there had been more than one
case. The president of the Olympic Council of Asia, Sheikh Ahmad
Al-Sabah, said that if the Chinese do provide names, the OCA will
order an investigation. Another Chinese official said a table
tennis player was approached, but was unable to identify the
Chinese-speaking person who made the offer.
	   Meanwhile, the Chinese kept collecting gold, winning six
Thursday _ two each in track and badminton, one in wushu and one
for a 1-0 triumph in women's soccer, on Fan Yunjie's golden goal in
the second half of extra time against North Korea.
	   That gave them 102 with two full days remaining in the games.
	   South Korea was an even bigger winner Thursday, boosting its
collection by eight to 59.
	   Japan won five and stood third with 48.
	   Thailand celebrated a 3-for-3 night by its boxers, who took half
of the night's six golds. Another six will be decided Friday, with
two more Thais on the card.
	   On Wednesday, Kuwait ended the Thai soccer team's ``miracle''
run in the semifinals, and Thursday started with Indonesia's Yayuk
Basuki beating the top seed, Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn, 6-4,
6-2 for the gold in women's singles tennis.
	   The flag-waving started soon after that, however. Brothers
Paradorn and Narathorn Srichaphan beat South Korea's Lee Hyung-taik
and Yoon Yong-il 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) for the men's doubles gold. Fans
jammed into the stadium's front row to seek autographs.
	   Thailand also won a gold in the Southeast Asian sport of sepak
takraw, beating Malaysia in the men's final. Myanmar beat Vietnam
for the women's gold.
	   Thailand now has 18 golds, well above its initial goal of 12 for
its home games.
	   On the track, Japanese sprinter Koji Ito moved toward adding the
men's 200 meters to his previous golds in the 100 and 400-meter
relay. China's Li Xuemei did likewise, qualifying for the women's
final.
	   Ito was fastest in the men's semifinal, in 20.41 seconds. Li was
second in her semifinal behind Sri Lanka's 400-meter gold medalist
Damayanthi Darsha.
	   Lee Jin-il edged South Korean compatriot Kim Soon-hyung by .05
second for the men's gold at 800 meters, completing a comeback from
a drugs ban after he had won the race at the 1994 games. Lee
maintains he took the anabolic agent in cough medicine.
	   India's Jyotirmoy Sikdhar added the women's 800 title to her
gold at 1,500 meters, finishing well ahead of teammate Rosa Kutty.
	   Kazakstan's Natalya Torshina won the women's 400-meter hurdles
in 55.33, ahead of the 55.71 for Taiwan's Hsu Pei-chin.
	   Japan finished 1-2 in the men's 400 hurdles, with Hideaki
Kawamura winning in 49.59 to 49.94 for Yoshihiko Saito.
	   China had two field event winners _ Guan Yingnan in the women's
long jump and Li Shaojie in the men's discus.
	   South Korea completed a sweep of the games' archery golds,
adding the men's and women's team titles to earlier top finishes in
the individual competition.
	   It also captured two golds in freestyle wrestling, with Iran and
North Korea each taking one. Its men's epee team won a gold medal
showdown with China.
	   In cycling, South Korea beat Kazakstan by seven seconds for the
gold in men's four-kilometer team pursuit cycling.
	   Kazakstan's Sergey Lavrenenko won the day's other cycling gold,
in the men's 40-kilometer points race, beating South Korea's Cho
Ho-sung 41 points to 34.
	   Japan won its first badminton gold at the games in 28 years as
unseeded Kanako Yonekura outsmarted No. 2 seed Gong Zhichao of
China for a 1-11, 11-5, 11-6 victory in women's singles.
	   China's Dong Jiong beat Indonesia's Hendrawan 17-14, 10-15, 15-8
for the men's singles gold, and its women's doubles pair, Ge Fei
and Gu Jun, beat Indonesians Elysa Nathanael and Deyana Lomban in
women's doubles.
	   Indonesia took the men's doubles, with defending champions Rexy
Ronald-Mainaky and Ricky Achmad-Subagdja beating Thailand's Pramote
Teerawiwatana and Siripong Siripool.
	   Mixed doubles had an all-South Korean final. Kim Dong-moon and
La Kyung-min beat Lee Dong-soo and Yim Kyung-jin.
	   India gained its second gold of the day in the doubles event of
English billiards.
	   Japan won the team jumping event of equestrian competition, and
the mixed doubles in tennis, where Satoshi Iwabuchi and Nana Miyagi
beat South Korea's Kim Dong-hyun and Choi Ju-yeon 7-5, 7-5.
	   But the Japanese took only one of the day's four golds in their
native sport of karate. Two Malaysians and an Indonesian were the
other winners.
	   Hong Kong and China split the day's two golds in the Chinese
martial art of wushu.

Serb police kill two Albanians in sweep over Kosovo slayings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with killing of two Albanians,
arrest of 11 in sweep; EDITS to trim; No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police launched a sweep
today in Kosovo where six Serbs were killed this week, arresting 11
people and killing two ethnic Albanian rebels in an ensuing
firefight, police said.
	   Gunfire and mortar fire could be heard in the rebel ethnic
Albanian stronghold of Pec in western Kosovo where police were
conducting the sweep, said a U.S. diplomatic official on condition
of anonymity.
	   The crackdown took place this morning in an outlying district of
Pec and in the nearby village of Glodjane _ a suspected stronghold
of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army _ the Serb-run Media Center in
the Kosovan capital Pristina reported, citing police sources.
	   After officers conducting the search for suspects came under
fire, the report said, police killed two people wearing camouflage
uniforms bearing the KLA insignia and armed with assault rifles and
mortars.
	   Police were said to have arrested 11 people and discovered large
quantities of arms, ammunition and KLA uniforms.
	   The sweep came in response to an attack on Monday in which
masked gunmen sprayed a Pec barroom with automatic weapons fire,
killing six Serbs.
	   The killings inflamed tensions in the already fragile truce
between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels in Serbia's
southern province, and prompted reports of harassment against
ethnic Albanians.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting to break the
province away from Serbia, denies rebel involvement in Monday's
attack.
	   But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this week to arrest
the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   The international Kosovo Verification Mission, which is
observing the cease-fire, sent several patrols to the Pec area and
American and other officials were holding talks with Serbian police
in a bid to calm both sides.
	   The barroom shootings and police sweep are the latest in a
recent wave of violence which has left dozens dead, shaking the
October truce and casting further gloom over stalled diplomatic
efforts to resolve the standoff in Kosovo. More than 1,000 people
have been killed in Kosovo since Milosevic began a crackdown on
separatists in February.
	   Serbs held a protest rally against the killings for a second
straight day today, this time in front of the headquarters of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs the
verifying force.
	   About 300 Serbs whistled derisively and booed, blaming the
verifiers for not doing enough over the barroom slaying. Mission
chief William Walker, an American diplomat, agreed to meet the
protesters on Friday.
	   The state-run Borba daily, in a sharply worded commentary,
called on the international verifiers and U.S. envoys to leave
Kosovo, calling them ``direct instigators and helpers of the crimes
committed by Albanian terrorists.''
	   On Wednesday, a policeman en route to the emotional funeral
service for the six victims reportedly shot and killed a suspected
rebel.
	   Elsewhere, ethnic Albanians complained of harassment connected
to the killings, saying Serbs had beaten schoolchildren and broken
Albanian shop windows.
	   Serbian authorities say they are willing to grant only limited
autonomy for Kosovo, while most of the overwhelmingly
Albanian-populated province want independence from Serbia _ the
dominant republic remaining in Yugoslavia.

Chancellor, new intelligence chief see threat in Iraqi weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PULLACH, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Thursday
praised the work of Germany's foreign intelligence service for its
part in helping reveal Saddam Hussein's weapons program in Iraq.
	   Speaking at the appointment ceremony of his new BND chief for
foreign intelligence, August Hanning, in the Munich suburb of
Pullach, Schroeder said the ``proliferation of mass destruction
weapons is perhaps the greatest threat to world peace.''
	   Hanning, 52, was previously responsible for intelligence matters
in the chancellery in Bonn. He replaces fromer BND chief Hansjoerg
Geiger, 56, who has been appointed a state secretary in the Justice
Ministry.
	   In accepting the new job, Hanning said Iraq continues to seek
options to acquire mass destruction weapons and rockets. The danger
exists that Germany ``more so earlier than later could be within
the range of these weapons.''
	   The sooner a government knows about such developments, the more
room it has for political maneuvering, Schroeder said. That has
been shown by efforts in India, Pakistan or Iraq. ``I have already
seen some impressive results from the service'' of the BND, he
said.
	   He said the importance of the BND's work would grow and that it
would have a larger representation when the government relocates to
Berlin next year.
	   In addition to keeping tabs on atomic, biological and chemical
weapons, Schroeder said other areas the intelligence service must
watch for are potential terrorist attacks such as those carried out
against U.S. embassies in Africa this year.
	   Other areas to watch were illegal alien smuggling, the drug
mafia and money laundering because all are a threat to the
integrity of democratic nations, Schroeder said.

 &UR; Russian defense minister meets Milosevic
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian sources quoting Sergeyev as criticizing
openly strikes at Iraq, defense minister leaving Yugoslavia. No
pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev met Slobodan Milosevic Thursday as the Yugoslav President
apparently sought allies and military help in his campaign against
Kosovo's Albanian separatists.
	   During the talks, the two indirectly criticized U.S. and British
airstrikes against Iraq, saying in a statement that ``the respect
of ... sovereignty and integrity should prevail over the acts which
are jeopardizing basic international principles and norms.''
	   Russian sources in Belgrade later quoted Sergeyev as saying he
and Milosevic sharply condemned the move, saying ``the ultimatum of
force without the consent of the international community destroyed
all efforts to preserve the shaky peace in the region.''
	   Sergeyev left Yugoslavia after the meeting. The defense minister
was supposed proceed to a NATO-Russia meeting in Brussels, Belgium,
but was summoned to urgent consultations in Russia as a result of
the Iraqi crisis.
	   Those acts ``have far-reaching consequences for peace, stability
and cooperation in the world,'' the statement from Milosevic's
office said.
	   It added that Milosevic and Sergeyev called for a peaceful
solution of the Kosovo crisis, ``which excludes any existence of
terrorism, as well as the support for separatism'' in the troubled
Serbian province.
	   Milosevic and his officials regularly accuse the United States
and other Western envoys active in the region of supporting ethnic
Albanian ``terrorists and separatists'' who want to secede Kosovo
from the dominant Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   Despite an international arms embargo stemming from the Kosovo
crisis, Yugoslavia has been seeking Russian political and military
aid to combat ethnic Albanians fighting to secede the province,
Yugoslav military sources said.
	   The Russian sources, who declined to be identified said Sergeyev
refused to talk about possible delivery of Russian weapons because
of the embargo.
	   Since February, more than 1,000 people have been killed and up
to 300,000 others forced from their homes in the southern Serb
province.
	   Sergeyev arrived in Belgrade late Wednesday after visiting
Russian peace-keeping troops serving in neighboring Bosnia. He was
accompanied by several Russian generals and military experts.

Man arrested for producing child pornography
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOSSER, Netherlands (AP) _ Police have arrested a 58-year-old
man on suspicion of child abuse and producing child pornography in
the latest in a series of child sex scandals to hit the
Netherlands.
	   The man was arrested Thursday in this eastern Dutch village just
across the border from Germany after investigators discovered child
pornography videos in which he was recognizable, television news
reported.
	   No further details were immediately available. The arrested
man's identity was not released, in line with Dutch privacy laws.
	   In July, police broke up a Netherlands-based pedophilia ring
that allegedly spread vast amounts of child pornography around the
world via the Internet and later in the summer a civil servant at
the Justice Ministry was fired after he was found to be downloading
child pornography from the Internet and spreading it among friends.

No anonymity for ex-soldiers, Bloody Sunday investigators rule
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With NIreland-Explosion
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The soldiers who opened fire
during the worst British army killing in Northern Ireland's history
will not have their identities protected, investigators into the
event known as ``Bloody Sunday'' ruled Thursday.
	   The decision by the independent commission marked a victory for
those hoping to hold accountable the soldiers who killed 13
Catholic demonstrators in Londonderry on Jan. 30, 1972.
	   Previous British investigations into killings by soldiers have
concealed the soldiers' names, presuming that the outlawed Irish
Republican Army _ now 17 months into a cease-fire _ might single
them out for assassination.
	   Bloody Sunday is considered a seminal event in the Northern
Ireland conflict, engendering a deep-rooted bitterness toward the
British and driving scores of Catholics to join the IRA.
	   The job of the commission, appointed in January by Prime
Minister Tony Blair, is to nail down what happened 26 years ago,
when soldiers opened fire on Catholics protesting against the
internment without trial of IRA suspects.
	   The soldiers, none of whom were injured, said they had come
under sustained fire and shot at people carrying weapons. To
locals' fury, an English judicial inquiry in 1972 accepted that
contention, along with forensic evidence _ since discredited _ that
some of those slain might have been handling firearms.
	   The new investigation is to determine facts, not to lay the
ground for prosecutions of soldiers. But relatives of the dead have
hired lawyers determined to use any witness testimony as the basis
for private prosecutions.
	   The commission said it would withhold any personal details
beyond the soldiers' names and offer ``any soldier who admits that
he fired one or more live rounds on Bloody Sunday a limited form of
anonymity, under which his surname will be published but not his
forenames.''
	   The commission also said that former soldiers living in England
should expect to testify in Londonderry, Northern Ireland's
second-largest city, instead of London.
	   The body's chairman, Lord Saville, a senior English appellate
judge, said he wanted all testimony to be available for
Londonderry's citizens to hear. But he warned that he would not
tolerate heckling or intimidation of witnesses.
	   More than 100 soldiers serving in Londonderry on Bloody Sunday
have offered to testify. None expect to do so until early in 2000,
the year Saville is supposed to publish conclusions.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant extremists claimed
responsibility Thursday for bombing a rural pub _ the first
explosion of any kind in Northern Ireland since August's car-bomb
slaughter of 29 people in Omagh.
	   About a dozen customers and workers were inside the
Catholic-owned McKenna's Bar near Crumlin late Wednesday when a
blast outside knocked in six windows and left a crater at the front
door. Nobody was injured, said residents of the religiously mixed
village 10 miles (15 kms) west of Belfast.
	   A shadowy new group calling itself the Orange Volunteers claimed
responsibility in a coded telephone call to Ulster Television in
Belfast.
	   Like other hard-line Protestant groups, the organization is
hostile to April's peace accord on the grounds that it offers too
much to the Irish Republican Army, which militant Catholics
support.
	   The caller claimed the bomb had been designed ``to assassinate a
senior IRA commander ... who drinks in the bar.''

Canada's trade barriers coming down, but concerns remain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS import figure in 2nd graf - corrected by source &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Canada is moving towards free trade, but certain
areas still block developing countries, a trade report said
Thursday.
	   In its policy review of the country, the World Trade
Organization said Canada has a generally open economy although the
United States is by far its biggest trading partner, accounting for
83 per cent of exports and 67 per cent of imports.
	   ``Canada's new customs tariff, in effect since Jan. 1, 1998,
greatly simplified and rationalized its import regime,'' the report
says.
	   Nevertheless, it questioned the ``significant'' tariff
protection given Canadian producers of food products, textiles,
clothing and footwear which it said could well be keeping out
lower-priced competition from developing countries.
	   It also noted concern that Canada's elaborate system of
preferential trade partners discriminates against other countries.
	   The review said Canada's general openness and ``prudent''
economic policies have been important factors in the country's
``recent strong economic performance.''
	   ``Its multi-track approach to international trade and investment
relations has further opened up Canada's economy, and resulted in
greater competitiveness in many sectors of its economy,'' it said.
	   However, it said, Canada's trade relations continue to be
complicated by difficulties in balancing domestic pressures with
North American integration and across-the-board trade
liberalization.

German doctors, government face off on eve of strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ With a nationwide strike call for Friday,
German doctors are mounting the first major protest against the
country's new center-left government.
	   Some 110,000 doctors are being urged by Germany's main medical
association to shut their practices for the day in anger at
government plans to cap their fees. Only emergency treatment will
be available.
	   In Bonn, where lawmakers are expected to approve the measure
Friday, about 2,000 health lobbyists and doctors are expected for a
rally.
	   Health Minister Andrea Fischer on Thursday urged patients to
shun doctors who take part in the strike. She also called on state
medical authorities to consider punishing doctors who close their
doors.
	   ``I don't have the slightest understanding when doctors abuse
their patients to push through their own political interests,'' she
told Bild, the nation's most-read daily.
	   In the acrimonious debate, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
overnment argues the limits on doctors' income are a way to rein in
health care costs under Germany's generous social welfare state.
	   At the same time, the government plans to make insured patients
pay less out of their own pocket for prescription drugs.
	   Doctors have denounced the fee limits, warning they won't be
able to keep up with advances in medicine that benefit patients.
	   Karsten Vilmar, head of the German Medical Association,
triggered widespread outrage last week by claiming that lower
incomes for doctors meant patients would die sooner. He has since
apologized for the remark.
	   Under the new law, the rise in health insurance companies'
budget for doctors fees is limited to 1.2 billion marks (dlrs 720
million) next year, or about 3 percent, Fischer said.
	   ``That's no reason for such drastic actions by a long shot,''
she told Bild.

took advantage of home snow to finish a surprise first in a women's
downhill training run Thursday, leading a series of unexpected
names among the top-10.
	   Rey-Bellet, who's never cracked the top-15 in the downhill,
raised Swiss fans' hopes in view of the weekend's double-header,
crossing first in 1 minute, 42.96 seconds, edging Italy's Patrizia
Bassis by .17 seconds.
	   Still winless in the downhill but runnerup in Veysonnaz in 1993,
France's Regine Cavagnoud clocked the third-fastest time of
1:43.30, ahead of Norway's Trude Gimle, fourth with a .45 deficit.
	   Current leader of the overall World Cup standings Austria's
Alexandra Meissnitzer, winner of 4-of-10 women's races since the
start of the season, finished fifth in 1:43.55.
	   Meissnitzer, who finished fifth and third in season-opening
back-to-back downhills in Lake Louise, Canada, crossed ahead of
Switzerland's Catherine Borghi, .62 back.
	   Ingeborg Helen Marken of Norway, runnerup in Wednesday's
training run, crossed seventh in 1:43.69, ahead of Italians Daniela
Ceccarelli and Bibiana Perez.
	   Seeking her first victory of the season, all-rounder Pernilla
Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup champion, was 10th, trailing by
a full 1.14.
	   Winner of both downhills this season and leader in Wednesday's
training session, Austria's Renate Geotschl ran into trouble on
Thursday, lagging back in 15th place almost a second and a half
back.

Firebomb explodes at Athens bank branch

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A firebomb exploded early Thursday at a
Commercial Bank branch in a residential Athens neighborhood,
causing damage to the bank but no injuries, police said.
	   The firebomb, consisting of 11 propane gas canisters, had been
placed beside the bank's automatic transaction machine. The
explosion destroyed the machine and caused serious damage to the
bank, located in the neighborhood of Kypseli, authorities said.
	   An anonymous caller to the independent daily Eleftherotypia said
the previously unknown ``Black Star Revolutionary Group'' claimed
responsibility for the attack, the newspaper said.
	   The bombing was carried out in a show of ``solidarity with the
Iraqi people, who are being attacked by Western imperialism,'' the
newspaper quoted the caller as saying.
	   It was unclear why the attackers targeted a Greek bank.
	   Nearly 200 similar firebombing attacks have been carried out
this year against cars and offices belonging to diplomats,
government officials, foreigners and journalists.
	   Most have been claimed by shadowy leftist groups little known to
authorities.

China beats North Korea for gold on extra-time goal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Fan Yunjie scored a golden goal in the
second half of extra time Thursday, giving China a 1-0 victory over
North Korea and the women's soccer gold medal of the Asian Games.
	   Fan's header came 20 minutes into extra time.
	   For the bronze, Japan beat Taiwan 2-1 in an earlier game.
	   Ma Yanan, manager of the Chinese Olympic silver medalist team,
expressed relief that his players finally could score after 110
minutes in a game where they were too tense.
	   ``I was so worried because our players are older than the North
Koreans,'' he said through an interpreter.
	   North Korean goalkeeper Kye Yong Sun shed tears as a silver
medal was placed around her neck.
	   Later, North Korea's team manager refused to talk to reporters.
	   The loss silenced a group of 16 cheering North Korean fans
equipped with two drums, a flag, and a banner reading ``Run at full
speed, Korea.'' They quietly left the stadium when the Chinese
national anthem was played.
	   Meanwhile, Japanese manager Satoshi Miyauchi said his team
played poorly and needs a lot of hard work before going to next
year's World Cup.
	   ``We should have made 5-0, not 2-1. I am not happy at all. We
will go back to study our today's performance,'' he said.
	   However, he blamed it partly on the illness of at least four
players.
	   ``They have a cold and diarrhea. No good,'' he said.

South Africa's population growing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's population grew
by about four percent over the past two years, the statistical
offices said Thursday.
	   Using information on fertility and death rates gathered in the
country's first door-to-door census in 1996, Statistics South
Africa said the population stood at about 42.13 million in mid
1998.
	   That figure represented a 3.8 percent increase over the 40.58
million people counted in October 1996.
	   Statistics officials said the new figure did not take into
account an expected increase in AIDS-related deaths, but they hoped
to provide such information in the future.
	   Earlier this month, a United Nations report said more than 1
million South Africans will have died of AIDS by 2001, bringing the
life expectancy down from 68 years to 48 years within the first
decade of the new millennium.
	   An estimated 3.2 million South Africans are HIV positive, or
about 12 to 14 percent of adults in South Africa.

U.S. bombards Iraq through the night: 2 killed, 30 injured

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Air raid sirens blared at dusk in Baghdad
on Thursday, signaling a new wave of expected U.S. attacks as Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein inspected the demolished remains of his
daughter's home.
	   Baghdad Radio reported Saddam visited several sites targeted by
U.S. missiles, including his daughter's house. She was safe but the
home ``was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said.
	   The United States fired more than 200 sea-launched cruise
missiles on Iraq in the largest attack on the country since 1991,
and Baghdad shook with explosions and anti-aircraft flak through
the night. Two people were killed and 30 were wounded, a doctor
said.
	   U.S. and British officials reported no casualties, and U.S. spy
satellites and U-2 spy planes flying over Iraq spent the day
assessing the damage.
	   Russia and China called for an immediate halt to the waves of
attacks that were backed by British air support, but President
Clinton suggested the strikes on Iraqi air defenses and military
and intelligence sites may continue to this weekend, when the
Muslim holy period begins.
	   A sense of normalcy returned to the streets of the Iraqi capital
during the day in sharp contrast to the air raid sirens and
anti-aircraft fire that punctuated the night and then went off
again as night fell.
	   Government employees went to their offices, and young children
headed to school. Morning traffic jams clogged some of the streets
in downtown Baghdad, although fewer cars were out than usual.
	   Baghdad residents, however, lined up at gas stations to stock up
on fuel, a sign that more attacks were expected.
	   ``We are expecting the worst of Clinton because we have
discovered that he has no humanitarian principles,'' said Riad
Mamdouh al-Samarai, 36, as he stood at one station.
	   The strikes were met with defiance in Iraqi newspapers.
	   ``Iraqis are pulling together to go forward to bury the strikes
of aggression and continue their new crusade to teach the enemy
lessons, which they will never forget,'' al-Qadissiya, a government
newspaper, said in an editorial.
	   Air raid sirens broke the night's silence minutes before a
barrage of anti-aircraft fire lit up the Baghdad sky at 12:49 a.m.
(4:40 p.m. EST Wednesday), unleashing thunderous blasts like a
fireworks display and shaking windows of buildings.
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad.
	   Witnesses said another missile landed in the neighborhood of
al-Adil, about a mile from Abu Ghraib where a sprawling military
camp and radio relay stations are located.
	   Both of Iraq's television stations were not broadcasting this
afternoon, and three of four official radio stations were off the
air. It was not clear whether they were destroyed.
	   Another newspaper, Babil, suggested Clinton launched the attacks
to divert attention from his impeachment hearings.
	   The total damage from the attack could not be immediately
assessed. Residents in an Iranian town reportedly saw thick smoke
rising from targets across the border in Iraq.
	   Iraqi officials took foreign reporters to Karada, an upscale
commercial and residential neighborhood, where they said a missile
had landed. The blast burst water mains in a street, flooding a
one-mile stretch of a street.
	   Karada is across the Tigris River from the Old Presidential
Complex, but it was not clear if the palace was damaged.
	   Foreign reporters, who are based at a press center in downtown
Baghdad and can travel around the city only with a government
escort, were given selective access to the damage.
	   The strikes were launched a day after chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler told the United Nations that Iraq had
failed to keep its promise to cooperate fully with the inspectors.
That promise had saved Iraq from an imminent U.S. attack on Nov.
14.
	   Butler withdrew all his weapons inspectors from Baghdad on
Wednesday. Although all U.N. weapons monitors also have left the
country, many U.N. humanitarian staff remained in Iraq Thursday.
Their spokesman, George Somerwill, said they had received no
instructions to evacuate. He said 133 U.N. staff had stayed in
Baghdad and 233 staff remained in northern Iraq.
	   Unlike previous U.S. attacks on the city, there was no blackout
this time. The streets were brightly lit, as were many homes when
the attack began.
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the Aliyarmouk Hospital in Baghdad,
said two people were killed and more than 30 were wounded,
suffering mostly burns in the face, hands and legs. But the full
casualty toll was not known, and there was no official word.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
mumbled Salam Mohammed, 34, as he moaned on his hospital bed in the
Iraqi capital, his face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   A missile from the attack also fell on the Iranian border city
of Khorramshahr, Tehran radio reported.
	   Sirens were heard three times in Baghdad, and anti-aircraft guns
were fired four times during the night. As the sounds of the last
barrage faded before dawn Thursday, a call for prayer floated over
the winter morning from a mosque loudspeaker.
	   Clinton said he ordered the strikes on military and security
targets to retaliate for Iraq's defiance of the U.N. Special
Commission, which is responsible for eliminating the country's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological weapons,'' he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair authorized the participation
of British forces.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in his radio
address, saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face''
but ``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain for the attack.
	   At a U.N. Security Council meeting, the ambassadors of Russia
and China, both sympathetic to Iraq, urged an end to the bombings.
	   Staunch American allies _ Germany, Canada and even Japan _
supported the strikes.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the events a ``sad day
for the world,'' saying he did everything in his power to seek
peace.
	   The United States hopes the attacks will achieve what UNSCOM has
not been able to achieve in seven years of work: destroy Iraq's
ability to produce weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Security Council will not lift sanctions imposed on Iraq for
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until inspectors certify Iraq is free
of chemical and biological weapons.

semifinals &QL;

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ India outmaneuvered Japan with
excellent ball handling, fast breaks and a tough defense, winning
3-1 Thursday night and advancing to the gold medal game of Asian
Games field hockey.
	   In the final, it meets South Korea, whose fast and aggressive
Korean team defeated Pakistan 3-2 in the other semifinal.
	   The Indians took a halftime lead of 2-0, scoring in the 17th
minute on a penalty corner by Baljeet Singh and in the 26th on a
penalty stroke by Ramandeep Singh after a deliberate foul by the
Japanese goalkeeper.
	   Japan failed on five first-half penalty corner attempts, and
scored its only goal on a penalty corner in the 7th minute of the
second half, slammed in by Kenichi Katayama.
	   Eight minutes later, India made it 3-1 when captain Dhanraj
Pillay stroked in a long pass from midfield.
	   Japan had three penalty corners in the last two minutes but
failed to score.
	   Against Pakistan, South Korea scored two field goals and
converted one of five penalty corners while Pakistan scored on two
penalty conversions.
	   Pakistan showed off its ball-stealing abilities in the first
half, and the first score was set up when Haider Hussain and Atif
Bashir double-teamed a Korean player to take the action back to
Korea's goal area. Sohail Abbas then converted the corner in the
4th minute.
	   In the 8th minute, Pakistan goalkeeper Muhammad Qasim made a
fine save of a shot from about three meters out on the left side.
	   But Korea's more aggressive play was starting to put pressure on
the Pakistanis. Korea failed to score from another penalty corner
in the 10th minute, but began frequent charges on Pakistan's area.
	   In the 18th minute, the Koreans finally equalized on a field
goal by Kang Keon-wook.
	   Five minutes later, Korea's Yeo Woon-kon put his team up 2-1 and
Kang scored again in the 31st minute for a 3-1 lead.
	   Pakistan had four corners in the last two minutes of the half,
but failed to score.
	   In the second half, the Pakistanis began taking the ball to the
Korean side more. Pakistan failed on a penalty shot in the 13th
minute, but Sohail Abbas was successful on another chance half a
minute later, narrowing Korea's advantage to 3-2.

Decision in Boesak trial set for Friday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A judge is to rule on Friday on a
request to dismiss embezzlement charges against former top African
National Congress official Allan Boesak.
	   Boesak faces 32 counts of fraud and theft and is accused of
stealing more than a million rand (dlrs 300,000 at the time) from
an anti-apartheid organization he headed.
	   The prosecution case was dealt a huge blow last month when
Boesak's former bookkeeper Freddie Steenkamp admitted he lied under
oath due to a personal grudge against his ex-boss. Steenkamp,
already serving six years in jail, was the state's key witness.
	   On Thursday defense lawyer Mike Maritz said the state's case had
collapsed and Boesak should be freed immediately.
	   ``On not one of these counts has the state established the
standard of evidence required'' for conviction, he said.
	   Judge John Foxcroft postponed the case until Friday for
judgement. If he rules for a dismissal, Boesak will walk free. If
Foxcroft rules against, the case will carry on into next year.
	   A former minister who once headed the World Alliance of Reformed
Churches, Boesak is accused of embezzling the money from the
Foundation for Peace and Justice charity.
	   Donations came from pop singer Paul Simon, the Coca-Cola
Foundation, Scandinavian aid agencies and other individuals and
groups.
	   Boesak played a prominent role in the anti-apartheid struggle
that ended in the country's first all-race elections in 1994.

Angolan embassy official repatriated in connection with fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The Angolan Embassy said Thursday its
consul-general was to be sent home after being arrested in
connection with the alleged embezzlement of up to dlrs 1 million.
	   The embassy official was arrested late Wednesday in a hotel
south of Lisbon, a week after relatives reported him missing,
according to the daily newspaper Publico.
	   An embassy statement, which did not give the consul-general's
name, said he had confessed to ``irregular procedures'' in managing
the embassy's finances.
	   Efforts to investigate the fraud had been delayed by the
``unexpected disappearance of this official ... who was located
yesterday,'' the statement added.

 &UR; U.S. Senator hopes strike will lead to overthrow of Saddam &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Specter's arrival in Egypt, meeting with
Mubarak. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The chairman of the U.S. Senate's
intelligence committee said Thursday that he hoped the strike
against Iraq would be the first step toward overthrowing Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
	   The United States does not like to interfere in the internal
affairs of countries, but times of war are a different matter,
Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter was quoted as saying by
Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
	   Specter expressed his hopes that the strike would be the first
step toward the overthrow of Saddam, especially since the U.S.
Congress has allocated dlrs 97 million for such a purpose.
	   Specter, who spoke after meeting Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, said he believed that the U.N. arms inspectors could
return to Iraq if Saddam allowed them unobstructed access. The
problem, however, was how to ensure compliance.
	   Specter arrived in Egypt Thursday after meeting with Syrian
President Hafez Assad earlier in the day.
	   Specter told a news conference in Damascus before leaving that
he had briefed Assad on the outcome of U.S. President Bill
Clinton's trip to Israel and the Gaza Strip.
	   ``President Assad and I had a good, frank, open and extensive
discussion,'' he said.
	   He said he told Assad that Clinton was trying to bring the
Syrian and Israeli sides to resume talks suspended in 1996.
	   Syria demands the return of the Golan Heights that Israel
captured in the 1967 Mideast war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
says the heights are crucial to Israel's security.
	   Specter and Assad also discussed Iraq in their meeting
Wednesday, hours before the United States and Britain launched
attacks against Iraq for defying U.S. weapons inspectors.

Military courts hand down death sentences in first convictions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ The military courts, which have
replaced civilian courts in Pakistan's southern Sindh province,
handed down its first judgments Thursday sentencing two men to
death -- one for rape and the other for murder.
	   Court officials said Ashraf Chakan was sentenced to death for
the murder in May of a police constable. Another three accused were
sentenced to prison terms.
	   The conviction and sentence can be appealed also before a
military court. Only one appeal is allowed.
	   Court officials also said that Mohammed Raffi, a political
activist with the Muttaheda Qami Movement (MQM), was sentenced to
death for his involvement in the kidnapping and rape of a young
girl one year ago.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif turned the courts over to the
military last month in an attempt to move justice along in southern
Sindh province,where more than 1,000 people have been killed in
bitter ethnic feuding this year.
	   The combatants have been rival factions of the MQM, an
organization that represents Indian Muslims who settled in Pakistan
in 1947 when British rule of the subcontinent. Many of the victims
of the feuding have been innocent civilians caught in the
crossfire, said police.
	   Raffi belongs to the largest MQM faction, led by exiled leader
Altaf Hussein, said police officials.
	   Also in an attempt to restore law and order to Karachi, Sharif
in October dismissed the provincial government and imposed federal
rule. He also suspended civil rights in southern Sindh province.
	   The country's largest city of 14 million people, Karachi also is
the financial and manufacturing heart of Pakistan. Relentless
violence has disrupted business and some businessmen say billions
of rupees (millions of dollars) have been lost.

Iraqi Foreign Minister accuses US and Britain of lying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Sahhaf
accused the United States of ``shameless lying'' in their remarks
on Iraq's stand with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Addressing the first government press conference since the
U.S.-British attacks on Iraq began, al-Sahhaf said that the strikes
were ``a crime against international law and the U.N. charter.
	   In defending their strikes, London and Washington had failed to
mention the report of the inspectors of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, the foreign minister said.
	   The IAEA has reported that Iraq had provided ``the necessary
level of cooperation'' to its inspectors.
	   The United States and Britain did not mention this ``because
they cannot benefit from it for their evil intentions,'' al-Sahhaf
said.
	   ``They lied to the world shamelessly, saying that the report of
the executive chairman of (the U.N. Special Commission) had not
cooperated,'' he said.
	   But the U.N. inspectors had visited 427 sites since Nov. 17,
when inspections resumed after an earlier stand-off.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Russia and China angrily denounced the
U.S.-British attack on Iraq, while allies such as Germany and
Canada offered their immediate support, placing all blame for the
crisis on Saddam Hussein.
	   Iraq's neighbor, Iran, joined Russia and China in blasting the
use of force and warning that it could shatter regional security.
	   ``Nobody has the right to act on their own in the name of the
United Nations and even less to pretend to be the judge of the
entire world,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said in
Madrid, Spain.
	   Fearful of recriminations, the United States on Thursday closed
all but two of its African embassies, and security was stepped up
at many U.S. and British institutions worldwide, from the
Philippines to Greece and Denmark.
	   The U.S. State Department ordered the departure of some of its
embassy personnel in Kuwait and warned other Americans living there
to consider leaving.
	   The Arab League condemned the strikes, and a Gulf official said
Baghdad had reached out for Arab support to stop the attacks.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross sent a diplomatic
note to the U.S., British and Iraqi governments asking them to do
everything possible to ensure civilians and medical facilities are
unaffected by military action.
	   Some of the strongest condemnations came from Russia and China,
both of which called for an immediate end to the military campaign.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin said further strikes ``could
result in the most dramatic consequences not only for the Iraqi
settlement but for the stability of the entire region.''
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi called the attack
``a violation of the U.N. charter and the principles of
international law.''
	   The German government noted, however, that the Iraqi leadership
``had been warned'' the international community would have to act
if it failed to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Support for the airstrikes also poured in from Canada, Japan,
Australia, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, the Netherlands,
Austria, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic and Spain.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has brought this crisis on himself,'' Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said.
	   France, which has close ties to Iraq, deplored ``the grave human
consequences'' of the military strikes, but added its regret that
Iraqi leaders were unable to ``show proof of the spirit of complete
cooperation'' demanded by previous agreements with the United
Nations.
	   Iranian television quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying
that ``such unilateral attacks against Iraq will lead to even more
pain and misery for the people of that country and will bring about
insecurity in the region.''
	   Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi urged the U.N. Security Council to
take immediate action to prevent ``further deterioration'' of the
situation, television reported. Iran also called on Baghdad to
cooperate with the United Nations.
	   Fearing an influx of refugees, both Jordan and Turkey closed the
borders they share with Iraq. Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
expressed disappointment in the attack, but also called on Iraq to
comply with the United Nations.
	   In Pakistan, however, the Senate passed a resolution unanimously
condemning the airstrikes as ``an attack on humanity and the
Islamic world.'' Islamic Pakistan's right-wing religious group
called the United States ``international terrorists.''
	   India also condemned the use of force.
	   The strikes led news reports in Lebanon, where all newspaper,
radio and television stations carried news agency reports without
comment.
	   In Indonesia, the world's most populous Islamic nation, leaders
pleaded for restraint.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was noncommittal,
saying, ``Israel is outside the dispute, and in any case will take
care of defending itself if the need arises.''
	   And Russian legislators had perhaps the most novel response.
	   Russia's lower chamber of Parliament agreed Thursday to consider
a motion appealing to Monica Lewinsky, the White House intern with
whom U.S. President Bill Clinton had an affair, to help halt the
military strikes.
	   ``The State Duma appeals to Ms. Lewinsky to undertake
corresponding measures to restrain the emotions of Bill Clinton,''
said the motion by nationalist lawmaker Alexander Filatov.
	   It will be considered for inclusion in a broader resolution
denouncing the attack on Iraq.

Fuel workers strike expected to hamper first holiday traffic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fuel crews at 10 of France's biggest airports were
to go on strike Friday and cause some delays or cancellations on
the first major travel day of the holiday season, airline officials
said Thursday.
	   The one-day walkout was to affect both Paris airports as well as
those serving Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon, Montpellier, Marseille, Nice,
Perpignan, and Toulouse, union officials said.
	   It was not clear how many workers would be on strike, coming the
same day as unions and management were to negotiate how to cut the
work week under the leftist government's 35-hour work week law. Pay
and schedules were at issue.
	   The country's main domestic carrier, state-owned Air France,
said in a statement that it expected to ``delay or cancel a certain
number of flights'' on Friday.
	   Air France spokeswoman Fabienne de Brebisson said the carrier
could not give specific figures on affected flights until the
extent of the walkout becomes clearer.
	   Long-distance flights were not expected to be suffer. As for all
its flights, Air France ``will try to refuel the planes in advance,
the night before,'' she said in a telephone interview.
	   The strike was called during two periods of the day, from 3-9
a.m. (0200-0800 GMT) and from 5-8 p.m. (1600-1900 GMT), said
Jacques Reder, spokesman for Airports of Paris.
	   ``It could disturb traffic a bit,'' he said. ``It doesn't mean
the strike call will be followed, either.
	   Any delays or cancellations could be remedied between the strike
periods during the day, he said.
	   At other airports, officials at Lyon and Bordeaux on Thursday
afternoon said no cancellations or delays were planned Friday.
	   A joint statement by five unions said the job action was to
protest ``deregulation that puts in peril our profession and
therefore the security and the quality of our airport services.
	   In talks so far, the unions said management has so far frozen
salaries and refused to hire more employees, an objective of
cutting the work week to spread jobs around.
	   ``If Dec. 18 falls on the day of departure for those on
vacation,'' which it said the management chose for the talks,
``this is therefore not an action against the passengers.''

Yeltsin in Kremlin, meets with Belarusian, Swiss presidents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin kept a close watch on
developments in Iraq today in between meeting with the leaders of
Belarus and Switzerland, his press service said.
	   In talks with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Yeltsin
said the economic situation in Russia ``is now stable,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin has made a number of public appearances since he was
released from a hospital a week ago after spending two weeks
recovering from pneumonia.
	   Yeltsin was up for much of the night monitoring the situation in
Iraq, according to aides. He condemned the attacks on Baghdad by
the United States and Great Britain.
	   The president met Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Chief of
Staff Nikolai Bordyuzha to discuss Iraq, as well as Russia's
pressing economic problems. He also talked to Chinese President
Jiang Zemin by telephone about Iraq.
	   Later, he met at the Kremlin with Swiss President Flavio Cotti,
in Russia on a three-day visit. There was no immediate report on
their talks, but they were expected to discuss economic crimes,
among other things.
	   The Russian president then met with Lukashenko, who said earlier
that he would discuss strengthening a union treaty between Belarus
and Russia.
	   But the two leaders had also been expected to discuss Belarus's
massive economic problems, deepened by Russia's financial collapse
in August. Belarus was hit harder by the crash than other former
Soviet republics because of its strong trade links to Russia and
already weak currency.
	   In an interview with the newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta,
Lukashenko called for pooling the financial resources of Russian
and Belarus. Lukashenko has frequently pushed for closer ties to
Russia.
	   Yeltsin has largely passed on responsibility for the country's
pressing economic problems to Primakov, and has not traveled abroad
recently because of his health. Still, he insists he will serve out
his term, which ends in 2000.

Nazi atom bomb files to be opened to public
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Once top secret, files on Nazi Germany's
unsuccessful race to build an atomic bomb are being opened to the
general public for the first time.
	   Among the materials received Thursday by Munich's German Museum
are research notes by famous German physicists who took part in the
program, such as Werner Heisenberg and Otto Hahn, as well as
notebooks, photos and correspondence between scientists and Nazi
authorities.
	   The documents suggest that German research into the atomic bomb
was ``nearly parallel'' with efforts in the United States, but that
the Third Reich lacked materials to build one because of wartime
destruction, said the museum's archivist, Wilhelm Fuessl.
	   A November 1945 report by two U.S. investigators, six months
after the Nazi defeat in World War II, says ``only the lack of
plutonium'' kept Adolf Hitler from building an atomic bomb, Fuessl
said.
	   U.S. forces seized the files at the war's end. They were
returned to a research center in Karlsruhe, Germany, in the 1970s,
but access there was largely restricted to academics, Fuessl said.
	   No exhibit is planned for now at the Munich museum, but Fuessl
said the files will be open to the public.

Police official's home bombed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A homemade bomb exploded in front of a
police official's home in western Bulgaria, media reported
Thursday. Nobody was injured.
	   According to state-run BTA news agency, the bomb went off at
about 4:00 a.m. local time (02:00 GMT) outside the front door of
Bobovdol deputy police chief Ivan Dimtitrov.
	   The blast damaged the building but Dimitrov, his wife and two
children were not hurt.
	   Dimitrov's relatives told BTA they believe the bomb was planted
by suspects he was investigating for a case in Bobovdol, 100
kilometers (63 miles) southwest of Sofia.
	   Apartment and car-bombings have become almost commonplace in
Bulgaria since crime has quadrupled since the end of communism in
1989.
	   Last week a car-bomb killed a businessman in the town of
Gabrovo, 223 kilometers (140 miles) east of Sofia.

 &UR; Croatian President Tudjman arrives in Russia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Franjo Tudjman arrived in Moscow on
Thursday on a two-day official visit that is to include talks with
Russian leader Boris Yeltsin.
	   The two were scheduled to meet in November, but the meeting was
postponed due to Yeltsin's health problems.
	   Tudjman was expected to attend a concert Thursday night, then
meet with Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Friday.
	   Though still recuperating, Yeltsin was released from the
hospital last week after receiving treatment for pneumonia. He had
stayed at a country residence most of the time since then, making
occasional trips into the Kremlin.
	   Tudjman, 76, was also taken ill in late 1996, when he underwent
medical treatment in Washington.
	   U.S. officials claimed then that the Croatian leader was
suffering from cancer. Tudjman denied the claims, saying he only
had minor stomach problems. Although reportedly still on therapy,
Tudjman appears often in public in a seemingly fine condition.
	   Tudjman and Yeltsin are expected to sign an agreement on
friendship and cooperation aimed at boosting the two countries'
relations.
	   Tudjman has been primarily seeking good ties with the West, but
he said on Monday that Croatia ``must also develop good relations
with Russia ... Despite its recent crisis, Russia remains the world
power.''
	   The trip to Russia was Tudjman's first since he came to power in
1991 and led his country to independence from the former Yugoslav
federation.
	   Croatian Serbs' rebellion against independence led to a
six-month war. It effectively ended in 1995, when the government
recaptured areas that rebels seized during the war.
	   Russia has been a traditional ally of Serbs, with whom it shares
Orthodox Christian religion.
	   Russia now shows ``more balanced'' approach to the ex-Yugoslav
countries, Croatian ambassador to Moscow, Hidajet Biscevic, said
recently.
	   Tudjman also is to discuss Russia's dlrs 1.5 billion debt to the
former Yugoslav nations, which it inherited from the old Soviet
Union.
	   The debt is to be divided among the former Yugoslav republics,
with Croatia getting about 28 percent.
	   Considering Russia's other financial obligations, Croatia would
accept payment in oil and natural gas, Biscevic said.
	   Croatian businessmen, who accompanied Tudjman, will seek ways to
improve the mutual trade, amounting to dlrs 600 million in 1998.

Palestinian Authority caught in dilemma after U.S. attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian killed in clashes with Israeli
troops, Clinton sending letter to Arafat to explain reasons for
attack on Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians angered by
the U.S. bombing of Iraq chanted ``Death to Clinton'' Thursday,
only days after cheering him in his visit to the West Bank and Gaza
Strip seen as recognition of Palestinian claims to independence.
	   In three West Bank towns, marchers threw stones at Israeli
soldiers who fired rubber bullets. In one confrontation outside
Ramallah, a 20-year-old Palestinian was killed by Israeli army fire
and 16 were injured by rubber bullets, doctors said.
	   The U.S. attack on Iraq early Thursday placed Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in a dilemma.
	   Arafat has been careful not to hurt his growing ties with the
United States, considered an important asset in the quest for
statehood. However, Arafat also could not afford to be seen as
going against the widespread support among his people for Iraq.
	   Clinton sent Arafat a letter Thursday to explain why he attacked
Iraq, Arafat's office said.
	   A senior Palestinian Authority official, Saeb Erekat, adopted a
carefully worded position of compromise after the latest U.S.
attack. The United States should halt its attacks and Iraq should
comply with U.N. weapons inspectors, Erekat said. In the 1991 Gulf
War, Arafat had sided with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator with Israel, said a war
in the Gulf will also cause further delays in the implementation of
the Wye River land-for-peace agreement Clinton helped negotiate.
	   In handling the public outpouring of support for Iraq, Arafat
permitted rallies and marches, but ordered his security forces to
disperse violent protests.
	   In the West Bank towns of Bethlehem and Hebron, Palestinian
police moved quickly to break up dozens of Palestinian teen-agers
who threw stones at Israeli troops. Only two days earlier, Clinton
had sung along with a Palestinian children's choir in Manger Square
in Bethlehem, the traditional birthplace of Jesus.
	   However, in Ramallah, Palestinian police stood back for more
than an hour while about 200 teen-agers threw stones at Israeli
soldiers who responded with rubber bullets.

Developments in the U.S.-British air attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   Following are developments Thursday in the U.S.-British air
attack on Iraq:
	   The Iraqi capital, Baghdad, shakes with explosions,
anti-aircraft flak cascades through skies during first wave of
punishing airstrikes, which began at 1 a.m. local time. At least
two people are killed and more than 30 injured, a doctor says. Air
raid sirens sound again at dusk, possibly signaling a new wave of
attacks.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein tours some targeted sites,
including his daughter's house, according to Baghdad Radio. But
there was little evidence of the nightlong blitz in the streets of
the Iraqi capital, where morning traffic clogged streets and young
children headed to school.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen says a thorough assessment
of damage is expected later Thursday after study of photographs
taken by spy satellites and U-2 aircraft. However, preliminary
analysis shows ``severe damage to some targets.'' National Security
Council spokesman David Leavy says ``military action continues.''
	   U.S. military officials say a second night of attacks calls for
using 15 U.S. Air Force B-52H bombers, armed with long-range AGM-86
air-launched cruise missiles, based on the Indian Ocean island of
Diego Garcia.
	   Russia, China and Iraq's neighbor, Iran, angrily denounce the
attack, while allies Germany and Canada offer their immediate
support, placing all blame for the crisis on Saddam.
	   Fearful of recriminations, the United States closes all but two
of its African embassies, and steps up security at U.S. and British
institutions worldwide.
	   Polls show Americans strongly support the military action. A CBS
poll says about 80 percent say they favor the strike, while in an
ABC survey, 62 percent said attacking Iraq was the right thing to
do.

Russia's wage debts rise despite Primakov's pledge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government's wage debts have grown in
recent months to insurmountable levels, despite Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's pledge to pay salaries on time, officials said
Thursday.
	   Education Minister Vladimir Filippov blamed the increase on
local officials, saying they misspent government funds earmarked
for wages. Paying the mammoth wage arrears was a priority of
Primakov's when he entered office in September and set out to
tackle Russia's worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet
collapse.
	   ``The government today can't pay off such huge debts,'' he said
at a news conference. ``We can only solve the arrears by cranking
up money-printing presses.''
	   The government so far has been trying to avoid printing large
amounts of new cash, fearing that would cause hyperinflation.
	   The government's debt to state workers now stands at a
staggering 85 billion rubles (dlrs 4.1 billion), up from about 80
billion rubles (dlrs 3.9 billion) three months ago when Primakov
became prime minister, Filippov said.
	   He refused to say when the government will pay off all debts.
	   Earlier this week it won parliament's approval to print 25
billion rubles (dlrs 1.2 billion) in the last quarter of this year.
Without waiting for the approval, the government had already
printed 13.5 billion rubles (dlrs 650 million) in October and
November.
	   Filippov pledged that the total amount of new money will stay
within limits set by the parliament.
	   Primakov chaired a Cabinet session on Thursday to consider the
wage situation. He urged local officials to submit detailed plans
for solving wage debts and ordered them to pay all current wages
plus one month worth of overdue wages by Jan. 15.
	   ``We should take extraordinary measures for ensuring human
rights: Everyone must receive remuneration for one's work,''
Primakov said.
	   In some regions, wages are up to 15 months late, Filippov said.
	   Teachers alone are owed about 15 billion rubles (dlrs 720
million) by the government, and about 45,000 teachers have been on
strike in recent days throughout Russia.
	   ``That means 600,000 children can't go to school on daily
basis,'' he said.
	   The average teacher's monthly wage is 500 rubles (less than dlrs
25).
	   The Cabinet has already factored in foreign loans in next year's
budget to pay off its domestic and foreign debts, although they may
not materialize.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders have been
reluctant to release loans put on hold after Russia's economy
nosedived in August, falling victim to global economic turmoil.
	   Left without foreign credits, the government will have to print
money to pay off its debts, further eroding the ruble's value.
	   The Central Bank's hard currency reserves have been steadily
dropping as the bank has been spending them to slow the fall of the
ruble, which stood Thursday at 20.7 to the dollar. It was worth six
to the dollar before the crisis.
	   The Russian Central Bank's gold and currency reserves fell by
dlrs 100 million in the second week of December and stood at dlrs
12 billion on Dec. 11, the bank announced Thursday.

Italian federation head latest under investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Soccer federation president Luciano Nizzola became
the latest top Italian sports official implicated in the country's
growing doping scandal when he was officially notified Thursday
that he is under investigation.
	   Rome prosecutors are looking into whether Nizzola played a role
in hiding positive drug tests to help clubs or players.
	   Antonio Matarrese, Nizzola's predecessor and now a UEFA vice
president, was informed Wednesday that he is being investigated in
connection with the same allegations.
	   The Rome inquiry is one of several into the use of
performance-enhancing substances in Italian soccer. The fallout has
included the resignation of Italian Olympic Committee president
Mario Pescante and the closing of the country's drug-testing
laboratory.
	   The Acqua Acetosa lab was shut down in October after it was hit
by allegations of improper handling of soccer doping tests and
hiding positive results.
	   Matarrese resigned as head of the federation following Italy's
poor showing at the 1996 European Championships.

Missing San Antonio Express-News reporter was strangled

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ An American reporter found dead after
disappearing on a hike in the remote mountains of western Mexico
was strangled, a coroner said Thursday.
	   ``It is a homicide. It is not an accident,'' Jalisco state
coroner Mario Rivas Souza said in an interview broadcast by the
Televisa television network.
	   The body of Philip True, who worked for the San Antonio
Express-News, was found Wednesday in a deep ravine in the mountains
on the border of Jalisco and Nayarit states.
	   Officials at first believed that he had accidentally fallen to
his death.
	   But Rivas said an autopsy detected ``a cord tightly restricting
the neck'' and he said other injuries were not caused by the
330-foot fall into the ravine.
	   ``We all mourn the loss of a colleague and an outstanding
journalist,'' W. Lawrence Walker Jr., publisher and chief executive
officer of the Express-News, told staff members gathered in the
paper's newsroom Wednesday.
	   True's body was spotted by one of several army aircraft sweeping
the area, military officials said. It took soldiers hours to reach
the isolated Chapangana Canyon, and several hours more to identify
the body.
	   True, a 50-year-old reporter based in Mexico City, headed into
the Sierra Madre Occidental range on Nov. 29 for a story on the
region's Huichol Indians.
	   He had planned to hike into neighboring Nayarit state and return
to Mexico City on Dec. 10. The Mexican army and authorities from
both states had been searching the region since then.
	   True worked for the Brownsville Herald before joining the
Express-News staff in 1992 as the newspaper's border correspondent
based in Laredo. He became Express-News correspondent in Mexico
City in January 1996.
	   Among the high-profile stories he covered for the San Antonio
paper were the Zapatista rebel conflict in the southern state of
Chiapas and Pope John Paul II's trip to Cuba.
	   Before his newspaper career, True worked as a wallpaper hanger
until his late 30s, recalled friend and colleague John MacCormack,
a state reporter for the Express-News.
	   ``But by the time he was 50, he was the correspondent in Mexico
for a major Texas newspaper,'' MacCormack said. ``His dream came
true.''

Meissnitzer, Goetschl face-off in weekend downhills
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ Alexandra Meissnitzer not only has
to concern herself with foreign challengers to her Alpine World Cup
lead in this weekend's downhills, but more likely from her own
teammates.
	   Austrian compatriot Renate Geotschl, the winner of both races in
the season opening downhills in Lake Louise, Canada, last month,
probably will provide the biggest threat but not the only one to
Meissnitzer's lead.
	   A slalom and the season's first combined could allow several
other skiers to jump into contention for the coveted overall crown
as the circuit heads into its short Christmas break.
	   As her compatriot Hermann Maier did last year on the men's tour,
Meissnitzer unexpectedly has leapt to the forefront of the women's
scene this season, winning four of 10 races so far and grabbing a
substantial lead in the overall standings.
	   Winner of sonsecutive races in Val d'Isere last weekend, the
Austrian will attempt to add to her 625-point total in the overall
rankings by recording her first career downhill victory.
	   The 25-year-old Austrian holds a whopping 242-point advantage
over her closest challenger Martina Ertl of Germany.
	   ``When I stand at the start I just feel nothing can go wrong,''
said Meissnitzer, the giant slalom runner-up and super-G bronze
medallist at the Nagano Olympics in February. ``My confidence is
thriving. I have no doubts in my head.
	   ``There's only one way to go when I'm in this state and that's
by taking all the risks. I can't explain it. I'm just on a roll.''
	   But while Meissnitzer has exterted her dominance in both the
super-G and giant slalom this season, leading in both disciplines,
she finished only fifth and third in the Lake Louise downhills.
	   Goetschl, meanwhile, has indicated she isn't ready to relinquish
her current downhill reign, posting the fastest time in Wednesday's
training run.
	   But while Austrians have won seven of 10 events this season, the
fight is hardly limited to the one nation.
	   Also strong is Italy's Isolde Kostner, runner-up behind Goetschl
in Lake Louise, and third in Wednesday's training.
	   Pernilla Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup champion, will try
to banish last year's injury-plagued campaign from her mind as she
seeks her first victory of the season and makes a fresh attempt at
a second overall crown.
	   Ertl, who has always lurked in the shadow of her illustrious
teammate, World Cup overall champion Katja Seizinger, is taking
advantage of her compatriot's season-long absence due to knee
injury to pursue her long-time dream.
	   Runner-up in the overall World Cup standings in 1996 and 1998,
Ertl has made it clear she intends to make the title hers this
season.
	   ``Of course I'm going for the overall,'' said Ertl, the World
Cup giant slalom champion last season.
	   ``I'm astonished at my results in the downhill,'' said Ertl, who
finished fourth and seventh in the season's two downhills. ``I hope
my skills in the slalom will give me an edge in the overall.''
	   The German will get an extra opportunity this weekend, with the
slalom also counting toward a combined event.
	   Meissnitzer, though hinting she may race in the combined events,
generally shies away from the slalom, giving her opponents an extra
event in the chase for the overall crown.
	   The event will give Goetschl, the reigning combined champion,
and Wiberg, the 1994 Olympic gold medallist in the event, another
chance for vauable points.

Former SOS Racism president convicted of corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ The former president of France's most
militant anti-racism lobby was convicted Thursday of receiving a
salary for a job he did not hold.
	   Harlem Desir, the outspoken former head of SOS Racism, received
an 18-month suspended sentence and was fined 30,000 francs (dlrs
5,400) for holding a no-show job during 1986 and 1987. The salary
was bankrolled by an association with political links to the
regional council of this northern French city.
	   A Socialist with close ties to the late President Francois
Mitterrand, Desir headed SOS Racism in the 1980s.
	   The movement gained momentum with the rise of the far-right
National Front party, which blames immigrants, particularly from
North Africa, for high unemployment and urban violence.
	   Heyette Boudjema, the former vice-president of SOS Racism, was
also convicted and fined on the same charges.

Yugoslavia opens consulate in Vukovar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VUKOVAR, Croatia (AP) _ Yugoslavia opened a consulate on
Thursday in this eastern Croatian town that saw some of the worst
bombardments and atrocities of the 1991 Serbo-Croatian war.
	   During that six-month war, which erupted after Croatian Serbs
rebelled against the then republic's claim for independence from
the former Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav army backed the rebels. Their
forces took the town after a three-month siege and indiscriminate
shelling.
	   Four years later, Zagreb recaptured the lands the rebels had
seized, which were temporarily put under international supervision.
The area surrounding Vukovar, known as Eastern Slavonia, returned
to full Croatian control last January.
	   In 1996, Croatia and Yugoslavia established diplomatic
relations.
	   The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry's first secretary, Radovan
Matovic, said the main role of the consulate should be to provide
necessary assistance to the local Serbs.
	   Yugoslavia wants to ``secure human and other rights'' of Serbs
in Croatia, he said, adding these were conditions needed for them
to stay in the country.
	   Western governments have sharply criticized Croatia mistreating
its Serbs, thousands of whom have fled Eastern Slavonia since the
area reverted to Zagreb's rule.
	   Croatia's Foreign Ministry official, Tonci Stanicic, noted,
however, that the opening of the consulate ``painfully coincides''
with the opening of a case at Yugoslav military court against the
``unknown perpetrators'' of the 1991 execution of more than 200
Croats at a farm Ovcara near Vukovar.
	   The court invited three Yugoslav army officers, who were accused
and wanted by the international war crimes tribunal for the Ovcara
slaughter, to testify as witnesses.
	   Yugoslavia refuses to hand over the three _ Veselin
Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic and Milan Mrksic _ to stand trial at
the international tribunal, based in The Hague, Netherlands.

Iraq attack could delay ratification of START II treaty

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The U.S. and British attack on Iraq could derail
hopes that Russia's parliament will approve the long-delayed START
II nuclear reduction treaty, officials said Thursday.
	   Officials of President Boris Yeltsin's administration and the
parliament showed unusual unanimity in agreeing that the treaty to
cut U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals stands little hope of swift
approval.
	   The START II treaty, signed in 1993, would halve the Russian and
American nuclear arsenals to about 3,000 to 3,500 warheads each.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, head of the largest faction
in the Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, said there was no
point in discussing ratification. Instead, he said, Russia should
increase its defense budget.
	   Valentin Kuptsov, a Communist leader in the Duma, predicted
discussion on approving the treaty would be shelved for at least
six months, and Vladimir Lukin of liberal Yabloko faction said the
ratification was put off ``indefinitely.''
	   ``The nearest real prospects of the START II are not seen any
more,'' said Lukin, who heads the Duma's foreign affairs committee.
	   Alexander Shokhin, head of the moderate Our Home is Russia party
in the Duma, also said it was unlikely the chamber would consider
ratification anytime soon.
	   ``We could raise the question of the treaty in January, but now
the prospects of its discussion are becoming increasingly
obscure,'' he said.
	   Russia's Communist-led parliament has repeatedly delayed action
on the START II treaty. But there had been increasing hopes in
recent months that the treaty would be approved.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, a staunch proponent
of the treaty, first said through his spokesman that the START II
should be ratified regardless of the strikes on Iraq, but later
caved in to the predominant view, retracting the spokesman's
statement.
	   ``I'm not such an idiot to insist on START II's ratification
during air strikes on Iraq,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   Sergei Karaganov, a prominent Russian political analyst who once
served as Yeltsin's consultant on foreign policy, raised a lone
voice of dissent, warning that Russia would be making a grave
mistake by delaying the ratification of a treaty that serves
Russia's interests.
	   ``If we reject ratification to punish the Americans we would be
acting like someone who wanted to annoy his neighbor by hanging
himself on his roof,'' Karaganov said, according to the Interfax
news agency.

Man commits suicide because he can't afford Christmas tree
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A 50-year-old Romanian man killed
himself because he couldn't afford to buy a Christmas tree for his
daughter, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Ion Done, a divorced father who lived with his widowed mother
and 10-year-old daughter, took own his life after an argument
Tuesday with his mother, who wanted him to buy a Christmas for the
little girl, daily Evenimentul Zilei reported.
	   Done, whose occupation was unknown, said he couldn't afford the
luxury of a tree.
	   After the argument he threw himself out of the sixth-floor
apartment where he lived in the city of Braila, some 175 kilometers
(109 miles) northeast of Bucharest. He died immediately, the paper
said.
	   Christmas trees in Romania cost between 50,000 lei (dlrs 5) and
200,000 (dlrs 20) and are a luxury for anyone earning the country's
average monthly salary of 1.2 million lei (dlrs 120).
	   Only about one in ten Romanians can afford trees. Many people
instead purchase evergreen branches, which are cheaper.

	   Some heavily bleeding students were carried to safety by their
friends through clouds of tear gas. Paramedics applied first aid on
the street.
	   Students fought back with sticks and some soldiers hurled rocks
at protesters.
	   At least 116 injured students had been treated at four
hospitals. Most had been beaten or overcome by gas, hospital
officials said.
	   The head of Jakarta's navy hospital Dr. Sutedjo said some had
been wounded by plastic bullets. However, he denied an earlier
report by doctors that one student had died there after being shot.
	   The military said 14 security personnel were injured, four of
them seriously. One had been stabbed.
	   It was the second straight day that students have clashed with
security forces in the Indonesian capital. And, it was the worst
violence seen since Nov. 13 when 14 people died after troops fired
upon students who also tried to march on Parliament.
	   The military has said that troops and police have only been
issued with plastic or blank ammunition.
	   One student leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the demonstrators would protest again on Friday.
	   Hours before Thursday's street battle, President B.J. Habibie
warned his country might break up if anti-government protests
escalated.
	   ``If the protests are not controlled it can lead to the
disintegration of the nation,'' Habibie said at a graduation
ceremony of new army officers.
	   For weeks, students have taken to the streets demanding that
Habibie force the military out of politics and put his autocratic
predecessor, ex-President Suharto, on trial for corruption.
	   Habibie has promised to open up the tightly controlled political
system and to hold elections next year. But the students are not
satisfied with the pace and scope of his reforms.
	   On Wednesday police also fired tear gas and swung batons to
disperse hundreds of rock-throwing protesters at the Defense
Ministry, not far from the presidential palace.
	   Religious groups have called on the students to end their
protest campaign during the forthcoming holy Islamic month of
Ramadan, which starts on Sunday.
	   As night fell Thursday, hundreds of military reinforcements
arrived at the Parliament and students lit bonfires on a toll road
before dispersing.
	   Soldiers ordered reporters and news crews to leave the scene.
	   They marched to the Parliament demanding political reform and
the release of some activists arrested by police during other
protests this week.
	   Habibie, who has promised democratic reform after decades of
authoritarian rule, said that freedom of expression that allows
protests is now guaranteed under Indonesian law.
	   ``But in carrying out these rights people must also respect
other people's rights,'' he said.
	   Indonesia, with 202 million people, is the world's fourth most
populous country. It has more than 300 ethnic groups spread over
about 17,000 islands.
	   Student protests and deadly riots last May also forced Suharto
to quit after 32 years in power. At that time students occupied the
parliament building for several days.
	   Anger at Habibie's seven-month old government has been sharpened
by a continuing economic crisis, which has resulted in soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and rising poverty.

Iraqi Foreign Minister accuses US and Britain of lying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Sahhaf
accused the United States of ``shameless lying'' in their remarks
on Iraq's stand with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Addressing the first government press conference since the
U.S.-British attacks on Iraq began, al-Sahhaf said that the strikes
were ``a crime against international law and the U.N. charter.
	   In defending their strikes, London and Washington had failed to
mention the report of the inspectors of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, the foreign minister said.
	   The IAEA has reported that Iraq had provided ``the necessary
level of cooperation'' to its inspectors.
	   The United States and Britain did not mention this ``because
they cannot benefit from it for their evil intentions,'' al-Sahhaf
said.

	   BAGHDAD: earlier stand-off.
	   Al-Shahhaf said the western allies were defending their attacks
because of five cases of alleged non-cooperation among the 427
inspections.
	   Taking issues with these five cases, al-Sahhaf said in one
instance, the inspectors wanted to enter a ``small headquarters''
of the ruling Baath Party.
	   ``What is the relation between the small headquarters of a
political party and a disarmament mission?''
	   In another case, the inspectors tried to enter a former office
of a security official, but this had been converted into a guest
house. The inspectors were allowed to enter it after a delay.
	   ``Do you deserve to be bombarded because you have delayed an
inspection team 45 minutes?'' al-Sahhaf asked.
	   The foreign minister said the cruise missiles had inflicted
``heavy casualties'' in their impact on civilian areas of Baghdad.
He did not give figures.
	   Al-Sahhaf said contrary to the U.S. claims of targeting Iraq's
military and its weapons manufacturing infrastructure, the missiles
had hit ``several industrial establishments - all of them under
complete, ongoing monitoring (by the United Nations).''
	   One missile hit a factory that produces brake oil for cars, he
said.
	   The minister said that instead of calling their campaign
Operation Desert Fox, the allies should have named it ``Operation
Villains in the Arabian Desert.''

Angolan embassy official repatriated in connection with fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The Angolan Embassy said Thursday its
consul-general was to be sent home after being arrested in
connection with the alleged embezzlement of up to dlrs 1 million.
	   The embassy official was arrested late Wednesday in a hotel
south of Lisbon, a week after relatives reported him missing,
according to the daily newspaper Publico.
	   An embassy statement, which did not give the consul-general's
name, said he had confessed to ``irregular procedures'' in managing
the embassy's finances. Embassy officials and police refused to
give the consul-general's name.
	   Efforts to investigate the fraud had been delayed by the
``unexpected disappearance of this official ... who was located
yesterday,'' the statement added.

Italian federation head latest under investigation

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nizzola quote. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Soccer federation president Luciano Nizzola became
the latest top Italian sports official implicated in the country's
growing doping scandal when he was officially notified Thursday
that he is under investigation.
	   Rome prosecutors are looking into whether Nizzola played a role
in hiding positive drug tests to help clubs or players.
	   ``It is very possible that some error might have been committed
by a functionary. The federation certainly does not have any
interest in making mistakes or protecting anybody,'' Nizzola told
reporters. ``If there was an error, it was certainly in good
faith.''
	   Antonio Matarrese, Nizzola's predecessor and now a UEFA vice
president, was informed Wednesday that he is being investigated in
connection with the same allegations.
	   The Rome inquiry is one of several into the use of
performance-enhancing substances in Italian soccer. The fallout has
included the resignation of Italian Olympic Committee president
Mario Pescante and the closing of the country's drug-testing
laboratory.
	   The Acqua Acetosa lab was shut down in October after it was hit
by allegations of improper handling of soccer doping tests and
hiding positive results.
	   Matarrese resigned as head of the federation following Italy's
poor showing at the 1996 European Championships.

French track star trying to keep up with Jones
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRANDE BAIE, Mauritius (AP) _ Crowned Europe's No. 1 sprinter in
1998, Christine Arron goes into the new year with a challenge:
keeping up with the Jones.
	   That's U.S. superstar Marion Jones, who won all three 100-meter
clashes against Arron in 1998, though the gap between the two
narrowed sharply.
	   Jones, 23, clocked a personal best time of 10.65 seconds in
1998, cutting her previous record by 11 hundredths of a second. The
25-year-old Arron slashed her fastest time by 30 hundredths of a
second when she won the European title in Budapest in a time of
10.73.
	   That time made Arron the third fastest woman in history behind
Florence Griffith Joyner (10.49 seconds) and Jones.
	   ``That time really gave me loads of confidence,'' Arron told The
Associated Press in Mauritius, where her French coach, Jacques
Piasenta, organizes winter training.
	   ``But I just don't have the stamina and short recovery time to
compete in so many events like Marion. She can probably do four
events in one day. That's awesome.''
	   ``I know now I can do one thing very well and that's fine by
me,'' Arron said.
	   But which one is it? Don't assume Arron will be lining up
against Jones in the 100 meters at the 1999 World Championships in
Seville, Spain. Or in the millennium Olympics in Sydney.
	   ``We're going to train for the 100 meters and 200 meters and
then decide which to go for just two months before the World
Championships,'' Arron said. ``We'll probably do that before the
Olympics as well.''
	   For an athlete who has none of her rival's powerfully versatile
talent, won't this be unsettling?
	   ``Not at all. Once I adopt an idea it's all systems go,'' Arron
said.
	   In pure speed there is little difference between Arron and the
world number one. But Jones breaks brilliantly out of the blocks
while Arron starts sluggishly.
	   ``It's all about power in the thighs and sustaining the crouch
position longer for maximum thrust,'' Arron explained. ``I'm
working on it. Quicker starts have already cut 10 hundredths off my
times.''
	   ``Against Marion, over 100 meters, a poor start leaves you
dead,'' Piasenta pointed out. ``That's why we're looking at the 200
meters. The start is not so vital.''
	   At 1.80 meters (5 feet 11 inches) tall, Arron admires Jones, but
has always looked up to Jamaica's Merlene Ottey as an athletic role
model.
	   ``At 38, she's still at the top and she's stayed elegant. That's
important to me. Ottey's proved you can express femininity through
sport,'' she said.
	   At the same age as Ottey, Griffith Joyner died this year.
	   ``We can't affirm Florence died from doping because we don't
know,'' Arron said. ``Still, her change of physique, and the
sudden, incredible improvement in her times look pretty suspect to
me. But it's too late to do anything.''
	   ``You can see why some athletes from ghettoes and poor families
see an Olympic gold as a way out. Even if they know a product can
harm or even kill them they'll use it. They'll grab the 10 years of
money and glory and accept the consequences,'' Arron said.
	   ``I'd prefer never to win a single medal and be sure of enjoying
a long life.''

Man's conviction for IRA bombing of Hyde Park overturned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A man convicted of a deadly 1982 IRA bombing in
London's Hyde Park had his conviction quashed Thursday, a month
after he was paroled early from prison under terms of the Belfast
peace accord.
	   Danny McNamee had proclaimed his innocence ever since receiving
a 25-year sentence for the blast, which killed four members of the
British army's Household Cavalry and seven horses.
	   Prosecutors relied heavily on traces of McNamee's fingerprints
found on remnants of the bomb and two other arms caches to convict
him in 1987.
	   But three Court of Appeal judges accepted that it might have
made a difference had jurors known that many more prints from a
known IRA bomb-maker were on the bomb remains, too.
	   The senior judge, Lord Justice Swinton Thomas, said it was ``not
possible for us to say that the jury would necessarily have arrived
at the same conclusion if they had knowledge of the fresh
evidence.''
	   But he emphasized: ``It does not at all follow that this
appellant is innocent of the charge brought against him, or that he
has served 11 years' imprisonment for a crime which it has been
found that he did not commit.''
	   Thomas said the prosecution's evidence still ``makes out a very
strong case that the appellant was indeed a conspirator to cause
explosions.''
	   McNamee, 38, hugged by well-wishers and signing autographs
outside the courthouse, said he considered himself to have been
proved innocent.
	   ``It's proved I was not guilty, even in a really grudging way,''
he said, calling the Hyde Park attack ``a terrible atrocity and a
sad loss for the families.''

Asian, European, U.S. markets unfazed by strikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIOREL URMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ European and U.S. markets were mostly up
Thursday, as investors shrugged off the launch of American military
strikes against Iraq and its implications for the impeachment
efforts against President Clinton.
	   The airstrikes against Iraq, which got under way Wednesday,
didn't spark dramatic responses in Tokyo or in Europe, and U.S.
government bonds, which some expected might attract frightened
investors, were instead off modestly.
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 74
points at 8,865 after one hour of trading.
	   In Japan, the Nikkei stock average rose 0.12 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.95 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.73 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.65 percent.
	   In Hong Kong, news on Iraq was largely ignored as the blue-chip
Hang Seng Index rose 143.92 points, or 1.4 percent, at 10,083.31.
	   U.S. bonds were tame in the early going. The bellwether long
bond has, in fact, lost ground, slipping 1/2 point. That has inched
its yield up to 5.02 percent.
	   The improvement contradicted some expectations that the
Treasurys market would rally, as investors, perhaps rattled by the
action against Iraq, would seek the security of the government
securities market.
	   ``As a general rule, markets hate uncertainty,'' John Williams,
chief global market economist at Bankers Trust, told Dow Jones
Newswires Thursday.
	   ``The consensus view is President (Clinton) won't be convicted
by the Senate if he is impeached, and that the military effort will
be successful,'' Williams said. ``I suspect the market will have a
pretty good tone.''
	   Oil stocks were expected to move moderately higher in Thursday's
trading, as investors anticipate that the prospect of removing Iraq
from the energy-product pipeline will result in higher crude oil
prices. Any gains, though, are expected to be limited, reflecting
the modest contribution Iraq makes to the world's oil supply.
	   Worries about Clinton's possible impeachment weighed slightly on
the dollar.
	   The dollar _ considered a safe haven in times of international
unrest _ had surged beyond 117 yen immediately following the
military action, but slipped back in late trading.

Iraqi Foreign Minister accuses US and Britain of lying
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: COMBINES pvs; MINOR EDITS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Sahhaf
accused the United States of ``shameless lying'' in their remarks
on Iraq's stand with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Addressing the first government press conference since the
U.S.-British attacks on Iraq began, al-Sahhaf said that in
defending their strikes, London and Washington had failed to
mention the report of the inspectors of the International Atomic
Energy Agency.
	   The IAEA had reported that Iraq had provided ``the necessary
level of cooperation.''
	   The United States and Britian did not mention this ``because
they cannot benefit from it for their evil intentions,'' al-Sahhaf
said.
	   ``They lied to the world shamelessly, saying that the report of
the executive chairman of (the U.N. Special Commission) had not
cooperated,'' he said.
	   But the U.N. inspectors had visited 427 sites since Nov. 17,
when inspections resumed after an earlier stand-off, he said.
	   The Special Commission's report had cited five cases of alleged
non-cooperation among these 427 inspections, the minister said.
	   Taking issues with these five cases, al-Sahhaf said in one
instance, the inspectors wanted to enter a ``small headquarters''
of the ruling Baath Party.
	   ``What is the relation between the small headquarters of a
political party and a disarmament mission?''
	   In another case, the inspectors tried to enter a former office
of a security official, but this had been converted into a guest
house. The inspectors were allowed to enter it after a delay.
	   ``Do you deserve to be bombarded because you have delayed an
inspection team 45 minutes?'' al-Sahhaf asked.
	   The foreign minister said the cruise missiles had inflicted
``heavy casualties'' in their impact on civilian areas of Baghdad.
He did not give figures.
	   Al-Sahhaf said contrary to the U.S. claims of targeting Iraq's
military and its weapons manufacturing infrastructure, the missiles
had hit ``several industrial establishments - all of them under
complete, ongoing monitoring (by the United Nations).''
	   One missile hit a factory that produces brake oil for cars, he
said.
	   The minister said that instead of calling their campaign
Operation Desert Fox, the allies should have named it ``Operation
Villains in the Arabian Desert.''
	   The special commission is charged with overseeing the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and long-range
missiles _ a process that Baghdad must complete before the United
Nations will lift the sanctions imposed after the 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian legislators considered a motion Thursday
appealing to Monica Lewinsky to help halt the American attack on
Iraq.
	   ``The State Duma appeals to Ms. Lewinsky to undertake
corresponding measures to restrain the emotions of Bill Clinton,''
said the motion by nationalist lawmaker Alexander Filatov.
	   Lawmakers in the Duma, the lower chamber of parliament,
considered including the motion in a broader resolution denouncing
the attack on Iraq. But seeking to speed up passage of the
resolution, they approved it later Thursday without any additions.
There was no separate vote on the Lewinsky amendment.
	   The attack by the United States and Britain on Iraq was
condemned by almost all major political groups in Russia. The
Communists, the largest party in the Duma, also mentioned Clinton
and his relationship with the former White House intern.
	   ``Many people link it with Clinton's impeachment and his
intimate relations with a certain person, but if these relations
develop into such acts of vandalism, than all of U.S. democracy is
worth a penny,'' Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov told a Duma
debate on the Iraqi crisis.

British joins with United States on attack on Iraq

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Blair's statement in House of Commons; British
aircraft in action &QL; 
 &UR; By MARA D. BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British fighter-bombers went into action against
Iraqi targets Thursday as Prime Minister Tony Blair told
legislators he was certain the U.S.-led strikes had nothing to do
with U.S. President Bill Clinton's domestic problems.
	   ``I have no doubt at all that action is fully justified now,''
Blair told a packed House of Commons. ``That is my own strong
personal view. I know that President Clinton reached the same
conclusion for the same reason.''
	   Blair added of Clinton: ``Not for the first time, he has shown
the courage to do the right thing and he has my full support.''
	   A dozen Tornado fighter-bombers based in Kuwait did not join in
the initial strikes by cruise missiles and U.S. aircraft, which
began Wednesday night. Blair gave no details of Thursday's
operations by the British Tornado aircraft based in Kuwait.
	   ``Saddam attaches importance to only one thing: His ability to
dominate his people and his neighbors by military force,'' the
prime minister told the Commons.
	   ``He wants to retain all the weapons he can, including weapons
of mass destruction. He has used them before. I am in no doubt of
his readiness to use them again if he has any opportunity.''
	   Earlier, Defense Secretary George Robertson said the military
action was not designed to ``to kill, capture or remove Saddam
Hussein.'' That would take thousands of troops in a land campaign,
he told a news conference.
	   Robertson said television pictures he had seen Thursday morning
after missile strikes late Wednesday showed the initial attack had
gone according to plan, with minimal civilian casualties.
	   He gave no specifics, but said ``pictures today show the
civilian population going about its business.''
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Thursday that the airstrikes
would continue until Britain and the United States achieved the
twin objectives of ``degrading'' Saddam's capacity to produce
weapons of mass destruction and ``diminishing severely'' the war
machine that keeps him in power.
	   ``He is not going to succeed in developing weapons with which he
can threaten the whole region and threaten humanity,'' Cook said.
	   Blair, the only world leader to join Clinton, announced
Britain's participation Wednesday night, moments after the assault
began at 10 p.m. (2200 GMT) local time.

Tycoon has high hopes on fifth try; to bypass Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) _ On the eve of his fifth try to make
the first round-the-world balloon voyage, British tycoon Richard
Branson said Thursday that strong winds should keep him clear of
Iraq and get them home in time for New Year's.
	   Branson also said he and two other ballooning veterans _ Chicago
millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand _ would ride wind
currents that would take them at least 50 miles north of Iraq and
over Turkey, he said.
	   The crew of the ICO Global Challenge was to lift off at 7:30
a.m. (0730 GMT) Friday from a Moroccan air force base outside
Marrakech and head eastward.
	   ``We have a window that takes us around the world at great speed
and that's something we're not going to pass up,'' Branson told a
news conference.
	   ``We are going ahead. We feel the risks are acceptable, and we
are confident we can stay out of the war situation,'' Branson said,
a day after the United States and Britain launched air strikes on
Iraq.
	   ``If they are sending any missiles, we'd appreciate that they
sort of keep us in mind. We won't get in their way,'' Branson
joked.
	   The tycoon of the Virgin group said he planned to enter the
United States near San Francisco. ``We're going to go under the
bridge,'' he joked, referring to the Golden Gate.
	   Branson secured permission from 97 countries for overflights and
had only four refusals -- Iran, Iraq, Russia and North Korea, said
Mike Johnson, a spokesman for ICO Global, a mobile telephone
company supporting the trip.
	   Johnson said the crew was more confident this time because of
the better technology used to build the balloon, including a Kevlar
canopy over the crew's pressurized capsule. Kevlar is used for
bulletproof vests.
	   Fossett has made four tries to ring the globe, the last one
ending when his Solo Spirit was ripped apart in a violent storm off
Australia.
	   Asked if he was afraid, Fossett said: ``Yes, my fall into the
Coral Sea in August reminded me how dangerous this is. Once we get
to altitude (9,100 meters, or 30,000 feet) I'll feel a lot more
comfortable.
	   Lindstrand was on Branson's three previous attempts and has
broken several ballooning records.
	   Branson has tried, and failed, four times to become the first
person to trek the globe in a balloon. The only time he managed to
take off, in January 1997, his balloon crashed a day after takeoff,
landing in the Algerian desert.
	   Branson and Fossett, one-time rivals, were putting their money
and energy together to tackle the challenge.
	   At least three other balloon crews have been waiting for
favorable weather to launch their balloon -- from Albuquerque, New
Mexico, Loves Park, Illinois and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team
is to take off next month from Alice Springs, Australia.

Forest fires blamed for smell in MD-11 cockpit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Forest fires on the Indonesian island
of Sumatra are believed to have caused a smell in the cockpit of a
Swissair MD-11 which prompted the captain to turn back, the company
said Thursday.
	   Flight 189 from Singapore to Zurich turned back 41 minutes after
takeoff on Nov. 26 after an acrid smell was noticed in the cockpit.
	   Studies carried out by the Federal Institute of Technology in
Zurich ``find that with great certainty the cause of the smell in
the cockpit was a result of the forest fires,'' Swissair said in a
statement.
	   ``The meteorological facts and satellite data point to the fact
that the wind had carried the smoke clouds a great distance,'' it
added.
	   An analysis of the air filter systems had shown a large amount
of burnt organic material, the airline said.
	   The company said the crew had not been warned about smoke before
they left Singapore and so were not prepared for the smell.
	   ``Swissair is certain that the decision of the captain to return
to Singapore was absolutely right,'' the statement added.
	   All 229 people on board were killed when a Swissair MD-11 bound
from New York to Geneva crashed off Nova Scotia Sept. 2.
	   Sixteen minutes before the crash, the pilots detected smoke in
the cockpit. The cause of the crash has yet to be determined.

EU start talks on fishing quotes for 1999; bluefin tuna major
</HEADLINE>
problem
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union fisheries ministers
opened negotiations Thursday to set catch quotas for next year,
trying to find a balance between the demands of their fishermen and
the need to protect dwindling stocks.
	   Proposals from the EU's executive Commission for sizable cuts in
the quotas diverge greatly from demands for increases from major
fishing nations. The differences led to an almost immediate
suspension of the full meeting to allow for a series of bilateral
sessions.
	   EU officials said the ministers were far from agreement as they
assessed about 100 different quotas for various types of fish in
waters around the EU.
	   The ministers are set for a particularly bitter fight over which
fleets will be able to catch dwindling quotas of bluefin tuna in
the Mediterranean and sell them to Japan where they are a
high-priced delicacy for exclusive sushi tables.
	   Quota proposals for other fish also reflect dwindling stocks in
Mediterranean, Baltic and Atlantic waters. Commission offers for
total allowable catches include cuts of up to 47 percent in
whiting, 40 percent in saithe and 30 percent in haddock in certain
waters.
	   Commission officials said the cuts were based on scientific
evidence showing significant declines of stocks. Yet during the
negotiating sessions EU member states are expected to take the hard
edges off the Commission's proposals.
	   Spain, France and Ireland are all asking for increases in catch
quotas for certain fish where the Commission is seeking cuts.
	   Negotiations will be especially tough on divvying up the quota
for bluefin tuna, one of the world's most expensive fish. Under
international agreements, the quota for the EU as a whole
represents about dlrs 250 million. That has to be shared between
Greece, Italy, Spain, France and Portugal.
	   Bluefin tuna is one of the most sought-after fish for sushi and
sashimi. On the Tokyo fish market, prices can easily reach dlrs
15,000 a ton. Before of Japan's financial crisis, prices were
double.
	   Because of years of overfishing, the fish has become ever rarer,
and the 15-nation EU has seen its catch quota decline to 20,165
tons in 1999 compared to 28,108 tons this year. In addition, the
international ICCAT organization that sets the tuna quotas, has
penalized the EU an additional 4,029 tons for overfishing in 1997.
	   Greece and Italy overfished their share of bluefin tuna in 1997
but they are calling on EU partners to share the penalty burden.
	   Under the EU's executive Commission proposals, Greece would lose
54 percent of its quota, even though its overfishing exceeded that
and Italy, which overfished its quota by about 30 percent would
lose 16 percent.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Russia and China angrily denounced the U.S. attack
on Iraq, while allies such as Germany and Canada offered their
immediate support, placing all blame for the crisis on Saddam
Hussein.
	   ``Nobody has the right to act on their own in the name of the
United Nations and even less to pretend to be the judge of the
entire world,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said in
Madrid, Spain.
	   Iraq's neighbor and former foe in war, Iran, joined Russia and
China in blasting the use of force, saying it will bring ``even
more pain and misery for the people in that country.'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi also urged Iraq to cooperate
with the United Nations.
	   Fearful of recriminations, the United States today closed all
but two of its African embassies, and security was stepped up at
many U.S. and British institutions worldwide, from the Philippines
to Greece and Denmark.
	   The U.S. State Department ordered the departure of some of its
embassy personnel in Kuwait and warned other Americans living there
to consider leaving.
	   The Arab League condemned the strikes, and a Gulf official said
Baghdad had reached out for Arab support to stop the attacks.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin demanded an immediate end to the
military campaign, and Chinese President Jiang Zemin also asked
President Clinton to refrain from further attacks.
	   ``This is a violation of the U.N. charter and the principles of
international law, and we condemn this,'' said Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi.
	   The German government noted, however, that the Iraqi leadership
``had been warned'' the international community would have to act
if it failed to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Support for the airstrikes also poured in from Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, the Netherlands,
Austria and Spain.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has brought this crisis on himself,'' Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said.
	   France, which has close ties to Iraq, deplored ``the grave human
consequences'' of the military strikes, but added its regret that
Iraqi leaders were unable to ``show proof of the spirit of complete
cooperation'' demanded by previous agreements with the United
Nations.
	   Fearing an influx of refugees, both Jordan and Turkey closed the
borders they share with Iraq.
	   In a statement today, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
blamed Saddam for ``the grave situation'' while Turkish Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem expressed disappointment in the attack but also
called on Iraq to comply.
	   In Pakistan, the Senate passed a resolution unanimously
condemning the airstrikes as ``an attack on humanity and the
Islamic world.'' Islamic Pakistan's right-wing religious group
called the United States ``international terrorists.''
	   The strikes led news reports in Lebanon, where all newspaper,
radio and television stations carried news agency reports without
comment.
	   In Indonesia, the world's most populous Islamic nation, leaders
pleaded for restraint.
	   Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka backed the United
States and Britain, saying, ``We strongly demand that Iraq
immediately and unconditionally implement the U.N. Security
Council's resolutions.''
	   He was seconded by Misao Nozaki, a 47-year-old Tokyo restaurant
owner who called the bombing justified ``because Iraq has continued
developing nuclear weapons in a way that goes against the common
sense of the rest of the world.''
	   But Yukari Ohi, 38, an office worker in Tokyo, said she opposed
the use of force.
	   ``I think the U.S. decision to attack Iraq was apparently
intended to shift attention from the impeachment issue to war,''
Ohi said, noting that the airstrikes came as Clinton faced an
impeachment vote.
	   India condemned the attack, while Mexico expressed
disappointment.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was noncommittal,
saying, ``Israel is outside the dispute, and in any case will take
care of defending itself if the need arises.''
	   The international Red Cross sent a diplomatic note to the U.S.,
British and Iraqi governments asking them to do everything possible
to ensure civilians and medical facilities are unaffected by
military action.

Inter, Roma set to test title ambitions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Internazionale of Milan can make months of
early-season heartache disappear in 90 minutes.
	   The club got off to a slow start marked by inner turmoil and
injuries to star strikers Roberto Baggio and Ronaldo, but a victory
over visiting AS Roma Sunday night will push Inter right back into
the thick of the Serie A title chase.
	   The match highlights the 14th round and will give both sides a
chance to measure if they really could end long championship
droughts. Inter last captured the league crown in 1989, Roma in
1983.
	   Fiorentina, alone in first place for the first time since 1982,
leads with 28 points. AC Milan is next with 24, followed by Roma
and AC Parma with 23 apiece.
	   Inter sits fifth with 21 points.
	   Sunday's other games are Cagliari vs. Bologna; Empoli vs. AC
Parma; Juventus of Turin vs. Salernitana; Lazio of Rome vs.
Udinese; Perugia vs. Fiorentina; Piacenza vs. Bari; Sampdoria of
Genoa vs. Milan; and Vicenza vs. Venezia.
	   After a break for the holidays, league action will resume with a
rare Wednesday slate of games Jan. 6.
	   Inter fired coach Luigi Simoni on Nov. 30 and replacement Mircea
Lucescu has compiled a win and a draw since. The club was also hit
by Taribo West's unsettling tantrum, in which the Nigerian defender
ripped off his jersey and threw it at Lucescu after being
substituted.
	   On the field, veteran Baggio and Brazil's Ronaldo have played
together only a handful of minutes, both sidelined intermittently
by knee injuries. The have been formidable, though, when lined up
side-by-side.
	   Baggio fed Ronaldo for the game-winner against Udinese last
week, giving the two-time FIFA Player of the Year four goals in the
six games he's played this season.
	   But neither appears to be able to sustain a top level of play
for a full game. Lucescu indicated he might start Youri Djorkaeff,
who helped France win the World Cup, up front with Ronaldo, and
bring Baggio off the bench in the second half.
	   Roma, meanwhile, has Italy's top attack, averaging about 2 goals
per game. Marco Delvecchio is tied for second in the league with 8
goals, one ahead of teammate Francesco Totti.
	   The third starter at forward, Brazil's Paulo Sergio (5 goals),
has been slowed by a leg injury and might not start Sunday. Carmine
Gautieri, who scored last week as a substitute, would fill in.
	   An Inter win would put it no lower than fourth in the standings
and might even vault it into second place.
	   Juventus, meanwhile, hosts Salernitana _ which is 16th in the
18-team league _ hoping not to lose any more ground in its uphill
quest for a third straight title.
	   The Turin club has lost three straight (it dropped two games all
last season) and been shut out in four in a row since star striker
Alessandro Del Piero went out for the season with knee ligament
damage.
	   In addition, defender Mark Iuliano will miss the game with a
broken nose suffered last week against Fiorentina, while Uruguayan
center back Paolo Montero and veteran midfielder Antonio Conte are
suspended.

Ministers from three oil exporters meet in Madrid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Ministers from three top oil producers met
in the Spanish capital Thursday, hoping to find a solution to the
pricing problem that has hurt their countries' economies.
	   Officials from Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela attended the
meeting, which follows similar gatherings of oil ministers from
other countries. All were searching for a so-far elusive answer to
the question of how to bring the price of oil higher.
	   Crude prices, depressed by overproduction amid a global economic
crisis, have hovered this year around 12-year lows, costing
oil-dependent nations billions of dollars in revenue.
	   ``Everybody is trying to cooperate in his own way,'' Saudi Oil
Minister Ali Naimi told reporters before going into the talks.
``But to get optimum cooperation you need continuous dialogue.''
	   After the meeting, Naimi was expected to fly to Norway as part
of the process of discussions. Norway has already agreed to cut
100,000 barrels a day until the end of the year.
	   The slide in oil prices has continued despite repeated attempts
earlier this year at production cuts, including those implemented
by some OPEC members.
	   Saudi Arabia is the leading producer among the 11-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Venezuela is OPEC's
No. 3 exporter Venezuela while Mexico is not a member of the
organization.
	   A Gulf source close to the Saudis said the meeting was part of
an ongoing process of consultations and attempts to bring stability
to the market and to improve oil prices in different ways,
``including adherence'' to production levels.
	   But the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cautioned
that there should not be high or low expectations from the meeting.
	   The price of Brent crude has traded at around dlrs 10 a barrel.
The source said Thursday that the Saudis would like to see a price
target for Brent at between dlrs 15 and dlrs 20.
	   Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico have been responsible for two
rounds of output cuts this year, totaling about 3.2 million barrels
from world oil producers. Analysts say another 1.5 million barrels
must be taken off the market to begin having an effect on prices.

Iraqi Foreign Minister accuses US and Britain of lying
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: COMBINES pvs; MINOR EDITS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Sahhaf
said America's attack on Baghdad had inflicted heavy civilian
casualties, and he accused Washington of ``shameless lying'' in its
remarks on Iraq's stand with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Addressing the first government press conference since the
U.S.-British attacks on Iraq began, al-Sahhaf said that in
defending their strikes, London and Washington had failed to
mention the report of the inspectors of the International Atomic
Energy Agency.
	   The IAEA had reported that Iraq had provided ``the necessary
level of cooperation.''
	   The United States and Britian did not mention this ``because
they cannot benefit from it for their evil intentions,'' al-Sahhaf
said.
	   ``They lied to the world shamelessly, saying that the report of
the executive chairman of (the U.N. Special Commission) had not
cooperated,'' he said.
	   But the U.N. inspectors had visited 427 sites since Nov. 17,
when inspections resumed after an earlier stand-off, he said.
	   The Special Commission's report had cited five cases of alleged
non-cooperation among these 427 inspections, the minister said.
	   Taking issues with these five cases, al-Sahhaf said in one
instance, the inspectors wanted to enter a ``small headquarters''
of the ruling Baath Party.
	   ``What is the relation between the small headquarters of a
political party and a disarmament mission?''
	   In another case, the inspectors tried to enter a former office
of a security official, but this had been converted into a guest
house. The inspectors were allowed to enter it after a delay.
	   ``Do you deserve to be bombarded because you have delayed an
inspection team 45 minutes?'' al-Sahhaf asked.
	   Al-Sahhaf said contrary to the U.S. claims of targeting Iraq's
military and its weapons manufacturing infrastructure, the missiles
had hit ``several industrial establishments - all of them under
complete, ongoing monitoring (by the United Nations).''
	   One missile hit a factory that produces brake oil for cars, he
said.
	   He said there were heavy civilian casualties in parts of
Baghdad, but gave no figures.
	   The minister said that instead of calling their campaign
Operation Desert Fox, the allies should have named it ``Operation
Villains in the Arabian Desert.''
	   The special commission is charged with overseeing the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and long-range
missiles _ a process that Baghdad must complete before the United
Nations will lift the sanctions imposed after the 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.

Turkey closes border with Iraq fearing a refugee influx
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UDATES throughout with Turkey suspending plans to improve
relations with Iraq, warnings carried by radio of chemical attacks;
EDITS to TRIM &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Fearing an influx of refugees, Turkey on
Thursday closed down its border with Iraq following the airstrikes
on Baghdad, a local official said.
	   ``We shut down the Habur border gate for security reasons,''
Mustafa Demir, governor in the border area, told the Turkish news
agency Anatolia.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds had fled to Turkey after
the 1991 Gulf War.
	   But Gov. Halil Ulusoy of the Sirnak border province said Turkey
was allowing the return of some 1,000 Turkish trucks, which trade
goods against cheap Iraqi diesel, stranded in northern Iraq.
	   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem implicitly confirmed that the border
had been closed. `We are taking every necessary measure,
particularly not to experience the immigration problem again,'' Cem
said.
	   But Shazad Saib, an Iraqi Kurdish spokesman of the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan, which controls part of the northern Iraq,
dismissed the possibility of a refugee influx.
	   ``Everything is calm in the region, there is no chaos, no
panic,'' Saib said.
	   An Iraqi Kurdish radio was broadcasting frequent warnings that
Iraqi forces may launch chemical weapons attacks against the Kurds,
Anatolia reported. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein used chemical
weapons to quell a Kurdish uprising in the aftermath of the Gulf
War.
	   U.S. President Clinton, backed by Britain, launched the attack
Wednesday night after Iraq again prevented U.N. inspectors from
searching for weapons of mass destruction.
	   Cem called on Baghdad to comply with U.N. resolutions but added,
``Our demand is to bring an end to the suffering of the Iraqi
people who pay the most heavy price in the crisis.''
	   During the Gulf War, Turkey allowed the use of a southern
airbase for allied bombardments on Iraq, but it has been uneasy
over the loss of about dlrs 30 billion in trade with Iraq since
then.
	   Turkey also fears that a new war may lead to creation of an
independent Iraqi Kurdish state, which could boost the aspirations
of Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in Turkey.
	   ``Experiencing hot clashes just beside our borders and in a
region already under the threat of instability, is a development
that leads to anxiety,'' Cem said.
	   A senior government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Thursday that Turkey had suspended its plans to
upgrade its diplomatic relations with Baghdad. He did not
elaborate.
	   Turkey has not had an ambassador in Iraq since the Gulf War but
earlier this year had announced plans to appoint one.
	   Cem said Washington has not asked Turkey for the right to use
the southern Turkish airbase of Incirlik, which hosts U.S. and
British warplanes that enforce a no-fly zone above the 36th
parallel in northern Iraq.
	   Senior Airman Adam Stump, at the base near the southern city of
Adana, confirmed that they did not participate in Wednesday's
attack.
	   A group of demonstrators of the leftist Workers Party chanted
anti-American slogans in Istanbul, but police prevented them from
gathering before the U.S. consulate in Istanbul.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Thousands of people rallied in central
Grozny on Thursday in support of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov,
who has promised to clamp down on crime in the breakaway republic.
	   The gathering adopted a resolution that called for broader
powers for Maskhadov, and urged him to crack down on rebel warlords
and suspected kidnappers. Protesters shouted for an end to the
crime wave.
	   Maskhadov imposed a one-month state of emergency Tuesday to try
to end rampant crime and kidnappings in Chechnya. He called for
people to turn out at the rally Thursday to support his decision.
	   The Chechen Security Ministry claimed 50,000 people attended the
rally. After it ended, opposition groups staged a smaller gathering
to urge Maskhadov's ouster, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Hundreds of people have been taken hostage in Chechnya since the
end of a 1994-96 war with Russia. In an unusually gruesome display
of lawlessness, four Western captives were beheaded last week.
	   The hostages _ three Britons and a New Zealander _ had been in
Chechnya to install a cellular phone system. They were kidnapped
Oct. 3 and their heads were found after a rescue attempt apparently
went wrong.
	   Maskhadov blamed the leader of a prominent group of Chechen
Islamic militants for the attack and for many other kidnappings
that have hit the region.
	   The group, the Islamic Jamaats or Warriors of Islam, has denied
any connection with the killings, and threatened to launch attacks
on Russia if authorities clamp down on their operations, ITAR-Tass
reported Thursday.
	   In a statement on Chechen television Wednesday night, group
leaders threatened to attack Russian sites outside Chechnya if
Maskhadov tries to fight them.
	   The group does not want to fight within Chechnya because it
refuses to ``spill the blood of Muslim brothers'' or play into the
hands of Russia's secret services and enemies of Chechen
independence, ITAR-Tass said, citing remarks made during the
address.
	   The group is holed up in Chechnya's second largest city,
Urus-Martan. Fighters led by warlord Arbi Barayev have dug trenches
around the town and say they are ready for war.
	   The resolution adopted at the rally in Grozny specifically
called for Maskhadov to disperse the armed groups in Urus-Martan
and bring the city under government control, Interfax said.
	   Maskhadov won Chechnya's presidential elections almost two years
ago by an overwhelming margin, and still retains widespread support
among many Chechens despite his failure to restore stability in the
region.

Serb officers sought by the Hague tribunal heard as witnesses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three Serb officers sought by a U.N.
war crimes tribunal appeared as witnesses at a Yugoslav military
probe into alleged 1991 war crimes, in defiance of international
demands to hand over the case and the suspects to The Hague court.
	   Two representatives of the U.N. tribunal also attended the
hearings in the Belgrade Military Court, according to a statement
from the court carried by the official Tanjug news agency.
	   The statement added that Veselin Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic
and Milan Mrksic, accused of ordering the 1991 massacre of 261
Croats taken out of a hospital in Vukovar in eastern Croatia,
``testified as witnesses.''
	   The statement further said that in their testimonies the three
responded to allegations from the Hague indictment. The Belgrade
military court said the proceedings will continue.
	   ``I have no comment at all about this proceedings,'' declared
The Hague court investigator Denis Milner as he came out of the
military court building.
	   The move by the Belgrade government, loyal to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, has been criticized by The Hague tribunal and
the West.
	   Yugoslavia refuses to extradite its citizens accused of war
crimes citing the country's constitution which bars extradition.
Defying international pressure the military court held its own
probe against ``unknown persons'' involved in the Vukovar massacre.
	   One of the officers, Veselin Sljivancanin, told Belgrade daily
``Glas'' Thursday that ``I have nothing to be ashamed of as I did
my officer's duty honorably in Vukovar.''
	   ``I recognize only my own state, our courts and the judgment of
my people,'' said Sljivancanin. ``For me, any foreign court does
not exist.''
	   Earlier this month, chief prosecutor Louise Arbour accused
Belgrade of setting up show proceedings to prevent the three from
being extradited for trial before the U.N. court in The Hague.
	   At her request, tribunal judges ordered Yugoslav authorities to
halt their investigation and send any evidence they have against
the officers to The Hague along with the officers.
	   Under international law, the tribunal has the power to take over
cases from domestic courts. National governments are obliged to
cooperate with such requests within 60 days.
	   Most of the suspects sought by the tribunal in connection with
alleged war crimes committed during the Croatian and Bosnian wars
are Serbs. But the key suspects are not in custody due to Bosnian
Serb and Yugoslav refusal to cooperate with the tribunal.
	   Serb-led Yugoslavia, now consisting of Serbia and much smaller
Montenegro, faces further international isolation over its defiance
concerning the Hague court.

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Patrick Ortlieb was nearly five
seconds faster than the best time of a day before and beat out
Italy's Kristian Ghedina and fellow Austrian Werner Franz on
Thursday in the final practice for consecutive World Cup downhill
races this weekend.
	   The 31-year-old former Olympic champion took advantage on one of
his favorite tracks and earned one of 10 Austrian berths for the
pair of downhills with a time of 2 minutes, 4.40 seconds.
	   Ortlieb's was significantly faster than teammate Fritz Stroble,
who set the pace Wednesday down the 3,495-meter Saslong course.
	   Strobl did not finish Thursday's run, falling at the S-shaped
Ciaslat bend. He escaped unhurt.
	   ``No doubt I like this course,'' said Ortlieb, who has two of
his four World Cup victories at Val Gardena, in 1993 and 1995.
``The track was icy and much faster than yesterday. The jumps are
demanding and I expect a close, tough race tomorrow.''
	   Friday's downhill replaces the season opener canceled in
Whistler Mountain, Canada, earlier this month. Saturday's race is
the original Val Gardena downhill, the third of the World Cup
season, in northeast Italy.
	   Ghedina, the defending champion in Val Gardena, trailed the
Austrian veteran by 0.15 seconds.
	   ``Practice is like a race for the Austrians, who need to
qualify. They are always very fast,'' said Ghedina, who's seeking
his first victory of the season. ``I made several mistakes at the
bumps, and I'm really surprised with my second place today. But I
feel competitive for the race.''
	   Franz, one of the five Austrians to finish in the top 11, came
in third, 0.41 seconds behind.
	   Franco Cavegn edged his younger Swiss teammate, Ambrosi
Hoffmann, for fourth place.
	   Hoffmann, a 1996 world junior champion, was third in Wednesday's
practice and is considered a potential threat.
	   Olympic downhill champion Jean-Luc Cretier of France was sixth,
0.67 seconds behind Ortlieb.
	   ``I'm skiing well and I have high hopes for the two races
here,'' he said.
	   Defending World Cup champion Hermann Maier and overall leader
Stephan Eberharter, both of Austria, were not as adventerous as
Ortlieb and finished with the 17th and 19th best times, nearly two
seconds slower than the leader.
	   Both, however, also earned on of the 10 places reserved for
Austrians for the consecutive downhills.
	   Eberharter leads the overall standings, entering Friday's race
with 368 points.
	   Norwegian Lasse Kjus, a surprise winner in last Saturday's
downhill at Val d'Isere, and Maier have 313 and 280 points.
	   Kjus placed 13th in Thursday's practice, in a tie with Canada's
Brian Stemmle, the top north American finisher.

Romania's president receives a nag for his political efforts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Journalists from the country's most
popular weekly gave President Emil Constantinescu a mare,
commemorating ``his exhausting efforts to make Romania the last nag
of Europe'' a journalist said Thursday.
	   ``We believe that Romania lost the last train to NATO and the
European Union and the president might catch it riding that
horse,'' said Ioan T. Morar, an editor of Academia Catavencu
weekly.
	   The journalists presented the president with the starved,
3-year-old horse late Wednesday at a ceremony in the giant palace
built by former communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and attended
by thousands of Romanian officials.
	   Academia Catavencu is Romania's most successful satirical
weekly, with a circulation of 150,000. It is known for its
informative investigative pieces, due to strong connections within
the intelligence services.
	   The weekly has an annual tradition of giving ironical prizes to
politicians for their most memorable statements or contributions to
the state.
	   ``Its feeding will be another serious problem for Romania,''
Morar concluded following the ceremony in which the president
accepted the gift and even caressed the mare.
	   The presidency spokesmen declined to make any comment.
	   Although he is a liberal supporter of the free market,
Constantinescu's popularity has dropped seriously over the last
months as Romanians' life has worsened. Unemployment has climbed to
9 percent while the monthly wage dropped to only 120 million lei
(dlrs 12).
	   Romania badly wanted to be invited to join NATO and the European
Union but its bids were rejected because the country's weak
economic performances.

Norway drops special status for Bosnian refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway is dropping a blanket asylum granted
all Bosnian refugees because conditions in their homeland no longer
warrant special protection, the justice ministry announced
Thursday.
	   During the 1992-95 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Norway decided to
accept all Bosnians who came to the country directly from the war
zone, without the usual case-by-case assessment.
	   The ministry said the change will not affect Bosnians granted
residence permits by Dec. 31. However, after Jan. 1, Bosnians will
have to meet the same requirement as other foreigners applying for
work and residence permits.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Russia and China angrily denounced the U.S. attack
on Iraq, while allies such as Germany and Canada offered their
immediate support, placing all blame for the crisis on Saddam
Hussein.
	   ``Nobody has the right to act on their own in the name of the
United Nations and even less to pretend to be the judge of the
entire world,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said in
Madrid, Spain.
	   Iraq's neighbor and former foe in war, Iran, joined Russia and
China in blasting the use of force, saying it will bring ``even
more pain and misery for the people in that country.'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi also urged Iraq to cooperate
with the United Nations.
	   Fearful of recriminations, the United States today closed all
but two of its African embassies, and security was stepped up at
many U.S. and British institutions worldwide, from the Philippines
to Greece and Denmark.
	   The U.S. State Department ordered the departure of some of its
embassy personnel in Kuwait and warned other Americans living there
to consider leaving.
	   The Arab League condemned the strikes, and a Gulf official said
Baghdad had reached out for Arab support to stop the attacks.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin demanded an immediate end to the
military campaign, and Chinese President Jiang Zemin also asked
President Clinton to refrain from further attacks.
	   ``This is a violation of the U.N. charter and the principles of
international law, and we condemn this,'' said Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi.
	   The German government noted, however, that the Iraqi leadership
``had been warned'' the international community would have to act
if it failed to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Support for the airstrikes also poured in from Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, the Netherlands,
Austria and Spain.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has brought this crisis on himself,'' Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said.
	   France, which has close ties to Iraq, deplored ``the grave human
consequences'' of the military strikes, but added its regret that
Iraqi leaders were unable to ``show proof of the spirit of complete
cooperation'' demanded by previous agreements with the United
Nations.
	   Fearing an influx of refugees, both Jordan and Turkey closed the
borders they share with Iraq.
	   In a statement today, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
blamed Saddam for ``the grave situation'' while Turkish Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem expressed disappointment in the attack but also
called on Iraq to comply.
	   In Pakistan, the Senate passed a resolution unanimously
condemning the airstrikes as ``an attack on humanity and the
Islamic world.'' Islamic Pakistan's right-wing religious group
called the United States ``international terrorists.''
	   The strikes led news reports in Lebanon, where all newspaper,
radio and television stations carried news agency reports without
comment.
	   In Indonesia, the world's most populous Islamic nation, leaders
pleaded for restraint.
	   Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka backed the United
States and Britain, saying, ``We strongly demand that Iraq
immediately and unconditionally implement the U.N. Security
Council's resolutions.''
	   He was seconded by Misao Nozaki, a 47-year-old Tokyo restaurant
owner who called the bombing justified ``because Iraq has continued
developing nuclear weapons in a way that goes against the common
sense of the rest of the world.''
	   But Yukari Ohi, 38, an office worker in Tokyo, said she opposed
the use of force.
	   ``I think the U.S. decision to attack Iraq was apparently
intended to shift attention from the impeachment issue to war,''
Ohi said, noting that the airstrikes came as Clinton faced an
impeachment vote.
	   India condemned the attack, while Mexico expressed
disappointment.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was noncommittal,
saying, ``Israel is outside the dispute, and in any case will take
care of defending itself if the need arises.''
	   Russian legislators had perhaps the most novel response.
	   Russia's lower chamber of Parliament agreed today to consider a
motion appealing to Monica Lewinsky to help halt the military
strikes.
	   ``The State Duma appeals to Ms. Lewinsky to undertake
corresponding measures to restrain the emotions of Bill Clinton,''
said the motion by nationalist lawmaker Alexander Filatov.
	   Lawmakers considered including the motion in a broader
resolution denouncing the attack on Iraq. But seeking to speed up
passage of the resolution, they approved it later without any
additions.

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians angered by
the U.S. bombing of Iraq chanted ``Death to Clinton'' Thursday,
only days after cheering him in his visit to the West Bank and Gaza
Strip seen as recognition of Palestinian claims to independence.
	   In three West Bank towns, marchers threw stones at Israeli
soldiers who fired rubber bullets. In one confrontation outside
Ramallah, a 20-year-old Palestinian was killed by Israeli army fire
and 16 were injured by rubber bullets, doctors said.
	   The U.S. attack on Iraq early Thursday placed Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in a dilemma.
	   Arafat has been careful not to hurt his growing ties with U.S.
President Bill Clinton, considered an important asset in the quest
for statehood. However, Arafat also could not afford to be seen as
going against the widespread support among his people for Iraq.

Palestinian Authority caught in dilemma after U.S. attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian killed in clashes with Israeli
troops, Clinton sending letter to Arafat to explain reasons for
attack on Iraq &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians angered by
the U.S. bombing of Iraq chanted ``Death to Clinton'' Thursday,
only days after cheering him in his visit to the West Bank and Gaza
Strip seen as recognition of Palestinian claims to independence.
	   In three West Bank towns, marchers threw stones at Israeli
soldiers who fired rubber bullets. In one confrontation outside
Ramallah, a 20-year-old Palestinian was killed by Israeli army fire
and 16 were injured by rubber bullets, doctors said.
	   The U.S. attack on Iraq early Thursday placed Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in a dilemma.
	   Arafat has been careful not to hurt his growing ties with the
United States, considered an important asset in the quest for
statehood. However, Arafat also could not afford to be seen as
going against the widespread support among his people for Iraq.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton sent Arafat a letter Thursday to
explain why he attacked Iraq, Arafat's office said.
	   A senior Palestinian Authority official, Saeb Erekat, adopted a
carefully worded position of compromise after the latest U.S.
attack. The United States should halt its attacks and Iraq should
comply with U.N. weapons inspectors, Erekat said. In the 1991 Gulf
War, Arafat had sided with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator with Israel, said a war
in the Gulf will also cause further delays in the implementation of
the Wye River land-for-peace agreement Clinton helped negotiate.
	   In handling the public outpouring of support for Iraq, Arafat
permitted rallies and marches, but ordered his security forces to
disperse violent protests.
	   In the West Bank towns of Bethlehem and Hebron, Palestinian
police moved quickly to break up dozens of Palestinian teen-agers
who threw stones at Israeli troops. Only two days earlier, Clinton
had sung along with a Palestinian children's choir in Manger Square
in Bethlehem, the traditional birthplace of Jesus.
	   However, in Ramallah, Palestinian police stood back for more
than an hour while about 200 teen-agers threw stones at Israeli
soldiers who responded with rubber bullets.
	   The largest pro-Iraq rally was held in the West Bank town of
Nablus where about 3,000 Palestinians took to the streets, chanting
``Death to America'' and ``Death to Clinton.''
	   Protesters burned a dozen U.S. flags, including those that had
been distributed by the Palestinian Authority several days earlier
to cheer the arrival of Clinton in the Gaza Strip and Bethlehem.
	   ``Two days ago, Clinton was here and we thought he carried a
message of peace,'' said Majeda Masri, a teen-age marcher. ``But
now it is clear that he is a murderer.''
	   The Nablus rally appeared to be spontaneous, starting out with
about 200 high school students, with older people gradually joining
in.
	   However, in other areas, the marches were orchestrated, with
pre-schoolers and elementary school students handed Iraqi flags by
their teachers and told what to chant.
	   In downtown Gaza City, about 300 elementary school students
assembled in Palestine Square. Some carried empty milk bottles and
others smeared fake blood on their clothes to dramatize the
suffering of the Iraqi people.
	   Most Palestinians strongly identify with the Iraqis as fellow
Arabs and fellow Muslims, though their support does not necessarily
extend to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   ``What Clinton has done is unfair,'' said Hussein Najib, who
sells bread from a cart in the West Bank town of Ramallah. ``The
only victims of such attacks are the Iraqi people.''
	   In the Gaza Strip, Iraqi flags quickly replaced U.S. banners
that had covered the streets earlier this week.
	   Safi Sayed, a Gaza City grocer who had done a brisk business
with U.S. flags was now selling Iraqi flags. Sayed said the Clinton
visit to Gaza had given him hope, but he was now disappointed.
	   ``We are very sorry about this strike against our people in
Iraq,'' Sayed said.

Iraqi Foreign Minister accuses US and Britain of lying

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf accused the United States of ``shameless lying'' in their
remarks on Iraq's stand with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Addressing the first government press conference since the U.S.
attacks on Iraq began, al-Sahhaf said that in defending their
strikes, London and Washington had failed to mention the report of
the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   The IAEA had reported that Iraq had provided ``the necessary
level of cooperation.''
	   The United States and Britian did not mention this ``because
they cannot benefit from it for their evil intentions,'' al-Sahhaf
said.
	   The foreign minister said the cruise missiles had inflicted
``heavy casualties'' in their impact on civilian areas of Baghdad.
But he declined to give figures.
	   The United States and Britain ``lied to the world shamelessly,
saying that the report of the executive chairman of (the U.N.
Special Commission) showed that Iraq has not cooperated,''
al-Sahhaf said.
	   But the U.N. inspectors had visited 427 sites since Nov. 17,
when inspections resumed after an earlier stand-off, he said.
	   The Special Commission's report had cited five cases of alleged
non-cooperation among these 427 inspections, the minister said.
	   Taking issues with these five cases, al-Sahhaf said in one
instance, the inspectors wanted to enter a ``small headquarters''
of the ruling Baath Party.
	   ``What is the relation between the small headquarters of a
political party and a disarmament mission?''
	   In another case, the inspectors tried to enter a former office
of a security official, but this had been converted into a guest
house. The inspectors were allowed to enter it after a delay.
	   ``Do you deserve to be bombarded because you have delayed an
inspection team 45 minutes?'' al-Sahhaf asked.
	   Al-Sahhaf said the missiles had hit Iraq's military intelligence
headquarters, its security police headquarters, and ``several
industrial establishments - all of them under complete, ongoing
monitoring (by the United Nations).''
	   Contrary to the U.S. claims of targeting Iraq's military and its
weapons manufacturing infrastructure, the missiles had hit the
house of President Saddah Hussein's daughter, Hala.
	   ``Fortunately she and her relatives were not at that moment in
her house,'' he said.
	   The missiles exploded in ``heavily populated'' districts of
Baghdad and one had hit a factory that produces brake oil for cars,
he said.
	   The minister said that instead of calling their campaign
Operation Desert Fox, the allies should have named it ``Operation
Villains in the Arabian Desert.''
	   The special commission is charged with overseeing the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and long-range
missiles _ a process that Baghdad must complete before the United
Nations will lift the sanctions imposed after the 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States fired hundreds of
missiles on Iraq Thursday in attacks that lasted through the night,
and Baghdad shook with explosions and anti-aircraft gunfire. Two
people were killed and 30 were wounded, a doctor said.
	   Air raid sirens sounded again Thursday afternoon. It was the
first time since attacks ended early Thursday morning. But no
explosion were heard, and no antiaircraft guns were fired, either.
	   Russia and China had called for a halt to the attacks, but U.S.
President Bill Clinton suggested the strikes would continue.
	   Earlier, a sense of normalcy had returned to the streets of the
Iraqi capital in sharp contrast to the sirens and antiaircraft fire
that had punctuated the night.
	   Government employees went to their offices, and young children
headed to school. Morning traffic jams clogged some of the streets
in downtown Baghdad, although fewer cars were out than usual.
	   Baghdad residents, however, lined up at gas stations to stock up
on fuel, a sign that more attacks were expected.
	   ``We are expecting the worst of Clinton because we have
discovered that he has no humanitarian principles,'' said Riad
Mamdouh al-Samarai, 36, as he stood at one station.
	   On Thursday evening, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf accused the United States and Britain of lying
``shamelessly'' in claiming that the report of the U.N. chief
weapons inspector proved Iraq had not cooperated in the search for
its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This aggression against Iraq is a crime against international
law, the U.N. charter, and we will hold our full right to hold them
responsible _ the Americans and British _ for all the crimes they
are committing against our people,'' al-Sahhaf told a news
conference.
	   He said inspection teams had carried out visits to 427 sites in
the past month _ since the last stand-off over weapons inspections
_ and only five cases of non-cooperation arose.
	   Al-Sahhaf characterized the five sites involved as minor and
said they did not justify ``a dangerous crime against the people of
Iraq.''
	   In one case, he said, the inspectors wanted to visit a former
office of a security official, but it had been changed into a guest
house. He said that as Iraqi authorities tried to explain it was a
guest house, the inspectors were delayed from entering for 45
minutes.
	   ``Do you deserve to be bombarded because you have delayed an
inspection team 45 minutes?'' al-Sahhaf asked.
	   Al-Sahhaf also listed examples of targets struck in the American
and British attack, including factories and the headquarters of the
security police and military intelligence.
	   He said the two headquarters have been inspected more than once
by U.N. arms experts and many of the factories had U.N. cameras as
part of permanent monitoring of potential weapons sites.
	   The overnight missile attack caused ``heavy casualties'' in
populated areas of Baghdad, al-Sahhaf said. But he declined to give
specific figures.
	   The minister said that instead of calling their campaign
Operation Desert Fox, the allies should have named it ``Operation
Villains in the Arabian Desert.''
	   The strikes were met with defiance in Iraqi newspapers.
	   ``Iraqis are pulling together to go forward to bury the strikes
of aggression and continue their new crusade to teach the enemy
lessons, which they will never forget,'' al-Qadissiya, a government
newspaper, said in an editorial.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein visited some of the targeted
sites Thursday, including the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad
Radio reported. Hala, the youngest of his three daughters, was
safe, but the house was demolished, it said.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said.
	   Air raid sirens had broken the night's silence minutes before a
barrage of anti-aircraft fire lit up the Baghdad sky at 12:49 a.m.
(2149 GMT Wednesday), unleashing thunderous blasts like a fireworks
display and shaking windows of buildings.
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known.
	   Witnesses said another missile landed in the neighborhood of
al-Adil, about two kilometers (one mile) from Abu Ghraib where a
sprawling military camp and radio relay stations are located.
	   Both of Iraq's television stations were not broadcasting
Thursday afternoon, and three of four official radio stations were
off the air. It was not clear whether they were destroyed.
	   One stray missile hit an Iranian city, Tehran radio reported.
	   Sirens were heard twice in Baghdad, and anti-aircraft guns were
fired four times during the night. As the sounds of the last
barrage at 5:18 a.m. (0218 GMT) faded, a call for prayer floated
over the winter morning from a mosque loudspeaker.
	   Clinton said he ordered the strikes on military and security
targets to retaliate for Iraq's defiance of the U.N. Special
Commission, which is responsible for eliminating the country's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological weapons,'' he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he authorized the
participation of British forces.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in his radio
address, saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face''
but ``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the al-Yarmouk Hospital in Baghdad,
said two people were killed and more than 30 were wounded,
suffering mostly burns in the face, hands and legs. But the full
casualty toll was not known, and there was no official word.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
mumbled Salam Mohammed, 34, as he moaned on his hospital bed, his
face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   The total damage from the attack could not be immediately
assessed, although residents in an Iranian town reportedly saw
thick smoke rising from targets across the border in Iraq.
	   Iraqi officials took foreign reporters to Karada, an upscale
commercial and residential neighborhood, where a missile had
landed. The blast burst water mains in a street, flooding a
two-kilometer (one-mile) stretch of a street.
	   Karada is across the Tigris River from the Old Presidential
Complex, but it was not clear if the palace was damaged.
	   Foreign reporters, who are based at a press center in downtown
Baghdad and can travel around the city only with a government
escort, were given selective access to the damage.
	   In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain for the attack and demanded an immediate end to
the campaign, warning it could shatter regional security.
	   At a Security Council meeting, the ambassadors of Russia and
China, both sympathetic to Iraq, urged an end to the attacks.
	   Staunch American allies _ Germany, Canada and even Japan _
supported the strikes.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the events a ``sad day
for the world,'' saying he did everything in his power to seek
peace. But he didn't say whether the attacks were justified.
	   In his speech, Clinton said the campaign against Iraq will be a
``strong sustained series of airstrikes,'' indicating that more
punishing strikes are likely in the next few days.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   In the attacks, the warships fired hundreds of Tomahawk cruise
missiles, and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck against Iraqi air
defense radars, Pentagon officials said.
	   The United States hopes the attacks will achieve what the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, says it has not been able to achieve
in seven years of work: destroy Iraq's ability to produce weapons
of mass destruction, specifically chemical and biological arms.
	   The U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until the
inspectors certify that Iraq is free of chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles and programs to build them.
	   The chief inspector, Richard Butler, withdrew all his weapons
inspectors from Baghdad on Wednesday, accusing Iraq of going back
on its promise last month to cooperate fully with UNSCOM. That
promise had saved Iraq from an imminent U.S. attack on Nov. 14.

Illegal immigrants call off hunger strike after government agrees
</HEADLINE>
case review
 &UR; By KATHRYN MASTERSON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A group of 130 illegal immigrants
ended a 17-day hunger strike Thursday after the government agreed
to check if any of them qualify for permanent residence in the
Netherlands.
	   The strikers, most of them Moroccans or Turks, had been sleeping
in wooden cots in a Roman Catholic church in The Hague for the
duration of their strike.
	   They began their action to highlight the plight of about 500
so-called ``white illegal immigrants'' living in the Netherlands.
	   ``This was our last choice,'' said Gunsel Yungul, a Turkish man
who has lived and worked in the Netherlands for 18 years. ``We
trust Mr. Cohen, that he will react positively to our files.''
	   Secretary of state for immigration Job Cohen pledged Thursday
that his ministry would review the files of all the hunger strikers
and not deport any of them before Feb. 1 next year, when the review
is completed.
	   Last year, the government scrapped a five-year amnesty policy
that had granted residency to illegal immigrants who could prove
they had worked legally and paid taxes for six consecutive years.
	   The immigrants involved in the hunger strike all claim they have
lived and worked in the Netherlands for longer than six years but
cannot prove that they have held down continual employment.
	   As he prepared to end his strike Thursday, Yungul, 36, who has
worked as a gardener during his stay in the Netherlands, said he
felt fit. ``But I will feel much better if I hear a positive
answer,'' he added.
	   Yungul and the other strikers were wearing white cloths daubed
with the number of years they have been living in the Netherlands.
	   Officials at the St. Agnes church in The Hague where the
strikers have been staying advised them to call off the strike
following a meeting with Cohen.
	   We ``trust that the secretary of state will use his
discretionary powers in a generous, sensible and careful way,'' the
church officials said in a press release.
	   Most of the strikers were in good physical shape, although one
had to be hospitalized this week after he lost consciousness for
three hours. The man recovered after hospital treatment and
rejoined the strike.

Van Gaal's job at Barcelona on the line as side faces Valladolid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ With four consecutive defeats and almost
every Barcelona fan against him, Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal heads
into Sunday's game against Valladolid wondering if he'll still have
a job on Monday.
	   Among the first to be eliminated from the prestigious European
Champion's League, Barcelona has fallen to 10th place in the
20-team Spanish first division, nine points behind leader Mallorca.
	   But while club chairman Luis Nunez last week ruled out
dismissing the 47-year-old Van Gaal before the season is over, the
fans have run up the white flag.
	   Last week's 3-1 defeat to Villareal had fans waving
handkerchiefs wildly in protest.
	   The city's sports daily, El Mundo Deportivo, this week ran a
survey showing 86 percent of fans opposed to Van Gaal remaining
with the club and most favored the return of Dutch legend Johan
Cruyff, who led Barcelona to its only European Champions Cup in
1992.
	   Few coaches have plunged so low so fast as Van Gaal. He was
welcomed with open arms before last season when he came from a
title-filled career with Ajax of Amsterdam, and was excused for the
side's early exit from the Champion's League last year when the
team recovered to capture the Spanish league and King's Cup.
	   But Barcelona is a demanding club and early anxiety surfaced
last month when Barcelona was again eliminated from the Champion's
League. The first-division slug exacerbated the matter.
	   ``Van Gaal has not fulfilled any of the expectations he
created,'' Spain's leading daily El Pais wrote Thursday. ``The club
cannot become healthy again as long as it keeps Van Gaal.''
	   Unable to chuckle at Barcelona's woes is fellow Dutchman Guus
Hiddink at Real Madrid, which has dropped to sixth and six trails
Mallorca by six points.
	   On Sunday, Madrid takes on a Oviedo, which lies just one point
behind Real.
	   Meanwhile, Mallorca will be looking to hold onto the leadership
for a fifth consecutive week when it hosts lowly Racing Santander.
	   Three points back of the leader is Celta Vigo, which takes its
25 points to face Real Sociedad on Sunday.
	   Also with 25 points is Claudio Raineri's Valencia, which goes to
a struggling Espanyol. In Saturday's only game, Deportivo La Coruna
receives a resurgent Betis.
	   Sunday's other 15th-round games are: Villareal vs. Athletic de
Bilbao; Atletico de Madrid vs. Zaragoza; Alaves vs. Salamanca and
Tenerife vs. Extremadura.

Swiss ask Egypt for legal assistance in own Luxor probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland has asked Egypt for legal
assistance with its own investigation of last year's massacre of
tourists in Luxor, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office
said Thursday.
	   Some 35 Swiss tourists were killed in the attack by Islamic
militants last November on the Temple of Hatshepsut in Luxor. In
total, 68 people, including four Egyptians and the gunmen, died.
Twenty-four people, including 10 Swiss, were injured.
	   The request by Swiss Federal Prosecutor Carla del Ponte contains
116 questions, covering among other things the identity of the
attackers and the weapons used, said her spokesman, Dominique
Reymond.
	   Swiss authorities are also seeking documents connected with the
attack, including videos and photographs.
	   Del Ponte opened an investigation against persons unknown in
October. Her office criticized as incomplete an Egyptian report
issued in July on the progress of investigations there.
	   She hopes to travel to Egypt with Switzerland's federal police
chief to talk to local investigators.
	   Last month, Switzerland called on Egypt to clarify whether it
will provide compensation in connection with the massacre.
	   Switzerland's main travel companies have declined responsibility
for the attack.

Report: Stuttgart to sign Macedonian, still looking for coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart is set
to sign Macedonian international midfielder Srdjan Zaharievski,
Kicker magazine reported Thursday.
	   Zaharievski, 25, is expected to sign with Stuttgart during the
Bundesliga's winter break, which starts after this weekend's round,
for an expected transfer fee of 800,000 marks (dlrs 480,000) from
Sileks Kratovo.
	   The Macedonian is set to replace Gerhard Poschner, who is
joining the Italian Serie A club Venezia.
	   Stuttgart is still looking for a new coach after firing Winfried
Schaefer earlier this month.
	   Kicker said that Ivica Osim, the former Yugoslav coach who is at
Sturm Graz in Austria now, was likely to turn down Stuttgart's
offer.
	   The latest candidate, Kicker said, was Bernd Schuster, a former
star in Spain who is now coach of second-division Cologne.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain on Thursday for attacking Iraq and demanded an
immediate end to the bombing, warning it could shatter hopes of
peace in the Middle East.
	   ``Russia demands an immediate end to military action, to show
common sense and restraint and not to allow further escalation of
the conflict which could result in the most dramatic consequences
not only for the Iraqi settlement but for the stability of the
entire region,'' Yeltsin said in a statement.
	   The United States and Britain launched air and missile attacks
against Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   In response, Russia's parliament urged the government Thursday
to increase funding for the country's military and defense
industry. The State Duma voted 394-1 to approve the non-binding
resolution that also denounced ``the barbarous bombings.''
	   Russian television channels showed Yeltsin looking at maps of
the Middle East and talking with several generals and senior aides.
The president spent most of Wednesday night monitoring the
situation, aides said.
	   Russia has consistently opposed military action against Iraq, an
old ally of the Soviet Union, and attempted to find a political
solution to the dispute. But Moscow is no longer a global
superpower and is able to do little more than protest U.S. actions,
goading Russian frustration.
	   Most Russians seemed critical of the attacks _ and most
mentioned their sympathy toward ordinary Iraqis.
	   The U.S. and Britain ``certainly had no right to do that _ there
are people there, after all,'' said Nadezhda Nenasheva, walking
with her child on a Moscow street.
	   Yeltsin discussed the situation in a phone call with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin. The two leaders agreed that the attack was
``unacceptable, unilateral and contradicting the U.N. charter and
the principles of international law,'' the Kremlin press service
said.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov also sharply denounced
the United States and Britain and said Russia would work in the
United Nations to end the attacks.
	   ``This time the activities of the U.S. and Great Britain have
not been provoked by Iraq. The U.S. administration has the strikes
on its conscience,'' said Primakov, who has had close ties with
Iraq for many years.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Russia will insist on the
dismissal of U.N. weapons inspector chief Richard Butler, saying
Butler ``carries a personal responsibility'' for the bombings.
	   In his report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday,
Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction, evasion and
subterfuge. He said he could not give assurances that Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction had been destroyed. A day after the
report, U.N. monitors were ordered to evacuate Baghdad.
	   ``The current crisis was created artificially, including through
irresponsible actions by Butler,'' Ivanov said. ``The document he
presented (to Annan) gives a distorted picture of the state of
affairs in Iraq.''
	   Russia's Islamic Committee issued a statement saying the
bombings are ``effectively the start of World War III, which the
West has long been promising to wage on us, Muslims.''
	   The Union of Russia's Muslims was even more blunt.
	   ``Our enemies must not entertain the illusions that the Islamic
world will remain unresponsive and divided,'' it said.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said the strikes ``go
beyond the international law and annul all political and diplomatic
efforts aimed at implementing the U.N. Security Council
resolutions,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Parliamentary leaders also denounced the attacks, with Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov saying, ``This is international banditry
that must be sharply denounced.''
	   Vladimir Zhirinovsky, an ultranationalist leader and a
long-standing supporter of Saddam, called for Russia to
unilaterally stop abiding by the sanctions against Iraq, and
temporarily recall its ambassador to the United States, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Zhirinovsky, who is given to flamboyant remarks, also called
U.S. President Bill Clinton an ``international bandit who ought to
be tried.''

Lawyer for Turkey appeals lifting of restrictions on Ocalan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Turkey on Thursday formally challenged a Rome
court's decision to lift restrictions on Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan, who was detained here in November.
	   Representing the Turkish government, lawyer Augusto Sinagra
urged the appeal court to reverse its decision and to order Ocalan
jailed to prevent him from leaving Italy.
	   Turkey wants to try Ocalan on terrorism charges. But Italy has
refused to extradite him, citing Italian law which forbids
extradition to a country where the suspect can face the death
penalty.
	   The leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, was arrested
Nov. 12 upon his arrival in Rome on a flight from Moscow. He was
jailed for a week and then transferred to a Rome villa and ordered
not to leave the city.
	   On Wednesday, a court decided to drop all restrictions after
Germany dropped its own extradition request.
	   Ocalan, who has applied for political asylum in Italy,
reportedly lacks a valid passport and thus would have difficulty
legally leaving Italy.
	   It was not clear when Italy would rule on the asylum request.
	   The Italian government has indicated it would consider expelling
Ocalan to a third country, if one could be found.
	   Italy's La Repubblica daily reported Thursday that South Africa
topped the list of countries possibly willing to take Ocalan. The
others mentioned are Pakistan, North Korea and Libya.
	   Close to 37,000 people have been killed since Ocalan's rebel
group began fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey in 1984.

Opposition leader launches campaign against Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ With early elections looming, opposition
leader Ehud Barak pushed social issues over security Thursday as he
launched his campaign against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   With U.S. President Bill Clinton's campaign strategist James
Carville at his side, Barak said he was ready for elections
expected in April.
	   Netanyahu said Wednesday he would call Israelis to the polls
early if he could not muster enough support for his hard-line peace
policies before a no-confidence motion in parliament Monday.
	   Netanyahu's coalition has been crumbling since he signed the
latest Mideast peace accord opposed by most of his Cabinet because
it calls for Israel to cede from war-captured West Bank land.
	   Barak wants the accord implemented to the letter and has
rejected calls of support from Netanyahu.
	   Barak accused Netanyahu of capitulating to his right-wing
coalition and freezing further Israeli troop withdrawals from the
West Bank. ``We are determined to put an end to yielding to
extremists,'' Barak said.
	   Barak promised that he would divert millions of dollars being
spent by the Netanyahu government on Jewish settlements in the West
Bank to domestic concerns such as education, health and ending
record-high unemployment.
	   He also pledged to cut government grants to yeshivas or Jewish
seminaries and to draft its students into military service like
other Israelis.
	   ``Education before settlements, job creation before yeshivas,''
Barak said.
	   Grabbing voters on social issues and the economy worked for
Carville in the 1992 and 1996 Clinton campaigns. In tiny Israel
however, security has always been the number one campaign issue and
candidates have ususally left social issues on the back burner for
smaller parties to champion.
	   Barak, a former commander-in-chief of Israel's armed forces also
said Netanyahu's policies had harmed the strong strategic ties
between Israel and the United States, its closest ally.
	   Interviewed on Israel radio, Netanyahu said the peace process
was on hold because of continuous violations of the deal by the
Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu turned the debate away from social issues to security,
a topic which helped him win narrow election in 1996.
	   He challenged Barak to reveal how he would deal with a possible
declaration of statehood next year by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Palestinian claims over parts of Jerusalem.
	   ``I expect that all the members of parliament who are concerned
for the fate of the state, for the fate of Jerusalem, will rally to
support me,'' Netanyahu said in an interview with Israel radio.
	   In the 1996 election, Netanyahu used negative campaign messages
against then Prime Minister Shimon Peres whom he repeatedly called
soft on security and said was willing to give away parts of
Jerusalem to the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu's campaign was aided by Arthur Finkelstein, the U.S.
political guru who helped elect many republicans to office.
	   Barak recently employed Carville, pollster Stanley Greenberg and
media specialist Robert Strom, who helped elect Clinton, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.

Corinthians midfielder poses for gay magazine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Cited by coaches as a symbol of
modern soccer, Corinthians midfielder Vampeta is breaking new
ground _ as a model for a gay magazine.
	   Vampeta, a starter on Brazil's national team, will be the cover
model on the January issue of ``G Magazine,'' the newspaper Folha
de Sao Paulo reported Thursday.
	   The paper printed photos of Vampeta _ fully clothed _ and
excerpts of his interview with the magazine, which will reach
newsstands only after the national championship ends on Dec. 23.
Corinthians faces Cruzeiro in the finals.
	   Vampeta was quoted as saying he wasn't a homosexual but had no
prejudices against homosexuals. Some players known to be homosexual
are accepted by teammates, he said, although he said there were no
gay players on Corinthians.
	   Wanderley Luxemburgo, Vampeta's coach on Corinthians and the
national team, said he had nothing against the modeling session as
long as it didn't hurt the team.
	   ``I wouldn't buy the magazine because I think Vampeta is very
ugly,'' joked Luxemburgo _ who reportedly also is being courted to
model for the magazine.
	   Brazil is more relaxed about homosexuality than other Latin
American countries. While some referees are openly gay, no top
player has come out of the closet.

Former trainer of Ali, Liston, Spinks dead at 83
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Sam Solomon, known for training some of
boxing's top heavyweights, is dead at 83.
	   Solomon died of heart failure at St. Ignatius Nursing Home in
West Philadelphia Sunday.
	   He trained Muhammad Ali, Leon Spinks and Sonny Liston before
they became world champions.
	   Solomon began his career as a boxer, fighting more than 300
bouts as an amateur welterweight and lightweight. He started to box
so he could defend himself from bullies in his south Philadelphia
neighborhood, his family said.
	   Solomon became a trainer in 1950 because, he said, it was easier
than getting punched. He was also a catcher in American baseball's
Negro leagues.
	   Solomon retired as a boxing trainer 10 years ago, but continued
to work with youngsters at the Haddington Recreation Center until a
few years ago when he had to stop due to Alzheimer's disease.
	   Solomon is survived by his wife, Edith; daughter Arlen;
stepdaughter Camille Veasey; a sister, four grandchildren, five
great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States fired hundreds of
missiles on Iraq Thursday in attacks that lasted through the night,
and Baghdad shook with explosions and anti-aircraft gunfire. Two
people were killed and 30 were wounded, a doctor said.
	   Air raid sirens sounded again Thursday afternoon. It was the
first time since attacks ended early Thursday morning. But no
explosion were heard, and no antiaircraft guns were fired, either.
	   Russia and China had called for a halt to the attacks, but U.S.
President Bill Clinton suggested the strikes would continue.
	   Earlier, a sense of normalcy had returned to the streets of the
Iraqi capital in sharp contrast to the sirens and antiaircraft fire
that had punctuated the night.
	   Government employees went to their offices, and young children
headed to school. Morning traffic jams clogged some of the streets
in downtown Baghdad, although fewer cars were out than usual.
	   Baghdad residents, however, lined up at gas stations to stock up
on fuel, a sign that more attacks were expected.
	   ``We are expecting the worst of Clinton because we have
discovered that he has no humanitarian principles,'' said Riad
Mamdouh al-Samarai, 36, as he stood at one station.
	   On Thursday evening, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf accused the United States and Britain of lying
``shamelessly'' in claiming that the report of the U.N. chief
weapons inspector proved Iraq had not cooperated in the search for
its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This aggression against Iraq is a crime against international
law, the U.N. charter, and we will hold our full right to hold them
responsible _ the Americans and British _ for all the crimes they
are committing against our people,'' al-Sahhaf told a news
conference.
	   He said inspection teams had carried out visits to 427 sites in
the past month _ since the last stand-off over weapons inspections
_ and only five cases of non-cooperation arose.
	   Al-Sahhaf characterized the five sites involved as minor and
said they did not justify ``a dangerous crime against the people of
Iraq.''
	   In one case, he said, the inspectors wanted to visit a former
office of a security official, but it had been changed into a guest
house. He said that as Iraqi authorities tried to explain it was a
guest house, the inspectors were delayed from entering for 45
minutes.
	   ``Do you deserve to be bombarded because you have delayed an
inspection team 45 minutes?'' al-Sahhaf asked. An air-raid siren
wailed _ for a second time Thursday afternoon _ as he was speaking.
	   Al-Sahhaf also listed examples of targets struck in the American
attack, including factories and the headquarters of the security
police and military intelligence.
	   He said the two headquarters have been inspected more than once
by U.N. arms experts and many of the factories had U.N. cameras as
part of permanent monitoring of potential weapons sites.
	   The overnight missile attack caused ``heavy casualties'' in
populated areas of Baghdad, al-Sahhaf said. But he declined to give
specific figures.
	   The minister said that instead of calling their campaign
Operation Desert Fox, the allies should have named it ``Operation
Villains in the Arabian Desert.''
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein visited some of the targeted
sites Thursday, including the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad
Radio reported. Hala, the youngest of his three daughters, was
safe, but the house was demolished, it said.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said.
	   Air raid sirens had broken the night's silence minutes before a
barrage of anti-aircraft fire lit up the Baghdad sky at 12:49 a.m.
(2149 GMT Wednesday), unleashing thunderous blasts like a fireworks
display and shaking windows of buildings.
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known.
	   Witnesses said another missile landed in the neighborhood of
al-Adil, about two kilometers (one mile) from Abu Ghraib where a
sprawling military camp and radio relay stations are located.
	   Both of Iraq's television stations shut down Thursday afternoon,
but one resumed broadcasting later. Three of the four official
radio stations were off the air. It was not clear whether they were
destroyed.
	   One stray missile hit an Iranian city, Tehran radio reported.
	   Sirens were heard twice in Baghdad, and anti-aircraft guns were
fired four times during the night. As the sounds of the last
barrage at 5:18 a.m. (0218 GMT) faded, a call for prayer floated
over the winter morning from a mosque loudspeaker.
	   Clinton said he ordered the strikes on military and security
targets to retaliate for Iraq's defiance of the U.N. Special
Commission, which is responsible for eliminating the country's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological weapons,'' he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he authorized the
participation of British forces.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in his radio
address, saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face''
but ``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the al-Yarmouk Hospital in Baghdad,
said two people were killed and more than 30 were wounded,
suffering mostly burns in the face, hands and legs. But the full
casualty toll was not known, and there was no official word.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
mumbled Salam Mohammed, 34, as he moaned on his hospital bed, his
face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary said in Washington that preliminary
assessments showed the attacks had inflicted ``severe damage to
some targets.''
	   Iraqi officials took foreign reporters to Karada, an upscale
commercial and residential neighborhood, where a missile had
landed. The blast burst water mains in a street, flooding a
two-kilometer (one-mile) stretch of a street.
	   Karada is across the Tigris River from the Old Presidential
Complex, but it was not clear if the palace was damaged.
	   Foreign reporters, who are based at a press center in downtown
Baghdad and can travel around the city only with a government
escort, were given selective access to the damage.
	   In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain for the attack and demanded an immediate end to
the campaign, warning it could shatter regional security.
	   At a Security Council meeting, the ambassadors of Russia and
China, both sympathetic to Iraq, urged an end to the attacks.
	   Staunch American allies _ Germany, Canada and even Japan _
supported the strikes.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the events a ``sad day
for the world,'' saying he did everything in his power to seek
peace. But he didn't say whether the attacks were justified.
	   In his speech, Clinton said the campaign against Iraq will be a
``strong sustained series of air strikes,'' indicating that more
punishing strikes are likely in the next few days.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   In the attacks, the warships fired hundreds of Tomahawk cruise
missiles, and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck against Iraqi air
defense radars, Pentagon officials said.
	   The United States hopes the attacks will achieve what the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, says it has not been able to achieve
in seven years of work: destroy Iraq's ability to produce weapons
of mass destruction, specifically chemical and biological arms.
	   The U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until the
inspectors certify that Iraq is free of chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles and programs to build them.
	   The chief inspector, Richard Butler, withdrew all his weapons
inspectors from Baghdad on Wednesday, accusing Iraq of going back
on its promise last month to cooperate fully with UNSCOM. That
promise had saved Iraq from an imminent U.S. attack on Nov. 14.

U.N. issues guidelines to cut TB risk from air travel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The resurgence of tuberculosis has increased the
risk passengers or crews on long-haul flights can catch the
disease, the World Health Organization said Thursday.
	   ``In-flight exposure to infectious tuberculosis in co-passengers
has become a realistic airline possibility owing to the high
prevalence of tuberculosis in some regions of the world,'' said Dr.
Claus Curdt-Christiansen, a member of a special WHO panel.
	   WHO stressed that no case of active TB has yet been discovered
as a result of exposure to the disease on a commercial aircraft.
	   Dr. Mario Raviglione of WHO's communicable diseases unit said
the risk of catching TB on an airplane ``is very low.''
	   But, he said, ``the risk exists; it's documented.''
	   Raviglione, one of the writers of new WHO guidelines issued
Thursday to help airlines limit exposure, said ``We want to push
everyone to be cooperative.''
	   WHO said anyone with infectious TB should postpone travel.
``Boarding can and should be denied to persons known to have
infectious TB,'' it added in a summary of the guidelines.
	   Curdt-Christiansen, a Canadian with the International Civil
Aviation Organization, said the risk appeared to be greater on
long, crowded flights.
	   WHO recommended airlines trace and inform passengers on a crew
who were on a flight of more than eight hours with an infectious
person.
	   That could be difficult at present because of incomplete or
incorrect airline records, it said.
	   The agency also recommended airlines install and maintain
efficient air filters as well as keeping ground delays as short as
possible.
	   Chances of the bacterium which causes the disease being
transmitted could be increased by poor ventilation on flights of
over eight hours, WHO said.
	   Drugs to treat tuberculosis have been available since the 1940s
to treat TB, and scientists once could foresee the disappearance of
the disease, which mainly attacks the lungs, intestines, skin and
brain.
	   But WHO has said poorly managed treatment programs have led to
the emergence of drug-resistant strains, which have spurred a sharp
rise in cases.
	   TB claims as many as 3 million lives every year. It is spread
through coughing, sneezing and even talking and can be highly
contagious. The germs can survive for hours in the air.
	   WHO noted studies carried out by the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention between 1992 and 1996, involving seven
infectious TB patients and 2,600 passengers and crew who came into
contact with them.
	   The CDC studies found a few cases where the bacterium that
causes TB may have been transmitted, but none where the disease had
been contracted.
	   WHO estimates a third of the world's population carries the
bacterium. Carriers have a one-in-10 chance of contracting the
disease, Raviglione said.
	   Between 1993 and 1996, WHO said, TB cases increased 13 percent
worldwide to 3.8 million cases. But it said the real figure may
been nearly 8 million.

authorities plan crackdown on Albanian-language media, other;

<TEXT>
	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police who said they were hunting
for the murderers of six Kosovo Serbs attacked a suspected
rebel-controlled village Thursday, reportedly killing two ethnic
Albanian fighters and arresting 11 in a day-long battle.
	   The clash that began around dawn near Glodjane was one of the
biggest in months in Kosovo, where a wobbly October truce that has
held across most of the Serbian province is in increasing danger of
breaking down altogether.
	   International monitors who got near the western Kosovo village,
located 10 kilometers (six miles) south of the city of Pec, said
they heard shelling and heavy fighting.
	   ``It was war,'' said a European monitor who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   Police also sealed off a northwestern suburb of Pec as part of
the sweep. An armored personnel carrier and policemen wearing flak
jackets blocked a bridge leading to Kapesnica, and police snipers
looked down from surrounding rooftops.
	   ``We are in pursuit of the perpetrators of the shooting in the
Panda bar,'' a police commander said, referring to the bar where
the six young Serbs were slaughtered. He spoke on condition his
name not be used.
	   Monday's brutal shootings, carried out by masked gunmen who
riddled the Serb bar with automatic weapons fire, dangerously
fueled tensions in a province still reeling from over 1,000 deaths
in months of fighting this year between Serb forces and separatist
rebels.
	   Police told the Serb-run Media Center in Pristina that after
officers searching for suspects in Glodjane came under fire, police
killed two people wearing camouflage uniforms bearing the KLA
insignia and armed with assault rifles and mortars. They said they
arrested 11 people _ at least one in Kapesnica _ and discovered
large quantities of arms, ammunition and KLA uniforms.
	   The international Kosovo Verification Mission sent several teams
to the area, and American and other officials held talks with
Serbian police in an unsuccessful attempt to calm the situation.
Hours later the clash was reported still going on.
	   The political representative of the KLA, which is fighting to
drive Serb police out of Kosovo and break the province away from
Serbia, has denied rebel involvement in Monday's attack.
	   But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this week to arrest
the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   The state-run Borba daily called Thursday, in a sharply worded
commentary, for the withdrawal of international verifiers and U.S.
envoys from Kosovo, saying they are ``direct instigators and
helpers of the crimes committed by Albanian terrorists.''
	   Serbs held a protest rally concerning the killings for a second
straight day Thursday, this time in front of the headquarters of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs
the verifying force.
	   About 300 Serbs whistled derisively and booed, and demanded an
immediate meeting with mission chief William Walker, an American
diplomat, who said he would meet with them Friday. Complaining that
the international verifiers are failing to ease tensions and not
responding sufficiently to the Pec killings, they chanted, ``Put
them in chains!''
	   The killings have cast further gloom over stalled diplomatic
efforts to resolve the Serb-Albanian standoff in Kosovo, where
dozens have died in sporadic clashes since the October agreement.
	   Serbian authorities say they are willing to grant only limited
autonomy for Kosovo, while most of the overwhelmingly
Albanian-populated province want independence from Serbia _ the
dominant republic remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   In a related development Thursday, Serbia announced a media
crackdown in Kosovo, warning the province's ethnic Albanian
newspapers to cease support for ``terrorism'' or face legal charges
under the government's restrictive new media law.
	   The government information ministry said some Albanian-language
papers have carried reports which ``directly instigate terrorism.''

Ruling party ex-spokesman gets ``award'' for working against media
</HEADLINE>
freedom &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The former spokesman for Croatia's ruling
party was awarded an ``iron scissors'' prize Thursday by a
journalist group for his ``heroic resistance'' to the principles of
freedom of expression.
	   The Forum 21 group said Drago Krpina deserved the ``award''
because of the government's campaign to muzzle the independent
press.
	   Forum 21 was established last year by reporters from different
Croatian papers, TV and radio stations to promote free media and
campaign against the government's control over most of the media.
	   President Franjo Tudjman's authoritarian government has often
been criticized by Western governments for its attempts to muzzle
independent media, its harsh critics.
	   Krpina and other Tudjman's party officials have frequently
accused independent press of working against the state.
	   Krpina, who is now a secretary general of Tudjman's party, told
news agency HINA he would like to meet Forum 21 members to receive
the award.

Rey-Bellet surprises by leading training run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's Corinne Rey-Bellet
took advantage of home snow and led a surprising practice session
Thursday for a women's World Cup downhill.
	   Rey-Bellet, who's never finished among the top 15 in a downhill,
raised Swiss fans' hopes heading int this weekend's pair of races,
completing the course in 1 minute, 42.96 seconds and edging Italy's
Patrizia Bassis by .17 seconds.
	   Still winless in the downhill but runner-up in Veysonnaz in
1993, France's Regine Cavagnoud clocked the third-fastest time of
1:43.30, ahead of Norway's Trude Gimle, fourth with a .45 deficit.
	   Overall World Cup leader Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria,
winner of four of 10 races this season, finished fifth in 1:43.55.
	   Meissnitzer, who finished fifth and third in season-opening
downhills in Lake Louise, Canada, crossed ahead of Switzerland's
Catherine Borghi, .62 back.
	   Ingeborg Helen Marken of Norway, runner-up in Wednesday's
training run, crossed seventh in 1:43.69, ahead of Italians Daniela
Ceccarelli and Bibiana Perez.
	   Seeking her first victory of the season, all-rounder Pernilla
Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup champion, was 10th, 1.14 back.
	   Winner of both downhills this season and leader in Wednesday's
training session, Austria's Renate Geotschl ran into trouble on
Thursday, finished 15th almost a second and a half back.

Dutch national airport shuts two runways to night flights for
</HEADLINE>
remainder of 1998

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Schiphol Airport, the nation's
busiest aviation hub, on Thursday closed two runways to all night
flights for the rest of the year to avoid overstepping noise
pollution limits.
	   Aircraft unable to land on the remaining two runways because of
adverse weather conditions will be rerouted to another airport,
Schiphol said. A third runway was closed to night flights earlier
this year and also will remain off limits until Jan. 1.
	   ``An exception can only be made in a situation where the safety
of an aircraft and its passengers are endangered,'' the airport
said in a press release.
	   The airport's decision came a day before the government is due
to announce its plans for future growth of the ambitious hub which
wants to keep growing to retain its position as Europe's fourth
largest airport.
	   Schiphol says the only way it can keep pace with expected growth
in the aviation sector is to build new runways on a manmade island
in the North Sea. The airport's terminal, which would remain on its
present site on the outskirts of Amsterdam, would be linked to the
island by an underground rail tunnel.

	   ROTHERHAM, England (AP) _ A man known as ``Rotherham's Father
Christmas,'' who annually donned a Santa suit to visit with the
town's children, collapsed and died during a break in his duties.
	   Ronald Gill, 61, collapsed Wednesday in a town building that
housed Santa's grotto. The former miner was rushed to a local
hospital, but was dead on arrival.
	   The grotto was closed and children turned away after the
incident, said Colin Scott, chairman of the sponsoring Rotherham
Chamber of Trade.
	   ``Ron was a fantastic Father Christmas _ there's no doubt about
that _ the best we've had,'' Scott said.
	   More than 2,000 children had visited with Gill in the grotto in
the past few weeks in this northern England town. Scott has taken
over the Santa role until a replacement can be found.

Suriname's State Oil to sell crude to Trinidad's Petrotrin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Suriname's State Oil has signed a
dlrs 40 million contract to sell crude oil to Trinidad's Petrotrin,
company officials said Thursday.
	   State Oil will supply Petrotrin with 110,000 to 175,000 barrels
of crude per month over two years, according to the contract signed
Wednesday. Petrotrin has processed part of State Oil's crude since
1986.
	   The two countries are separated by about 400 miles (650
kilometers). In a written statement, government-owned State Oil
said the deal fit into the country's plans to strengthen trade ties
to the Caribbean.
	   State Oil also said in a written statement it has signed an
agreement with Canadian firm Koch Exploration to negotiate oil
exploration in the country's Wayombo area.

Parliamentary commission votes to try Turkish premier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz came
one step closer to be tried on charges of squandering state money
Thursday when a parliamentary commission voted to send the
accusations to the floor.
	   It is now up to the entire Parliament to vote on whether Yilmaz
should be prosecuted. No date has been set for the vote.
	   The motion was launched by Yilmaz' bitter rival, ex-premier
Tansu Ciller of the True Path Party.
	   The Parliament will also vote on similar accusations against
former public works minister Yasar Topcu of Yilmaz' center-right
Motherland Party.
	   Both deny any irregularity in the case where they are accused of
awarding the feasibility study for the construction of a second
Istanbul airport to two private firms instead of government
agencies.
	   Yilmaz' government collapsed on Nov. 25 after allegations of
corruption and ties to mobsters.

Thousands rally behind Chechen president's crackdown on crime
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with call by demonstrators for
greater crackdown. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Thousands of people rallied in Chechnya's
capital today to support the president's planned clampdown on
rampant crime and kidnappings in the breakaway Russian territory.
	   The gathering adopted a resolution calling for broader powers
for President Aslan Maskhadov to crack down on rebel warlords and
suspected kidnappers. Protesters shouted for an end to the crime
wave.
	   Maskhadov imposed a one-month state of emergency Tuesday to
launch his new crime offensive, and he called for today's
demonstration in order to rally support for his decision.
	   Hundreds of people have been taken hostage in Chechnya since the
end of a 1994-96 war with Russia. Maskhadov, elected two years ago
by an overwhelming margin, has so far been unable to impose order
in the territory.
	   In the most gruesome incident, four Western hostages _ three
British and a New Zealander _ were beheaded by their captors last
week after being kidnapped Oct. 3 while working on Chechnya's phone
network.
	   Maskhadov blamed the leader of a prominent Islamic militant
group for the slaying and for other kidnappings in the region.
	   The group, the Islamic Jamaats, or Warriors of Islam, denies any
connection with the killings. On Wednesday it threatened to attack
Russian sites outside Chechnya if Maskhadov clamps down on them,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The group, led by warlord Arbi Barayev, is holed up in
Chechnya's second-largest city, Urus-Martan, which it has
surrounded with trenches in preparation, the group says, for war.

Vatican expresses dismay over Ango-American attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Vatican newspaper urging dialogue &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican expressed its dismay Thursday
over the Anglo-American airstrikes on Iraq.
	   It said it fully agreed with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
that it was ``a sad day for the United Nations and for the world.''
	   ``The Holy See hopes that this aggression ends as soon as
possible and that international order is restored,'' said spokesman
Joaquin-Navarro Valls.
	   Pope John Paul II, who had spoken out against the 1991 Gulf War,
referred to the latest hostilities in what sources said was a
last-minute insertion in a speech to a group of ambassadors
Thursday.
	   ``Peace is again threatened in the Middle East. Reconciliation
based on dialogue, justice and the right of every people to live in
security is more than ever urgent,'' John Paul said.
	   He said the international community is responsible for favoring
peaceful solutions that prevent the loss of innocent lives.
	   Later, the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano urged tenacity
in following the ``tiring but fertile ways of peace'' and called
dialogue ``the only instrumemt capable of freeing consciences of
rancor built up over years of rigid counter-positions.''

Report: DaimlerChrysler considering linkup with Nissan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs RECASTS lead and throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ DaimlerChrysler has been testing
conditions with Nissan of Japan and its subsidiary Nissan Diesel
for about a year on possible cooperation in commercial vehicle
production, a spokesman said Thursday.
	   But spokesman Eckhard Zanger in Stuttgart said ``We have never
commented on how the constellation of such a cooperation would
look, were it to work out.''
	   Zanger's comments came after Der Spiegel weekly said Thursday
that Daimler Chrysler is considering a stake in debt-ridden Nissan
Motor Co., but not in its truck-making subsidiary as originally
contemplated.
	   In an early release of a report which will appear in its next
edition, the magazine said that DaimlerChrysler Chairman Juergen
Schrempp was hesitating to go into any immediate deal with Nissan.
``We shouldn't take too much on board at one time,'' the report
quoted him as saying.
	   ``In three years' time we'll be measured by whether we've made a
success of DaimlerChrysler or not and less by whether we've entered
Asia,'' Spiegel quoted Schrempp as saying.
	   Zanger declined to comment further on the report.
	   Nissan too declined to comment, but said that in general, it is
``willing to consider business tie-ups to strengthen its
international competitiveness.''
	   Daimler-Benz and Nissan said in July they would jointly build a
light truck starting in 2002 as the first step toward a broader
alliance. Daimler also said then it was considering taking a stake
in Nissan Diesel.
	   At the time there was talk of producing 100,000 to 150,000
vehicles per year mostly aimed at the markets in Japan, other Asian
states and Latin America and a final decision was expected by
year's end.
	   However, Zanger said last week that the deadline will be missed
because of additional work resulting from the DaimlerChrysler
merger.
	   According to Spiegel, Nissan is looking for an all-around
partner and not just for a company to take over its diesel trucks,
and is also discussing possible linkups with France's Renault and
Ford Motor Co.
	   In Paris, a Renault spokesman denied the company was in any
talks for a linkup with Nissan. There was no immediate comment
available from Ford.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The airstrikes against Iraq have bitterly
divided the U.N. Security Council, leaving it unable to decide on
any course of action to resolve the conflict over weapons
inspections.
	   Iraq, Russia and China called Wednesday night for an immediate
halt to the attacks. But the United States and Britain insisted
military action was justified because Iraq had failed to cooperate
fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The result was a formal Security Council meeting with 15
speeches, an outpouring of frustration that peace efforts had
failed, but no action. Russia, which had called Wednesday night's
formal meeting, requested another round of informal consultations
Thursday afternoon.
	   For U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Wednesday was ``a sad day
for the United Nations and for the world.''
	   Annan, who helped avert military action against Iraq in February
and November, said he did everything in his power to seek peace and
deeply regretted not being able to avert the use of force. He said
his thoughts were with the Iraqi people, the 370 U.N. humanitarian
workers still in the country ``and with all others whose lives are
in danger.''
	   He spent much of the day at the three closed council meetings
and the open council session Wednesday night.
	   Only a month ago, the Security Council unanimously backed a
resolution demanding that Iraq cooperate fully with weapons
inspectors _ as Baghdad promised Nov. 14 when the United States and
Britain called off threatened airstrikes.
	   But that unity started to fray when chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler reported to Annan on Tuesday that Iraq had not only
failed to cooperate fully but imposed new restrictions on the
inspectors' work.
	   And it totally collapsed after Butler pulled out the inspection
teams from Baghdad on Wednesday morning without consulting the
council _ and the United States and Britain then launched
airstrikes hours later without council approval.
	   During Wednesday night's meeting, there were serious divisions
among the 15-member council over a cease-fire, the accuracy of
Butler's report and his decision to evacuate inspection teams from
Baghdad, and the unilateral use of force by the United States and
Britain.
	   Some council members were also angered that the airstrikes were
launched just as they were discussing three options suggested by
Annan to deal with Butler's report, which became moot.
	   Speaking at the start of Wednesday night's meeting, Iraq's U.N.
envoy Nizar Hamdoon urged the council to call for an immediate halt
to the unprovoked attacks which he said were ``wrecking the lives''
of innocent Iraqis.
	   Russian ambassador Sergey Lavrov backed his appeal for an
immediate end ``to these acts of military force'' and China's U.N.
envoy Qin Huasun called on the United States and Britain ``to stop
forthwith all military actions against Iraq.''
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' Qin said earlier.
	   But the United States and Britain insisted the airstrikes were
launched only after diplomacy had been exhausted and Butler had
documented Iraq's failure to hand over documents and allow
unfettered inspections.
	   ``The United States did not seek a confrontation and did not
undertake this decision lightly,'' said Deputy U.S. Ambassador
Peter Burleigh. ``Iraq's policy of unremitting defiance and
noncompliance necessitated the resort to military force.''
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to develop nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and threaten his neighbors.
	   Hamdoon challenged the U.N. Special Commission known as UNSCOM,
which Butler heads, to produce physical evidence that Iraq still
has prohibited weapons.
	   ``The exaggerated uproar over the Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction is nothing more than a big lie,'' he said. ``The other
lie is that Iraq poses a threat to its neighbors.''
	   Britain and the United States insisted that they acted under the
authority provided by previous Security Council resolutions. But
many other council members countered that only the council can
sanction the use of military force _ and it had not done so.
	   Swedish Ambassador Hans Dahlgren said his government regretted
``that the council was presented with a fait acompli.'' And
Russia's Lavrov warned that ``the entire responsibility for the
consequence of these actions must be borne by those states who have
chosen a unilateral act of force in order to resolve their problems
with Iraq.''
	   Hamdoon accused Butler of bias, noting that Butler cited only
five incidents in 300 inspection operations.
	   ``The leader of UNSCOM has played a dishonorable role in this
crisis,'' said China's Qin. ``The reports submitted by UNSCOM to
the secretary-general were unfounded and evasive of the facts. It
is difficult for the UNSCOM leader to shed his responsibility over
the current crisis.''
	   Asked whether Butler still had the council's backing, Lavrov
noted that steps he had taken in the last 24 hours ``were
questioned seriously'' by council members.
	   Under the cease-fire resolution which ended the 1991 Gulf War,
UNSCOM must verify that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _
chemical, biological and nuclear, as well as long-range missiles _
have been eliminated before tough economic sanctions against Iraq
can be lifted. But there were questions of when _ and whether _
UNSCOM would be able to return to Iraq.

Gloucestershire withdraws offer to WIndies paceman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISTOL, England (AP) _ Former West Indies captain Courtney
Walsh is furious that Gloucestershire has withdrawn its offer of a
new, 2-year old contract.
	   The Jamaican paceman, who has hit a spell of good form at test
level at age 36, has been connected with the county for 14 years
and last season was leading wicket taker in the championship with
106 victims. Now they seem headed for an acrimonious split.
	   Gloucestershire is understood to be chasing an all-rounder as
its overseas player especially as it will lose its team captain,
Mark Alleyne to England's World Cup squad in May.
	   Walsh, currently playing for the West Indies in South Africa,
believes that is not the only reason.
	   ``I have been told the main reason for withdrawing the offer is
due to the introduction of the two-divisional championship in the
year 2000 being based on positions next season, and that the
balance of the side will be upset if Mark Alleyne is selected for
England's World Cup squad,'' he said.
	   ``But, to me, it is bowlers who win matches and I believe these
are not the real reasons for the withdrawal of the offer.
	   ``I am possibly bowling as well as I ever have and I know I have
at least two good seasons of first-class cricket left. Regretfully,
these will not be with Gloucestershire.''
	   Gloucestershire chief executive Colin Sexstone said the loss of
Alleyne would be a big blow to the team.
	   ``If Mark gets in the World Cup squad, we will be losing our
captain and best all-round player for the first two months of the
season and that will have a great effect on the balance of the
side,'' he said.
	   ``We had been a bit frustrated by Courtney's lack of commitment
since we made him the offer of a new contract. He hadn't said he
was committed to Gloucestershire if he didn't make the West Indies
World Cup squad.''

Analyst: Iraq bombing has advantage for Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The bombing of Iraq may help Russia's economy by
pushing up oil prices, a prominent Russian analyst said Thursday,
sounding a note of discord amid Russia's condemnation of the
attacks.
	   This year's sharp drop in world prices of oil _ Russia's main
export earner _ was a major factor in the country's current
economic crisis, its worst since the Soviet collapse.
	   Responding to Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of U.N.
weapons inspectors, the United States and Britain launched air and
missile attacks against Iraq.
	   Russia ``is interested in higher oil prices and the bombing of
Iraq has already triggered a rise in the prices of black gold,''
meaning oil, Sergei Karaganov, a political analyst who once served
as President Boris Yeltsin's consultant on foreign policy, was
quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying.
	   Crude oil prices rose late Wednesday on expectations of the
airstrikes against Iraq to dlrs 11.36 per barrel, up from dlrs 9.64
a week ago. The increase pushed Russian stocks up early Thursday.
	   But Russia's Fuel and Energy Minister Sergei Generalov warned
that the rise could be temporary.
	   ``The entire history of Iraq's relations with the United Nations
proves that whenever the situation is aggravated, oil prices go up
just to get back to the former level some time later,'' he was
quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   A spokesman for Russia's oil giant Lukoil welcomed the rise in
oil prices but said the company condemns the bombings.
	   ``We unconditionally back the stance of the Russian Foreign
Ministry on Iraq that unilaterally condemns the U.S.
administration's actions,'' spokesman Dmitry Dolgov said, according
to ITAR-Tass.
	   Yeltsin and other Russian officials harshly denounced the
bombings.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Sahhaf
said America's attack on Baghdad had inflicted heavy civilian
casualties, and he accused Washington of ``shameless lying'' in its
remarks on Iraq's stand with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Addressing the first government press conference since the U.S.
attacks on Iraq began, al-Sahhaf said that in defending their
strikes, London and Washington had failed to mention the report of
the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   The IAEA had reported that Iraq had provided ``the necessary
level of cooperation.''
	   The United States and Britian did not mention this ``because
they cannot benefit from it for their evil intentions,'' al-Sahhaf
said.
	   The foreign minister said the cruise missiles had inflicted
``heavy casualties'' in their impact on civilian areas of Baghdad.
But he declined to give figures.
	   The United States and Britain ``lied to the world shamelessly,
saying that the report of the executive chairman of (the U.N.
Special Commission) showed that Iraq has not cooperated,''
al-Sahhaf said.
	   But the U.N. inspectors had visited 427 sites since Nov. 17,
when inspections resumed after an earlier stand-off, he said.
	   The Special Commission's report had cited five cases of alleged
non-cooperation among these 427 inspections, the minister said.
	   Taking issues with these five cases, al-Sahhaf said in one
instance, the inspectors wanted to enter a ``small headquarters''
of the ruling Baath Party.
	   ``What is the relation between the small headquarters of a
political party and a disarmament mission?''
	   In another case, the inspectors tried to enter a former office
of a security official, but this had been converted into a guest
house. The inspectors were allowed to enter it after a delay.
	   ``Do you deserve to be bombarded because you have delayed an
inspection team 45 minutes?'' al-Sahhaf asked.
	   Al-Sahhaf said the missiles had hit Iraq's military intelligence
headquarters, its security police headquarters, and ``several
industrial establishments - all of them under complete, ongoing
monitoring (by the United Nations).''
	   Contrary to the U.S. claims of targeting Iraq's military and its
weapons manufacturing infrastructure, the missiles had hit the
house of President Saddah Hussein's daughter, Hala.
	   ``Fortunately she and her relatives were not at that moment in
her house,'' he said.
	   The missiles exploded in ``heavily populated'' districts of
Baghdad and one had hit a factory that produces brake oil for cars,
he said.
	   The minister said that instead of calling their campaign
Operation Desert Fox, the allies should have named it ``Operation
Villains in the Arabian Desert.''
	   The special commission is charged with overseeing the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and long-range
missiles _ a process that Baghdad must complete before the United
Nations will lift the sanctions imposed after the 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.

World temperature set another record for 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The earth's temperature in 1998 is set to be the
highest since record keeping began in 1860, the U.N. weather agency
said Thursday.
	   The ``global mean surface temperature'' for the year is expected
to be 0.58 degrees Celsius (1 degree Fahrenheit) above the
long-term average, which is taken as 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees
Fahrenheit), said the World Meteorological Association.
	   It will be the 20th consecutive year during which the earth's
surface temperature was above normal. New monthly temperature
records have been set in each of the past 18 months.
	   In the United States, spring and summer heat and drought caused
massive wildfire outbreaks in Florida and damage to crops from the
southern plains to the southeast.
	   April to June was the driest period in 104 years of record in
Florida, Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico, and May to June was the
warmest period on record in that area.
	   The organization says heat waves caused the deaths of more than
100 people in Russia in June and great loss of life in India in
May. Widespread drought affecting huge areas of Brazil also induced
extensive wildfires.
	   The last stages of the El Nino phenomenon are blamed for fires
in Indonesia, drought in Guyana and Papua New Guinea and extensive
flooding in Ecuador, Peru and Kenya.
	   It was also responsible for the late start of the hurricane
season, while its opposite, La Nina, made the season one of the
deadliest in history with 14 named storms. They included Hurricane
Mitch, which killed more than 9,000 people in Central America.
	   Godwin Obasi, secretary-general of the WMO, called on the world
community to ``heed the anomalies and maximize their effort to
implement the resolutions'' of countries belonging to the U.N.
Convention on Climate Change.

British joins with United States on attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with British aircraft returning from mission &QL; 
 &UR; By MARA D. BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British fighter-bombers went into action against
Iraqi targets Thursday as Prime Minister Tony Blair told
legislators he was certain the U.S.-led strikes had nothing to do
with U.S. President Bill Clinton's domestic problems.
	   ``I have no doubt at all that action is fully justified now,''
Blair told a packed House of Commons. ``That is my own strong
personal view. I know that President Clinton reached the same
conclusion for the same reason.''
	   Blair added of Clinton: ``Not for the first time, he has shown
the courage to do the right thing and he has my full support.''
	   A dozen Tornado jets based in Kuwait, all designed primarily for
low-level bombing missions, did not join in the initial strikes by
cruise missiles and U.S. aircraft, which began Wednesday night.
Blair gave no details of Thursday's operations by the British

Government announces crackdown on Albanian-language media
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with information minister warning to Albanian-language
media

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Announcing a media crackdown in
Kosovo, the Serbian government on Thursday warned the province's
ethnic Albanian newspapers to cease support for ``terrorism'' or
face punishment under a restrictive media law.
	   In a letter distributed to the Kosovo Albanian media and carried
by the official Tanjug news agency, the information ministry also
demanded that the Albanian-language media outlets in Kosovo
officially register with the Serb government.
	   Ethnic Albanians, the majority population in Serb-ruled Kosovo,
have boycotted the state institutions for years. Dozens of their
newspapers and other media outlets in the province have not been
officially registered due to the boycott.
	   The information ministry said some of the Albanian-language
papers, including well-known Bujku or Koha Ditore, have carried
reports which ``directly instigate terrorism and call on violent
subversion, violation of territorial integrity and independence''
of Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia and Montenegro.
	   Binak Kelmendi, chief editor of Bujku, said his paper had not
received any official warning letter but added that based on what
he had heard of the crackdown, ``we will not accept any ultimatum.
We will continue with our editorial policies.''
	   Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are seeking independence for the
province from Serbia. Kosovo's Albanian-language media have
supported the Albanians' quest, considered illegal by the state
which calls Albanian rebel fighters ``terrorists.''
	   The statement, signed by information minister Aleksandar Vucic,
warned that the newspapers could face charges if they continue with
such reporting. Vucic said the Albanian media were ``inciting
religious and national hatred.''
	   The warning came after Vucic earlier Thursday announced an
imminent government crackdown against Albanian-language media who
disobey the restrictive Serbian media law.
	   The law, passed by the Serbian parliament last October,
envisages enormous fines for publishing reports considered by the
government to be against the state.
	   Some independent media in Serbia already have been fined under
the new law, but Vucic said the government decided to give the
Albanian-language media ``some time'' to adjust their writing to
``respect territorial integrity of the country,'' following an
October agreement which ended heavy fighting in the province.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The airstrikes against Iraq have bitterly
divided the U.N. Security Council, leaving it unable to decide on
any course of action to resolve the conflict over weapons
inspections.
	   Iraq, Russia and China called Wednesday night for an immediate
halt to the attacks. But the United States and Britain insisted
military action was justified because Iraq had failed to cooperate
fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The result was a formal Security Council meeting with 15
speeches, an outpouring of frustration that peace efforts had
failed, but no action. Russia, which had called Wednesday night's
formal meeting, requested another round of informal consultations
this afternoon (3:30 p.m. EST).
	   For U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, it was ``a sad day for
the United Nations and for the world.''
	   Annan, who helped avert military action against Iraq in February
and November, said he did everything in his power to seek peace and
deeply regretted not being able to avert the use of force. He said
his thoughts were with the Iraqi people, the 370 U.N. humanitarian
workers still in the country ``and with all others whose lives are
in danger.''
	   He spent much of the day at the three closed council meetings
and the open council session Wednesday night.
	   Only a month ago, the Security Council unanimously backed a
resolution demanding that Iraq cooperate fully with weapons
inspectors _ as it promised Nov. 14 when the United States and
Britain called off threatened airstrikes.
	   But that unity started to fray when chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler reported to Annan on Tuesday that Iraq not only
failed to cooperate fully but imposed new restrictions on the
inspectors' work.
	   And it totally collapsed after Butler pulled out the inspection
teams Tuesday night without consulting the council _ and the United
States and Britain then launched airstrikes without council
approval.
	   During Wednesday night's meeting, there were serious divisions
among the 15-member council over a cease-fire, the accuracy of
Butler's report and his decision to evacuate inspection teams from
Baghdad, and the unilateral use of force by the United States and
Britain.
	   Some council members were also angered that the airstrikes were
launched just as they were discussing three options suggested by
Annan to deal with Butler's report, which became moot.
	   Speaking at the start of Wednesday night's meeting, Iraq's U.N.
envoy Nizar Hamdoon urged the council to call for an immediate halt
to the uprovoked attacks which he said were ``wrecking the lives''
of innocent Iraqis.
	   Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov backed his appeal for an
immediate end ``to these acts of military force'' and China's U.N.
envoy Qin Huasun called on the United States and Britain ``to stop
forthwith all military actions against Iraq.''
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' Qin said earlier.
	   But the United States and Britain insisted the airstrikes were
launched only after diplomacy was exhausted and Butler had
documented its failure to hand over documents and allowed
unfettered inspections.
	   ``The United States did not seek a confrontation and did not
undertake this decision lightly,'' said Deputy U.S. Ambassador
Peter Burleigh. ``Iraq's policy of unremitting defiance and
noncompliance necessitated the resort to military force.''
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to develop nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and threaten his neighbors.
	   Hamdoon challenged the U.N. Special Commission known as UNSCOM,
which Butler heads, to produce physical evidence that Iraq still
has prohibited weapons.
	   ``The exaggerated uproar over the Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction is nothing more than a big lie,'' he said. ``The other
lie is that Iraq poses a threat to its neighbors.''
	   Britain and the United States insisted that they acted under the
authority provided by previous Security Council resolutions. But
many other council members countered only the council can sanction
the use of military force _ and it had not done so.
	   Swedish Ambassador Hans Dahlgren said his government regretted
``that the council was presented with a fait acompli.'' And
Russia's Lavrov warned that ``the entire responsibility for the
consequence of these actions must be borne by those states who have
chosen a unilateral act of force in order to resolve their problems
with Iraq.''
	   Hamdoon accused Butler of bias, noting that Butler cited only
five incidents in 300 inspection operations.
	   ``The leader of UNSCOM has played a dishonorable role in this
crisis,'' said China's Qin. ``The reports submitted by UNSCOM to
the secretary-general were unfounded and evasive of the facts. It
is difficult for the UNSCOM leader to shed his responsibility over
the current crisis.''
	   Asked whether Butler still had the council's backing, Lavrov
noted that steps he had taken in the last 24 hours ``were
questioned seriously'' by council members.
	   Under the cease-fire resolution which ended the 1991 Persian
Gulf War, UNSCOM must verify that Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction have been eliminated before tough economic sanctions
against Iraq can be lifted. But there were questions of when _ and
whether _ UNSCOM would be able to return to Iraq.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain on Thursday relaxed the arms embargo it
had imposed on Argentina after the Falklands War 16 years ago, but
stressed there was no change in its policy toward its South
Atlantic colony.
	   The Foreign Office said the government remains committed to
defending the islands, which Argentina claims.
	   Licenses for the export of weapons to Argentina will now be
granted on a case-by-case basis, the Foreign Office said.

Broadcasting group emerges as takeover bidder

 &UR; Eds: ADDS NTL, Newcastle comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ U.S. media and broadcasting group NTL
emerged Thursday as the company planning to take over Newcastle
United.
	   New York-based NTL announced it had bought a 6 percent share in
the club and had reached agreement with Newcastle's main
shareholder, Cameron Hall Developments, to buy a further 51 percent
if the broadcasting company makes an offer.
	   NTL president and chief executive officer Barclay Knapp said the
company was hoping to gain a foothold in screening live soccer but
did not intend to have a say in the running of the team.
	   ``NTL's approach across its business activities is to be a force
for wider choice, diversity and customer value,'' said Knapp, who
added that the deal would be done through a subsidiary, Premium TV.
	   ``Through Premium TV, we have been looking at ways of bringing
more quality sport to more viewers and today's deal is in line with
that strategy,'' he said. ``Our involvement will be for the benefit
of football, Newcastle United and its supporters. We believe
strongly that the future success of football will continue to be
developed on the enthusiasm and active support of fans.
	   ``Whilst NTL will not be involved in any way in managing
Newcastle United and will have no influence on the running of the
club, our strategic stake on 6.3 per cent in Newcastle United gives
us a significant foothold in the market for sports television.''
	   NTL said such a decision depends on a ruling by the government's
Monopolies and Mergers Commission whether BSkyB's takeover bid for
Manchester United contravenes fair trading.
	   Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB satellite TV company has made a 623
million pound (dlrs 1 billion) bid for Manchester United but the
deal is on hold pending a ruling by the MMC.
	   When Newcastle plc announced last week that it was the target of
a takeover, newspaper speculation suggested the company involved
was the Sony electronics firm, with U.S. media group Time Warner
also reported to be interested.
	   Newcastle's chief executive, Freddie Fletcher, welcomed the
approach by NTL.
	   ``This is good news for Newcastle United, its fans and its
shareholders,'' he said. ``I think this is the way football is
going to develop on a more internationalized basis.
	   ``If the best clubs are to compete with Manchester United in
Britain, and the Milans and Barcelona, they need the strength of a
company like NTL behind them.''
	   The ownership of Newcastle has been in the headlines for the
wrong reasons during the past year.
	   Cameron Hall Developments is owned by Douglas Hall, a Newcastle
United director who resigned, along with co-director Freddie
Shepherd, after they were caught on tape making derogatory comments
about the women of Newcastle. They also mocked the club's fans and
called Magpies' top striker, England captain Alan Shearer, ``Mary
Poppins.''
	   Last week, Hall and Shepherd regained their places on the board
of directors and chairman Dennis Cassidy and directors John Josephs
and Tom Fenton resigned in protest.
	   The club's stockbrokers, BT Alex Brown, also resigned their
contract with the club because of the return of Hall and Shepherd.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Air raid sirens blared at dusk in Baghdad
on Thursday, signaling a new wave of expected U.S. attacks, hours
after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein inspected the demolished remains
of his daughter's home.
	   In Washington, Pentagon officials said they had launched a
second attack, but in Baghdad there was no immediate sign of this.
A senior U.S. defense official said cruise missiles were sent deep
into the country and Navy strike aircraft with laser-guided bombs
targeted Iraqi air defenses along the border. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Baghdad Radio reported that earlier Thursday Saddam visited
several sites targeted by U.S. missiles, including his daughter's
house. She was safe but the home ``was targeted and destroyed by
the evil enemies in their latest aggression,'' the radio said.
	   In the first attack early Thursday, the United States fired more
than 200 sea-launched cruise missiles on Iraq in the largest attack
on the country since 1991, and Baghdad shook with explosions and
anti-aircraft flak through the night. Two people were killed and 30
were wounded, a doctor said.
	   Russia and China had called for a halt to the attacks, but U.S.
President Bill Clinton suggested the strikes would continue.
	   On Thursday evening, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf accused the United States and Britain of lying
``shamelessly'' in claiming that the report of the U.N. chief
weapons inspector proved Iraq had not cooperated in the search for
its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This aggression against Iraq is a crime against international
law, the U.N. charter, and we will hold our full right to hold them
responsible _ the Americans and British _ for all the crimes they
are committing against our people,'' al-Sahhaf told a news
conference.
	   He said inspection teams had carried out visits to 427 sites in
the past month _ since the last stand-off over weapons inspections
_ and only five cases of non-cooperation arose.
	   Al-Sahhaf characterized the five sites involved as minor and
said they did not justify ``a dangerous crime against the people of
Iraq.''
	   Al-Sahhaf also listed examples of targets struck in the American
attack, including factories and the headquarters of the security
police and military intelligence.
	   He said the two headquarters have been inspected more than once
by U.N. arms experts and many of the factories had U.N. cameras as
part of permanent monitoring of potential weapons sites.
	   The overnight missile attack caused heavy casualties in
populated areas of Baghdad, al-Sahhaf said. But he declined to give
specific figures.
	   The minister said that instead of calling their campaign
Operation Desert Fox, the allies should have named it ``Operation
Villains in the Arabian Desert.''
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein visited some of the targeted
sites Thursday, including the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad
Radio reported. Hala, the youngest of his three daughters, was
safe, but the house was demolished, it said.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said.
	   Air raid sirens had broken the night's silence minutes before a
barrage of anti-aircraft fire lit up the Baghdad sky at 12:49 a.m.
(2149 GMT Wednesday), unleashing thunderous blasts like a fireworks
display and shaking windows of buildings.
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known.
	   Witnesses said another missile landed in the neighborhood of
al-Adil, about two kilometers (one mile) from Abu Ghraib where a
sprawling military camp and radio relay stations are located.
	   Both of Iraq's television stations shut down Thursday afternoon,
but one resumed broadcasting later. Three of the four official
radio stations were off the air. It was not clear whether they were
destroyed.
	   Clinton said he ordered the strikes on military and security
targets to retaliate for Iraq's defiance of the U.N. Special
Commission, which is responsible for eliminating the country's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological weapons,'' he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he authorized the
participation of British forces.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in his radio
address, saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face''
but ``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the al-Yarmouk Hospital in Baghdad,
said two people were killed and more than 30 were wounded,
suffering mostly burns in the face, hands and legs. But the full
casualty toll was not known, and there was no official word.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
mumbled Salam Mohammed, 34, as he moaned on his hospital bed, his
face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary said in Washington that preliminary
assessments showed the attacks had inflicted ``severe damage to
some targets.''
	   Iraqi officials took foreign reporters to Karada, an upscale
commercial and residential neighborhood, where a missile had
landed. The blast burst water mains in a street, flooding a
two-kilometer (one-mile) stretch of a street.
	   Foreign reporters, who are based at a press center in downtown
Baghdad and can travel around the city only with a government
escort, were given selective access to the damage.
	   In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain for the attack and demanded an immediate end to
the campaign, warning it could shatter regional security.
	   At a Security Council meeting, the ambassadors of Russia and
China, both sympathetic to Iraq, urged an end to the attacks.
	   Staunch American allies _ Germany, Canada and even Japan _
supported the strikes.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the events a ``sad day
for the world,'' saying he did everything in his power to seek
peace. But he didn't say whether the attacks were justified.
	   In his speech, Clinton said the campaign against Iraq will be a
``strong sustained series of air strikes,'' indicating that more
punishing strikes are likely in the next few days.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   In the attacks, the warships fired hundreds of Tomahawk cruise
missiles, and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck against Iraqi air
defense radars, Pentagon officials said.
	   The United States hopes the attacks will achieve what the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, says it has not been able to achieve
in seven years of work: destroy Iraq's ability to produce weapons
of mass destruction, specifically chemical and biological arms.
	   The U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until the
inspectors certify that Iraq is free of chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles and programs to build them.
	   The chief inspector, Richard Butler, withdrew all his weapons
inspectors from Baghdad on Wednesday, accusing Iraq of going back
on its promise last month to cooperate fully with UNSCOM. That
promise had saved Iraq from an imminent U.S. attack on Nov. 14.

details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and major
power companies have agreed to close Germany's nuclear plants
within 20 years, a magazine reported Thursday.
	   The accord, to be fleshed out in detailed talks starting next
month, would rule out compensation claims by utilities for scrapped
power plants, the newsweekly Der Spiegel said.
	   Government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye called the report
``speculation.''
	   Schroeder's 7-week-old center-left government, which includes
the environmentalist Greens, has set shutting down the nation's 19
nuclear plants as a top goal _ a policy reversal for Germany.
	   Juergen Trittin, the new Greens environment minister has said he
wants to shut down as many nuclear power plants as possible ``as
soon as possible.''
	   Commenting on the Spiegel report, Trittin called it ``a
frivolous unbelievable speculation.'' He said the coalition planned
to meet in Berlin on Jan. 13 to formulate a joint policy nuclear
energy.
	   The report said Schroeder agreed on a timetable for the exit
strategy in talks Monday with the bosses of Germany's four biggest
energy providers: RWE, Veba, Viag, and Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg.
	   Schroeder at the time described the talks as preliminary and
announced no agreements. There was no immediate government comment
on the Spiegel report.
	   If confirmed, the timetable would be much slower than sought by
the Greens, the junior partner to Schroeder's Social Democrats, but
quicker than industry has so far proposed.
	   While the Greens have talked about closing the plants in five to
10 years, an electricity industry trade group this week demanded a
40-year time span.
	   Efforts to draft a new nuclear power law have already caused a
rift in the government alliance, clouding prospects for Schroeder's
negotiations with power companies.
	   Environment Minister Juergen Trittin, a Green, insisted Thursday
he will fight for an immediate legal ban on reprocessing spent
nuclear fuel from German power plants, which could force them to
shut down more quickly than Schroeder wants.
	   Schroeder failed to settle the dispute in a Cabinet meeting
Wednesday, and both parties agreed to put off the issue until next
month.
	   At issue are contracts with reprocessing plants in France and
Britain. Germany has no such plants of its own.
	   The opposition Christian Democrats said Trittin's plans could
trigger violent protests by Germany's strong anti-nuclear movement
if the new law forces the French and British to ship back nuclear
fuel that was awaiting reprocessing.

	   ``Licenses will only be granted for exports that we are
satisfied would not now, or in the foreseeable future, put at risk
the security of our overseas territories in the South Atlantic, or
our forces operating there,'' Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd
said.
	   Britain imposed a ban on the export of all arms and military
equipment to Argentina in April 1982 after the invasion of the
Falkland Islands by Argentine troops.
	   Lloyd said in future exports of arms and military equipment to
Argentina would be assessed against Britain's national licensing
criteria and the European Union's Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.
	   ``This is a logical modernization of our export control
arrangements. It reflects the changed circumstances since the
embargo was put in place,'' he added.
	   Most of the 970 soldiers killed in the 74-day conflict over the
islands were Argentines.

	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police who said they were hunting
for the murderers of six Kosovo Serbs attacked a suspected
rebel-controlled village Thursday, reportedly killing two ethnic
Albanian fighters and arresting 11 in a day-long battle.
	   The clash that began around dawn near Glodjane was one of the
biggest in months in Kosovo, where a wobbly October truce that has
held across most of the Serbian province is in increasing danger of
breaking down altogether.
	   International monitors who got near the western Kosovo village,
located 10 kilometers (six miles) south of the city of Pec, said
they heard shelling and heavy fighting.
	   ``It was war,'' said a European monitor who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   Police also sealed off a northwestern suburb of Pec as part of
the sweep. An armored personnel carrier and policemen wearing flak
jackets blocked a bridge leading to Kapesnica, and police snipers
looked down from surrounding rooftops.
	   ``We are in pursuit of the perpetrators of the shooting in the
Panda bar,'' a police commander said, referring to the bar where
the six young Serbs were slaughtered. He spoke on condition his
name not be used.
	   Monday's shootings, carried out by masked gunmen who riddled the
Serb bar with automatic fire, fueled tensions in a province still
reeling from more than 1,000 deaths in months of fighting this year
between Serb forces and separatist rebels.
	   Police told the Serb-run Media Center in Pristina that after
officers searching for suspects in Glodjane came under fire, police
killed two people wearing camouflage uniforms bearing the KLA
insignia and armed with assault rifles and mortars. They said they
arrested 11 people _ at least one in Kapesnica _ and discovered
large quantities of arms, ammunition and KLA uniforms.
	   The international Kosovo Verification Mission sent several teams
to the area, and American and other officials held talks with
Serbian police in an unsuccessful attempt to calm the situation.
Hours later the clash was reported to be still going on.
	   The political representative of the KLA, which is fighting to
drive Serb police out of Kosovo and break the province away from
Serbia, has denied rebel involvement in Monday's attack.
	   But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this week to arrest
the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   The state-run Borba daily called Thursday, in a sharply worded
commentary, for the withdrawal of international verifiers and U.S.
envoys from Kosovo, saying they are ``direct instigators and
helpers of the crimes committed by Albanian terrorists.''
	   Serbs held a protest rally concerning the killings for a second
straight day Thursday, this time in front of the headquarters of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs
the verifying force.
	   About 300 Serbs whistled, booed, and demanded to meet
immediately mission chief William Walker, an American diplomat, who
said he would meet with them Friday. Complaining that the
international verifiers are failing to ease tensions and not
responding sufficiently to the Pec killings, they chanted, ``Put
them in chains!''
	   The killings have cast further gloom over stalled diplomatic
efforts to resolve the Serb-Albanian standoff in Kosovo, where
dozens have died in sporadic clashes since the October agreement.
	   Serbian authorities say they are willing to grant only limited
autonomy for Kosovo, while most of the overwhelmingly
Albanian-populated province want independence from Serbia _ the
dominant republic remaining in Yugoslavia.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A Brazilian Congresswoman was
gunned down along with three family members in a northeastern
state, police said Thursday.
	   Ceci Cunha, 57, a two-term Congresswoman with the government's
Brazilian Social Democratic Party, was killed Wednesday evening
with a single shot from a 12-gauge shotgun, said Alagoas state
police Col. Ailton Pimentel.
	   Alagoas is a corrupt and violent state.
	   The shooting occured outside Cunha's sister's house in the rich
neighborhood of Gruta de Lourdes in the state capital of Maceio
1,033 miles (1,667 kms) northeast of Rio de Janeiro.
	   Cunha's husband, sister-in-law and her sister's mother-in-law
were also killed in the shooting, Pimentel said.
	   Pimentel said some of the other victims were killed with a 9
millimeter weapon and that while the police had some leads he could
not comment futher on the investigation.
	   Cunha's office said she is survived by two children and will be
buried Thursday evening in Maceio.

Alleged anti-AIDS drug rejected for testing by SAfrican panel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ After two years of political
and scientific wrestling, the panel that controls testing of new
drugs rejected on Thursday an alleged AIDS remedy, Virodene, for
clinical trials.
	   The Medicines Control Council said its decision was prompted by
the interests of science and public safety.
	   ``The clinical data that was presented to council ... contained
duplications, incorrect figures and omissions,'' the council's
statement said.
	   The government, including Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and
Health Minister Dr. Nkosazana Zuma, have battled with the panel and
even proposed dismantling the council to streamline Virodene's
approval.
	   Researchers claim Virodene dramatically reduced the level of HIV
in patients' blood and boosted their infection-fighting CD4 cell
counts within weeks.
	   But the Medicines Control Council stepped in last year even
before the application for clinical trials, banning further
research because one of Virodene's ingredients is
dimethylformamide, a toxic industrial solvent that can damage the
liver and possibly cause cancer.
	   Critics said the South African researchers deviated from
accepted procedures in testing the experimental AIDS drug and
sidestepped peer review in seeking government funding.
	   Some scientists also criticized Virodene's developers, Olga
Visser and two other researchers, for testing on humans without
first going through laboratory and animal trials.
	   In a statement in Pretoria on Thursday, the panel said the
researchers failed to provide evidence of the drug's efficacy
during the 22 months their application was under review.
	   ``As Virodene is unregistered, with no proven benefit for the
treatment of HIV-AIDS, the use of the product is unlawful,'' the
panel's statement said.
	   Zuma, Mbeki and other top ANC officials are being investigated
by the government ombudsman for possible conflict of interest
involving the drug.
	   The investigation, begun at the request of the opposition
Democratic party, is probing whether Mbeki had acted unethically in
his contacts with the company that developed the drug,
Cryopreservation. The ruling party, the African National Congress,
was also, considering buying shares in the firm.
	   Mbeki criticized the council's ban on Virodene, saying it denied
AIDS sufferers a possible treatment.
	   ``I and many others will not rest until Virodene's efficacy or
otherwise is established scientifically,'' Mbeki said earlier this
year.
	   A consortium, called Virodene Pharmaceutical Holdings, bought
the majority interest in Cryopreservation Technologies in June.
Media reports said the company paid dlrs 3.7 million for a 70
percent share.

Police disperse protesting miners from national road, railway line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Police dispersed hundreds of miners
early Thursday after they blocked a national highway and railway
lines to protest falling living standards and possible job cuts.
	   Some 200 gold and zinc miners sat down across a central Romanian
highway and railway track Wednesday, after the state electricity
company cut power to four mines, affecting 5,000 miners. Dozens of
trains were delayed, canceled or rerouted due to the protest.
	   Before dawn Thursday, 200 policemen moved in to break up the
demonstration in Sandominic, a small town 140 miles north of
Bucharest. The miners did not resist because they were ``hungry,
tired and frozen,'' police spokesman Maj. Gheorghe Tudor said by
telephone.
	   According to the state electricity company, the mines owe $1.5
million. The miners are demanding that the government reconnect
their power and guarantee their jobs. Their demands will be
discussed by the government later.
	   Last year, the government said unprofitable mines will be closed
over the coming months and tens of thousands of mainly coal miners
were laid off.
	   Miners in Romania are a volatile political force. Twice in the
past decade, they rampaged through the capital, forcing a prime
minister to resign and killing civilians _ the state counts only
six victims, but citizens say the numbers are as high as 60.

Yeltsin in Kremlin, meets with Belarusian, Swiss presidents

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 7-8 with comment on Yeltsin-Cotti meeting. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin kept a close watch on
developments in Iraq on Thursday, in between meetings with the
leaders of Belarus and Switzerland, his press service said.
	   At a meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko,
Yeltsin said the economic situation in Russia ``is now stable,''
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin has made a number of public appearances since he was
released from a hospital a week ago to finish recovering from
pneumonia. He had received treatment for more than two weeks.
	   Yeltsin was up for much of the night monitoring the situation in
Iraq, according to aides. He condemned the attacks on Baghdad by
the United States and Great Britain.
	   The president met Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Chief of
Staff Nikolai Bordyuzha to discuss Iraq, as well as Russia's
pressing economic problems. He also talked to Chinese President
Jiang Zemin by telephone about Iraq.
	   Later, he met at the Kremlin with Swiss President Flavio Cotti,
in Russia on a three-day visit.
	   Yeltsin admitted that Russia's economy was struggling, but Cotti
praised Russian leaders' attempts to tackle the economic crisis,
Yeltsin aide Sergei Prikhodko said after the talks.
	   The two presidents discussed cooperation in law enforcement and
other areas, Prikhodko said. Cotti had expressed concern about
economic crimes in Russia.
	   The Russian president then met with Lukashenko, who said before
arriving in Moscow on Wednesday that he would only discuss
strengthening a union treaty between Belarus and Russia during his
trip.
	   But the two leaders had also been expected to discuss Belarus's
massive economic problems, deepened by Russia's financial collapse
in August. Belarus was hit harder by the crash than other former
Soviet republics because of its strong trade links to Russia and
already weak currency.
	   In an interview with the newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta,
Lukashenko called for pooling the financial resources of Russian
and Belarus. Lukashenko has frequently pushed closer ties to
Russia, in part out of an ambition to restore the Soviet Union.
	   Yeltsin has largely passed on responsibility for the country's
pressing economic problems to Primakov, and has not traveled abroad
recently because of his health. Still, he insists he will serve out
his term, which ends in 2000.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Air raid sirens blared at dusk in Baghdad
on Thursday, signaling a new wave of expected U.S. attacks, and
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein inspected the demolished remains of his
daughter's home.
	   Baghdad Radio reported Saddam visited several sites targeted by
U.S. missiles, including the home of the youngest of his three
daughters. Hala was safe, having been away at the time, but the
home ``was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said.
	   The United States fired more than 200 sea-launched cruise
missiles on Iraq in the largest attack on the country since 1991,
and Baghdad shook with explosions and anti-aircraft flak through
the night. Two people were killed and 30 were wounded, a doctor
said.
	   U.S. and British officials reported no casualties, and U.S. spy
satellites and U-2 aircraft flying over Iraq spent the day
assessing the damage.
	   In Washington, a senior defense official said cruise missiles
had been sent deep into Iraq Thursday in a second wave of attacks,
and Navy aircraft from the Persian Gulf were using laser-guided
bombs to target Iraqi air defenses along the border.
	   ``The B-52s (based in the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia)
are on the way,'' said a senior military planner, who also spoke on
condition of anonymity. The strikes began in the early evening
Iraqi time, shortly after 1600 GMT, the senior defense official
said.
	   Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Sahhaf, in the first
government news conference since the airstrikes began, said cruise
missiles had inflicted ``heavy casualties'' in populated areas of
Baghdad in the first wave of attacks. He declined to give a figure.
	   Al-Sahhaf said contrary to U.S. claims of targeting Iraq's
military and its weapons manufacturing infrastructure, the missiles
had hit ``several industrial establishments _ all of them under
complete, ongoing monitoring (by the United Nations).''
	   One missile struck a factory that produces brake oil for cars,
he said.
	   The minister also said houses in several places in the capital
were hit by missiles, and that a small factory for flashlight
batteries was targeted twice.
	   Al-Sahhaf accused the United States of ``shameless lying'' and
said that in defending their strikes, London and Washington had
failed to mention the report by inspectors of the International
Atomic Energy Agency that said Iraq had provided ``the necessary
level of cooperation.''
	   Russia and China called for an immediate halt to the waves of
attacks, but President Bill Clinton suggested the strikes on Iraqi
air defenses and military and intelligence sites may continue to
this weekend, when the Muslim holy period begins.
	   The first wave against Iraq produced ``severe damage to some
targets,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said Thursday. The
Pentagon readied further attacks aimed at destroying Saddam's
ability to create weapons of mass destruction.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said its Tornado
fighter-bombers based in Kuwait were taking part in forays over
Iraq on Thursday.
	   Government employees went to their offices, and young children
headed to school. Morning traffic jams clogged some of the streets
in downtown Baghdad, although fewer cars were out than usual.
	   Baghdad residents, however, lined up at gas stations to stock up
on fuel, a sign that more attacks were expected.
	   ``We are expecting the worst of Clinton because we have
discovered that he has no humanitarian principles,'' said Riad
Mamdouh al-Samarai, 36, as he stood at one station.
	   Air raid sirens broke the night's silence minutes before a
barrage of anti-aircraft fire lit up the Baghdad sky at 21:49 p.m.
GMT Wednesday, unleashing thunderous blasts like a fireworks
display and shaking windows of buildings.
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad.
	   Witnesses said another missile landed in the neighborhood of
al-Adil, about a mile (2.5 kilometers) from Abu Ghraib where a
sprawling military camp and radio relay stations are located.
	   Neither of Iraq's television stations broadcast Thursday
afternoon but one went back on the air in the evening, while three
of four official radio stations remained off the air.
	   Damage from the attack was hard to assess. Residents in an
Iranian town reportedly saw thick smoke rising from targets across
the border in Iraq.
	   Iraqi officials took foreign reporters to Karada, an upscale
neighborhood, where they said a missile had landed. The blast burst
water mains in a street, flooding a one-mile (2.5 kilometer)
stretch of a street.
	   Foreign reporters based at a press center in downtown Baghdad
can travel around the city with a government escort. The reporters
were given selective access to the damage.
	   The strikes were launched a day after chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler told the United Nations that Iraq had
failed to keep its promise to cooperate fully with the inspectors.
That promise had saved Iraq from an imminent U.S. attack on Nov.
14.
	   Butler withdrew all his weapons inspectors from Baghdad.
Although all U.N. weapons monitors also have left the country, many
U.N. humanitarian staff remained in Iraq Thursday. Their spokesman,
George Somerwill, said 133 U.N. staff had stayed in Baghdad and 233
staff remained in northern Iraq.
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the Aliyarmouk Hospital in Baghdad,
said two people were killed and 30 were wounded, many suffering
burns to the face, hands and legs. But the full casualty toll was
not known, and there was no official word.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
mumbled Salam Mohammed, 34, as he moaned on his hospital bed in the
Iraqi capital, his face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Clinton said he ordered the strikes on military and security
targets to retaliate for Iraq's defiance of the U.N. Special
Commission, which is responsible for eliminating the country's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in a radio address,
saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face.''
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the events a ``sad day
for the world.''
	   The United States hopes the attacks will achieve what UNSCOM has
not been able to achieve in seven years of work: destroy Iraq's
ability to produce weapons of mass destruction in the aftermath of
the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

Yeltsin in Kremlin, meets with Belarusian, Swiss presidents

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 7-8 with comment on Yeltsin-Cotti meeting. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin kept a close watch on
developments in Iraq on Thursday, in between meetings with the
leaders of Belarus and Switzerland, his press service said.
	   At a meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko,
Yeltsin said the economic situation in Russia ``is now stable,''
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin has made a number of public appearances since he was
released from a hospital a week ago to finish recovering from
pneumonia. He had received treatment for more than two weeks.
	   Yeltsin was up for much of the night monitoring the situation in
Iraq, according to aides. He condemned the attacks on Baghdad by
the United States and Great Britain.
	   The president met Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Chief of
Staff Nikolai Bordyuzha to discuss Iraq, as well as Russia's
pressing economic problems. He also talked to Chinese President
Jiang Zemin by telephone about Iraq.
	   Later, he met at the Kremlin with Swiss President Flavio Cotti,
in Russia on a three-day visit.
	   Yeltsin admitted that Russia's economy was struggling, but Cotti
praised Russian leaders' attempts to tackle the economic crisis,
Yeltsin aide Sergei Prikhodko said after the talks.
	   The two presidents discussed cooperation in law enforcement and
other areas, Prikhodko said. Cotti had expressed concern about
economic crimes in Russia.
	   The Russian president then met with Lukashenko, who said before
arriving in Moscow on Wednesday that he would only discuss
strengthening a union treaty between Belarus and Russia during his
trip.
	   But the two leaders had also been expected to discuss Belarus's
massive economic problems, deepened by Russia's financial collapse
in August. Belarus was hit harder by the crash than other former
Soviet republics because of its strong trade links to Russia and
already weak currency.
	   In an interview with the newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta,
Lukashenko called for pooling the financial resources of Russian
and Belarus. Lukashenko has frequently pushed closer ties to
Russia, in part out of an ambition to restore the Soviet Union.
	   Yeltsin has largely passed on responsibility for the country's
pressing economic problems to Primakov, and has not traveled abroad
recently because of his health. Still, he insists he will serve out
his term, which ends in 2000.

Appeal court acquits six Iraqi hijackers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Appeal judges Thursday acquitted six Iraqi
hijackers jailed for commandeering a Sudanese passenger jet with
fake hand grenades, saying the men acted out of fear of Saddam
Hussein's regime.
	   The men, who commandeered a Sudan Airways plane bound from
Khartoum to Jordan and forced the pilot to fly to London, were
convicted in November 1997 by English jurors who nevertheless said
they felt sorry for them.
	   The judge at their trial, Sir Michael Wright, said he accepted
that the Iraqis _ exiles in Sudan _ were terrified of Saddam.
	   But Wright ruled that to claim they acted ``under duress,'' a
legal defense, the hijacking needed to be in response to an
immediate threat.
	   Three appeal judges, however, likened the plight of the Iraqis
to that of Anne Frank, the famed young Jewish diarist who hid from
the Nazis in Amsterdam in World War II.
	   ``If Anne Frank had stolen a car to escape from Amsterdam and
had been charged with theft, the tenets of English law would not
have denied her the defense of duress of circumstances on the
ground that she should have awaited the Gestapo's knock at the
door,'' Lord Justice Christopher Rose said.
	   The appeal judges refused a request from prosecutors for a
retrial.
	   The Iraqis, Shiite Muslims from southern Iraq, now can apply for
political asylum.
	   They commandeered the Airbus A320 with 197 passengers and crew
on Aug. 16, 1996, by using two sauce bottles filled with salt and
bound with black tape to look like grenades.
	   Prosecutors said that in a 20-hour ordeal of terror they held
hostage a 12-year-old girl and a flight attendant, beat passengers
and threatened to throw people out of the airplane.
	   Adnan Hoshan, 40, who had studied in Britain in the 80s and was
described as the leader, had been jailed for nine years.
	   Two others, Muhammad Muhssin, 40, and Saheb Aboud, 32, were
jailed for seven years. Hasah Hasan, 35, Mustafa Hussin, 34, and
Maged Nagi, 37, were each jailed for five years.

U.S. carrier readies itself for possible second strike on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY ADNAN MALIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ Sailors aboard this carrier
loaded thousands of pounds of laser-guided weapons on warplanes
Thursday in preparation for a possible second strike on Iraq.
	   No fewer than 200 crew were busy on the flight deck making
planes ready for unspecified missions.
	   Motivation was high after Wednesday night's bombing raids on
Iraq.
	   ``It was a long night for us, but it was the night in which all
the aircraft air crews returned successfully and safely.'' Rear
Adm. James Cutler Dawson Jr. told reporters.
	   Some 50 strike missions were flown by the carrier's F-14 and
F-18 planes and EA6 B's prowler aircraft.
	   ``The opposition were light and we had to take proper measures
to protect ourselves from their defenses,'' Dawson said, referring
to the Iraqi anti-aircraft guns and surface-to-air missiles.
	   Prior to the strike, pilots had carried our nearly 100 sorties
over the no-fly zone in southern Iraq on Wednesday.
	   ``We prepare for this deployment for months and months and we
were well prepared and we continue to improve our readiness,''
Dawson said.
	   Some 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired during the strike.
	   During the daylight hours of Thursday, no aircraft took off for
missions. Everything was geared for the next possible attack.
	   But in the morning, some 2,000 marines from the amphibious
assault ship USS Belleau Wood conducted training exercises close to
the Kuwait border.
	   On Wednesday, they had practiced evacuating 50 American
civilians from the shore.
	   The U.S. Navy would not allow the carrier's position in the Gulf
to be published, but the ship was within easy striking range of
Iraq.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the strike after the U.N.
Special Commission reported that Iraq had failed to cooperate with
its inspectors, who are charged with overseeing the elimination of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

Chirac says force cannot solve Iraq crisis
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMS, UPDATES with Chirac saying France opposes use
of force and will try to help end the crisis, CHANGES byline.
 &UR; By SUSANNAH PATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac said Thursday that
U.S. military strikes against Iraq will not solve the crisis there.
	   ``What will be essential is to resolve the problems, which
obviously will not be solved with weapons,'' said Chirac, standing
at the doorstep of the presidential Elysee Palace.
	   The statement, coming after extensive comments by Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine, indicated France's clear discomfort with
the developments.
	   Chirac also said France would use its weight to try to end the
crisis. France, he said, has ``a role and responsibility'' to ``do
everything possible'' to find a solution.
	   He added, however, that `once again, the responsibility clearly
falls on Saddam Hussein.''
	   Earlier Thursday, Vedrine criticized the Iraqi leader for
failing to fully comply with a U.N. accord on weapons inspections.
	   But he defended France's longstanding position that a diplomatic
solution should be sought to repeated standoffs with the Iraqi
leader.
	   At a hastily called news conference, Vedrine said: ``France
deplores the spiral of events that led to the American military
strikes against Iraq and the grave human consequences they could
have on the Iraqi population.''
	   ``But Saddam Hussein is the person who bears the main
responsibility for the conflict,'' he added. ``We regret that the
Iraqi leader and other officials did not show a spirit of
cooperation.''
	   France has repeatedly clashed with Washington over how to deal
with Saddam in recent months, and France's latest stand drew ire
from Washington.
	   ``It would be very nice if those who did not support our
approach had an approach that worked,'' U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said in Washington Wednesday night.
	   France, which in the past has had fruitful trade relations with
Iraq, wanted the U.N. Security Council to play the leading role in
the latest crisis, and hours ahead of the strikes it expressed hope
the new dispute could be solved peacefully.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin was cautious during a news
conference in Ottawa, trying to avoid either endorsing or
condemning the airstrikes.
	   The U.S. action ``was to some extent inevitable _ but inevitable
does not mean necessary,'' he said.
	   French newspapers went further in their criticism.
	   The leftist Liberation, with a headline reading ``Clinton's
War,'' said the strikes ``punished a country already weak and
permanently humiliated,'' and it noted pointedly that the
airstrikes led Congress to postpone an impeachment vote against
President Clinton.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ European and U.S. markets were up Thursday, as
investors shrugged off the launch of American military strikes
against Iraq and its implications for the impeachment efforts
against President Clinton.
	   The airstrikes against Iraq, which got under way Wednesday,
didn't spark dramatic responses in Asia or Europe.
	   Oil prices, which rose Wednesday as air strikes became imminent,
fell Thursday as traders realized that Iraqi oil facilities hadn't
been damaged.
	   The U.S. Treasury bond, normally a safe haven in uncertain
times, also fell slightly, as did the U.S. dollar in trading
against other dominant currencies.
	   ``This isn't a very important economic event, though it may be
an important political event,'' said Diane C. Swonk, deputy chief
economist for Bank One Corp.
	   U.S. investors were more interested in a surprising drop in the
U.S. trade deficit, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up
79.30 points to 8869.90 on Wall Street by midday.
	   In Japan, the Nikkei stock average rose 0.12 percent. In
Germany, the DAX index closed up 1.0 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
was up 1.0 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1.2 percent.
	   In Hong Kong, news on Iraq was largely ignored as the blue-chip
Hang Seng Index rose 143.92 points, or 1.4 percent, at 10,083.31.
	   Overseas sales of American wheat, soybeans and other farm
products helped offset U.S. imports of cheap Asian toys and
consumer products for the holidays. The deficit in October fell 1.2
percent to dlrs 14.2 billion, the lowest level since April.
	   ``They are just stunned,'' Swonk said. ``The economy is now
adding up to close to 4 percent growth for the fourth quarter.''
That rate would be much higher than economists have been predicting
of late.
	   John Williams, chief global market economist at Bankers Trust,
said markets remain sanguine about the impeachment proceedings
against Clinton.
	   ``The consensus view is President (Clinton) won't be convicted
by the Senate if he is impeached, and that the military effort will
be successful,'' Williams told Dow Jones Newswires. ``I suspect the
market will have a pretty good tone.''
	   The fall in the bellwether 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was blamed
on speculative investors, who were closing out their books for the
year.

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ President Eduardo Frei and supporters of
Gen. Augusto Pinochet called Thursday for the release of the former
dictator, who has won a new hearing in his fight against
extradition to Spain.
	   In London, Britain's highest court set aside its decision that
Pinochet has no immunity from arrest and ordered a new hearing
because of a judge's ties with the human rights group Amnesty
International.
	   Frei and rightwing supporters of Pinochet said he should be set
free from house arrest in London.
	   ``It seems logical that Sen. Pinochet be allowed to return to
Chile and let us Chileans to decide our affairs,'' Frei said.
	   Frei's government also said it is prepared to support the
83-year-old former dictator in a new battle in court after Pinochet
was granted the hearing by the British House of Lords.
	   ``It does not seem reasonable after two months of unrest and
commotion in Chile, Britain and Spain, we are back to the initial
point,'' he added.
	   The decision by the House of Lords means that a panel of judges
will hold another hearing next month on the former Chilean
dictator's claim to immunity under British law.
	   It was the first time the Lords had overturned a decision by
their own tribunal and marks a setback in Spain's efforts to
extradite the 83-year-old general to face charges of murder and
torture.
	   Frei praised the British highest court's ``capacity to correct
its own decisions.''
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London while recovering from
back surgery on a warrant from Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, who
charged him with genocide and torture.
	   A Chilean government report in 1990 said more than 3,000 people
were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's dictatorship. The
government insists only its courts have jurisdiction over any
alleged crimes.
	   Right-wing supporters of Pinochet said British Home Secretary
Jack Straw should reverse his decision to authorize the start of
proceedings to extradite Pinochet to Spain.
	   They noted that his decision was based on the original 3-2
ruling by the Lords.
	   ``The door is now open for the release of Sen. Pinochet through
an administrative decision,'' said conservative Congressman Pablo
Longueira. ``Our government has a good opportunity to demand that
from the British government.''
	   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said the government will
support Pinochet in court but will not argue that he has full
immunity for his acts as a chief of state, as his lawyers insisted
during the first trial.
	   ``We didn't like'' that strategy, Insulza said. ``We will not
claim a legitimacy to commit crimes, but will say which court we
think is the one that has jurisdiction to try this case.''
	   At the Pinochet Foundation, a private group of Pinochet
loyalists, news of the decision triggered ``a wave of optimism and
renewed faith,'' said its director, retired Gen. Luis Cortes.
	   ``This is a great step forward in the difficult road.''
	   Cortes said he called Pinochet's house in London and was told
``the general was extremely happy, sharing the moment with his wife
and a number of visitors.''

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ It was a fleeting romance.
	   Thousands of Palestinians enraged by Bill Clinton's decision to
bomb Iraq chanted ``Death to America'' on Thursday and burned the
very U.S. flags they had waved when the U.S. president visited the
West Bank and Gaza Strip just three days earlier.
	   In three West Bank towns, marchers threw stones at Israeli
soldiers who fired rubber-coated steel pellets. In one
confrontation outside Ramallah, a 20-year-old Palestinian was
killed and 16 were injured by Israeli fire, doctors said.
	   Clinton sent a letter to Yasser Arafat to explain his reasons
for the attack on Iraq which has placed the Palestinian leader in a
difficult position.
	   The anti-U.S. marches in the West Bank and Gaza threatened to
undercut Arafat's special new relationship with the United States
which blossomed during the Clinton visit, widely seen as implicit
U.S. recognition of Palestinian claims to independence.
	   However, Arafat could not simply stifle the protests because of
the widespread support among his people for Iraq.
	   The largest rally was held in the West Bank town of Nablus where
about 3,000 Palestinians took to the streets, chanting ``Death to
America'' and ``Death to Clinton.''
	   Protesters burned a dozen U.S. flags, including those that had
been distributed by the Palestinian Authority several days earlier
to cheer the arrival of Clinton in Gaza and the biblical West Bank
town of Bethlehem.
	   ``Two days ago, Clinton was here and we thought he carried a
message of peace,'' said Majeda Masri, a teen-age marcher. ``But
now it is clear that he is a murderer.''
	   In Israel, the government opened 65 gas mask distribution and
deployed three Patriot anti-missile batteries outside the cities of
Tel Aviv and Haifa as a precaution against a possible Iraqi attack.
	   In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein fired 39 Scud
missiles at Israel after being attacked by the United States. At
the time, Saddam hoped to provoke an Israeli response and thus
break up the Arab coalition that had formed against him. However,
at the urging of the United States, Israel did not strike back.
	   Israeli military commanders said Thursday that the probability
of an Iraqi strike was very low. However, if pushed to the verge of
collapse by U.S. airstrikes, Saddam might fire missiles with
chemical or biological warheads at Israel, said Gen. Amos Gilad,
the head of research in Israel's military intelligence.
	   Clinton called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and told him
that the United States would not stand by if Israel were attacked,
according to a statement by Netanyahu's office.
	   Netanyahu said Israel does not want to get involved in the
conflict, but reserves the right to defend itself.
	   ``We have no intention of being part of this conflict, but we
are preparing for every eventuality,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Unlike in earlier Gulf crises, there was no sign of panic in
Israel. One hardware store hoping to boost sales offered customers
a free flashlight if they bought two rolls of tape for sealing
rooms. Gas mask distribution centers did brisk business, but there
were no long lines.
	   At one Jerusalem school, the average waiting period was three
minutes. Elissa Polan, 28, who immigrated from Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, a week ago, said she was concerned, but would stay.
	   ``I'm worried that something might happen, but I guess that's
just life in the Middle East,'' she said. ``I didn't think I'd have
to be getting a gas mask the first week I got here.
	   In the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat, British tour operators
evacuated several hundred tourists on special flights.
	   ``I had 12 British tourists on a scuba diving course and the
representatives of the British tour operators came and ordered them
back to their hotels to pack,'' said Uri Prigal, director of
Eilat's Red Sea Sports Club. ``They practically peeled the rubber
suits off them.''
	   The families of U.S. Embassy and Consulate staff in Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem prepared to leave by Friday, complying with a U.S. State
Department order.
	   One U.S. official said there was concern that children would be
at risk in case of a biological weapons attack. The antidote to
Anthrax, a biological agent mostly likely to be used by Iraq, has
not been tested on children, said the official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.

Judges set aside ruling against Pinochet in legal debacle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rattling the judiciary and stalling Spain's
efforts to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Britain's highest court
on Thursday set aside its own ruling against the former Chilean
dictator because a judge failed to disclose ties with Amnesty
International.
	   In an implied rebuke over the unprecedented legal debacle in the
House of Lords, the head of Britain's judiciary said top judges
must be required to declare any possible conflicts and withdraw
from cases where bias might be inferred.
	   ``We must make every effort to ensure that such a state of
affairs could not occur again,'' wrote Lord Derry Irvine, the Lord
Chancellor.
	   The unanimous ruling by a five-judge tribunal means that a new
House of Lords panel will rehear next month Pinochet's claim that,
under British law, his status as a former foreign head of state
gives him immunity from arrest on charges of murder and torture
during his 1970-93 rule.
	   Pinochet, arrested Oct. 16 while recuperating from back surgery,
cannot leave the country and remains under police guard at a rented
mansion 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of London.
	   Chile, however, renewed calls for the 83-year-old general to be
sent home, suggesting he might be tried there _ even though he has
immunity in Chile.
	   Citing the maxim that justice must be done and also be seen to
be done, the general's lawyers had complained that Lord Justice
Leonard Hoffmann should not have been allowed to sit in judgment of
Pinochet since he is the director of Amnesty International's
fundraising arm.
	   Hoffmann was one of the majority judges in the Lords' 3-2 ruling
Nov. 25 holding that Pinochet does not have immunity.
	   In addition to his role with the human rights group, the judge's
wife has worked at Amnesty's London headquarters since 1977.
	   Amnesty has played a key role in a long campaign to have
Pinochet charged with gross abuses of human rights, and also made
special representations in the first hearing before Hoffmann and
the other law lords. But the group insists Hoffmann and his wife
played no role in its efforts to try Pinochet.
	   Delivering judgment Thursday, however, Lord Justice Nicolas
Browne-Wilkinson noted that Hoffmann's Amnesty ties ``had not been
disclosed to the parties'' and said Hoffmann should have withdrawn.
	   ``I am satisfied that the earlier decision of this house cannot
stand and must be set aside,'' he said.
	   Hoffmann, 64, was out of the country and had no comment, his
office said. The judge and his wife are native-born South Africans
who opposed apartheid and settled in Britain in the '60s.
	   Though he has had a highly successful legal career, the ruling
by his fellow law lords is personally embarrassing.
	   It also raised speculation that the political views and
interests of judges _ who are appointed by the head of the
judiciary _ will be more closely scrutinized in future.
	   In New York, Human Rights Watch said it was ironic that ``a
dictator whose clandestine war tribunals ordered the summary
execution of hundreds of policial opponents is now taking advantage
of the full measure of British rule of law.''
	   And Amnesty chairman Andy McEntee noted that ``Augusto Pinochet
has very inventive lawyers.
	   ``They will make this a long case, one that is hard for him to
lose,'' McEntee said.
	   An official Chilean report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of his secret police after Pinochet
overthrew an elected Marxist.
	   In Santiago, Chilean President Eduardo Frei said Pinochet should
``be allowed to return to Chile and let us Chileans to decide on
our affairs.''
	   Said Chilean House Speaker Gutenberg Martinez, ``This is
starting to look like a legal or judicial soap opera.''
	   The rehearing in the Lords, probably Jan. 18, means extradition
proceedings due to start in a magistrate's court that day will
likely be on hold.
	   A British Cabinet minister ruled Dec. 9 that proceedings can
start.

Sri Lanka's government hopes for end to 16-year war in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's government is hoping that
1999 will bring an end to the country's 16-year civil war, a senior
minister said Thursday.
	   ``We hope that we can achieve that very elusive peace that we
have been trying to achieve,'' Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera
told reporters. ``The nation is crying out for peace.''
	   The war has reached a stalemate after the military two weeks ago
called off the bloodiest offensive yet, a failed 19-month attempt
to capture a vital highway in the northern war zone which cost more
than 6,000 lives.
	   The offensive was halted after wresting control of only 40
kilometers (24 miles) of the 70-kilometer (45-mile) highway.
Repeated counterattacks by the guerrillas caused heavy casualties
among government troops and brought the advance to a standstill.
	   The last peace talks ended in April 1995, with the rebels
launching surprise attacks on the military.
	   Government troops killed 51 Tamil Tiger rebels in northeastern
Sri Lanka over the last two days, without losing a single soldier,
said Brigadier Sunil Tennekoon, the military's main spokesman.
Twenty-six soldiers were wounded.
	   The military announced a 48-hour amnesty on Saturday and Sunday
to allow some of the 15,000 deserters to return. Both sides are
short of fighters. The military declares such amnesties as often as
every two months.
	   The guerrillas are fighting for a homeland in the northeast for
the country's minority ethnic Tamils, who say they are
discriminated by the majority Sinhalese who control the government
and military. More than 56,000 people have been killed in the war.

Man commits suicide because he can't afford Christmas tree
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A 50-year-old Romanian man killed
himself because he couldn't afford to buy a Christmas tree for his
daughter, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Ion Done, a divorced father who lived with his widowed mother
and 10-year-old daughter, took own his life after an argument
Tuesday with his mother, who wanted him to buy a Christmas for the
little girl, daily Evenimentul Zilei reported.
	   Done, whose occupation was unknown, said he couldn't afford the
luxury of a tree.
	   After the argument he threw himself out of the sixth-floor
apartment where he lived in the city of Braila, 110 miles northeast
of Bucharest. He died immediately, the paper said.
	   Christmas trees in Romania cost between $5 and $20 and are a
luxury for anyone earning the country's average monthly salary of
$120.
	   Only about one in ten Romanians can afford trees. Many people
instead purchase evergreen branches, which are cheaper.

Yeltsin condemns strikes on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian navy and air force put in `state of
preparedness' in grafs 4-5. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain on Thursday for attacking Iraq and demanded an
immediate end to the bombing, warning it could shatter hopes of
peace in the Middle East.
	   ``Russia demands an immediate end to military action, to show
common sense and restraint and not to allow further escalation of
the conflict which could result in the most dramatic consequences
not only for the Iraqi settlement but for the stability of the
entire region,'' Yeltsin said in a statement.
	   The United States and Britain launched air and missile attacks
against Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The Russian General Staff ordered the navy and air force to put
some of its units in ``a state of preparedness'' to await orders
that the commander-in-chief might issue because of the attacks, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. It did not elaborate, and there was
no sign that Russia was preparing to send any troops to the region.
	   While Russia has long opposed military action against Iraq, it
has never taken military steps of its own to intervene.
	   Responding to the attacks, Russia's parliament urged the
government Thursday to increase funding for the country's military
and defense industry. The State Duma voted 394-1 to approve the
non-binding resolution that also denounced ``the barbarous
bombings.''
	   Russian television channels showed Yeltsin looking at maps of
the Middle East and talking with several generals and senior aides.
The president spent most of Wednesday night monitoring the
situation, aides said.
	   Russia has consistently opposed military action against Iraq, an
old ally of the Soviet Union, and attempted to find a political
solution to the dispute. But Moscow is no longer a global
superpower and is able to do little more than protest U.S. actions,
goading Russian frustration.
	   Most Russians seemed critical of the attacks _ and most
mentioned their sympathy toward ordinary Iraqis.
	   The U.S. and Britain ``certainly had no right to do that _ there
are people there, after all,'' said Nadezhda Nenasheva, walking
with her child on a Moscow street.
	   Yeltsin discussed the situation in a phone call with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin. The two leaders agreed that the attack was
``unacceptable, unilateral and contradicting the U.N. charter and
the principles of international law,'' the Kremlin press service
said.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov also sharply denounced
the United States and Britain and said Russia would work in the
United Nations to end the attacks.
	   ``This time the activities of the U.S. and Great Britain have
not been provoked by Iraq. The U.S. administration has the strikes
on its conscience,'' said Primakov, who has had close ties with
Iraq for many years.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Russia will insist on the
dismissal of U.N. weapons inspector chief Richard Butler, saying
Butler ``carries a personal responsibility'' for the bombings.
	   In his report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday,
Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction, evasion and
subterfuge. He said he could not give assurances that Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction had been destroyed. A day after the
report, U.N. monitors were ordered to evacuate Baghdad.
	   ``The current crisis was created artificially, including through
irresponsible actions by Butler,'' Ivanov said. ``The document he
presented (to Annan) gives a distorted picture of the state of
affairs in Iraq.''
	   Russia's Islamic Committee issued a statement saying the
bombings are ``effectively the start of World War III, which the
West has long been promising to wage on us, Muslims.''
	   The Union of Russia's Muslims said: ``Our enemies must not
entertain the illusions that the Islamic world will remain
unresponsive and divided,'' it said.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said the strikes ``go
beyond the international law and annul all political and diplomatic
efforts aimed at implementing the U.N. Security Council
resolutions,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Parliamentary leaders also denounced the attacks, with Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov saying, ``This is international banditry
that must be sharply denounced.''
	   Vladimir Zhirinovsky, an ultranationalist leader and a
long-standing supporter of Saddam, called for Russia to
unilaterally stop abiding by the sanctions against Iraq, and
temporarily recall its ambassador to the United States, the
Interfax news agency reported.

	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ Sailors aboard this carrier
loaded thousands of pounds of laser-guided weapons on warplanes
Thursday in preparation for a possible second strike on Iraq.
	   No fewer than 200 crew were busy on the flight deck making
planes ready for unspecified missions.
	   Motivation was high after Wednesday night's bombing raids on
Iraq.
	   ``It was a long night for us, but it was the night in which all
the aircraft air crews returned successfully and safely.'' Rear
Adm. James Cutler Dawson Jr. told reporters.
	   Some 50 strike missions were flown by the carrier's F-14 and
F-18 planes and EA6 B's prowler aircraft.
	   ``The opposition were light and we had to take proper measures
to protect ourselves from their defenses,'' Dawson said, referring
to the Iraqi anti-aircraft guns and surface-to-air missiles.
	   Prior to the strike, pilots had carried our nearly 100 sorties
over the no-fly zone in southern Iraq on Wednesday.
	   ``We prepare for this deployment for months and months and we
were well prepared and we continue to improve our readiness,''
Dawson said.
	   Some 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired from U.S. Navy
ships during the strike.
	   During the daylight hours of Thursday, no aircraft took off for
missions. Everything was geared for the next possible attack.
	   But in the morning, some 2,000 marines from the amphibious
assault ship USS Belleau Wood conducted training exercises close to
the Kuwait border.
	   On Wednesday, they had practiced evacuating 50 American
civilians from the shore.
	   The U.S. Navy would not allow the carrier's position in the Gulf
to be published, but the ship was within easy striking range of
Iraq.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the strike after the U.N.
Special Commission reported that Iraq had failed to cooperate with
its inspectors, who are charged with overseeing the elimination of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

Serb police launch Kosovo sweep against KLA over Pec slayings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with total of 34 arrests claimed
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police who said they were hunting
for the murderers of six Kosovo Serbs attacked a suspected
rebel-controlled village Thursday, reportedly killing two ethnic
Albanian fighters and arresting 34 after a day-long battle.
	   The clash that began around dawn near Glodjane was one of the
biggest in months in Kosovo, where a wobbly October truce that has
held across most of the Serbian province is in increasing danger of
breaking down altogether.
	   International monitors who got near the western Kosovo village,
located 10 kilometers (six miles) south of the city of Pec, said
they heard shelling and heavy fighting.
	   ``It was war,'' said a European monitor who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   Police also sealed off a northwestern suburb of Pec as part of
the sweep. An armored personnel carrier and policemen wearing flak
jackets blocked a bridge leading to Kapesnica, and police snipers
looked down from surrounding rooftops.
	   ``We are in pursuit of the perpetrators of the shooting in the
Panda bar,'' a police commander said, referring to the bar where
the six young Serbs were slaughtered. He spoke on condition his
name not be used.
	   Monday's brutal shootings, carried out by masked gunmen who
riddled the Serb bar with automatic weapons fire, dangerously
fueled tensions in a province still reeling from over 1,000 deaths
in months of fighting this year between Serb forces and separatist
rebels.
	   Police told the Serb-run Media Center in Pristina that after
officers searching for suspects in Glodjane came under fire, police
killed two people wearing camouflage uniforms bearing the KLA
insignia and armed with assault rifles and mortars.
	   They said they arrested 34 people from a ``terrorist gang'' in
Glodjane and Kapesnica and discovered large quantities of arms,
ammunition and KLA uniforms.

Opposition leader launches campaign against Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>

elections; ADDS Barak head of Labor party graf 5 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ With early elections looming, opposition
leader Ehud Barak pushed social issues over security Thursday as he
launched his campaign against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   With U.S. President Bill Clinton's campaign strategist James
Carville at his side, Barak said he was ready for elections
expected in April.
	   Netanyahu said Wednesday he would call Israelis to the polls
early if he could not muster enough support for his hard-line peace
policies before a no-confidence motion in parliament Monday.
	   Netanyahu's coalition has been crumbling since he signed the
latest Mideast peace accord opposed by most of his Cabinet because
it calls for Israel to cede from war-captured West Bank land.
	   Barak, head of the dovish Labor party which reached historic
peace accords with the Palestinians in 1993, wants the accord
implemented to the letter and has rejected calls of support from
Netanyahu.
	   Barak accused Netanyahu of capitulating to his right-wing
coalition and freezing further Israeli troop withdrawals from the
West Bank. ``We are determined to put an end to yielding to
extremists,'' Barak said.
	   Barak promised that he would divert millions of dollars being
spent by the Netanyahu government on Jewish settlements in the West
Bank to domestic concerns such as education, health and ending
record-high unemployment.
	   He also pledged to cut government grants to yeshivas or Jewish
seminaries and to draft its students into military service like
other Israelis.
	   ``Education before settlements, job creation before yeshivas,''
Barak said.
	   Grabbing voters on social issues and the economy worked for
Carville in the 1992 and 1996 Clinton campaigns. In tiny Israel
however, security has always been the number one campaign issue and
candidates have usually left social issues on the back burner for
smaller parties to champion.
	   The Third Way, a moderate party in Netanyahu's coalition, said
Thursday it would vote against the premier on Monday and in favor
of new elections.
	   Barak, a former commander-in-chief of Israel's armed forces also
said Netanyahu's policies had harmed the strong strategic ties
between Israel and the United States, its closest ally.
	   Interviewed on Israel radio, Netanyahu said the peace process
was on hold because of continuous violations of the deal by the
Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu turned the debate away from social issues to security,
a topic which helped him win narrow election in 1996.
	   He challenged Barak to reveal how he would deal with a possible
declaration of statehood next year by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Palestinian claims over parts of Jerusalem.
	   ``I expect that all the members of parliament who are concerned
for the fate of the state, for the fate of Jerusalem, will rally to
support me,'' Netanyahu said in an interview with Israel radio.
	   In the 1996 election, Netanyahu used negative campaign messages
against then Prime Minister Shimon Peres whom he repeatedly called
soft on security and said was willing to give away parts of
Jerusalem to the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu's campaign was aided by Arthur Finkelstein, the U.S.
political guru who helped elect many republicans to office.
	   Barak recently employed Carville, pollster Stanley Greenberg and
media specialist Robert Strom, who helped elect Clinton, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.

Britain relaxes arms embargo against Argentina
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: combines urgent series, adds background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain on Thursday relaxed the arms embargo it
had imposed on Argentina after the Falklands War 16 years ago, but
stressed there was no change in its policy toward its South
Atlantic colony.
	   The Foreign Office said the British government remains committed
to defending the islands, which Argentina claims as its own.
	   However, it said, licenses for the export of weapons to
Argentina will now be granted on a case-by-case basis.
	   ``Licenses will only be granted for exports that we are
satisfied would not now, or in the foreseeable future, put at risk
the security of our overseas territories in the South Atlantic, or
our forces operating there,'' Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd
said.
	   Britain imposed a ban on the export of all arms and military
equipment to Argentina in April 1982 after the invasion of the
Falkland Islands by Argentine troops.
	   Lloyd said that such exports to Argentina now would be assessed
against Britain's national licensing criteria and the European
Union's Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.
	   ``This is a logical modernization of our export control
arrangements,'' he said. ``It reflects the changed circumstances
since the embargo was put in place.''
	   During the October visit to London of Argentinian President
Carlos Menem, Menem disavowed the use of force against the
Falklands.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair welcomed those remarks when the pair
held talks at Downing Street, and told Menem that Britain would
review its arms embargo in a positive light, mindful of security
considerations, the Foreign Office said.
	   Most of the 970 soldiers killed in the 74-day conflict off the
coast of Argentina were Argentines.
	   Argentina has since vowed to recover the islands, which it calls
the Malvinas, but by diplomatic means, not war. Argentina contends
the islands, 8,000 miles (12,900 km) from Britain, were usurped by
Britain in 1833.
	   Before his visit, Menem declared that the sparsely populated
islands are Argentina's ``inalienable right'' and urged Argentines
not to ``forget our historical responsibility nor our
constitutional mandate'' to reclaim them.
	   He has said he wants them returned to Argentina by 2000, but
that is unlikely. The islands' population of 2,200 is of British
descent and refuses any handover of the islands.

<TEXT>
	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	   -0-
	   Tages-Anzeiger, Zurich, Switzerland, on Clinton impeachment:
	   Americans tend to take things to the limits and live excess to
the full.
	   In their eyes, no political mistake is too great for the right
way out to be at the end of the tunnel.
	   As a result, Washington's politicians can see nothing funny in
the fact hundreds of them have spent 11 months obsessed with a sex
scandal in the White House.
	   Quite the opposite: the lawmakers, lawyers, professors and
commentators involved see it as their sacred duty to take part in
the search for truth in the ``William Jefferson Clinton'' case.
	   Meanwhile, the rest of the world worries about the U.S.
president's authority. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Frankfurter Rundschau, Frankfurt, Germany, on impeachment:
	   The people may want to condemn Clinton's personal conduct, but
they voted for him two times because they see their country in good
hands with him. An impeachment charge before the U.S. Senate would
therefore touch the very core of democracy: the fall of a president
_ even when it is comes constitutionally and formally secured _
represents the annulment of the voted will of the people. Such a
step can only be justified by grievous practices such as
endangering democracy, the state order, or national security.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on Clinton impeachment:
	   On the one hand, the Republican majority, knowing full well that
there are not enough votes in the Senate to convict the President,
seems bent on humiliating him. On the other, Mr. Clinton, buoyed by
opinion polls showing two-thirds of the public opposing
impeachment, has refused to resign. Barring a last-minute deal, it
looks like the U.S. is about to condemn itself to a Senate trial
that may last as long as six months. ... As the world tries
desperately to avoid an economic slump, its sole remaining
superpower will treat itself to a semen-stained dress, scratchy
tape-recordings of two not particularly brainy women talking about
the `Big Creep,' and grainy video clips of the `Big Creep' himself
squirming in his seat as he parses impenetrable definitions of
sexual acts. ... The Dow may melt in the meantime, the dollar may
sink, and millions of Indonesians and Russians may be starving, but
the Senate will devote itself to adding a new chapter to the Kama
Sutra. Is this for real?
	    &UR; ___
	   The Daily Telegraph, London, on President Clinton's Mideast
visit:
	   American diplomacy is essential to the search for peace between
Arab and Israel. However, it is doubtful whether Bill Clinton's
level of involvement in that process over the past few months has
been wise. During the Wye River negotiations in October he devoted
more than 70 hours to persuading Benjamin Netanyahu to give up land
in return for security guarantees from Yasser Arafat. The
agreement, reached after nine days of talks, stipulated that the
American president should visit the region to promote
implementation of its terms. Yesterday he left for home with the
two protagonists still at each other's throats, the Israelis saying
that not enough had been done to warrant a further troop
withdrawal, the Palestinians countering that the other side was
bent on wrecking Wye. ...
	   Thus, Mr. Clinton has left the region with the situation as
fraught as ever. ...
	   It was partly for domestic political considerations that Mr.
Clinton, facing Congressional elections under a cloud of
impeachment, became so deeply involved in the Wye negotiations. His
calculations backfired. ... A superpower's prestige has thereby
been diminished.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Guardian, London, on President Clinton's Mideast visit:
	   The United States this week recognized the independent state of
Palestine. That is the historic significance of President Clinton's
visit to Gaza. In his speeches, Clinton stressed self determination
and liberty, in a context which left no doubt that he was speaking
of the right of Palestinians to have a state of their own. But it
was by his presence above all that he conferred on the Palestinians
a recognition that has been a long time coming. Fifty years coming
in fact. Half a century ago American statesmen and diplomats were
making the decisions which tied the United States so closely to
Israel that the claims of the people the Israelis had displaced and
defeated were from then on to take second place, when they were not
forgotten entirely, in the American understanding of the Middle
East and its problems. America's movement toward a more balanced
policy, not slighting Israel's security but dealing fairly with
Arab and Palestinian concerns, has been slow and hesitant. A true
balance has hardly yet been achieved, but Clinton's trip is still
an important marker. ... But the question now, as the Clinton trip
has underlined, is not whether there will be a state, but what kind
of state it will be.

<TEXT>
	   The Financial Times, London, on British's place in Europe:
	   The newly robust stance adopted by Tony Blair in defense of
Britain's place in Europe is wholly welcome if somewhat belated.
Britain's debate has been conduced for far too long on terms set by
the Euroskeptics _ terms which see the Union as a wicked foreign
conspiracy to do the nation down.
	   By forcefully asserting the fundamental national interests _
political and economic _ which bind Britain to its continental
European partners, Mr. Blair is stepping out of the shadow of his
previous timidity. ... The prime minister's further acknowledgment
that there are areas in which both Britain and Europe can benefit
from closer integration is similarly refreshing. Too many British
prime ministers have failed to understand that integration is a
continuing process rather than a random series of isolated events.
	    &UR; ___
	   Liberation, Paris, on the far-right National Front party:
	   There are two ways to assess the consequences of the National
Front crisis.
	   On a political level, there is no doubt that the party of
xenophobia will suffer. The ``civil war'' has triggered a
formidable outpouring. The old leader has been stung, the young has
been ridiculed. Division inside the party heralds its weakening. As
the third party in elections, the party has played a role very
harmful to French democracy.
	   But on a social level, one should refrain from hasty optimism.
The National Front is not only a political evil, it is also a
social symptom. And on that score, the bitter feuding between its
two leaders won't alter anything. Anguish and bitterness, the basis
of the National Front's success, will remain. These symptoms can
only be addressed by a long drawn out plan to fight the rift inside
society. That's not an easy task.
	   Leaders are bitterly fighting. But voters could remain the same.
Beware: unified or divided, the far right is far from dead.
	    &UR; ___
	   Yomiuri Shimbun, Tokyo, on Olympics site nomination:
	   The Japanese Cabinet has approved a drive to bring the 2008
Summer Olympic Games to Osaka city.
	   Since the government has announced it supports the bid, a
nationwide committee will be set up in January to bring the
Olympics to Osaka. The committee will include representatives from
the Osaka prefectural and city governments and from the Japan
Olympic Committee (JOC).
	   The committee will soon launch a campaign to appeal to the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2001, which will decide
the site of the games.
	   Osaka will compete with about 10 cities, such as Beijing and
Toronto, where they have already announced their bids to host the
2008 Olympics. Paris also has indicated it wants to host the games.
	   Japan has hosted the Winter and Summer Olympic games three times
_ in Tokyo, Sapporo and Nagano. Its management and capacity for
organization have been highly appreciated internationally.
	   Using such past experiences, we hope Osaka will appeal to the
world to demonstrate the advantages and significance of holding the
games in Osaka, and do so fairly. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on Clinton's Mideast visit:
	   It looked like statehood; It sounded like statehood. It even
felt like statehood when U.S. President Bill Clinton addressed the
Palestinian National Council following its cancellation of
``anti-Israel'' clauses in the Palestinian National Charter.
	   The overwhelming support of the PNC for the revision of the
charter _ only a few dozen of 900 present remained seated during
the vote _ should send a strong message to Israel. The majority of
Palestinians, young and old alike, believe that the path of peace
is in the best interests of their future generations and the region
as a whole.
	   But on both banks of the Jordan River, all parties must be
wondering: is Israel receiving the messages that its peace partners
are sending.
	   It's an all too familiar story of no give and all take.
	   However, it is too difficult to remain uninspired by yesterday's
events in Gaza itself, so Jordanians encourage their Palestinian
brethren to stay the course in the best of faith. But they still
demand that Israel do the right thing, not the least of which is to
recognize yesterday's message.

Kuwaitis believe Americans have missed the target _ Saddam
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwaitis want more than punishing strikes against
Iraq. They want the United States to target Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, who invaded their country eight years ago and occupied it
for seven months.
	   ``This strike is nothing more than a discipline operation,''
said newspaper columnist Hassan al-Issa said.
	   ``He will behave for a month or two, then what?'' he said.
	   ``We want more of this, and we want it aimed at him,'' said
Saleh Nasser, a 34-year-old civil servant, referring to Saddam.
	   Like many Kuwaitis, al-Issa and Nasser stayed up until the early
morning watching television news reports about the U.S. attack on
Iraq.
	   Despite the high interest, there has been no panic or serious
fear of an Iraqi retaliatory attack on this small oil-rich state
and American ally.
	   Sea front cafes were packed Thursday and it was business as
usual in shopping malls.
	   While denouncing the Iraqi regime, most Kuwaitis sympathize with
the Iraqi people and understand their plight because they
experienced life under Saddam's oppressive rule after Iraqi forces
invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
	   During the occupation, Iraqi troops systematically looted the
country _ plundering medical equipment, printing presses and even
street lights. An estimated 300 Kuwaitis died. Hundreds of others
were rounded up _ and Kuwait claims they still are being held in
Iraqi jails. Iraq denies the charge.
	   Unlike previous standoffs, the Kuwaiti government distanced
itself from the showdown between Iraq and U.N. inspectors that
sparked the overnight attacks.
	   Kuwait is trying to avoid giving the Iraqi government an excuse
for retaliatory attacks, especially as it hosts American and
British forces in line with the defense agreements it signed with
the western allies after the Gulf War.
	   The United States is Kuwait's largest trading partner, exporting
more than dlrs 1 billion a year to the emirate.
	   Columnist al-Issa said he had no hope that Saddam Hussein would
be toppled in the near future.
	   ``Things will stay the way they are, and maybe at the end they
will have to negotiate with Saddam Hussein,'' he said.

UNDATED: yesterday's message.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, on Clinton impeachment:
	   Others have said it, and it is so true: Bill Clinton has found
it impossible simultaneously to uphold the law (including his oath
of office) and remain in power.
	   His abuses extend from meticulous violations of campaign finance
law to misuse of government agencies and resources in order to
shred the reputations of both political foes and former lovers.
	   Yet, just one of his trysts triggered the self-induced political
crisis he now faces. An on-the-job dalliance with an intern led to
deliberate lies _ and the falsehoods of others who believed his
protestations of innocence. He stands, in the House Judiciary
Committee's four articles of impeachment, guilty in the court of
public opinion, a man uniquely capable of lying with conviction.
...
	   More than ever, America needs leaders who will stand for
righteousness.
	   The rule of law should apply to everyone _ including this
corrupt and unethical president. For high crimes and misdemeanors,
the U.S. House of Representatives should impeach Bill Clinton. The
U.S. Senate will determine whether he can continue in office.
	    &UR; ___
	   Statesman Journal, Salem, Oregon, on Clinton impeachment:
	   As appalling as Bill Clinton's offenses are, they don't meet the
high constitutional standards for impeaching a president. To treat
impeachment as a vehicle for giving a president his comeuppance is
to make a mockery of our Constitution.
	   Nor is impeachment _ an ``indictment'' by the House of
Representatives requiring the president to stand trial before the
U.S Senate _ in the best interest of the country. Clinton's place
in historical infamy already is secure. Consequently, impeachment
would cause greater harm to the presidency than to the president.
	   Impeachment is such a monumental step that it should only be
undertaken with overwhelming, bipartisan support. That isn't the
case. The Judiciary Committee hearings were directed at swaying 20
to 30 moderate lawmakers, mostly Republicans, out of 435 House
members. Unlike Watergate, which was far more clear-cut, this
investigation is so partisan that these few moderates hold the key
to Clinton's fate.
	   Clinton, like accomplice-turned-witness Monica Lewinsky, is a
liar and a cheat.
	   Censure him. Punish him. Demand a full accounting of his
wrongdoing.
	   But don't send the country into the abyss of impeachment.
	    &UR; ___
	   Los Angeles Times, on Clinton impeachment:
	   ... It's come down to this: Clinton lied. He ought to say so. He
lied pretty much every time he had a chance. Clinton said Sunday
and again Monday night that he did not commit perjury. In a
technically legal sense, he may be right. But that is beside the
point. For a man who has shown himself to be a brilliant
politician, his lawyerly evasions have never masked his lies.
Americans saw them clearly. But because most Americans possess
something that many in Washington lack _ a sense of proportion and
context _ voter backlash in November awaited the dragging out of
prurient details from the Kenneth Starr investigation. Voters
thought they had sent a message of sorts, not only in the polls but
in the midterm elections: We don't condone Clinton's dishonest,
boorish behavior, and he should pay a price for it _ but removal
from office is too high a price for the country. ...
	   Clinton won't admit to perjury, and the Republican leaders in
the House say they won't consider censure, only impeachment. ...
	   Some form of rebuke, short of impeachment, is what Americans
want. The Constitution does not forbid it. The House leadership has
no right to preclude it. While many supporters of impeachment have
sanctimoniously worried about the precedent of a censure, what they
ought to worry about is the precedent of impeaching a president
who, outside the Beltway, maintains popular support, in this
country and abroad. A Capitol so out of step with the people it
claims to represent, one so easily whipsawed by a group of small
but vocal extremists, is a greater danger to the Republic than all
of Bill Clinton's selfish lies. ...

Norwegian passenger train derails, injuring eight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Three cars of a passenger train derailed in
a remote area of central Norway on Thursday, injuring eight people,
the railroad said.
	   The Norwegian state railroad NSB said the seven-car train was
headed south from the town of Bodoe to the city of Trondheim when
the cars derailed.
	   NSB spokesman Arvid Baardstu said all of the injured had been
brought to a local hospital and that their injuries ranged from
shock to broken bones. He said the rest of nearly 200 passengers
were being brought out by bus.
	   ``We had some luck because it turned out that there was a road
nearby,'' Baardstu said by telephone.
	   Baardstu said the train derailed because heavy rains swelled a
small creek and eroded the railroad bed.

Georgia, Abkhazia, Russia discuss border troops changeover
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SUKHUMI, Georgia (AP) _ The breakaway province of Abkhazia on
Thursday urged Russian troops to keep guarding its borders, despite
Georgia's plan to take over the border patrols.
	   Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba met with the Russian and
Georgian border troops commanders, Konstantin Totsky and Valery
Chkheidze, in the capital of the breakaway republic on Thursday to
discuss the dispute.
	   For the past several years, Russian forces have patrolled
Georgia's borders, including stretches claimed by Abkhazia.
However, Russia has been pulling troops out under a November
agreement that calls for Georgian troops to take over.
	   Abkhazia opposes the withdrawal plan and says the changeover
will strengthen Georgian control over the region and could
intensify the conflict with Georgia.
	   ``The agreement ... concerns only Georgia and Russia, and has no
relation to Abkhazia, because it is an independent state,''
Ardzinba said.
	   The Abkhazian leader also warned that a withdrawal of troops
``can provoke a serious conflict'' between Georgia and Abkhazia.
	   He called for Russia to make a separate agreement with Abkhazia
to keep up the border guard, and proposed sharing the expenses with
Moscow.
	   Totsky said Ardzinba's opinion ``should be taken into account''
by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze, who will decide the issue.
	   A spokesman for Georgia's border service quoted Chkheidze as
saying that while talks should continue, Abkhazia ``should finally
understand that the world community, the United Nations, regard
Abkhazia as part of Georgia.''
	   Chkheidze also said that Abkhazians could patrol their own
borders but only if Georgia oversaw the work, according to
spokesman Dzhemal Aloshvili.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwestern Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. Separatists drove out Georgian troops and
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war.

``can provoke a serious conflict'' between Georgia and Abkhazia.
	   He called for Russia to make a separate agreement with Abkhazia
to keep up the border guard, and proposed sharing the expenses with
Moscow.
	   Totsky said Ardzinba's opinion ``should be taken into account''
by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze, who will decide the issue.
	   A spokesman for Georgia's border service quoted Chkheidze as
saying that while talks should continue, Abkhazia ``should finally
understand that the world community, the United Nations, regard
Abkhazia as part of Georgia.''
	   Chkheidze also said that Abkhazians could patrol their own
borders but only if Georgia oversaw the work, according to
spokesman Dzhemal Aloshvili.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwestern Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. Separatists drove out Georgian troops and
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war.

Marketing agent seeks to clear name in Olympic scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A marketing agent who has been linked to the
Olympic bribery scandal denied any wrongdoing Thursday and offered
to collaborate with IOC investigators to clear his name.
	   Goran Takac, who has worked on Olympic bids for more than 20
years, defended his activities in the wake of the corruption
allegations leveled by senior IOC executive Marc Hodler.
	   Takac runs the IMS-Studio 6 agency, which is based in Lausanne,
Switzerland, home of the International Olympic Committee. His
father, Arthur Takac, is a longtime IOC adviser.
	   Hodler alleged last weekend that four ``agents'' _ including an
IOC member _ have been involved in demanding payment to secure IOC
votes for cities bidding for the Olympics.
	   Hodler claimed the ``most detested agent'' lived in Lausanne.
	   ``In the last two days, my name has been mentioned a lot,''
Goran Takac told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
``We feel we have to react. We have to clean our name.''
	   Takac said he had contacted IOC vice president Dick Pound and
director general Francois Carrard to explain his position.
	   ``We are willing and completely ready to cooperate, to open all
our files, to show exactly what we were doing,'' Takac said. ``We
are for full transparency. We, as the agency, and I personally, do
not feel in any way concerned by the allegations.''
	   Pound is leading a high-level investigation into the Salt Lake
City scholarship fund which set off the biggest corruption crisis
in the IOC's 104-year history.
	   The relatives of six IOC members were among those who benefited
from nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarship aid made by Salt Lake City
during its successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
	   Takac said his agency was not involved in the Salt Lake bid but
that he sent a letter to Pound offering to put ``all our knowledge
and documentation at the disposal of the commission.''
	   Takac, who was born in Yugoslavia and is now a Swiss citizen,
said his company was formed in 1976 and acts as a ``professional
marketing and communications agency.'' It has 10 employees in
Lausanne and 18 in Belgrade.
	   Takac said the company produces promotional material, posters,
pins, graphic designs and other services for Olympic candidate
cities.
	   ``We have behind us 22 years of very high professional
activity,'' he said from Belgrade. ``My people are concerned about
that. Our telephone has been ringing for two days. Our clients are
asking questions. It takes a long time to build up a reputation and
a short time to destroy it. We have to react.''
	   Takac said his agency had promoted, among others, failed bids
from Athens, Greece; Sochi and St. Petersburg, Russia; Sofia,
Bulgaria; and Tashkent, Uzbekistan.
	   ``You can notice that Sochi and St. Petersburg were eliminated
before the final,'' he said. ``If we were involved in buying the
votes, I think we would buy a little better.''
	   Takac insisted that his agency has never approached bidding
cities, saying it's been the other way around.
	   In addition to working with bid cities, Takac said his company
is the official marketing agency for the Russian Olympic Committee.
It also signed recent deals with the amateur boxing and modern
pentathlon federations.
	   Takac said he has known Hodler for 30 years.
	   ``He is a very respectable, very honest, very straight man,''
Takac said. ``Certainly he had a very sound reason to talk about
(corruption). Whether the reason is right is a different story.
There are a lot of rumors. He started to talk about that.''
	   Takac said he was unaware of any bribery in Olympic bidding but
didn't rule out that it exists.
	   ``When you have so many people involved, so much money involved,
I guess it's normal that somewhere there are some dark spots,'' he
said.
	   ``If there are some people going around and offering services
where they have only a phone number and fax number, then we are the
first to say that has to be clarified,'' he added.
	   Takac said his activities are independent from those of his
82-year-old father, who has been associated with the IOC for more
than 30 years.
	   IOC director general Francois Carrard said the elder Takac is an
adviser and consultant on ``technical matters'' for the
organization. Among other things, he helps organize smaller
regional competitions such as the Mediterranean Games.
	   Carrard said the younger Takac worked in promotional activities
for the IOC in the 1980s. He ended that role after Carrard cited
the possible conflict of Takac working for bid cities while his
father was an IOC adviser.
	   Goran Takac has maintained links with the IOC, however. He
produces the official book on each Olympic Games and runs the IOC
contest for best Olympic photographs.
	   ``We have a relationship with the father,'' Carrard told the AP.
``Nothing in this relationship would lead us to believe there is
any improper behavior of the father. As far as the son, since we
don't have any direct relations, we have no way to know exactly
what he's doing.''

Appeal court acquits six Iraqi hijackers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 9th graf with hijackers not being released immediately &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Appeal judges Thursday acquitted six Iraqi
hijackers jailed for commandeering a Sudanese passenger jet with
fake hand grenades, saying the men acted out of fear of Saddam
Hussein's regime.
	   The men, who commandeered a Sudan Airways plane bound from
Khartoum to Jordan and forced the pilot to fly to London, were
convicted in November 1997 by English jurors who nevertheless said
they felt sorry for them.
	   The judge at their trial, Sir Michael Wright, said he accepted
that the Iraqis _ exiles in Sudan _ were terrified of Saddam.
	   But Wright ruled that to claim they acted ``under duress,'' a
legal defense, the hijacking needed to be in response to an
immediate threat.
	   Three appeal judges, however, likened the plight of the Iraqis
to that of Anne Frank, the famed young Jewish diarist who hid from
the Nazis in Amsterdam in World War II.
	   ``If Anne Frank had stolen a car to escape from Amsterdam and
had been charged with theft, the tenets of English law would not
have denied her the defense of duress of circumstances on the
ground that she should have awaited the Gestapo's knock at the
door,'' Lord Justice Christopher Rose said.
	   The appeal judges refused a request from prosecutors for a
retrial.
	   The Iraqis, Shiite Muslims from southern Iraq, now can apply for
political asylum, but will not be released from custody until the
Home Office can interview them about their applications.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Rescue crew digging through the rubble of a
collapsed apartment house found six more bodies Thursday, raising
the total number of dead to 26.
	   Despite nightfall, the search continued for five more residents
believed buried under the rubble. But hope of finding any survivors
more than 40 hours hours after the collapse was virtually nil.
	   The building, in the middle-class Portuense neighborhood, a
district about 6 kilometers (3 1/2 miles) from central Piazza
Venezia, collapsed during the night Wednesday.
	   Investigators were trying to determine what caused the collapse.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Dozens of students launched a second
hunger strike Thursday, escalating tensions hours after police
broke up their initial protest.
	   Early Thursday, Albanian authorities ordered police to force a
group of students to end a week-long hunger strike after one of the
participants was diagnosed with hepatitis C, officials said.
	   ``We intervened in the hunger strike because we had information
that terrorist acts against the students had been planned,'' said
Prime Minister Pandeli Majko in a statement.
	   ``We also decided to intervene to safeguard their lives,'' after
one student was diagnosed with hepatitis C, he said, adding that no
force was used against the students.
	   At 4:00 a.m. local time (0300GMT), police forced about 40
students from Tirana and Skodra universities to end their protest,
demanding better learning conditions and higher scholarships.
	   But up to 30 students returned later in the day to continue the
strike in a disco in the Tirana dormitory complex. Police had
blocked off the entrance to the disco and were not permitting
anyone to enter, but later dispersed.
	   Despite a recent government pledge to invest about dlrs 70,000
towards improving the conditions in the dormitories, known
informally as Student City, the students refused to end their
protest.
	   According to the Information Ministry, the 20-year-old son of
Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha is believed to be a key member
behind the group organizing the hunger strikes.
	   On Thursday, the Democratic leader gathered thousands of
supporters in the capital's central Skanderbeg square, calling for
support of the students and their demands.
	   ``Now I am determined more than ever to defend the Albanian
ideal and the ideals of democracy,'' he told supporters at a rally.
From the rally, Berisha led the group to the dormitory complex,
where they shouted support for the students and called for Majko's
resignation.
	   ``This is the day of the student's victory over the criminal
government,'' Berisha said. The leader of the pro-Berisha Student
Union, Shkelzen Margjeka, said the hunger strike would continue
until Majko steps down.
	   Student boycotts and hunger strikes have played an important
political role in Albania in recent years. In 1991, student
protesters were instrumental in forcing Albania's last communist
leader to call multi-party elections, and the spread of organized
student protests significantly increased pressure on the
government.
	   Majko himself got started in politics as a student leader.
	   A hunger strike by students in the southern town of Vlora
preceded the failure of the government of Sali Berisha, who was
president of the country from 1992 to 1997. His government lost
power after pyramid schemes collapsed, creating anarchy and chaos.

	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police who said they were hunting
for the murderers of six Kosovo Serbs attacked a suspected
rebel-controlled village Thursday, reportedly killing two ethnic
Albanian fighters and arresting 34 after a day-long battle.
	   The clash that began around dawn near Glodjane was one of the
biggest in months in Kosovo, where a wobbly October truce that has
held across most of the Serbian province is in increasing danger of
breaking down altogether.
	   International monitors who got near the western Kosovo village,
located 10 kilometers (six miles) south of the city of Pec, said
they heard shelling and heavy fighting.
	   ``It was war,'' said a European monitor who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   Police also sealed off a northwestern suburb of Pec as part of
the sweep. An armored personnel carrier and policemen wearing flak
jackets blocked a bridge leading to Kapesnica, and police snipers
looked down from surrounding rooftops.
	   ``We are in pursuit of the perpetrators of the shooting in the
Panda bar,'' a police commander said, referring to the bar where
the six young Serbs were slaughtered. He spoke on condition his
name not be used.
	   Monday's shootings, carried out by masked gunmen, dangerously
fueled tensions in a province still reeling from more than 1,000
deaths in months of fighting this year between Serb forces and
separatist rebels.
	   Police told the Serb-run Media Center in Pristina that after
officers searching for suspects in Glodjane came under fire, police
killed two people wearing camouflage uniforms bearing the KLA
insignia and armed with assault rifles and mortars.
	   They said they arrested 34 people from a ``terrorist gang'' in
Glodjane and Kapesnica and discovered large quantities of arms,
ammunition and KLA uniforms.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ It was a fleeting romance.
	   Thousands of Palestinians enraged by Bill Clinton's decision to
bomb Iraq chanted ``Death to America'' on Thursday and burned the
very U.S. flags they had waved when the U.S. president visited the
West Bank and Gaza Strip just three days earlier.
	   In three West Bank towns, marchers threw stones at Israeli
soldiers who fired rubber-coated steel pellets. In one
confrontation outside Ramallah, a 20-year-old Palestinian, Mohammed
Daoud, was killed and 16 others were injured by Israeli fire.
	   ``This is only the beginning,'' said one of the protesters,
Maher Hilmi. Expressing a view widely held by Palestinians, Hilmi
said Clinton attacked Iraq to delay the impeachment vote in
connection with the Monica Lewinsky affair. ``This is all because
of Monica, because of an immoral man,'' he said.

Second busload of German tourists robbed in Jamaica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Two masked men robbed a busload of
German tourists near the Jamaican resort area of Montego Bay, the
second such holdup in three weeks.
	   The bus was carrying 14 people to a local rafting attraction
owned by Tourism Minister Francis Tulloch when it was forced to
stop because of boulders in the road, police said.
	   The two men, one carrying a gun and the other with a knife,
forced their way into the bus and instructed the tourists to hand
over their wallets, jewelry and cameras.
	   No one was hurt during the hold-up, police said.
	   On Nov. 25, three men held up a bus carrying 18 German tourists
in the northern parish of Portland as they stopped to take
pictures. The robbers made off with dlrs 5,000, cameras and
jewelry.
	   Police are investigating whether the two robberies are linked,
said National Security and Justice Minister Keith Knight. He urged
Jamaicans with information about the robbery to approach police.
	   ``Every Jamaican must see it as his or her responsibility to
ensure that there not a third occurrence,'' Knight said.
	   German officials doubt Germans were singled out for the
robberies and do not plan to issue warnings to tourists apart from
the anti-crime tips given to all incoming visitors, said acting
consul Robert Mueller.
	   ``We know tourists can be victims of crime, so they just have to
be careful,'' Mueller said. ``There are no plans to issue any
additional travel advisories ... the two incidents have done
nothing to change our attitude.''
	   Because of recent advertising campaigns, tourism from Germany is
up 31 percent over last year, tourism officials say. Between 36,000
and 37,000 Germans have visited Jamaica in the last 10 months.

Serb police launch Kosovo sweep against rebels over Pec slayings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police attacked a suspected
rebel-controlled village in Kosovo on Thursday, reportedly killing
two ethnic Albanian fighters and arresting 34 in one of the worst
battles in months in the separatist province.
	   Serb forces said they had launched the assault to hunt for the
killers of six Kosovo Serbs slain in a bar earlier this week in the
city of Pec, 45 miles west of the province's capital, Pristina.
	   The daylong clash began at dawn near the western village of
Glodjane, six miles south of Pec. International monitors nearby
could hear shelling and heavy fighting.
	   ``It was war,'' said one European monitor, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Monday's brutal shootings, carried out by masked gunmen who
riddled the Serb bar with automatic weapons fire, fueled tensions
in a province still reeling from over 1,000 deaths this year in
months of fighting between Serb forces and separatist rebels.
	   In a separate clash Monday, 36 rebels were killed by Serb
forces.
	   Police also sealed off Kapesnica, a northwestern suburb of Pec,
as part of Thursday's military operation. An armored personnel
carrier and policemen wearing flak jackets blocked a bridge leading
to Kapesnica, and police snipers looked down from surrounding
rooftops.
	   ``We are in pursuit of the perpetrators of the shooting in the
Panda bar,'' a police commander said, referring to the bar where
the six young Serbs were slaughtered.
	   The political representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army has
denied rebel involvement in Monday's bar attack. The rebels are
fighting to drive Serb police out of Kosovo and break the province
away from Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   But Serb authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas for the
barroom slaughter and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged
this week to arrest the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   Police told the Serb-run Media Center that officers searching
for suspects in Glodjane came under fire, then police killed two
people wearing KLA insignia and armed with assault rifles and
mortars. Police said they arrested 34 people and discovered large
quantities of arms, ammunition and KLA uniforms.
	   The international Kosovo Verification Mission sent several
monitoring teams to the area, and American and other officials held
talks with Serbian police in an unsuccessful attempt to calm the
situation.
	   In a sharply worded commentary, the state-run Borba daily called
Thursday for the withdrawal of international verifiers and U.S.
envoys from Kosovo, saying they are ``direct instigators and
helpers of the crimes committed by Albanian terrorists.''
	   Serbs held a protest rally over the killings for a second day
Thursday, this time in front of the headquarters of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs the
verifying force.
	   About 300 Serbs booed and whistled derisively, demanding an
immediate meeting with mission chief William Walker. The American
diplomat said he would meet with them Friday.
	   Protesters complain that the international verifiers are failing
to ease tensions and have not responded sufficiently to the Pec
killings.
	   The killings have cast further gloom over stalled diplomatic
efforts to resolve the Serb-Albanian standoff in Kosovo.
	   Serbian authorities are willing to grant only limited autonomy
for Kosovo, while most in the overwhelmingly Albanian-populated
province want independence from Serbia.
	   Also Thursday, Serbia announced a media crackdown in Kosovo,
warning the province's ethnic Albanian newspapers to cease support
for ``terrorism'' or face legal charges.

Report: Russia and Belarus agree to trade gas for food
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Belarus may supply Russia with food to help pay
off large Belarusian debts for Russian gas, a news report said
Thursday.
	   Belarus has been suffering from food shortages for months, and
has introduced food rationing in some regions.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Belarusian Prime
Minister Sergei Ling signed an agreement Thursday on paying off the
gas debt, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Sources in the Belarusian delegation told Interfax that the
agreement foresees that Belarus will supply Russia with food in
exchange for writing off dlrs 200 million of the debt. Ling said in
August that the total debt to Russia's gas monopoly Gazprom was
dlrs 250 million.
	   Ling was visiting Moscow with Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko, who was pushing one of his favorite projects, a closer
union with Russia.

U.S. carrier readies itself for possible second strike on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY ADNAN MALIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ Sailors aboard this carrier
loaded thousands of pounds (kilos) of laser-guided weapons on
warplanes Thursday in preparation for a possible second strike on
Iraq.
	   At least 200 crew were on the flight deck preparing planes for
unspecified missions.
	   Motivation was high after Wednesday night's bombing raids on
Iraq.
	   ``It was a long night for us, but it was the night in which all
the aircraft air crews returned successfully and safely.'' Rear
Adm. James Cutler Dawson Jr. told reporters.
	   Some 50 strike missions were flown by the carrier's F-14 and
F-18 planes and EA6 B's prowler aircraft.
	   ``The opposition were light and we had to take proper measures
to protect ourselves from their defenses,'' Dawson said, referring
to the Iraqi anti-aircraft guns and surface-to-air missiles.
	   Prior to the strike, pilots had carried our nearly 100 sorties
over the no-fly zone in southern Iraq on Wednesday.
	   ``We prepare for this deployment for months and months and we
were well prepared and we continue to improve our readiness,''
Dawson said.
	   Some 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired from U.S. Navy
ships during the strike.
	   During the daylight hours of Thursday, no aircraft took off for
missions. Everything was geared for the next possible attack.
	   But in the morning, some 2,000 marines from the amphibious
assault ship USS Belleau Wood conducted training exercises close to
the Kuwait border.
	   On Wednesday, they had practiced evacuating 50 American
civilians from the shore.
	   The U.S. Navy would not allow the carrier's position in the Gulf
to be published. The ship could easily strike Iraq.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the strike after the U.N.
Special Commission reported that Iraq had failed to cooperate with
its inspectors, who are charged with overseeing the elimination of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ After six hours of early morning missile
attacks, Baghdad's people heard wailing air raid sirens Thursday as
Iraqi officials anticipated another strike by the United States.
But the sirens proved to be false alarms.
	   Aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf, sailors
loaded thousands of pounds of laser-guided weapons on warplanes in
preparation for an expected second attack on the Iraqi capital
Thursday night.
	   Despite urging by Russia and China for a halt to the attacks,
U.S. President Bill Clinton suggested the strikes would continue.
Pentagon officials said in Washington that planes had taken off for
a second wave of attacks Thursday night.
	   The full extent of damage and casualties from the hundreds of
missiles fired in the early morning hours Thursday was unclear.
Foreign reporters in Baghdad are based in a government press center
and cannot move around the sprawling city of 5 million without
official escorts.
	   An Iraqi doctor reported five people killed and 30 wounded.
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf referred to ``heavy
casualties'' in civilian areas of Baghdad, but declined to give
specific figures.
	   In Washington, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said headquarters of Iraq's special forces and
military intelligence were leveled by sea-launched Tomahawk cruise
missiles.
	   Clinton, meeting in the Oval Office with top military and
foreign policy advisers Thursday morning, expressed regret that
there would inevitably be ``unintended casualties.''
	   The American president said Wednesday he ordered ``Operation
Desert Fox'' to prevent Iraq from building the chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons it was prohibited from having under U.N.
resolutions after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Clinton pledged the attacks would be ``sustained'' to end Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's threat to neighboring Gulf states.
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said Thursday: ``This
operation is not completed.''
	   In one sign of fear of renewed attack, Baghdad residents lined
up at gas stations to stock up on fuel, a sign that more attacks
were expected.
	   ``We are expecting the worst of Clinton because we have
discovered that he has no humanitarian principles,'' said Riad
Mamdouh al-Samarai, 36, at one filling station.
	   Despite the threat more missiles, many people went about their
normal routines Thursday _ government workers showed up at their
offices and children at schools _ and some gave a show of defiance.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
Salam Mohammed, 34, mumbled from a bed in Baghdad's al-Yarmouk
Hospital bed, his face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Air raid sirens sounded repeatedly in Baghdad Thursday afternoon
and evening. One went off as al-Sahhaf was holding a news
conference to accuse the United States and Britain of committing
crimes against the Iraqi people.
	   Britain had lent its support to the U.S. attack Thursday
morning, but did not take part. Al-Sahhaf accused both nations of
lying in claiming that the report of the U.N. chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler proved Iraq had not cooperated in the
search for its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This aggression against Iraq is a crime against international
law, the U.N. charter, and we will hold our full right to hold them
responsible _ the Americans and British _ for all the crimes they
are committing against our people,'' al-Sahhaf told the news
conference.
	   He said inspection teams had carried out visits to 427 sites
since the last stand-off over weapons inspections in mid-November
and there had been only five cases of non-cooperation.
	   The inspectors have the job of certifying Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step before the U.N.
Security Council will lift damaging trade sanctions imposed on Iraq
for its invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf said the five sites that caused trouble did not
justify ``a dangerous crime against the people of Iraq.''
	   One proposed visit was to an office of Iraq's ruling Baath
Party, he said. Two others were a problem because they occurred on
Friday, the Muslim day of worship when most people are not working,
al-Sahhaf said.
	   In one case, he said, the inspectors tried to visit a former
office of a security official that had been changed into a guest
house. He said inspectors were delayed for 45 minutes in entering
the building as Iraqi authorities tried to explain the change.
	   ``Do you deserve to be bombarded because you have delayed an
inspection team 45 minutes?'' al-Sahhaf asked.
	   Al-Sahhaf also listed examples of targets struck in the American
attack, including factories and the headquarters of the security
police and military intelligence.
	   He said the two headquarters have been inspected more than once
by U.N. arms experts and many of the factories had U.N. cameras as
part of permanent monitoring of potential weapons sites.
	   The minister said that instead of calling their campaign
Operation Desert Fox, the allies should have named it ``Operation
Villains in the Arabian Desert.''
	   In the Thursday morning's attacks, the warships fired more than
200 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck
Iraqi air defense radars, Pentagon officials said.
	   Saddam visited some of the targeted sites Thursday, including
the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad Radio reported. Hala, the
youngest of his three daughters, was safe, but the house was
demolished, it said.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in a radio address,
saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face'' but
``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known at the time
of the attack.
	   Witnesses said another missile landed in the neighborhood of
al-Adil, about two kilometers (one mile) from a sprawling military
camp and radio relay stations.
	   Iraqi officials took foreign reporters to Karada, an upscale
commercial and residential neighborhood where a missile landed. The
blast burst water mains in a street, flooding a two-kilometer
(one-mile) stretch of the roadway.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.

 &UR; Palestinian Authority caught in dilemma after U.S. attack on Iraq
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout, INCORPORATES Israel-Iraq; ADDS new quote
from Palestinian demonstrator. &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ It was a fleeting romance.
	   Thousands of Palestinians enraged by Bill Clinton's decision to
bomb Iraq chanted ``Death to America'' on Thursday and burned the
very U.S. flags they had waved when the U.S. president visited the
West Bank and Gaza Strip just three days earlier.
	   In three West Bank towns, marchers threw stones at Israeli
soldiers who fired rubber-coated steel pellets. In one
confrontation outside Ramallah, a 20-year-old Palestinian, Mohammed
Daoud, was killed and 16 others were injured by Israeli fire.
	   ``This is only the beginning,'' said one of the protesters,
Maher Hilmi. Expressing a view widely held by Palestinians, Hilmi
said Clinton attacked Iraq to delay the impeachment vote in
connection with the Monica Lewinsky affair. ``This is all because
of Monica, because of an immoral man,'' he said.
	   Clinton sent a letter to Yasser Arafat to explain his reasons
for the attack, which has placed the Palestinian leader in a
difficult position.
	   The anti-U.S. marches in the West Bank and Gaza threatened to
undercut Arafat's special new relationship with the United States.
The Clinton visit, his first to the autonomous Palestinian
territories, was widely seen as implicit U.S. recognition of
Palestinian claims to independence.
	   However, Arafat could not simply stifle the protests because of
the widespread support among his people for Iraq.
	   The largest rally was held in the West Bank town of Nablus,
where about 3,000 Palestinians took to the streets, chanting
``Death to America'' and ``Death to Clinton.''
	   Protesters burned a dozen U.S. flags, including those that had
been distributed by the Palestinian Authority several days earlier
to cheer the arrival of Clinton in Gaza and the biblical West Bank
town of Bethlehem.
	   ``Two days ago, Clinton was here and we thought he carried a
message of peace,'' said Majeda Masri, a teen-age marcher. ``But
now it is clear that he is a murderer.''
	   In Israel, the government opened 65 gas mask distribution and
deployed three Patriot anti-missile batteries outside the cities of
Tel Aviv and Haifa as a precaution against a possible Iraqi attack.
	   In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein fired 39 Scud
missiles at Israel after being attacked by the United States. At
the time, Saddam hoped to provoke an Israeli response and thus
break up the Arab coalition that had formed against him. However,
at the urging of the United States, Israel did not strike back.
	   Israeli military commanders said Thursday that the probability
of an Iraqi strike was very low. However, if pushed to the verge of
collapse by U.S. airstrikes, Saddam might fire missiles with
chemical or biological warheads at Israel, said Gen. Amos Gilad,
the head of research in Israel's military intelligence.
	   Clinton called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and told him
that the United States would not stand by if Israel were attacked,
the prime minister's office said.
	   Netanyahu said Israel does not want to get involved in the
conflict, but reserves the right to defend itself.
	   Unlike in earlier Gulf crises, there was no sign of panic in
Israel. One hardware store hoping to boost sales offered customers
a free flashlight if they bought two rolls of tape for sealing
rooms. Gas mask distribution centers did brisk business, but there
were no long lines.
	   In the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat, British tour operators
evacuated several hundred tourists on special flights.
	   The families of U.S. Embassy and Consulate staff in Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem prepared to leave by Friday, complying with a U.S. State
Department order.
	   One U.S. official said there was concern that children would be
at risk in case of a biological weapons attack. The antidote to
Anthrax, a biological agent mostly likely to be used by Iraq, has
not been tested on children, the official said on condition of
anonymity.

Welsh say they're blameless for English FA scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Welsh soccer officials maintained on
Thursday they were blameless for the so-called cash-for-votes
scandal which has stunned England's Football Association and led to
the resignation of chief executive Graham Kelly.
	   The scandal arises out of the promise of a loan by the English
FA to its Welsh counterpart. The English FA's executive committee
charged that Kelly and chairman Keith Wiseman promised the loan
unilaterally without consulting them but the deal has also been
interpreted as a bribe so that the Welsh would vote for Wiseman in
FIFA/UEFA elections.
	   At Tuesday's meeting of the English FA's executive committee,
Kelly resigned after 10 years at the helm and members voted
unanimously for Wiseman to quit also. He refused and has thrown the
matter over to a meeting of the 91-member FA Council Jan. 4.
	   Meanwhile the president of the Welsh FA, John Hughes, said
Thursday that his organization couldn't possibly be blamed for the
scandal.
	   ``We accepted the money in the spirit in which it was given, for
the benefit not of the FA of Wales but for the betterment of
football in Wales and football in the community,'' he said.
	   ``I'm of the firm belief that nobody at the Football Association
of Wales has done anything wrong whatsoever.''
	   Hughes said he was amazed at the comments of former Wales
national team manager, Terry Yorath, that the entire Welsh FA
council should resign for not doing their job properly.
	   ``Every member of the Welsh Football Association should resign
lock, stock and barrel,'' said Yorath, a former Leeds star who
played 59 times for Wales and now is a coach at division two
Huddersfield. ``They have been doing an embarrassing job for years.
	   ``I would like it to be more professional, with people who know
what they are talking about, who know about football, who know
about running football and who are closer to the professional game
in Wales.''
	   Hughes said that the current board were elected just three
months ago at the Welsh FA's tri-annual meeting.
	   ``We are a democratically elected council who were elected by
the clubs themselves. If the clubs feel it was unjust, it's up to
them to decide if they want to make their own expressions to us,''
he said.
	   ``People can say what they like but I'm very surprised by Yorath
because I was a firm believer in him and he had my full support.''
	   (rjm)
	   Hughes also expressed his surprise over comments made by former
Welsh boss Terry Yorath, who said that ``every member of the Welsh
Football Association should resign lock, stock and barrel. They
have been doing an embarrassing job for years.'' Yorath believes
the Welsh FA are now faced with an irretrievable financial
situation in having decided to accept the gift from the FA. Hughes
countered: ``I don't see why any of them should resign. I'm of the
firm belief that nobody at the Football Association of Wales has
done anything wrong whatsoever. ``We accepted the money in the
spirit in which it was given, for the benefit not of the FA of
Wales but for the betterment of football in Wales and football in
the community. ``The current board were elected just three months
ago at our tri-annual meeting _ we are a democratically elected
council who were elected by the clubs themselves. ``If the clubs
feel it was unjust, it's up to them to decide if they want to make
their own expressions to us. ``People can say what they like but
I'm very surprised by Yorath because I was a firm believer in him
and he had my full support.'' The Huddersfield first team coach
reckons there is only one way forward, and that is for the FAW to
take a more professional approach and attitude, with someone of the
calibre of former Wales boss and current Wolves scout Mike Smith
given a high-profile role. Yorath added: ``I would like it to be
more professional, with people who know what they are talking
about, who know about football, who know about running football and
who are closer to the professional game in Wales. ``I would like
somebody like Mike Smith to be involved. He is fully qualified to
do anything the Welsh FA could possibly do. He is well organised
and has enough contacts which would help him do a great job for
them.'' end

Yugoslavs condemn US airstrikes against Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Two months after Yugoslavia stood
under the threat of NATO airstrikes, the Belgrade government has
strongly condemned U.S.-British attacks on Iraq.
	   In a statement Thursday, the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry condemned
the attacks as ``aggression'' which violated the U.N. Charter as
well as principles of equality, sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
	   Yugoslavia, which itself almost faced NATO airstrikes in October
over the Kosovo conflict, said ``such arbitrary use of force in
international relations cannot be justified, nor can it contribute
to solving any of the problems.''
	   Meanwhile, Serbian deputy premier Vojislav Seselj met with Iraqi
charge d'affaires in Belgrade and ``expressed, in the name of the
Serbian government and his own, solidarity with the Iraqi people
and the state,'' according to the official Tanjug news agency.
	   He called the strikes ``the defeat of the principles of
international law ... and all democratic values.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain on Thursday for attacking Iraq and demanded an
immediate end to the bombing, warning it could shatter hopes of
peace in the Middle East.
	   ``Russia demands an immediate end to military action, to show
common sense and restraint and not to allow further escalation of
the conflict which could result in the most dramatic consequences
not only for the Iraqi settlement but for the stability of the
entire region,'' Yeltsin said in a statement.
	   The United States and Britain launched air and missile attacks
against Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The Russian General Staff ordered the navy and air force to put
some of its units in ``a state of preparedness'' to await orders
that the commander-in-chief might issue because of the attacks, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. It did not elaborate, and there was
no sign that Russia was preparing to send any troops to the region.
	   While Russia has long opposed military action against Iraq, it
has never taken military steps of its own to intervene.
	   Responding to the attacks, Russia's parliament urged the
government Thursday to increase funding for the country's military
and defense industry. The State Duma voted 394-1 to approve the
non-binding resolution that also denounced ``the barbarous
bombings.''
	   Russian television channels showed Yeltsin looking at maps of
the Middle East and talking with several generals and senior aides.
The president spent most of Wednesday night monitoring the
situation, aides said.
	   Russia has consistently attempted to find a political solution
to the dispute with Iraq, an old ally of the Soviet Union. But
Moscow is no longer a global superpower and is able to do little
more than protest U.S. actions, goading Russian frustration.
	   Many Russians seemed critical of the attacks, and mentioned
their sympathy toward ordinary Iraqis.
	   The U.S. and Britain ``certainly had no right to do that _ there
are people there, after all,'' said Nadezhda Nenasheva, walking
with her child on a Moscow street.
	   Yeltsin discussed the situation in a phone call with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin. The two leaders agreed that the attack was
``unacceptable, unilateral and contradicting the U.N. charter and
the principles of international law,'' the Kremlin press service
said.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov also sharply denounced
the United States and Britain and said Russia would work in the
United Nations to end the attacks.
	   ``This time the activities of the U.S. and Great Britain have
not been provoked by Iraq. The U.S. administration has the strikes
on its conscience,'' said Primakov, who has had close ties with
Iraq for many years.
	   Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and the head of the
Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II, both condemned the
bombings.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev canceled his participation in a
session of a joint Russia-NATO council in Brussels, Belgium,
because of the bombings and flew back to Moscow on Thursday, news
reports said.
	   The strikes ``go beyond international law and annul all
political and diplomatic efforts'' toward a settlement, Sergeyev
said.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Russia will insist on the
dismissal of U.N. weapons inspector chief Richard Butler, saying
Butler ``carries a personal responsibility'' for the bombings.
	   In his report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday,
Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction, evasion and
subterfuge. He said he could not give assurances that Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction had been destroyed. A day after the
report, U.N. monitors were ordered to evacuate Baghdad.
	   ``The current crisis was created artificially, including through
irresponsible actions by Butler,'' Ivanov said. ``The document he
presented (to Annan) gives a distorted picture of the state of
affairs in Iraq.''
	   Russia's Islamic Committee issued a statement saying the
bombings are ``effectively the start of World War III, which the
West has long been promising to wage on us, Muslims.''
	   The Union of Russia's Muslims said: ``Our enemies must not
entertain the illusions that the Islamic world will remain
unresponsive and divided.''
	   Parliamentary leaders also denounced the attacks, with Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov saying, ``This is international banditry
that must be sharply denounced.''
	   Vladimir Zhirinovsky, an ultranationalist leader and a
long-standing supporter of Saddam, called for Russia to
unilaterally stop abiding by the sanctions against Iraq, and
temporarily recall its ambassador to the United States, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   About 200 retired army officers who are also members of
Zhirinovsky's party offered to serve as volunteers in Saddam's
army, ITAR-Tass reported. They sent a letter to the Iraqi Embassy
in Moscow offering their services.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain on Thursday for attacking Iraq and demanded an
immediate end to the bombing, warning it could shatter hopes of
peace in the Middle East.
	   ``Russia demands an immediate end to military action, to show
common sense and restraint and not to allow further escalation of
the conflict which could result in the most dramatic consequences
not only for the Iraqi settlement but for the stability of the
entire region,'' Yeltsin said in a statement.
	   The United States and Britain launched air and missile attacks

Welsh say they're blameless for English FA scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to delete extraneous material &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Welsh soccer officials maintained on
Thursday they were blameless for the so-called cash-for-votes
scandal which has stunned England's Football Association and led to
the resignation of chief executive Graham Kelly.
	   The scandal arises out of the promise of a loan by the English
FA to its Welsh counterpart. The English FA's executive committee
charged that Kelly and chairman Keith Wiseman promised the loan
unilaterally without consulting them but the deal has also been
interpreted as a bribe so that the Welsh would vote for Wiseman in
FIFA/UEFA elections.
	   At Tuesday's meeting of the English FA's executive committee,
Kelly resigned after 10 years at the helm and members voted
unanimously for Wiseman to quit also. He refused and has thrown the
matter over to a meeting of the 91-member FA Council Jan. 4.
	   Meanwhile the president of the Welsh FA, John Hughes, said
Thursday that his organization couldn't possibly be blamed for the
scandal.
	   ``We accepted the money in the spirit in which it was given, for
the benefit not of the FA of Wales but for the betterment of
football in Wales and football in the community,'' he said.
	   ``I'm of the firm belief that nobody at the Football Association
of Wales has done anything wrong whatsoever.''
	   Hughes said he was amazed at the comments of former Wales
national team manager, Terry Yorath, that the entire Welsh FA
council should resign for not doing their job properly.
	   ``Every member of the Welsh Football Association should resign
lock, stock and barrel,'' said Yorath, a former Leeds star who
played 59 times for Wales and now is a coach at division two
Huddersfield. ``They have been doing an embarrassing job for years.
	   ``I would like it to be more professional, with people who know
what they are talking about, who know about football, who know
about running football and who are closer to the professional game
in Wales.''
	   Hughes said that the current board were elected just three
months ago at the Welsh FA's tri-annual meeting.
	   ``We are a democratically elected council who were elected by
the clubs themselves. If the clubs feel it was unjust, it's up to
them to decide if they want to make their own expressions to us,''
he said.
	   ``People can say what they like but I'm very surprised by Yorath
because I was a firm believer in him and he had my full support.''

Opposition leader launches campaign against Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ With early elections looming, opposition
leader Ehud Barak stressed social issues over security concerns
Thursday as he launched his campaign against Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   With President Bill Clinton's campaign strategist, James
Carville, at his side, Barak said he was ready for elections,
expected in April.
	   Netanyahu said Wednesday he would call Israelis to the polls
more than a year ahead of schedule if he could not muster enough
support for his hard-line peace policies before a no-confidence
motion Monday in parliament.
	   Netanyahu's coalition has been crumbling since he signed the
latest Mideast peace accord _ which is opposed by most of his
Cabinet because it calls for Israel to cede war-captured West Bank
land.
	   Barak, leader of the Labor Party, which reached historic peace
accords with the Palestinians in 1993, wants the accord implemented
to the letter and has rejected Netanyahu's calls for support.
	   Barak accused Netanyahu of capitulating to his right-wing
coalition and freezing further Israeli troop withdrawals from the
West Bank. ``We are determined to put an end to yielding to
extremists,'' Barak said.
	   Barak promised to divert millions of dollars now being spent by
the Netanyahu government on Jewish settlements and give it instead
to domestic concerns, such as education, health and ending
record-high unemployment.
	   He also pledged to cut government grants to yeshivas, or Jewish
seminaries, and to draft seminary students into military service
like other Israelis.
	   ``Education before settlements, job creation before yeshivas,''
Barak said.
	   Focusing on social issues and the economy worked for Carville in
the 1992 and 1996 Clinton campaigns. In tiny Israel, however,
security has always been the No. 1 campaign issue and candidates
have usually left social issues on the back burner for smaller
parties to champion.
	   The Third Way, a moderate party in Netanyahu's coalition, said
Thursday it would vote against the premier on Monday and in favor
of new elections.
	   Barak, a former commander-in-chief of Israel's armed forces,
also said Netanyahu's policies had harmed the strong strategic ties
between Israel and the United States, its closest ally.
	   Interviewed on Israel radio, Netanyahu said the peace process
was on hold because of continuous violations of the deal by the
Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu turned the debate away from social issues to security,
a topic which helped him win narrow election in 1996.
	   He challenged Barak to reveal how he would deal with a possible
declaration of statehood next year by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Palestinian claims over parts of Jerusalem.
	   ``I expect that all the members of parliament who are concerned
for the fate of the state, for the fate of Jerusalem, will rally to
support me,'' Netanyahu told Israel radio.
	   In the 1996 election, Netanyahu used negative campaign messages
against then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres, whom he repeatedly called
soft on security and said was willing to give away parts of
Jerusalem to the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu's campaign was aided by Arthur Finkelstein, the U.S.
political guru who helped elect many Republicans to office.
	   Barak recently employed Carville, pollster Stanley Greenberg and
media specialist Robert Strom, who helped elect Clinton, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.

	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Insurgents, dignitaries,
presidents and prime ministers gathered in Burkina Faso's capital
Thursday in search of peace on a continent scarred by war.
	   Delegates from the Organization of African Unity concluded their
first closed-door session without comment. The session focused on
conflicts from the Congo to Angola to the Horn of Africa, where
Ethiopia and Eritrea continue to grapple over a land dispute.
	   Congolese President Laurent Kabila criticized the OAU for
failing to take a stand on the civil war in his country, which he
says is an act of aggression by neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.
	   ``This is an aggression by two members countries of the
Organization of African Unity, yet the OAU has no official position
in the face of this aggression,'' Kabila told delegates.
	   There were no major breakthroughs during the first session, a
Burkina Faso government official said on condition of anonymity. A
second session was scheduled for Thursday night.
	   Urging member states of the OAU to search for peace, Burkina
Faso's President Blaise Compaore said African nations must take
responsibility for their future to ensure security for development.
	   ``As we near the end of the 20th century, with certain regions
of our continent facing crisis and complexity we must ask the
question of ourselves: `What have we done to reach this
objective?''' Compaore said during the summit's opening ceremony.
	   The theme of the gathering _ peace and conflict resolution _
appeared lost, however, on summit security agents and Chadian
presidential bodyguards who brawled on the front steps of the
conference center.
	   The fight began when the Chadians were told they could not
accompany their president into the conference center.
	   The incident delayed the start of the opening ceremonies.
	   Of central focus during the talks is Congo, where at least five
countries are embroiled in bitter fighting.
	   Kabila, among other warring leaders involved in the Congo
conflict who were at the summit, said he would consider signing a
cease-fire agreement if it included a timeline for the withdrawal
of foreign forces in Congo.
	   ``If we sign a cease-fire pact with the aggressors, it must be
linked to a calender,'' he said. ``We cannot sign any agreement if
we don't know when the aggressors are going to leave our country.''
	   A rebel uprising earlier this year threatened to topple Kabila's
regime until troops and warplanes from Angola and Zimbabwe
intervened on his behalf.
	   Rwandan and Ugandan backing has helped prop up the rebel
movement, which continues to control portions of eastern Congo.
	   Speaking from the eastern Congolese city of Goma, rebel leader
Arthur Zahidi Ngoma said his movement would be willing to agree to
the withdrawal of foreign armies from Congo once a pact was signed
with Kabila.
	   ``Once we achieve an agreement with Kabila, there will be no
need for foreign powers to stay in Congo,'' he said.
	   Heads of state or delegates representing all sides, including a
team from the rebels, are in Ouagadougou for the two-day meeting.
	   Congo is not the only scene of fighting on the continent.
Ethiopia and Eritrea continue to search for a resolution to their
territorial dispute; rebels and government troops in Guinea-Bissau
are struggling to create a new government; and Angola's
longstanding rebel war is lurching back into gear.
	   And there are more, including growing hostilities in the
Republic of Congo, where government forces are battling an outlawed
militia force called the Ninjas.

Russia's wage debts rise despite Primakov's pledge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government's mammoth wage debts have
grown since Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov came to power in
September, despite his pledge to pay current salaries on time and
gradually solve arrears, officials said Thursday.
	   Education Minister Vladimir Filippov blamed the increase on
local officials, saying they misspent government funds earmarked
for wages.
	   ``The government today can't pay off such huge debts,'' he said
at a news conference. ``We can only solve the arrears by cranking
up money-printing presses.''
	   The government so far has been trying to avoid printing large
amounts of new cash, fearing that would cause hyperinflation.
	   The government's debt to state workers now stands at a
staggering $4.1 billion, Filippov said _ up from about $3.9 billion
when Primakov took office in September and set out to tackle
Russia's worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   He refused to say when the government will pay off all debts.
	   Earlier this week, the government won parliament's approval to
print $1.2 billion in the last quarter of this year. Without
waiting for approval, the government had already printed $650
million in October and November.
	   Filippov pledged the total amount of new money will stay within
limits set by the parliament.
	   Primakov chaired a Cabinet session on Thursday to consider the
wage situation. He urged local officials to submit detailed plans
for solving wage debts and ordered them to pay all current wages
plus one month worth of overdue wages by Jan. 15.
	   ``We should take extraordinary measures for ensuring human
rights: Everyone must receive remuneration for one's work,''
Primakov said.
	   In some regions, wages are up to 15 months late, Filippov said.
	   Teachers alone are owed about $720 million by the government,
and about 45,000 teachers have been on strike in recent days
throughout Russia.
	   ``That means 600,000 children can't go to school on a daily
basis,'' he said.
	   The average teacher's monthly wage is less than $25.
	   The Cabinet has already factored in foreign loans in next year's
budget to pay off its domestic and foreign debts, although they may
not materialize.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders have been
reluctant to release loans put on hold after Russia's economy
nose-dived in August, falling victim to global economic turmoil.
	   Left without foreign credits, the government will have to print
money to pay off its debts, further eroding the ruble's value.
	   The Central Bank's hard currency reserves have been steadily
dropping as the bank has been spending them to slow the fall of the
ruble, which stood Thursday at 20.7 rubles to the dollar. It was
worth six to the dollar in August, before the crisis began.
	   The Russian Central Bank's gold and currency reserves fell by
$100 million in the second week of December and stood at $12
billion on Dec. 11, the bank announced Thursday.

	   Two powerful explosions occured not far from the Information
Ministry building, from where foreign correspondents operate.
	   Anti-aircraft fire intensified. Cars, which had been driving

Vatican expresses dismay over Ango-American attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES with more quotes from Vatican spokesman,
including pope's feelings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Saying the pope was saddened by the
Anglo-American airstrikes on Iraq, the Vatican's spokesman on
Thursday said the Holy See hoped for a quick end to what it called
the ``aggression.''
	   ``The Holy See hopes that this aggression ends as soon as
possible and that international order is restored,'' said spokesman
Joaquin Navarro-Valls.
	   Asked what Pope John Paul II was feeling, Navarro-Valls replied:
``I'd say feelings of sadness, as every time that, by violent
means, civilians -- and in the end, innocent persons -- die.''
	   Pope John Paul II, who had spoken out repeatedly against the
1991 Gulf War, referred to the latest hostilities during a speech
to a group of ambassadors.
	   ``Peace is again threatened in the Middle East. Reconciliation
based on dialogue, justice and the right of every people to live in
security is more than ever urgent,'' John Paul said.
	   The pope contended that the international community is
responsible for favoring peaceful solutions that prevent the loss
of innocent lives.
	   Navarro-Valls echoed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
assessment that it was ``a sad day for the United Nations and for
the world.''
	   The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, in a front-page
editorial, urged tenacity in pursuing the ``tiring but fertile ways
of peace'' and called dialogue ``the only instrument capable of
freeing consciences of rancor built up over years of rigid
counter-positions.''

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The International Herald Tribune said Thursday it
has appointed Peter Green to the position of operations director
and Ian Walthew, marketing director.
	   Green, 45, has been a director for The European newspaper for
the past three years.
	   Walthew, 32, joined the IHT in 1994 in Brussels and moved to
Paris in 1997, where he oversaw double-digit growth in
subscriptions, the IHT said.
	   ``The challenge is for our marketing and technology to keep in
step with the growing global class,'' Richard Wooldridge, the IHT's
president and chief operating officer, said in a statement.
	   Founded in Paris in 1887, the International Herald Tribune is
jointly owned by the New York Times and the Washington Post. The
paper is on sale in more than 180 countries.

Russian prosecutors open probe into lawmaker's anti-Semitic
</HEADLINE>
remarks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prosecutors have opened an investigation against a
Communist lawmaker who accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in
Russia, a news report said Thursday.
	   Communist lawmaker Viktor Ilyukhin said Tuesday that Russia's
post-Soviet collapse would not have happened if Russia's government
was not made up ``exclusively of one group, the Jews.'' He also
accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in the country.
	   The Prosecutor General's office has launched a probe and has
asked parliament to provide a transcript of Tuesday's impeachment
hearing against Yeltsin, during which Ilyukhin made his comments,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Prosecutors have also asked Russia's main television companies
to provide footage of Ilyukhin's speech.
	   Russia's constitution forbids statements that ``incite ethnic
strife,'' but few people have been punished for making such
remarks.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's governments have contained a number of
Jews and other minorities in prominent positions, but they have
always been outnumbered by ethnic Russians.
	   Yeltsin's office strongly condemned Ilyukhin's remarks, and
powerful Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky called for banning the
Communist party.
	   Visiting Swiss President Flavio Cotti also condemned the
anti-Semitic statements on Thursday, when he visited Russia's
Memorial human rights group as part of his three-day trip to
Moscow.
	   Ilyukhin's remarks come in the wake of similar anti-Semitic
comments by another Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov. Makashov
never came under investigation for his anti-Semitic remarks,
although he is under a separate inquiry into his alleged calls for
a violent ouster of the government.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Singing ``revolution until we die,''
more than 4,000 student protesters abandoned their usual peaceful
tactics and attempted to storm the Parliament on Thursday to press
their demands for greater democracy.
	   Many threw rocks, bottles and gasoline bombs infuriating
security forces who stopped them with plastic bullets, tear gas and
batons.
	   Other students fought back with sticks and some soldiers hurled
rocks at protesters.
	   Hours before the massive street battle, President B.J. Habibie
warned his country might break up if anti-government protests
escalated.
	   At least 116 injured students were treated in four hospitals,
officials said. Most were overcome by tear gas or beaten.
	   Some, bleeding profusely from plastic bullet wounds, were
carried to safety by their friends through clouds of gas and
despite volleys of warning shots.
	   Volunteers applied first aid on the street to hundreds more.
	   The head of Jakarta's navy hospital, Dr. Sutedjo, denied an
earlier report from the hospital that one student had died there of
a gunshot wound.
	   The military said 14 security personnel were injured, four of
them seriously. One had been stabbed.
	   ``If the protests are not controlled it can lead to the
disintegration of the nation,'' Habibie said at a graduation
ceremony of new army officers.
	   It was the second straight day that students clashed with
security forces in the Indonesian capital. And, it was the worst
violence since mid-November when 14 people died after troops fired
upon students who also tried to march on Parliament.
	   For weeks, students have taken to the streets demanding that
Habibie force the powerful military out of politics and put his
autocratic predecessor, ex-President Suharto, on trial for
corruption.
	   Suharto was forced to quit after 32 years of autocratic rule in
May when student protests were followed deadly riots. At that time
the students occupied the Parliament for days.
	   Habibie, a one time Suharto protege, has promised to open up the
tightly controlled political system and to hold elections next
year. He's also ordered a new investigation into Suharto's wealth.
	   But the students are not satisfied with the pace and scope of
his reforms.
	   Anger at his seven-month old government has been sharpened by
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades, which has resulted in
soaring inflation, mass unemployment and rising poverty.
	   Indonesia, with 202 million people, is the world's fourth most
populous country. It has more than 300 ethnic groups spread over
about 17,000 islands.
	   There's been sporadic rioting and looting in some parts of the
sprawling Southeast Asian nation. Violence among its Muslim
majority and the Christian minority has flared with dozens of
mosques and churches set afire or ransacked.
	   One student leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the demonstrators would protest again on Friday.
	   On Wednesday police also fired tear gas and swung batons to
disperse hundreds of rock-throwing protesters at the Defense
Ministry, not far from the presidential palace.
	   Religious groups have called on the students to end their
protest campaign during the forthcoming holy Islamic month of
Ramadan, which starts on Sunday.
	   As night fell Thursday, hundreds of military reinforcements
arrived at the Parliament and students lit bonfires on a toll road.
	   Soldiers ordered reporters and news crews to leave the scene.
	   Angry students pulled down and set fire to tents erected by the
troops near the legislature. They also burned a portrait of Suharto
before leaving in buses for their college campuses.
	   Later student organizers accused police forced one bus off the
road by shooting its tires and then firing at or beating those
inside.
	   Police were not immediately available to comment.
	   Also on Thursday, dozens of riot police and troops peacefully
blocked about 100 students about 100 meters (yards) in front of the
presidential palace.

	   Police also arrested another opposition leader Marcel Cros, a
leader of the tiny African Democratic Party of Guinea, in a
separate incident on Saturday for alleged illegal possession of
military weapons in his home, state radio said.
	   Although the elections were peaceful, the arrests have increased
tensions in Guinea's capital. Several hundred people began marching
through the streets of the capital towards Conde's home Wednesday
before police cut short the protest by firing teargas into the
crowds, witnesses said.

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ More than 40 Soviet-era statues of
Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx and other Communist figures are being
given by the government to a club that wants to put them on display
in a forest park, the Baltic News Service reported Thursday.
	   The statues, torn down after Lithuania became independent of the
Soviet Union in 1991, have been sitting in scrapyards.
	   The report said the club that wants to display the statues is
funded by the Hesonas canning company, but did not give details on
the club's motivation for acquiring the statues or whether
admission would be charged to the display.
	   The display is to be erected in a forest about 100 kilometers
(60 miles) south of Vilnius, the capital, the report said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S.-British military action in Iraq is about a
defiant dictator and has nothing to do with an American president's
possible impeachment, Prime Minister Tony Blair said Thursday.
	   Blair, who has unflinchingly supported U.S. President Bill
Clinton throughout the Monica Lewinsky saga, disputed suggestions
that his friend may have sought a distraction from the looming
impeachment debate in the House of Representatives.
	   And he bristled when one lawmaker said the military action was
led by ``Clinton the liar.''
	   ``I have no doubt at all that action is fully justified now,''
said Blair, the only national leader to commit military forces to
support the U.S. airstrikes against Iraq.
	   ``That is my own strong personal view,'' he told the House of
Commons. ``I know that President Clinton reached the same
conclusion for the same reason.''
	   Blair added of Clinton: ``Not for the first time, he has shown
the courage to do the right thing, and he has my full support.''
	   Blair also told lawmakers that British Tornado jets, all
designed primarily for low-level bombing missions, went into action
for the first time Thursday afternoon, but would disclose no
details of the operation.
	   In part, Britain's military commitment against Saddam Hussein
reflects its self-image as America's strongest ally and special
friend in Europe.
	   But there also is a personal bond between Blair and Clinton,
both young centrists leading traditional left-leaning parties.
	   Their mutual admiration recalls similarly strong ties between a
very different pair of leaders _ Ronald Reagan and Margaret
Thatcher.
	   Visiting Washington in February, Blair stood with Clinton at a
news conference dominated by questions about possible military
action in Iraq and about Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   At a time when many people were reluctant to even stand next to
him in public, Blair said he had found that Clinton was ``someone I
could trust, someone I could rely upon, someone I am proud to call
not just a colleague, but a friend.''
	   And on the night Independent Council Kenneth Starr's report was
released in September, Blair was on the telephone in London for a
long talk with Clinton, in a clear gesture of support.
	   Defending the U.S.-British military campaign in Iraq, Blair said
Saddam had been given another chance in November, when airstrikes
were called off at the last minute.
	   ``Saddam Hussein is a man to whom a last chance to do right is
just a further opportunity to do wrong. He is blind to reason,'' he
said.
	   Most lawmakers appeared to support Blair's action, but there was
sharp criticism from two left-wingers in his own Labor Party.
	   Tony Benn called the attacks ``deeply immoral and contrary to an
ethical foreign policy of which we boast.''
	   George Galloway said the attacks would be deeply resented by
Muslims, adding, ``An Arab-Muslim capital is in flames at the hands
of a new crusade, but this time led, not by Richard the Lionheart
but by Clinton the liar.''
	   Blair responded: ``I find it curious that you should attack
President Clinton personally and mention not a word of condemnation
of Saddam Hussein. It is a curious sense of priority that you
have.''
	   No polling data was available showing how Britons viewed their
country's involvement, but demonstrators were plentiful outside the
main government offices in London.
	   In one incident Thursday, protesters used red paint to daub the
Foreign Office with the words ``Stop Killing'' and ``Lift the
Sanctions,'' referring to U.N.-imposed embargoes on Iraq.

 &UR; CONAKRY: Witnesses said.

<TEXT>
	   Both detained men were believed to be in paramilitary quarters
in Conakry and opposition officials said on condition of anonymity
that as many as 15 other government opponents had also been seized.
	   Six people were believed killed in Conakry street clashes on
Saturday after a ruling party rally.
	   Conte seized power in 1984 after the death of Guinea's former
dictator, Sekou Toure.
	   Guinea, which has an average per capita income of just a few
hundred dollars a year and an illiteracy rate of up to 80 percent,
is still recovering from Toure's 26-year regime. Thousands of
people died in prison camps, and 2 million people fled the country.
	   While Conte has allowed greater political freedom, his critics
say he has become more autocratic since a military revolt in 1996
by soldiers angry over unpaid wages.

US human rights official praises Montenegro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top State Department human rights
official Thursday pledged strong U.S. support for Montenegro,
praising the Yugoslav republic's ``fine record'' in respecting
human rights and democracy.
	   Harold Koh, an assistant secretary of state, met Montenegro's
reformist president, Milo Djukanovic, as part of a tour of
Yugoslavia, which will include a visit to Serbia's restive Kosovo
province on Friday. Yugoslavia consists of Serbia and much smaller
Montenegro.
	   Koh said that Montenegro, where opponents of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic took power last year, stands in ``stark
contrast'' to Serbia, where autocratic Milosevic has full control.
Koh visited Belgrade Wednesday.
	   ``In Belgrade I saw government repression of the media,
government repression of universities, and deep assault on the
institutions of civil society,'' Koh said, adding Milosevic's
regime shows ``contempt for democracy, human rights and the rule of
law.''
	   But Koh praised what he called Montenegro's ``fine record on
these points,'' adding ``the U.S. government strongly supports
Montengro's steps toward democracy and human rights.''
	   Koh gave Djukanovic, a fierce critic of Milosevic, a letter from
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who also pledged further U.S.
support to Montenegro.
	   ``Your example will set the pace for Serbia and for the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia as a whole,'' the letter said.
	   Djukanovic, once a supporter of Milosevic, split from the Serb
leader last year over various political and economic issues.
Djukanovic won an election last year over a Milosevic protege in
Montenegro, but Milosevic, who is now president of Yugoslavia,
refused to recognize Djukanovic's victory.
	   There are fears that Milosevic might try to install his allies
on power in Montenegro by force.
	   In a speech Thursday, Djukanovic said next year would be ``the
year of political resolution in Yugoslavia,'' which he called ``a
hostage of (Milosevic's) failed policies.''
	   Djukanovic warned that Yugoslavia, which shrunk from six
republics to two since 1990, faces grim future ``with its
foundations getting thinner day by day.''
	   Earlier this year, Milosevic named his protege in Montenegro,
Momir Bulatovic, as federal premier, straining relations between
the two republics. Bulatovic lost the Montegerin presidential
election to Djukanovic.
	   Analysts believe the tensions could lead to the final breakup of
Yugoslavia.

Serb officers sought by the Hague tribunal heard as witnesses

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with top U.S. human rights official condemning the
Belgrade trial &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three Serb officers sought by a U.N.
war crimes tribunal appeared as witnesses at a Yugoslav military
probe into alleged 1991 war crimes, in defiance of international
demands to hand over the case and the suspects to The Hague court.
	   Two representatives of the U.N. tribunal also attended the
hearings in the Belgrade Military Court, according to a statement
from the court carried by the official Tanjug news agency.
	   The statement added that Veselin Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic
and Milan Mrksic, accused of ordering the 1991 massacre of 261
Croats taken out of a hospital in Vukovar in eastern Croatia,
``testified as witnesses.''
	   The statement further said that in their testimonies the three
responded to allegations from the Hague indictment. The Belgrade
military court said the proceedings will continue.
	   ``I have no comment at all about this proceedings,'' declared
The Hague court investigator Denis Milner as he came out of the
military court building.
	   The move by the Belgrade government, loyal to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, has been criticized by The Hague tribunal and
the West.
	   In Montenegro's capital Podgorica, a top U.S. human rights
official blasted the Belgrade trial, saying it defied international
demands.
	   ``These actions show contempt for democracy, human rights and
the rule of law,'' said Harold Koh, U.S. assistant secretary of
state for human rights.

U.S. missiles explode in Baghdad in second wave of attacks on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. missiles exploded in Baghdad on
Thursday night, provoking a barrage of anti-aircraft fire.
	   There was no immediate word of casualties or damage, but at
least one missile was seen heading toward that part of the city
where the Military Industrial Corporation has its premises.
	   The U.S. military had announced hours earlier that a second
round of air strikes was underway.
	   The attack began at 9:57 p.m. local time (1857GMT) with a loud
explosion that was followed swiftly by anti-aircraft guns firing.
	   Tracer shells criss-crossed the sky.
	   Two powerful explosions occurred not far from the Information
Ministry building, from where foreign correspondents operate.
	   As anti-aircraft fire intensified, cars began to speed down the
streets and city residents turned off their house lights.
	   Ten more explosions were heard in the following minutes.
	   A thick column of white smoke rose in the sky from the area near
the military corporation. The skyline in that part of the city
glowed orange as if buildings were on fire.
	   Earlier Thursday, the U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, told reporters in Washington that a
second night of air strikes on Iraq had begun.
	   The general declined to give the targets.
	   But he said the first round of attacks overnight Wednesday had
been largely successful.
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen told the same press conference
that the goal of the strikes was to reduce Iraq's capability to
threaten neighbors with chemical or biological weapons.

	   Fear of greater instability in the Middle East and a surge of
sympathy for the Iraqi people led a wave of opposition to U.S. and
British airstrikes on Baghdad on Thursday. Most NATO allies,
however, backed the attacks.
	   Amir Roh, a mechanic in the bombed-out city of Kabul,
Afghanistan, wrung his grease-blackened hands as he contemplated
the plight of the Iraqi people, who already are suffering after
eight years of U.N. sanctions.
	   ``We know what it is like to hide your head, always afraid. It
is only the people who suffer, no one else,'' the Afghani man said.
``Saddam Hussein is safe in some basement.''
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the attack with a
warning that it could shatter regional security. Russia has
consistently opposed military action against Iraq, an old Soviet
ally.
	   China, like Russia a permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council, appealed for an end to the bombing.
	   ``This is a violation of the U.N. charter and the principles of
international law and we condemn this,'' Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sun Yuxi said.
	   China's uncharacteristically strong comments underscored a split
in the Security Council over U.N. weapons inspections and
sanctions.
	   The United States and Britain say the attacks were prompted by
Iraq's refusal to cooperate with weapons inspectors, while the
other three permanent council members _ France, China and Russia _
have called for an immediate end to the airstrikes.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
which sparked the Gulf War. The council will not lift them until
inspectors certify the destruction of Iraq's weapons programs.
Permanent members can veto any decision.
	   During the 1991 Gulf War, the West and part of the Muslim world
lined up together, but the situation is very different now, with
little consensus even on the question of whether the United States
and Britain had the right to attack without council approval.
	   That would have been nearly impossible to get, with China,
Russia and France urging the adoption of a more conciliatory line
toward Baghdad.
	   France, which had a fruitful trade relationship with Iraq before
sanctions were imposed, blamed both sides.
	   ``But Saddam Hussein is the person who bears the main
responsibility for the conflict,'' French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said.
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a strong U.S. ally, said
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had only himself to blame.
	   Italian premier Massimo D'Alema was quoted in newspapers
Thursday as saying that ``the strikes were legitimate but
useless.'' His foreign minister, Lamberto Dini, also blamed Saddam.
	   While Russia feared the attacks could destabilize the Gulf,
supporters of the airstrikes said doing nothing could have been
even more dangerous.
	   ``The developing of mass destruction weapons is a threat against
stability and security in the whole region,'' Norwegian Foreign
Minister Knut Vollebaek told the Norwegian news agency NTB.
	   Others had a more visceral response.
	   In Yugoslavia, which narrowly avoided U.S. airstrikes just two
months earlier, newspapers were clearly sympathetic to Iraq. ``U.S.
and British aggression against Iraq'' and ``American invasion of
Iraq,'' blared headlines in Belgrade.
	   In Islamabad, right-wing Pakistani religious groups burned
effigies of Clinton. Protest leader Sajjid Chaudhry warned that
``Muslims can strike any where, any time.''
	   Muslim opinion did not line up solely on the Iraqi side. A
member of Kuwait's ruling family, whose father was killed when Iraq
invaded eight years ago, said he was worried. ``We know the Iraqis
too well, they are capable of anything,'' Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah
said in Bangkok, where he was attending the Asian Games.
	   Others expressed concern for the Iraqi people.
	   ``Such unilateral attacks against Iraq will lead to even more
pain and misery for the people of that country,'' Iranian
television reported a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying. While
relations between Iran and Iraq are still tense after their 1980-88
war, Iran has always opposed military strikes.
	   In Gaza City, where many Palestinians side with the Iraqis as
fellow Arabs and Muslims, grocer Safi Sayed was selling Iraqi
flags.
	   ``We are very sorry about this strike against our people in
Iraq,'' Sayed said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain on Thursday for attacking Iraq and demanded an
immediate end to the bombing, warning it could shatter hopes of
peace in the Middle East.
	   ``Russia demands an immediate end to military action, to show
common sense and restraint and not to allow further escalation of
the conflict which could result in the most dramatic consequences
not only for the Iraqi settlement but for the stability of the
entire region,'' Yeltsin said in a statement.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, in a telephone conversation
with U.S. President Al Gore on Thursday night, expressed Russia's
indignation at the attacks and urged the United States to stop the
strikes, the Interfax news agency cited the government press
service as saying. Primakov has had close ties with Iraq for many
years.
	   The United States and Britain launched air and missile attacks
against Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The Russian General Staff ordered the navy and air force to put
some of its units in ``a state of preparedness'' to await orders
that the commander-in-chief might issue because of the attacks, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. It did not elaborate, and there was
no sign that Russia was preparing to send any troops to the region.
	   While Russia has long opposed military action against Iraq, it
has never taken military steps of its own to intervene.
	   Responding to the attacks, Russia's parliament urged the
government Thursday to increase funding for the country's military
and defense industry. The State Duma voted 394-1 to approve the
non-binding resolution that also denounced ``the barbarous
bombings.''
	   Russian television channels showed Yeltsin looking at maps of
the Middle East and talking with several generals and senior aides.
The president spent most of Wednesday night monitoring the
situation, aides said.
	   Russia has consistently attempted to find a political solution
to the dispute with Iraq, an old ally of the Soviet Union. But
Moscow is no longer a global superpower and is able to do little
more than protest U.S. actions, goading Russian frustration.
	   Many Russians seemed critical of the attacks and sympathetic
toward ordinary Iraqis.
	   The U.S. and Britain ``certainly had no right to do that _ there
are people there, after all,'' said Nadezhda Nenasheva, walking
with her child on a Moscow street.
	   Yeltsin discussed the situation in a phone call with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin. The two leaders agreed that the attack was
``unacceptable, unilateral and contradicting the U.N. charter and
the principles of international law,'' the Kremlin press service
said.
	   Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and the head of the
Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II, both condemned the
bombings.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev canceled his participation in a
session of a joint Russia-NATO council in Brussels, Belgium,
because of the bombings and flew back to Moscow on Thursday, news
reports said.
	   The strikes ``go beyond international law and annul all
political and diplomatic efforts'' toward a settlement, Sergeyev
said.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Russia will insist on the
dismissal of U.N. weapons inspector chief Richard Butler, saying
Butler ``carries a personal responsibility'' for the bombings.
	   In his report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday,
Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction, evasion and
subterfuge. He said he could not give assurances that Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction had been destroyed. A day after the
report, U.N. monitors were ordered to evacuate Baghdad.
	   ``The current crisis was created artificially, including through
irresponsible actions by Butler,'' Ivanov said. ``The document he
presented (to Annan) gives a distorted picture of the state of
affairs in Iraq.''
	   Ivanov also dismissed speculation that the attacks were timed to
thwart impeachment proceedings against Clinton.
	   ``Let's leave this to film-makers. The problem is far more
serious and must not be lowered to the level of banality,'' he
said.
	   Russia's Islamic Committee issued a statement saying the
bombings are ``effectively the start of World War III, which the
West has long been promising to wage on us, Muslims.''
	   Parliamentary leaders also denounced the attacks.
	   Vladimir Zhirinovsky, an ultranationalist leader and a
long-standing supporter of Saddam, called for Russia to
unilaterally stop abiding by the sanctions against Iraq, and
temporarily recall its ambassador to the United States, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   About 200 retired army officers who are also members of
Zhirinovsky's party offered to serve as volunteers in Saddam's
army, ITAR-Tass reported. They sent a letter to the Iraqi Embassy
in Moscow offering their services.

Serb officers sought by the Hague tribunal heard as witnesses

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three Serb officers sought by a U.N.
war crimes tribunal appeared as witnesses at a Yugoslav military
probe into alleged 1991 war crimes, in defiance of international
demands to hand over the case and the suspects to The Hague court.
	   Two representatives of the U.N. tribunal also attended the
hearings in the Belgrade Military Court, according to a statement
from the court carried by the official Tanjug news agency.
	   The statement added that Veselin Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic
and Milan Mrksic, accused of ordering the 1991 massacre of 261
Croats taken out of a hospital in Vukovar in eastern Croatia,
``testified as witnesses.''
	   The statement further said that in their testimonies the three
responded to allegations from the Hague indictment. The Belgrade
military court said the proceedings will continue.
	   ``I have no comment at all about this proceedings,'' said The
Hague court investigator Denis Milner as he came out of the
military court building.
	   The move by the Belgrade government, loyal to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, has been criticized by The Hague tribunal and
the West.
	   In Montenegro's capital Podgorica, a top U.S. human rights
official blasted the Belgrade trial, saying it defied international
demands.
	   ``These actions show contempt for democracy, human rights and
the rule of law,'' said Harold Koh, U.S. assistant secretary of
state for human rights.
	   Yugoslavia refuses to extradite its citizens accused of war
crimes citing the country's constitution, which bars extradition.
Defying international pressure the military court held its own
probe against ``unknown persons'' involved in the Vukovar massacre.

Study: Chocolate lovers may live longer

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Scientists already have suggested that eating
chocolate may make you happy. Now they say men who indulge in
chocolates may live longer.
	   A study of 7,841 Harvard male graduates found that chocolate and
candy eaters _ regardless of how voracious their appetite for
goodies _ live almost a year longer than those who abstain.
	   The researchers from Harvard University's School of Public
Health, whose study was published in this week's issue of the
British Medical Journal, said they don't know why this is. They
speculate, however, that antioxidants present in chocolate may have
a health benefit.
	   The scientists stress their findings are preliminary, and other
experts caution that the research does not prove the results can be
attributed to the antioxidants.
	   In the study, those who ate a ``moderate'' amount of sweets _
allowing themselves only one to three candy bars a month _ fared
the best, having a 36 percent lower risk of death compared with
non-candy eaters.
	   Although they fared worse than the moderates, the more ardent
confectionery eaters _ classified as those treating themselves to
three or more sweets a week _ still lived longer than those who had
banished candy from their lives, with a 16 percent decreased risk
of death.
	   Scientists previously have found that chocolate contains
phenols, antioxidant chemicals also present in wine. Antioxidants
prevent fat-like substances in the blood from oxidizing and
clogging the arteries.
	   ``It's raising a hypothesis that, if true, would bring cheer to
those who like chocolate,'' said Dr. I-Min Lee, an epidemiology
professor at Harvard who led the research.
	   The study, in which men were questioned in 1988 about their
candy habits over the past year, did not count chocolate sauce,
cake or other chocolate consumed in desserts.
	   The men, who started the study at an average age of 65, were
followed for five years, by which time 514 had died.
	   The results took into account factors including weight, smoking
and other lifestyle habits, but Lee still warned that other health
effects could have played a role.
	   Andrew Waterhouse, a wine chemist at the University of
California at Davis who has researched chocolate's antioxidant
properties, said the Harvard hypothesis that the decrease in death
risk could be linked to chocolate is ``plausible.''
	   He said he was surprised, however, by the finding that eating
only three chocolate bars a month was associated with a lower death
risk and doubted that was due to phenol.
	   ``That frequency is so low it was surprising there would be any
benefit from an antioxidant effect _ if that's the full
explanation,'' he said. ``Oranges are high in antioxidants and you
wouldn't expect much benefit from eating three oranges a month.''
	   Dr. Catherine Rice-Evans, a professor of biochemistry at Guy's
Hospital in London, also doubted that the phenols in chocolate
could explain the results.
	   She said she also was suspicious that the study did not find
that the more chocolate the men ate, the lower their risk of death.
	   ``That observation suggests to me that it's nothing to do with
the chocolate,'' she said, adding that studies controlling the diet
are necessary to discover if it is a real effect of chocolate.

	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ Guinea's President Lansana Conte, who
first seized power in a coup 14 years ago, has emerged victorious
in presidential elections held earlier this week, state radio
reported Thursday.
	   Opposition politicians, though, have lashed out at the vote,
saying it was rigged in Conte's favor.
	   Conte won 54.12 percent, or 1,454,007 votes, in Monday's
elections in this West African country, according to final but
unofficial results that have yet to be approved by the country's
top court, the radio station said.
	   Mamadou Ba, leader of the Union for Progress and Renewal, came
in second with 24.63 percent of the votes or 638,563 ballots cast,
the radio station said. Ba is believed to have wide support in the
country's interior.
	   In third place, with 16.58 percent or 429,770 votes, was Alpha
Conde, the presidential rival who was arrested Tuesday while
reportedly trying to illegally cross the border into neighboring
Ivory Coast.
	   Police also arrested another opposition leader Marcel Cros, a
leader of the tiny African Democratic Party of Guinea, in a
separate incident on Saturday for alleged illegal possession of
military weapons in his home, state radio said.
	   Counts released earlier Monday showed Conte winning 15 of 18
electoral districts counted, including one area where opponents
gained only 12 votes to Conte's 60,777. Guinea has 38 electoral
districts.
	   Opposition parties have accused the government of rigging the
vote in Conte's favor, saying the regime remained firmly in control
of the electoral process and inflaming tensions with the arrests.
	   Although voting went ahead peacefully, the arrests have
increased tensions in Guinea's capital. Several hundred people
began marching through the streets of the capital towards Conde's
home Wednesday before police cut short the protest by firing
teargas into the crowds, witnesses said.
	   Both detained politicians were believed to be in paramilitary
quarters in Conakry and opposition officials said on condition of
anonymity that as many as 15 other government opponents had also
been seized.
	   Six people were believed killed in Conakry street clashes on
Saturday after a ruling party rally.
	   Conte seized power in 1984 after the death of Guinea's former
dictator, Sekou Toure.
	   Guinea, which has an average per capita income of just a few
hundred dollars a year and an illiteracy rate of up to 80 percent,
is still recovering from Toure's 26-year regime. Thousands of
people died in prison camps, and 2 million people fled the country.
	   While Conte has allowed greater political freedom, his critics
say he has become more autocratic since a military revolt in 1996
by soldiers angry over unpaid wages.

US human rights official praises Montenegro

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top State Department human rights
official Thursday pledged strong U.S. support for Montenegro,
praising the Yugoslav republic's ``fine record'' in respecting
human rights and democracy.
	   Harold Koh, an assistant secretary of state, met Montenegro's
reformist president, Milo Djukanovic, as part of a tour of
Yugoslavia, which will include a visit to Serbia's restive Kosovo
province on Friday. The Yugoslav federation consists of Serbia and
much smaller Montenegro.
	   Koh said that Montenegro, where opponents of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic took power last year, stands in ``stark
contrast'' to Serbia, where autocratic Milosevic has full control.
Koh visited Belgrade Wednesday.
	   ``In Belgrade I saw government repression of the media,
government repression of universities, and deep assault on the
institutions of civil society,'' Koh said, adding Milosevic's
regime shows ``contempt for democracy, human rights and the rule of
law.''
	   But Koh praised what he called Montenegro's ``fine record on
these points,'' adding ``the U.S. government strongly supports
Montengro's steps toward democracy and human rights.''

	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Seattle quit the race to host the 2012 Summer
Olympics on Thursday.
	   The Seattle Olympic Bid Committee, formed to seek the 2012
Games, withdrew its candidacy and disbanded for lack of civic
support.
	   The decision by the committee's executive board followed an 8-1
City Council vote Monday, reiterating the council's decision
against supporting an official Olympic bid.
	   Such a governmental endorsement _ including a pledge to
underwrite any losses _ is required before the U.S. Olympic
Committee will consider a bid.
	   Seattle had been an early favorite to secure USOC selection as
the American city that will go against international challengers in
a race that won't be decided until an International Olympic
Committee vote in 2005.
	   The withdrawal leaves eight U.S. hopefuls _
Baltimore-Washington, Cincinnati, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, New
York, Orlando-Tampa and San Francisco.

Czech Skoda signs deal for car plant in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Czech car maker Skoda and Russian government
officials signed an agreement Thursday to set up a Skoda-controlled
car assembly facility in Russia.
	   Some details of the deal have yet to be worked out, including
breaks for Skoda on taxes and customs duties.
	   Skoda Chairman Vratislav Kulhanek told a news conference in
Moscow that the company hoped to sign a final agreement by next
May, and produce 5,000 cars next year.
	   The plant will be based in the city of Izhevsk, 1,350 kilometers
(810 miles) east of Moscow, and the Russian state-controlled
Izhmash Holding will hold a minority stake. Izhmash used to be
Russia's major manufacturer of light army vehicles, motorcycles and
other defense-related products.
	   Thursday's agreement was signed by Czech Vice Premier Pavel
Mertlik and Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov.
	   Skoda, majority-owned by the German auto maker Volkswagen, will
invest about dlrs 300 million in the Izhevsk plant with a capacity
of 80,000 cars a year by 2004, Kulhanek said.
	   Skoda officials declined to elaborate on the tax and customs
duties concessions they are seeking.
	   President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree this spring which allows
foreign companies to import parts, equipment and finished vehicles
duty-free for a limited period, provided they invest dlrs 250
million in Russia over five years.

BAGHDAD: night attack.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The Military Industrial Corporation, which is in charge of
Iraq's factories, was heavily damaged during the 1991 Gulf War but
has since been rebuilt. It is near the Rashid Hotel, where Iraq
houses visiting dignitaries and reporters.
	   Earlier in the day, sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS
Enterprise in the Gulf loaded thousands of pounds of laser-guided
weapons on warplanes in preparation for the second attack.
	   Thursday night's attack came after air raid sirens sounded
repeatedly during the day, but until the night time attack all
proved to be false alarms.
	   Despite urging by Russia and China for a halt to the attacks,
U.S. President Bill Clinton had suggested earlier that the strikes
would continue. U.S. officials have said the attacks would go on
for four days.
	   The full extent of damage and casualties from the hundreds of
missiles fired in the early morning hours Thursday was unclear.
Foreign reporters in Baghdad are based at a press center in the
Information Ministry and cannot move around the sprawling city of 5
million without official escorts.
	   An Iraqi doctor reported five people killed and 30 wounded.
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf referred to ``heavy
casualties'' in civilian areas of Baghdad, but declined to give
specific figures.
	   In Washington, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said headquarters of Iraq's special forces and
military intelligence were leveled by sea-launched Tomahawk cruise
missiles.
	   Clinton, meeting in the Oval Office with top military and
foreign policy advisers Thursday morning, expressed regret that
there would inevitably be ``unintended casualties.''
	   The American president said Wednesday he ordered ``Operation
Desert Fox'' to prevent Iraq from building the chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons it was prohibited from having under U.N.
resolutions after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   In Baghdad Thursday, one sign of an expected second attack was
residents lining up at gas stations to stock up on fuel.
	   But many people went about their normal routines _ government
workers showed up at their offices and children at schools _ and
some gave a show of defiance.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
Salam Mohammed, 34, mumbled from a bed in Baghdad's al-Yarmouk
Hospital bed, his face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Air raid sirens sounded repeatedly in Baghdad Thursday afternoon
and evening. One went off as al-Sahhaf was holding a news
conference to accuse the United States and Britain of committing
crimes against the Iraqi people.
	   Britain had lent its support to the U.S. attack Thursday
morning, but did not take part. Al-Sahhaf accused both nations of
lying in claiming that the report of the U.N. chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler proved Iraq had not cooperated in the
search for its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This aggression against Iraq is a crime against international
law, the U.N. charter, and we will hold our full right to hold them
responsible _ the Americans and British _ for all the crimes they
are committing against our people,'' al-Sahhaf told the news
conference.
	   He said inspection teams had carried out visits to 427 sites
since the last stand-off over weapons inspections in mid-November
and there had been only five cases of non-cooperation.
	   The inspectors have the job of certifying Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step before the U.N.
Security Council will lift damaging trade sanctions imposed on Iraq
for its invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf said the five sites that caused trouble did not
justify ``a dangerous crime against the people of Iraq.''
	   One proposed visit was to an office of Iraq's ruling Baath
Party, he said. Two others were a problem because they occurred on
Friday, the Muslim day of worship when most people are not working,
al-Sahhaf said.
	   In one case, he said, the inspectors tried to visit a former
office of a security official that had been changed into a guest
house. He said inspectors were delayed for 45 minutes in entering
the building as Iraqi authorities tried to explain the change.
	   ``Do you deserve to be bombarded because you have delayed an
inspection team 45 minutes?'' al-Sahhaf asked.
	   Al-Sahhaf also listed examples of targets struck in the American
attack, including factories and the headquarters of the security
police and military intelligence.
	   He said the two headquarters have been inspected more than once
by U.N. arms experts and many of the factories had U.N. cameras as
part of permanent monitoring of potential weapons sites.
	   The minister said that instead of calling their campaign
Operation Desert Fox, the allies should have named it ``Operation
Villains in the Arabian Desert.''
	   In the Thursday morning's attacks, the warships fired more than
200 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck
Iraqi air defense radars, Pentagon officials said.
	   Saddam visited some of the targeted sites Thursday, including
the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad Radio reported. Hala, the
youngest of his three daughters, was safe, but the house was
demolished, it said.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in a radio address,
saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face'' but
``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known at the time
of the attack.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.

UNDATED: they suffer.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALBRIGHT: And who cares about them and how they suffer. And I
think that in my conversations with mostly the Arab leaders, but
this is true of the other leaders that I've spoken with, there is
genuine concern about the Iraqi people, and that they have suffered
under this cruel dictator for decades now and that they are _ that
they really ought to have the possibility of a choice of their
leadership. And that they clearly are better people potentially
than the leader that they have now who is imposing his will on
them.
	   Q: Madam Secretary, in your conversation with these 20 foreign
leaders, have the comments _ have they reacted to the comments that
they saw on CNN and other places of Senator Lott and Congressman
Solomon, and especially your predecessor, Mr. Eagleburger, who said
the timing 'smelled'? Did that raise questions among those leaders
to you?
	   ALBRIGHT: Frankly, it didn't, which I tell you _ they did not.
The did not ask those questions. I did actually speak to my
predecessor, Secretary Eagleburger, last night and I'm very sorry
that I didn't speak to him before he made those comments because I
was _you know, a little secret about me, I always wake up to the
radio.
	   And I woke up to Larry Eagleburger's voice this morning
basically saying that having spoken to me last night and that I had
assured him that there was no connection of the timing to the
current domestic issues, that he took me at my word and therefore,
he believed that that was not a _ did not play a role in the
decision.
	   Would you please comment on the question _ parliament's
decision, statement that this action _ this act could make it more
difficult to ratify START II?
	   ALBRIGHT: Well, I think that I have heard that, but the truth is
that the only reason that the Russians would ratify START II is
it's in their national interest. And there have also been
statements by various Russian leaders who are concerned about the
fact that if START II is not ratified, then they will have to use
scarce defense funds for the problem of maintaining missiles that
they don't need, rather than on some of their other force needs.
	   So we hope very much that the ratification of START II will go
forward because it's in our national interest and because it's in
Russia's national interest. Otherwise, they wouldn't have signed
on.
	   QUESTION: Madam Secretary, on a related question, can you
comment on temporary closures of U.S. embassies in Africa, and
whether it's related in any way to action _ to the action in Iraq?
	   ALBRIGHT: We have temporarily closed our embassies and done some
ordered departures in Kuwait and in Israel because we are concerned
about general threats and the heightened situation.
	   Yes?
	   Q: Yes, Madam Secretary, the support that you say you are
hearing from the foreign leaders you speak to, who are also
expressing concern for the Iraqi people, do they say that they are
basing their support in the belief that your strategy will bring
relief to the Iraqi people _ your strategy, your short-, medium-
and long-term strategy for Iraq?
	   ALBRIGHT: I think that they _ that isn't quite the way the
question has worked. But let me do something first and explain. I
have tried, being a professor, to group my answers in some kind of
a way as to how these polls have gone. And I think they're kind of
in four groups.
	   The first is of those who are strongly supportive of what we
have done, the list I have read. And I think in addition to that
list there's also Denmark and Norway. And there are those who are
strongly supportive of what we're doing.
	   Then there are the Arab countries who are supportive and are
giving us the support that we need to carry on this mission. And
they are the ones, I think, that are primarily voicing the problems
of the Iraqi people.
	   I think the others have mentioned it. But clearly, it's the Arab
countries that are the most concerned about it.
	   The third group are those who, I would say the kind of key word
for their comments is they regret this. And they regret it because
Saddam Hussein led us into this situation. Oh, and let me just say
back on the Arabs, they also are very clear about the fact that it
was Saddam Hussein's responsibility that this happened, as they
made clear in their GCC statement, and as they have repeated to me
on the phone.
	   But the regret group are basically regretful of the fact that we
have come to this and that a diplomatic solution has not been
found.
	   And then there's the fourth group, which are really the Russians
and the Chinese.
	   So, but the main concern about the Iraqi people I think clearly
come from the Arab group.
	   And I think that I would read into what they're saying is that
basically they are concerned about civilian casualties. And I've
told them that we are doing everything we can to avoid that. But
they are concerned about the long-term situation of the Iraqi
people, and I've talked about the fact that the oil-for-food
program needs to be in place, and that we think _ and they agree _
that some other form of government, some other leader, would be of
help to the Iraqi people.
	   These are general discussions only.
	   Q: Could I just follow up?
	   And they _ they support this long-term strategy?
	   ALBRIGHT: I _ It depends, frankly. There are some _ I think it's
inappropriate for me to really go into it.
	   (UNKNOWN): Last question.
	   Q: In your discussion with Arab leaders, have you found that
they would regard continuing bombing during Ramadan as less
offensive that initiating bombing during Ramadan?
	   ALBRIGHT: Specifically, we have not talked about that. And I
have _ but I have expressed the fact that we are sensitive to the
fact that Ramadan is going _ is about to be upon us.
	   But frankly, they have not talked about it. I am the one that
has initiated the fact that _ just the way that the president did
in his statement _ that we are sensitive to Ramadan.
	   (UNKNOWN): Thank you very much.
	   ALBRIGHT: Thank you.
	   OK. Thanks.

Unlike others, nuclear inspectors have it easier in Iraq

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Not all U.N. weapons inspectors are down
on Iraq. The agency investigating Iraq's nuclear program says it
has run into far fewer problems than Richard Butler's inspection
teams.
	   Butler's U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, rejects
Iraq's claims it has destroyed all of its weapons of mass
destruction, and he accuses the Baghdad government of obstructing
teams trying to verify their elimination. UNSCOM inspects and
monitors chemical and biological weapons programs as well as those
involving long-range missiles.
	   The International Atomic Energy Agency, on the other hand, has
said it believes Iraq no longer has much to hide in the area of
nuclear weapons.
	   The IAEA, based in Vienna, has given Iraq fairly good marks,
saying it has provided ``the necessary level of cooperation'' to
enable the nuclear inspectors to complete their work ``efficiently
and effectively.''
	   But IAEA officials say their job has been easier than that of
UNSCOM, and therefore less confrontational.
	   ``They've had a harder time, so they had to pursue their work
much more toughly and with larger teams than we did,'' IAEA
spokesman David Kyd told The Associated Press.
	   Iraq's nuclear facilities were heavily damaged during the 1991
Gulf War and, Kyd noted, it is harder to hide a clandestine nuclear
program. ``Biological and chemical weapons can be squirreled away
anywhere in pharmaceutical or plants or elsewhere,'' he said.
	   The IAEA says it has dismantled much of what survived the Gulf
War. However, the Washington-based Nuclear Control Institute
suggests nuclear inspectors were relatively unimpeded because they
were less demanding.
	   If UNSCOM, rather than IAEA, was responsible for nuclear
inspections, ``there would not be the dangerously mistaken
impression that exists today that Iraq's nuclear weapons threat is
dead,'' said Paul Levanthal, president of the Nuclear Control
Institute.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ U.S. missiles struck the Iraqi capital Thursday
night in a second round of air strikes. At least a dozen explosions
were heard in Baghdad, and a pall of smoke hung over the downtown.
	   The attack came as U.S. officials were still assessing damage
from the strike by hundreds of missiles in the early morning hours
of Thursday.
	   In Washington, officials at the Pentagon, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said cruise missiles were fired deep into Iraq in the
second attack and Navy strike aircraft fired laser-guided bombs
along Iraq's borders.
	   At the government's press office in downtown Baghdad, witnesses
said one missile was seen flying over Thursday night. After the
first explosion was heard at 9:57 p.m. (1857gmt), anti-aircraft
fire came in response and tracer bullets darted into the night sky.
	   The blasts grew increasingly louder as they came nearer the
downtown. One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the
government's Military Industrial Corporation, from where smoke
drifted into the sky.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the Thursday
night attack.

Albanian students defy police and continue hunger strike

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Dozens of Albanian students defied police
orders on Thursday and continued a week-long hunger strike,
demanding improved dormitories and better scholarships.
	   Police ordered a group of 40 students to leave a disco in Tirana
University dormitories where they had been protesting, officials
said.
	   Prime Minister Pandeli Majko said the strike was ordered stopped
because police had ``information that terrorist attacks against the
students had been planned,'' and because one of the students had
been diagnosed with hepatitis.
	   But later in the day, 30 students returned to continue the
strike.
	   The students, from Tirana and Skodra universities, have refused
to end their protests despite government promises to invest the
equivalent of $70,000 to improve dormitories.
	   Student unrest has played an important role in Albanian
politics, and student strikes preceded both the fall of the
communist government in 1991 and former president Sali Berisha.
	   The Albanian information ministry says the son of Berisha is
among the strike organizers. Berisha supporters have held rallies
in support of the students, calling on them to continue the hunger
strike until Majko steps down.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ U.S. missiles struck the Iraqi capital Thursday
night in a second round of air strikes. At least a dozen explosions
were heard in Baghdad, and a pall of smoke hung over the downtown.
	   The attack came as U.S. officials were still assessing damage
from the strike by hundreds of missiles in the early morning hours
of Thursday.
	   In Washington, officials at the Pentagon, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said cruise missiles were fired deep into Iraq in the
second attack and Navy strike aircraft fired laser-guided bombs
along Iraq's borders.
	   At the government's press office in downtown Baghdad, witnesses
said one missile was seen flying over Thursday night. After the
first explosion was heard at 9:57 p.m. (1857gmt), anti-aircraft
fire came in response and tracer bullets darted into the night sky.
	   The blasts grew increasingly louder as they came nearer the
downtown. One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the
government's Military Industrial Corporation, from where smoke
drifted into the sky.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the Thursday
night attack.
	   The Military Industrial Corporation, which is in charge of
Iraq's factories, was heavily damaged during the 1991 Gulf War but
has since been rebuilt. It is near the Rashid Hotel, where Iraq
houses visiting dignitaries and reporters.
	   Earlier in the day, sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS
Enterprise in the Gulf loaded thousands of pounds of laser-guided
weapons on warplanes in preparation for the second attack.
	   Thursday night's attack came after air raid sirens sounded
repeatedly during the day, but until the night attack all proved to
be false alarms.
	   Despite urging by Russia and China for a halt to the attacks,
U.S. President Bill Clinton had said earlier that the strikes would
continue. U.S. officials have said the strikes would go on for four
days.
	   The full extent of damage and casualties from the hundreds of
missiles fired in the early morning hours Thursday was unclear.
Foreign reporters in Baghdad are based at a press center in the
Information Ministry and cannot move around the sprawling city of 5
million without official escorts.
	   An Iraqi doctor reported five people killed and 30 wounded.
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf referred to ``heavy
casualties'' in civilian areas of Baghdad, but declined to give
specific figures.
	   In Washington, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said headquarters of Iraq's special forces and
military intelligence were leveled by sea-launched Tomahawk cruise
missiles.
	   Clinton, meeting in the Oval Office with top military and
foreign policy advisers Thursday morning, expressed regret that
there would inevitably be ``unintended casualties.''
	   The American president said Wednesday he ordered ``Operation
Desert Fox'' to prevent Iraq from building the chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons it was prohibited from having under U.N.
resolutions after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   In Baghdad Thursday, one sign of an expected second attack was
residents lining up at gas stations to stock up on fuel.
	   But many people went about their normal routines _ government
workers showed up at their offices and children at schools _ and
some gave a show of defiance.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
Salam Mohammed, 34, mumbled from a bed in Baghdad's al-Yarmouk
Hospital bed, his face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Air raid sirens sounded repeatedly in Baghdad Thursday afternoon
and evening. One went off as al-Sahhaf was holding a news
conference to accuse the United States and Britain of committing
crimes against the Iraqi people.
	   Britain had lent its support to the U.S. attack Thursday
morning, but did not take part. Al-Sahhaf accused both nations of
lying in claiming that the report of the U.N. chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler proved Iraq had not cooperated in the
search for its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This aggression against Iraq is a crime against international
law, the U.N. charter, and we will hold our full right to hold them
responsible _ the Americans and British _ for all the crimes they
are committing against our people,'' al-Sahhaf told the news
conference.
	   He said inspection teams had carried out visits to 427 sites
since the last stand-off over weapons inspections in mid-November
and there had been only five cases of non-cooperation.
	   The inspectors have the job of certifying Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step before the U.N.
Security Council will lift damaging trade sanctions imposed on Iraq
for its invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf said the five sites that caused trouble did not
justify ``a dangerous crime against the people of Iraq.''
	   One proposed visit was to an office of Iraq's ruling Baath
Party, he said. Two others were a problem because they occurred on
Friday, the Muslim day of worship when most people are not working,
al-Sahhaf said.
	   In one case, he said, the inspectors tried to visit a former
office of a security official that had been changed into a guest
house. He said inspectors were delayed for 45 minutes in entering
the building as Iraqi authorities tried to explain the change.
	   ``Do you deserve to be bombarded because you have delayed an
inspection team 45 minutes?'' al-Sahhaf asked.
	   Al-Sahhaf also listed examples of targets struck in the American
attack, including factories and the headquarters of the security
police and military intelligence.
	   He said the two headquarters have been inspected more than once
by U.N. arms experts and many of the factories had U.N. cameras as
part of permanent monitoring of potential weapons sites.
	   The minister said that instead of calling their campaign
Operation Desert Fox, the allies should have named it ``Operation
Villains in the Arabian Desert.''
	   In the Thursday morning's attacks, the warships fired more than
200 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck
Iraqi air defense radars, Pentagon officials said.
	   Saddam visited some of the targeted sites Thursday, including
the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad Radio reported. Hala, the
youngest of his three daughters, was safe, but the house was
demolished, it said.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in a radio address,
saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face'' but
``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known at the time
of the attack.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Major oil producers Saudi Arabia, Mexico
and Venezuela agreed Thursday to maintain reduced output through
1999 and to seek cuts by other oil producers in order to bring down
supplies and improve sagging prices.
	   Ministers of oil and energy from the three nations said after a
meeting in the Spanish capital that they ``urge other producing
countries to strictly comply with their commitments.''
	   The meeting followed similar gatherings of oil ministers from
other countries. All were searching for a so-far elusive answer to
the question of how to bring the price of oil higher.
	   Crude prices, depressed by overproduction amid a global economic
crisis, have hovered this year around 12-year lows, costing
oil-dependent nations billions of dollars in revenue.
	   The statement said Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela reaffirmed
their commitment to the agreed reductions in June 1998, 725,000
barrels a day and 200,000 barrels a day respectively.
	   The Saudis and the Mexicans have already announced their
decisions to extend reduction agreements until the end of next
year, the statement added.
	   ``Venezuela, sharing the same spirit and resolution, will
immediately undertake decisions required to extend its production
restrictions until December 1999,'' the three ministers said in the
joint statement.
	   Venezuela had agreed to reductions of 525,000 barrels a day.
	   Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico have led an initiative to cut
production this year which led to an agreement at the end of June
by OPEC, excluding Iraq, and non-OPEC members to cut production by
a total of 3.1 million barrels a day for a period of one year
starting July 1.
	   Analysts and some OPEC members have said another additional 1.5
million barrels must be taken off the market to begin having an
effect on prices.
	   The officials from the three nations also agreed to ``initiate
immediate actions to discuss with other producers further measures
that translate into a large stock draw-down and improvement of oil
prices.''
	   The statement said consultations will be carried out with other
oil-producing countries and that ``visits had been arranged for the
very near future.''
	   Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Naimi was expected to fly to
Norway after the Madrid meeting. Norway has already agreed to cut
100,000 barrels a day until the end of the year.
	   A senior Saudi source, speaking on condition he is not
identified further, said Saudi Arabia will consult with OPEC
colleagues while Mexico and Venezuela will initiate talks with oil
producers in their region, such as Colombia and Ecuador.
	   Saudi Arabia is the leading producer among the 11-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, with output at about
8 million barrels per day. Venezuela is OPEC's No. 3 exporter
Venezuela, producing about 2.8 million barrels a day. Mexico, which
is not a member of the organization, produces 3.2 million barrels a
day.
	   The slide in oil prices has continued despite repeated attempts
earlier this year at production cuts, including those implemented
by some OPEC members.
	   The price of Brent crude has traded at around dlrs 10 a barrel.
A Gulf source close to the Saudis said earlier Thursday that the
oil-rich kingdom would like to see a price target for Brent at
between dlrs 15 and dlrs 20.

	   LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) _ A small plane crashed Thursday
afternoon into a residential neighborhood in this Central African
capital city, killing the two pilots and damaging a number of
houses, witnesses said.
	   At least two other people were injured on the ground, the
witnesses told state radio.
	   Airport officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
plane belonged to the Gabonese local airline Air Service and was
headed from Libreville to the coastal oil city Port Gentil.
	   There were no passengers in the plane when it crashed between
4:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. (1530 GMT and 1600 GMT), the officials said.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ About 100 supporters of former Georgian
President Zviad Gamsakhurdia were arrested Thursday after holding
an unauthorized protest in front of the parliament.
	   The demonstrators were led by Gamsakhurdia's widow, Manana
Archadze-Gamsakhurdia, who said they were protesting mistreatment
by authorities in this former Soviet republic. No violence was
reported.
	   Earlier this month, Gamsakhurdia's followers clashed with police
in the Georgian capital after the demonstrators tried to block
traffic on a central street.
	   Gamsakhurdia was ousted in 1992 and died under mysterious
circumstances in 1994.
	   Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze told his Cabinet on
Wednesday that attempts at ``using the difficult social and
economic situation to weaken the executive branch'' would be
thwarted.
	   Gamsakhurdia's supporters claim Shevardnadze's government is
illegal, and they staged a mutiny against Shevardnadze at a
military garrison this fall that failed after one day.

KLA denies involvement in Pec shootings, vows revenge for border

clashes

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian rebels denied
responsibility Thursday for the Pec shootings that have enraged
Serbs across the province, and promised retaliation on Serb forces
for the border killings of 36 guerrillas.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which Serb authorities blame for the
slayings of six young Serbs in a bar in western Kosovo on Monday,
made the remarks in a statement issued to ethnic Albanian media.
	   The KLA, it said, has not committed or in any way abetted ``the
miserable murders of Serb youths in a Pec cafe. We are convinced
that this is the act of Serb secret police in order to further
strain relations between Serbs and Albanians.''
	   ``The murders of more than 30 of our soldiers and commanders
will not induce us to take revenge on the civilian population _ we
shall take revenge on the Serb police and the military,'' it said.
	   In their statement, the rebels also said the Serbs have not
abided by an October peace agreement and the KLA has suffered more
casualties during the last two months than during more than seven
months of fighting.
	   ``This leads us to seriously question our restraint so far,'' it
said.

Asian crisis, bad weather slow down economic growth in Latin
</HEADLINE>
America &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Average economic growth in Latin America
and the Caribbean dropped to 2.3 percent in 1998 from 5.2 percent a
year earlier, due mainly to the Asian financial turmoil and adverse
weather conditions, a U.N. agency reported Thursday.
	   And growth will further slow down to only 1 percent in 1999, the
Santiago-based Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean (ECCLA) said in its annual report on the regional
economies.
	   Still, given the difficult conditions, the results for this year
should be considered reasonable, ECCLA said. It noted regional
growth was above the world rate of 2 percent.
	   The picture looks better in the inflation front, with a regional
rate of 10.2 percent this year, similar to that of 1997.
	   Some countries were badly affected by the steep drop of
international prices for products such as oil and copper, which
caused losses estimated at dlrs 10 billion to the region.
	   Chile, the world's largest copper exporter, and Venezuela, a
major oil exporter, were especially hit.
	   The region as a whole succeeded in curbing pressures on
employment, ECCLA said. Average regional unemployment grew only to
7.9 percent from 7.3 percent the previous year.
	   The economic difficulties were mainly the result of the Asian
financial crisis and adverse weather conditions, such as El Nino
phenomenon and hurricanes George and Mitch, that caused massive
destruction in the Caribbean and Central America.
	   El Nino, a cyclical warming of the water in the Pacific Ocean,
triggered weather changes this year that caused damages estimated
at billions of dollars, especially in Ecuador, Peru and Chile where
it seriously affected fishing activities.
	   Mexico and Bolivia led the individual economic growth rates in
the region with 4.5 percent, followed by Argentina and Chile with 4
percent.
	   ECCLA's executive secretary Jose Ocampo said recovery in the
region will only begin in the second half of 1999.
	   ``But the continued slowdown in Brazil and elsewhere this year
will keep growth at around 1 percent'' next year, the Colombian
economist said.
	   He also warned the regional situation will continue to depend
greatly ``on the programs to reactivate economies around the
world.''
	   ``We will depend on industrialized economies registering an
expansion and on the situation in Brazil,'' he added.

Polish peasant party to support Solidarity in dispute over secret
</HEADLINE>
files &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The opposition Polish Peasant's Party
agreed Thursday to join forces with the Solidarity-led government
in its battle with the president over a bill that would open
communist-era files.
	   The move indicates the governing coalition of parties linked to
the movement that toppled communist rule almost a decade ago could
score a major victory over President Aleksander Kwasniewski, a
former communist, by mustering a 60 percent majority in
Parliament's lower chamber to override his veto. The parliament was
expected to take action Friday morning on the veto.
	   Only the largest opposition party, the reformed communists, said
it will support the ex-communist president.
	   The opening of the files would mark a major step in a
longstanding political dispute over how to confront Poland's bitter
past.
	   On Dec. 12, Kwasniewski vetoed the government-backed bill that
would open secret police files to victims of communist-era
repression, saying it would give too much power to the institute
managing the files. He also said all Poles, not only victims of
totalitarian regimes, should be allowed to see their records.
	   Passed by parliament on Sept. 22, the bill would create an
Institute of National Remembrance to collect communist files from
1944-89, as well as documents of Stalinist and Nazi crimes. Besides
making files available to victims, the institute would have power
to launch investigations to establish those responsible for
persecution or political murders.
	   Trying to muster the majority needed to override the veto,
Solidarity leaders promised the peasants to amend the law in order
that opposition parties could have their say in appointing the head
of the institute.
	   Peasant leaders have insisted that the head of the institute be
elected by a 60 percent majority in the powerful lower chamber, or
Sejm. The law requires only a simple majority vote to elect the
head of the institute.
	   Solidarity's declaration that the law will be amended is
satisfactory for us, peasant leader Jaroslaw Kalinowski said
Thursday announcing his party's decision.
	   Shifts in allegiances have occurred since the election in 1997,
but were only expected to affect a few seats at the most. In
September 1997, Solidarity won 201 seats in the 460-seat Sejm. Its
junior government ally, the Freedom Union had 60, the peasants won
27. There were also six members of Movement for Poland's
Reconstruction, and two representatives of the German minority.
	   The former communists had 164 votes.

Serb police launch Kosovo sweep against KLA over Pec slayings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 8-9 and 13 with KLA accusing Serb secret
police in Pec shootings, vowing revenge against Serb forces for
border attack &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police who said they were hunting
for the murderers of six Kosovo Serbs attacked a suspected
rebel-controlled village Thursday, reportedly killing two ethnic
Albanian fighters in a day-long battle and arresting 34.
	   The clash that began around dawn near Glodjane was one of the
biggest in months in Kosovo, where a wobbly October truce that has
held across most of the Serbian province is in increasing danger of
breaking down altogether.
	   International monitors who got near the western Kosovo village,
located 10 kilometers (six miles) south of the city of Pec, said
they heard shelling and heavy fighting.
	   ``It was war,'' said a European monitor who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   Police also sealed off a northwestern suburb of Pec as part of
the sweep. An armored personnel carrier and policemen wearing flak
jackets blocked a bridge leading to Kapesnica, and police snipers
looked down from surrounding rooftops.
	   ``We are in pursuit of the perpetrators of the shooting in the
Panda bar,'' a police commander said, referring to the bar where
the six young Serbs were slaughtered. He spoke on condition his
name not be used.
	   Monday's brutal shootings, carried out by masked gunmen who
riddled the Serb bar with automatic weapons fire, dangerously
fueled tensions in a province still reeling from over 1,000 deaths
in months of fighting this year between Serb forces and separatist
rebels.
	   It was the second major clash this week, coming three days after
Yugoslav army border guards killed 36 guerrillas entering from
Albania.
	   The KLA issued a statement late Thursday accusing Serb secret
police of carrying out the barroom shootings as a pretext to crack
down further on Kosovo Albanians. It also promised to retaliate
against Serbian forces over the border killings.
	   Police told the Serb-run Media Center in Pristina that after
officers searching for suspects in Glodjane came under fire, police
killed two people wearing camouflage uniforms bearing the KLA
insignia and armed with assault rifles and mortars.
	   They said they arrested 34 people from a ``terrorist gang'' in
Glodjane and Kapesnica and discovered large quantities of arms,
ammunition and KLA uniforms.
	   The international Kosovo Verification Mission sent several teams
to the area, and American and other officials held talks with
Serbian police in an unsuccessful attempt to calm the situation.
Hours later the clash was reported still going on.
	   The KLA, which is fighting to drive Serb police out of Kosovo
and break the province away from Serbia, denied involvement in
Monday's attack.
	   But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this week to arrest
the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   The state-run Borba daily called Thursday, in a sharply worded
commentary, for the withdrawal of international verifiers and U.S.
envoys from Kosovo, saying they are ``direct instigators and
helpers of the crimes committed by Albanian terrorists.''
	   Serbs held a protest rally concerning the killings for a second
straight day Thursday, this time in front of the headquarters of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs
the verifying force.
	   About 300 Serbs whistled derisively and booed, and demanded an
immediate meeting with mission chief William Walker, an American
diplomat, who said he would meet with them Friday. Complaining that
the international verifiers are failing to ease tensions and not
responding sufficiently to the Pec killings, they chanted, ``Put
them in chains!''
	   The killings have cast further gloom over stalled diplomatic
efforts to resolve the Serb-Albanian standoff in Kosovo, where
dozens have died in sporadic clashes since the October agreement.
	   Serbian authorities say they are willing to grant only limited
autonomy for Kosovo, while most of the overwhelmingly
Albanian-populated province want independence from Serbia _ the
dominant republic remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   In a related development Thursday, Serbia announced a media
crackdown in Kosovo, warning the province's ethnic Albanian
newspapers to cease support for ``terrorism'' or face legal charges
under the government's restrictive new media law.
	   The government information ministry said some Albanian-language
papers have carried reports which ``directly instigate terrorism.''

Gershwin centenary celebrations climax with Ozawa concert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Yearlong 100th anniversary celebrations of the
birth of Georges Gershwin climaxed Thursday with a concert of
classics and a warm tribute from Bill Clinton.
	   In pre-recorded remarks beamed to an audience of Gershwin fans
and international celebrities, Clinton described the American
songwriter and composer as the ``quintessential American in
Paris,'' referring to one of his greatest works.
	   ``Gershwin and his brother Ira gave to the world a timeless gift
of song and symphony,'' Clinton said. ``France gave to the
Gershwins new and broader horizons.''
	   Japanese-born Seiji Ozawa conducted France's National Orchestra
performing Gershwin's jazz-inspired ``Rhapsody in Blue'' and
selections from his famed ``Porgy and Bess'' opera.
	   Soloists included violinist Joshua Bell, pianist Marcus Roberts
and singer James Taylor.
	   French composer Henri Dutilleux presented Ozawa with the Legion
of Honor, the nation's highest award for excellence.
	   Gershwin died of a brain tumor in 1937 at the height of his
career, at the age of 38.

Baghdad hit by second round of U.S. strikes

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ U.S. missiles struck the Iraqi capital Thursday
night in a second round of airstrikes. At least a dozen explosions
were heard in Baghdad, and a pall of smoke hung over the downtown.
	   The attack came as U.S. officials were still assessing damage
from the strike by hundreds of missiles early Thursday.
	   In Washington, officials at the Pentagon, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said cruise missiles were fired deep into Iraq in the
second attack and Navy strike aircraft fired laser-guided bombs
along Iraq's borders.
	   At the government's press office in downtown Baghdad, witnesses
said one missile was seen flying over Thursday night. After the
first explosion was heard at 9:57 p.m. (1857gmt), anti-aircraft
fire came in response and tracer bullets darted into the night sky.
	   The blasts grew increasingly louder as they came nearer the
downtown. One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the
government's Military Industrial Corporation, from where smoke
drifted into the sky.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the Thursday
night attack.
	   The Military Industrial Corporation, which is in charge of
Iraq's factories, was heavily damaged during the 1991 Gulf War but
has since been rebuilt. It is near the Rashid Hotel, where Iraq
houses visiting dignitaries and reporters.
	   Earlier in the day, sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS
Enterprise in the Gulf loaded thousands of pounds (kilos) of
laser-guided weapons on warplanes in preparation for the second
attack.
	   Despite urging by Russia and China for a halt to the attacks,
U.S. President Bill Clinton had suggested earlier that the strikes
would continue. U.S. officials have said the attacks would go on
for four days.
	   The full extent of damage and casualties from the hundreds of
missiles fired early Thursday was unclear. Foreign reporters in
Baghdad are based at a press center in the Information Ministry and
cannot move around the sprawling city of 5 million without official
escorts.
	   An Iraqi doctor reported five people killed and 30 wounded.
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf referred to ``heavy
casualties'' in civilian areas of Baghdad, but declined to give
specific figures.
	   In Washington, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said headquarters of Iraq's special forces and
military intelligence were leveled by sea-launched Tomahawk cruise
missiles.
	   Clinton, meeting in the Oval Office with top military and
foreign policy advisers Thursday morning, expressed regret that
there would inevitably be ``unintended casualties.''
	   The American president said Wednesday he ordered ``Operation
Desert Fox'' to prevent Iraq from building the chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons it was prohibited from having under U.N.
resolutions after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Many in Baghdad went about their normal routines during the day.
Government workers showed up at their offices and children at
schools.
	   Some residents lined up at gas stations to stock up on fuel.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
Salam Mohammed, 34, mumbled from a bed in Baghdad's al-Yarmouk
Hospital bed, his face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Air raid sirens sounded repeatedly in Baghdad on Thursday
afternoon and evening. One went off as al-Sahhaf was holding a news
conference accusing the United States and Britain of committing
crimes against the Iraqi people.
	   Britain had lent its support to the U.S. attack Thursday
morning, but did not take part. Al-Sahhaf accused both nations of
lying in claiming that U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard
Butler's report Tuesday proved Iraq had not cooperated in the
search for its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This aggression against Iraq is a crime against international
law, the U.N. charter, and we will hold our full right to hold them
responsible _ the Americans and British _ for all the crimes they
are committing against our people,'' al-Sahhaf told the news
conference.
	   The inspectors have the job of certifying Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step before the U.N.
Security Council will lift damaging trade sanctions imposed on Iraq
for its invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf said inspection teams had carried out visits to 427
sites since the last standoff over weapons inspections in
mid-November and there had been only five instances where they
didn't cooperate.
	   Those instances _ which he said involved misunderstandings or
occurred during the Muslim Sabbath _ did not justify ``a dangerous
crime against the people of Iraq,'' he said.
	   Saddam visited some of the targeted sites Thursday, including
the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad Radio reported. Hala, the
youngest of his three daughters, was safe, but the house was
demolished, it said.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in a radio address,
saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face'' but
``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known at the time
of the attack.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.

Chirac says force cannot solve Iraq crisis

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chirac calling Clinton, ADDS graf describing
demonstration outside U.S. embassy.
 &UR; By SUSANNAH PATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac said Thursday that
U.S. military strikes against Iraq will not solve the crisis there.
	   ``What will be essential is to resolve the problems, which
obviously will not be solved with weapons,'' said Chirac, standing
at the doorstep of the presidential Elysee Palace.
	   Also on Thursday, Chirac spoke by telephone to U.S. President
Bill Clinton to discuss ``ways to end the crisis,'' presidential
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said.
	   Chirac's statement on the airstrikes, coming after extensive
comments by Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, indicated France's
clear discomfort with the developments.
	   Chirac also said France would use its weight to try to end the
crisis. France, he said, has ``a role and responsibility'' to ``do
everything possible'' to find a solution.
	   He added, however, that ``once again, the responsibility clearly
falls on Saddam Hussein.''
	   Earlier Thursday, Vedrine criticized the Iraqi leader for
failing to fully comply with a U.N. accord on weapons inspections.
	   But he defended France's longstanding position that a diplomatic
solution should be sought to repeated standoffs with the Iraqi
leader.
	   At a hastily called news conference, Vedrine said: ``France
deplores the spiral of events that led to the American military
strikes against Iraq and the grave human consequences they could
have on the Iraqi population.''
	   ``But Saddam Hussein is the person who bears the main
responsibility for the conflict,'' he added. ``We regret that the
Iraqi leader and other officials did not show a spirit of
cooperation.''
	   France has repeatedly clashed with Washington over how to deal
with Saddam in recent months, and France's latest stand drew ire
from Washington.
	   ``It would be very nice if those who did not support our
approach had an approach that worked,'' U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said in Washington Wednesday night.
	   France, which in the past has had fruitful trade relations with
Iraq, wanted the U.N. Security Council to play the leading role in
the latest crisis, and hours ahead of the strikes it expressed hope
the new dispute could be solved peacefully.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin was cautious during a news
conference in Ottawa, trying to avoid either endorsing or
condemning the airstrikes.
	   The U.S. action ``was to some extent inevitable _ but inevitable
does not mean necessary,'' he said.
	   French newspapers went further in their criticism.
	   The leftist Liberation, with a headline reading ``Clinton's
War,'' said the strikes ``punished a country already weak and
permanently humiliated,'' and it noted pointedly that the
airstrikes led Congress to postpone an impeachment vote against
President Clinton.
	   And about 300 demonstrators, including leaders of France's
Communist Party, marched in front of the U.S. embassy in Paris
Thursday, chanting ``Stop the bombings,'' and ``Clinton murderer.''

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Major oil producers Saudi Arabia, Venezuela
and Mexico agreed Thursday to maintain reduced output through 1999
and to seek cuts by other oil producers in order to bring down
supplies and improve sagging prices.
	   Ministers of oil and energy from the three nations said after a
meeting in the Spanish capital that they ``urge other producing
countries to strictly comply with their commitments.''
	   The meeting followed similar gatherings of oil ministers from
other countries. All were searching for a thus far elusive answer
to the question of how to bring the price of oil higher.
	   Crude prices, depressed by overproduction amid a global economic
crisis, have hovered this year around 12-year lows, costing
oil-dependent nations billions of dollars in revenue.
	   The statement said Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela reaffirmed
their commitment to reductions agreed upon in June. The Saudis and
the Mexicans have already announced their decisions to extend
reduction agreements until the end of next year, the statement
added.
	   ``Venezuela, sharing the same spirit and resolution, will
immediately undertake decisions required to extend its production
restrictions until December 1999,'' the three ministers said in the
joint statement.
	   Venezuela had agreed to reductions of 525,000 barrels a day.
	   Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico have led an initiative to cut
production this year which led to an agreement at the end of June
by OPEC, excluding Iraq, and non-OPEC members to cut production by
a total of 3.1 million barrels a day for a period of one year
starting July 1.
	   Analysts and some OPEC members have said another additional 1.5
million barrels must be taken off the market to begin having an
effect on prices.
	   The officials from the three nations also agreed to ``initiate
immediate actions to discuss with other producers further measures
that translate into a large stock draw-down and improvement of oil
prices.''
	   The statement said consultations will be carried out with other
oil-producing countries.
	   Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Naimi was expected to fly to
Norway after the Madrid meeting. Norway has already agreed to cut
100,000 barrels a day until the end of the year.
	   A senior Saudi source, speaking on condition he is not
identified further, said Saudi Arabia will consult with OPEC
colleagues while Mexico and Venezuela will initiate talks with oil
producers in their region, such as Colombia and Ecuador.
	   Saudi Arabia is the leading producer among the 11-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, with output at about
8 million barrels per day. Venezuela is OPEC's No. 3 exporter,
producing about 2.8 million barrels a day. Mexico, which is not a
member of the organization, produces 3.2 million barrels a day.
	   The slide in oil prices has continued despite repeated attempts
earlier this year at production cuts, including those implemented
by some OPEC members.
	   The price of Brent crude has traded at around dlrs 10 a barrel.
A Gulf source close to the Saudis said earlier Thursday that the
oil-rich kingdom would like to see a price target for Brent at
between dlrs 15 and dlrs 20.

Driver in 1997 limo crash arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, Michigan (AP) _ The driver of the limousine that
crashed while carrying two Detroit Red Wings players and the team's
massage therapist was ordered held on dlrs 50,000 cash bail at his
arraignment on Thursday.
	   Richard Gnida was arrested Wednesday night under a warrant
signed by Judge Kimberly Small Dec. 7, six days after Gnida failed
to show up at a court hearing.
	   Assistant Oakland County Prosecutor John Slevin requested the
high bail today because Gnida, ``has shown through his alleged
violations that his word to the court may not be as good as one
might think.''
	   The 29-year-old Gnida was driving the limousine that crashed
into a tree in Birmingham on June 13, 1997, six days after the Red
Wings won their first Stanley Cup in 42 years.
	   Defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov and team masseur Sergei
Mnatsakanov sustained debilitating head injuries, and defenseman
Vyacheslav Fetisov had minor injuries.
	   Gnida's license was revoked at the time. He eventually pleaded
guilty to a second offense of driving without a valid license.
Gnida was sentenced in November 1997 to nine months in jail and two
years' probation scheduled to expire in November 1999.
	   Gnida was ordered to appear before Small after allegedly
skipping a Nov. 16 meeting with his probation officer and failing
to contact the court on three different days in October.
	   The warrant alleged that Gnida violated his probation by failing
to receive outpatient therapy since July 28; failing to prove that
he's attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings; and failed to complete
200 hours of community service at a closed-head injury clinic.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Nobel Peace Prize laureate Rigoberta
Menchu, accused of distorting her book about the oppression she and
her family suffered in Guatemala, said in remarks published
Thursday she would ``defend the book to the death.''
	   But Menchu apparently failed to respond to specific accusations,
raised by U.S. anthropologist David Stoll, that she distorted facts
and events.
	   The New York Times reported Tuesday the findings in Stoll's new
book, ``Rigoberta Menchu and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans.'' A
Times reporter also reportedly conducted interviews in Guatemala
that contradicted Menchu's account in her 1983 book, ``I, Rigoberta
Menchu.''
	   Menchu had not previously commented on the allegations.
	   ``What they are trying to do is erase the historical memory of
all of the victims and the blood of all the Guatemalans who died
during the armed confrontation of the most difficult epoch of my
town, where none of my accusers was to see the suffering through
which we passed,'' she was quoted as telling the newspaper Nuesto
Diario.
	   ``I am going to defend the book to the death because it is the
history of my family,'' she was quoted as saying.
	   Stoll has previously published academic articles about
government repression of Guatemalan Indian communities. He insisted
on Tuesday that he was ``not attacking the laureate herself, but a
story that did serve a useful purpose at one time.''
	   Stoll asserts that Menchu's book inaccurately said she had no
formal education, that she watched a younger brother starve to
death and witnessed the execution-by-burning of another brother.
	   Stoll said witnesses told him the younger brother never existed
and that Menchu had attended two private boarding schools on
scholarships. A land dispute central to the book was a family
quarrel, they said, not a fight against rich landowners of European
descent.
	   But he said the book might be justified because ``it was a
crisis situation and she wouldn't have gotten the attention that
she did had she told her own story, or if she said `These are
things I've heard have happened to other people,' ''
	   Menchu's book helped her to become an internationally acclaimed
spokeswoman for the rights of indigenous people.
	   An Indian Guatemalan congresswoman, Rosalina Tuyuc, charged that
the criticism of Menchu's book were ``racist.''

Serb police launch Kosovo sweep against KLA over Pec slayings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 8-9 and 13 with KLA accusing Serb secret
police in Pec shootings, vowing revenge against Serb forces for
border attack &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police who said they were hunting
for the murderers of six Kosovo Serbs attacked a suspected
rebel-controlled village Thursday, reportedly killing two ethnic
Albanian fighters in a daylong battle.
	   The clash that began around dawn near Glodjane was one of the
biggest in months in Kosovo, where a wobbly October truce that has
held across most of the Serbian province is in increasing danger of
breaking down altogether.
	   International monitors who got near the western Kosovo village,
located 10 kilometers (six miles) south of the city of Pec, said
they heard shelling and heavy fighting.
	   ``It was war,'' said a European monitor who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   Police also sealed off a northwestern suburb of Pec as part of
the sweep. An armored personnel carrier and policemen wearing flak
jackets blocked a bridge leading to Kapesnica, and police snipers
looked down from surrounding rooftops.
	   ``We are in pursuit of the perpetrators of the shooting in the
Panda bar,'' a police commander said, referring to the bar where
the six young Serbs were slaughtered. He spoke on condition his
name not be used.
	   Monday's brutal shootings, carried out by masked gunmen who
riddled the Serb bar with automatic weapons fire, dangerously
fueled tensions in a province still reeling from over 1,000 deaths
in months of fighting this year between Serb forces and separatist
rebels.
	   It was the second major clash this week, coming three days after
Yugoslav army border guards killed 36 guerrillas entering from
Albania.
	   The KLA issued a statement late Thursday accusing Serb secret
police of carrying out the barroom shootings as a pretext to crack
down further on Kosovo Albanians. It also promised to retaliate
against Serbian forces over the border killings.
	   Police told the Serb-run Media Center in Pristina that after
officers searching for suspects in Glodjane came under fire, police
killed two people wearing camouflage uniforms bearing the KLA
insignia and armed with assault rifles and mortars.
	   They said they arrested 34 people from a ``terrorist gang'' in
Glodjane and Kapesnica and discovered large quantities of arms,
ammunition and KLA uniforms.
	   The international Kosovo Verification Mission sent several teams
to the area, and American and other officials held talks with
Serbian police in an unsuccessful attempt to calm the situation.
Hours later the clash was reported still going on.
	   The KLA, which is fighting to drive Serb police out of Kosovo
and break the province away from Serbia, denied involvement in
Monday's attack.
	   But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian guerrillas, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this week to arrest
the ``terrorist bandits.''
	   The state-run Borba daily called Thursday, in a sharply worded
commentary, for the withdrawal of international verifiers and U.S.
envoys from Kosovo, saying they are ``direct instigators and
helpers of the crimes committed by Albanian terrorists.''
	   Serbs held a protest rally concerning the killings for a second
straight day Thursday, this time in front of the headquarters of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs
the verifying force.
	   The killings have cast further gloom over stalled diplomatic
efforts to resolve the Serb-Albanian standoff in Kosovo, where
dozens have died in sporadic clashes since the October agreement.
	   Serbian authorities say they are willing to grant only limited
autonomy for Kosovo, while most of the overwhelmingly
Albanian-populated province want independence from Serbia _ the
dominant republic remaining in Yugoslavia.

Arabs states have condemned the strikes on Iraq

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Arab states unanimously
condemned the U.S. attacks on Iraq on Thursday, shattering the
quiet support Washington enjoyed in last month's standoff with
Baghdad.
	   Many Arab and Muslim governments questioned both the timing and
the motivation of Thursday's strikes.
	   ``Once again, Iraq is being subjected to military attacks whose
circumstances remain suspicious and whose objectives remain
unclear,'' the Organization of the Islamic Conference said in a
statement issued by its headquarters in Saudi Arabia.
	   The 52-nation group, which represents the world's 1 billion
Muslims and every Arab nation, called for an ``immediate halt'' to
the strikes.
	   In Cairo, the secretary general of the 21-nation Arab League,
Esmat Abdel-Meguid, saw the attack sheerly in terms of the report
that the chief U.N. weapons inspector filed earlier this week on
Iraq's lack of cooperation.
	   ``This bombardment is a clear submission to the negative report
presented by top international inspector Richard Butler, who had
intended to provoke Iraq and not be neutral and objective in
Security Council missions,'' Abdel-Meguid said.
	   Several major Arab nations sent a different message last month
when the United States was preparing to strike Iraq to force it to
resume cooperation with U.N. inspectors seeking to eliminate its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Eight Arab states _ including heavyweights Egypt, Saudi Arabia
and Syria _ warned Baghdad mid-November that it would be ``held
responsible for any consequences.''
	   This lack of Arab support is thought to have played a
significant role in the decision by Iraq's President Saddam Hussein
to back down and resume cooperation at the 11th hour.
	   But this time not one Arab government has expressed support for
the strikes.
	   One reason is that Arabs know that U.S. President Bill Clinton
is facing imminent impeachment proceedings and could have been
tempted to use the attacks to rally Americans behind him.
	   ``This is all because of Monica (Lewinsky), because of an
immoral man,'' said Maher Hilmi, a Palestinian protester in Gaza
City Thursday, referring to Clinton's relationship with a White
House aide.
	   Beirut's As-Safir newspaper suggested that the timing of the
attacks stemmed from ``the fact that Clinton is drowning in the
insults he has dealt to his nation with his private scandals.''
	   Another reason is that the United States and Britain have
launched the offensive on Iraq without explicit endorsement from
the U.N. Security Council. Arabs believe the western allies lack
authority for their actions, and two other members of the Security
Council, Russia and China, have taken a similar position.
	   Saddam, a master at exploiting his enemies' weaknesses, seemed
to have sensed that the moment was favorable. He ordered his
officials to phone several Arab governments, including Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, on Thursday.
	   Iraq asked these governments for their support in calling a halt
to the strikes, said an official from a Gulf country, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Moreover, there is the standing Arab charge that the United
States is judging Iraq by values quite different from those it
applies to Israel.
	   Lebanese Prime Minister Salim al-Hoss said Thursday that his
government condemned the attacks on Iraq and was ``astonished by
the fact that Israel alone among the regional states is free from
the constraints and controls of possessing mass-destruction
weapons.''
	   In the words of Abdullah al-Daylemi, a Saudi professor of
religion in Riyadh: ``Why don't they (the Americans) strike Israel,
which continuously flouts international law. Why is it always
Muslim countries, like Sudan, Afghanistan and Iraq that are
attacked?''
	   Such sentiments were reflected in protests in Arab cities
Thursday.
	   In Cairo, Egypt, 3,000 university students poured into the
streets after hearing news of the military strike, shouting
anti-American slogans.
	   A couple of students were injured in a scuffle with police at
the American University of Cairo. Security guards dispersed a small
protest outside the U.S. Embassy.
	   In Beirut, some 250 students at the American University of
Beirut staged a sit-in and urged students to boycott classes.
	   In Khartoum, which was itself the target of a U.S. military
strike in August, about 2,000 university converged in the streets,
chanting ``down, down U.S.A.''
	   In Gaza City, thousands of Palestinians chanted ``Death to
Clinton'' and burned the American flag. Earlier this week residents
of the city cheered the U.S. president on his first visit to the
Palestinian territories.
	   Yet not all Arab rhetoric on Thursday was directed at the United
States.
	   A Saudi spokesman said that while his government ``fully
sympathizes with the brotherly Iraqi people'' and hoped the attacks
would end, it also accused Baghdad of ``taking matters to extremes
and creating crises that prolong the suffering of the Iraqi people
and endangering the region's security.''

U.S. embassy pulling out children for fear of anthrax attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Fearing Iraq may launch a biological attack on
Israel, the United States embassy has ordered home children of its
diplomats stationed here, an American official said Thursday.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
decision was based on the lack of testing on children of an
antidote for anthrax, a biological agent Iraq is believed to
possess.
	   Dr. Boaz Lev, associate director general of Israel's health
ministry, said that while antibiotics and immunization that would
be used to treat those contaminated by anthrax has not been tested
in children, there is no medical reason to think it would not be
effective for them.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman Larry Schwartz said that by
Friday evening all children and dependents of American embassy and
consulate diplomatic staff under the age of 18 as well as pregnant
women and the elderly will have left Israel as ordered by a State
Department travel advisory. Non-essential staff were also being
permitted to leave the country.
	   During the 1991 Gulf War, most Israelis were given gas masks
after Saddam threatened to attack Israel with biological or
chemical weapons. Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel during the
war, but all carried conventional warheads.

Baghdad hit by second round of U.S. missile strikes

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ U.S. missiles struck the Iraqi capital Thursday
night in a second round of air strikes. At least a dozen explosions
were heard in Baghdad, and a pall of smoke hung over the downtown.
	   The attack came as U.S. officials were still assessing damage
from the strike by hundreds of missiles in the early morning hours
of Thursday.
	   In Washington, officials at the Pentagon, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said cruise missiles were fired deep into Iraq in the
second attack and Navy strike aircraft fired laser-guided bombs
along Iraq's borders.
	   At the government's press office in downtown Baghdad, witnesses
said one missile was seen flying over Thursday night. After the
first explosion was heard at 9:57 p.m. (1857gmt), anti-aircraft
fire came in response and tracer bullets darted into the night sky.
	   The blasts grew increasingly louder as they came nearer the
downtown. One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the
government's Military Industrial Corporation, from where smoke
drifted into the sky.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the Thursday
night attack. The sound of the explosions was far louder than the
attack Thursday morning since the missiles struck in the heart of
the Iraqi capital.
	   The Military Industrial Corporation, which is in charge of
Iraq's factories, was heavily damaged during the 1991 Gulf War but
has since been rebuilt. It is near the Rashid Hotel, where Iraq
houses visiting dignitaries and reporters.
	   Earlier in the day, sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS
Enterprise in the Gulf loaded thousands of pounds of laser-guided
weapons on warplanes in preparation for the second attack.
	   Thursday night's attack came after air raid sirens sounded
repeatedly during the day, but until the night attack all proved to
be false alarms.
	   Despite urging by Russia and China for a halt to the attacks,
U.S. President Bill Clinton had said earlier that the strikes would
continue. U.S. officials have said the strikes would go on for four
days.
	   The full extent of damage and casualties from the hundreds of
missiles fired in the early morning hours Thursday was unclear.
Foreign reporters in Baghdad are based at a press center in the
Information Ministry and cannot move around the sprawling city of 5
million without official escorts.
	   An Iraqi doctor reported five people killed and 30 wounded.
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf referred to ``heavy
casualties'' in civilian areas of Baghdad, but declined to give
specific figures.
	   In Washington, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said headquarters of Iraq's special forces and
military intelligence were leveled by sea-launched Tomahawk cruise
missiles.
	   Clinton, meeting in the Oval Office with top military and
foreign policy advisers Thursday morning, expressed regret that
there would inevitably be ``unintended casualties.''
	   The American president said Wednesday he ordered ``Operation
Desert Fox'' to prevent Iraq from building the chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons it was prohibited from having under U.N.
resolutions after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   In Baghdad Thursday, one sign of an expected second attack was
residents lining up at gas stations to stock up on fuel.
	   But many people went about their normal routines _ government
workers showed up at their offices and children at schools _ and
some gave a show of defiance.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
Salam Mohammed, 34, mumbled from a bed in Baghdad's al-Yarmouk
Hospital bed, his face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Air raid sirens sounded repeatedly in Baghdad Thursday afternoon
and evening. One went off as al-Sahhaf was holding a news
conference to accuse the United States and Britain of committing
crimes against the Iraqi people.
	   Britain had lent its support to the U.S. attack Thursday
morning, but did not take part. Al-Sahhaf accused both nations of
lying in claiming that the report of the U.N. chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler proved Iraq had not cooperated in the
search for its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This aggression against Iraq is a crime against international
law, the U.N. charter, and we will hold our full right to hold them
responsible _ the Americans and British _ for all the crimes they
are committing against our people,'' al-Sahhaf told the news
conference.
	   He said inspection teams had carried out visits to 427 sites
since the last stand-off over weapons inspections in mid-November
and there had been only five cases of non-cooperation.
	   The inspectors have the job of certifying Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step before the U.N.
Security Council will lift damaging trade sanctions imposed on Iraq
for its invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf said the five sites that caused trouble did not
justify ``a dangerous crime against the people of Iraq.''
	   One proposed visit was to an office of Iraq's ruling Baath
Party, he said. Two others were a problem because they occurred on
Friday, the Muslim day of worship when most people are not working,
al-Sahhaf said.
	   In one case, he said, the inspectors tried to visit a former
office of a security official that had been changed into a guest
house. He said inspectors were delayed for 45 minutes in entering
the building as Iraqi authorities tried to explain the change.
	   ``Do you deserve to be bombarded because you have delayed an
inspection team 45 minutes?'' al-Sahhaf asked.
	   Al-Sahhaf also listed examples of targets struck in the American
attack, including factories and the headquarters of the security
police and military intelligence.
	   He said the two headquarters have been inspected more than once
by U.N. arms experts and many of the factories had U.N. cameras as
part of permanent monitoring of potential weapons sites.
	   The minister said that instead of calling their campaign
Operation Desert Fox, the allies should have named it ``Operation
Villains in the Arabian Desert.''
	   In the Thursday morning's attacks, the warships fired more than
200 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck
Iraqi air defense radars, Pentagon officials said.
	   Saddam visited some of the targeted sites Thursday, including
the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad Radio reported. Hala, the
youngest of his three daughters, was safe, but the house was
demolished, it said.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said. The house, built since the
Gulf War, was in a complex of buildings that was home to several of
Saddam's relatives.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in a radio address,
saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face'' but
``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known at the time
of the attack.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ U.S. missiles struck the Iraqi capital Thursday
night in a second round of airstrikes. At least a dozen explosions
were heard in Baghdad, and a pall of smoke hung over the downtown.
	   The attack came as U.S. officials were still assessing damage
from the strike by hundreds of missiles early Thursday.
	   In Washington, officials at the Pentagon, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said cruise missiles were fired deep into Iraq in the
second attack and Navy strike aircraft fired laser-guided bombs
along Iraq's borders.
	   At the government's press office in downtown Baghdad, witnesses
said one missile was seen flying over Thursday night. After the
first explosion was heard at 9:57 p.m. (1857gmt), anti-aircraft
fire came in response and tracer bullets darted into the night sky.
	   The blasts grew increasingly louder as they came nearer the
downtown. One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the
government's Military Industrial Corporation, from where smoke
drifted into the sky.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the Thursday
night attack. The sound of the explosions was far louder than the
attack Thursday morning since the missiles struck in the heart of
the Iraqi capital.
	   The Military Industrial Corporation, which is in charge of
Iraq's factories, was heavily damaged during the 1991 Gulf War but
has since been rebuilt. It is near the Rashid Hotel, where Iraq
houses visiting dignitaries and reporters.
	   Earlier in the day, sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS
Enterprise in the Gulf loaded thousands of pounds (kilos) of
laser-guided weapons on warplanes in preparation for the second
attack.
	   Despite urging by Russia and China for a halt to the attacks,
U.S. President Bill Clinton had suggested earlier that the strikes
would continue. U.S. officials have said the attacks would go on
for four days.
	   The full extent of damage and casualties from the hundreds of
missiles fired early Thursday was unclear. Foreign reporters in
Baghdad are based at a press center in the Information Ministry and
cannot move around the sprawling city of 5 million without official
escorts.
	   An Iraqi doctor reported five people killed and 30 wounded.
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf referred to ``heavy
casualties'' in civilian areas of Baghdad, but declined to give
specific figures.
	   In Washington, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said headquarters of Iraq's special forces and
military intelligence were leveled by sea-launched Tomahawk cruise
missiles.
	   Clinton, meeting in the Oval Office with top military and
foreign policy advisers Thursday morning, expressed regret that
there would inevitably be ``unintended casualties.''
	   The American president said Wednesday he ordered ``Operation
Desert Fox'' to prevent Iraq from building the chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons it was prohibited from having under U.N.
resolutions after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Many in Baghdad went about their normal routines during the day.
Government workers showed up at their offices and children at
schools.
	   Some residents lined up at gas stations to stock up on fuel.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
Salam Mohammed, 34, mumbled from a bed in Baghdad's al-Yarmouk
Hospital bed, his face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Air raid sirens sounded repeatedly in Baghdad on Thursday
afternoon and evening. One went off as al-Sahhaf was holding a news
conference accusing the United States and Britain of committing
crimes against the Iraqi people.
	   Britain had lent its support to the U.S. attack Thursday
morning, but did not take part. Al-Sahhaf accused both nations of
lying in claiming that U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard
Butler's report Tuesday proved Iraq had not cooperated in the
search for its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This aggression against Iraq is a crime against international
law, the U.N. charter, and we will hold our full right to hold them
responsible _ the Americans and British _ for all the crimes they
are committing against our people,'' al-Sahhaf told the news
conference.
	   The inspectors have the job of certifying Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step before the U.N.
Security Council will lift damaging trade sanctions imposed on Iraq
for its invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf said inspection teams had carried out visits to 427
sites since the last standoff over weapons inspections in
mid-November and there had been only five instances where they
didn't cooperate.
	   Those instances _ which he said involved misunderstandings or
occurred during the Muslim Sabbath _ did not justify ``a dangerous
crime against the people of Iraq,'' he said.
	   Saddam visited some of the targeted sites Thursday, including
the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad Radio reported. Hala, the
youngest of his three daughters, was safe, but the house was
demolished, it said.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said. The house, built since the
Gulf War, was in a complex of buildings that was home to several of
Saddam's relatives.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in a radio address,
saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face'' but
``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known at the time
of the attack.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight

Kuwaitis believe Americans have missed the target _ Saddam

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwaitis want more than punishing strikes against
Iraq. They want the United States to target Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, who invaded their country eight years ago and occupied it
for seven months.
	   ``This strike is nothing more than a discipline operation,''
said newspaper columnist Hassan al-Issa said.
	   ``He will behave for a month or two, then what?'' he said.
	   ``We want more of this, and we want it aimed at him,'' said
Saleh Nasser, a 34-year-old civil servant, referring to Saddam.
	   A dozen British Tornado fighter-bombers took off from their base
in Kuwait late Thursday to take part in the second round of strikes
against Iraq. British officials declined to specify their mission.
	   Some 400 British personnel are based in Kuwait.
	   Some 3,000 U.S. troops are stationed in the emirate and an
additional 1,500 soldiers are on their way.
	   In the early hours of Thursday, most Kuwaitis were glued to
their television sets as news of the first U.S. military strikes
came in.
	   Interest was high, but there was no fear in the street of Iraqi
retaliation.
	   Sea front cafes were packed Thursday and it was business as
usual in shopping malls of this small oil-rich state.
	   While denouncing the Iraqi regime, most Kuwaitis sympathize with
the Iraqi people and understand their plight because they
experienced life under Saddam's oppressive rule after Iraqi forces
invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
	   During the seven-month occupation, Iraqi troops systematically
looted the country _ plundering medical equipment, printing presses
and even street lights. An estimated 300 Kuwaitis died. Hundreds of
others were rounded up _ and Kuwait claims they still are being
held in Iraqi jails. Iraq denies the charge.
	   Unlike previous standoffs, the Kuwaiti government distanced
itself from the showdown between Iraq and U.N. inspectors that
sparked the overnight attacks.
	   Kuwait is trying to avoid giving the Iraqi government an excuse
for retaliatory attacks, especially as it hosts American and
British forces in line with the defense agreements it signed with
the western allies after the Gulf War.
	   The United States is Kuwait's largest trading partner, exporting
more than dlrs 1 billion a year to the emirate.
	   Columnist al-Issa said he had no hope that Saddam Hussein would
be toppled in the near future.
	   ``Things will stay the way they are, and maybe at the end they
will have to negotiate with Saddam Hussein,'' he said.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ European and U.S. markets ended up Thursday, as
investors shrugged off the launch of American military strikes
against Iraq and its implications for the impeachment efforts
against President Clinton.
	   The airstrikes against Iraq, which got under way Wednesday,
didn't spark dramatic responses in Asia or Europe.
	   Oil prices, which rose Wednesday as air strikes became imminent,
fell Thursday as traders realized that Iraqi oil facilities hadn't
been damaged.
	   The U.S. Treasury bond, normally a safe haven in uncertain
times, also fell slightly, and the U.S. dollar was mixed against
other dominant currencies.
	   ``This isn't a very important economic event, though it may be
an important political event,'' said Diane C. Swonk, deputy chief
economist for Bank One Corp.
	   U.S. investors were more interested in a surprising drop in the
U.S. trade deficit, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up
85.22 points to 8,875.82 on Wall Street for the day.

Important Roman relics found in London
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Archaeologists have unearthed two significant
pieces of Roman history in central London _ the foundations of a
massive arch, and a wide river channel, long-buried in the heart of
the capital.
	   ``The foundations of the arch date back to the first or second
century A.D. and are evidence that Roman London was a wealthy and
sophisticated place,'' archaeologist Bruce Watson said Thursday,
when he and colleagues from the Museum of London announced the
discoveries.
	   The museum said the river channel may have influenced the siting
of the city, which the Romans occupied for about 400 years before
departing in the 5th century.
	   About 25 meters (yards) wide and 8 meters (yards) deep, it was
found near the Old Bailey courthouse in central London and is
thought to have been a major tributary of the river Fleet, which
still exists under the streets of London and is used as a sewer.
	   Experts say the river was present in early Roman times and the
arch, which is on the same site, would have straddled the main
western entrance to the Roman city of London. It is belived to be a
triumphal arch.
	   ``The impression we now have is that Roman London was probably
more like the Mediterranean Roman cities than we first imagined,''
said Watson.
	   Simon Thurley, director of the museum, said: ``These discoveries
will have the potential to revise our understanding of the Roman
city of Londinium.
	   The discoveries were made at a building construction site, and
Watson said, ``we hope they will be preserved and incorporated in
the foundations of the new building.''
	   Roman baths, stretches of Roman wall, coins, pots and parts of
boats and barges have turned up over the centuries, and many
artifacts are in the Museum of London.

Unlike others, nuclear inspectors have it easier in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Butler's comments on IAEA &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Not all U.N. weapons inspectors are down
on Iraq. The agency investigating Iraq's nuclear program says it
has run into far fewer problems than Richard Butler's inspection
teams.
	   Butler's U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, rejects
Iraq's claims it has destroyed all of its weapons of mass
destruction, and he accuses the Baghdad government of obstructing
teams trying to verify their elimination. UNSCOM inspects and
monitors chemical and biological weapons programs as well as those
involving long-range missiles.
	   The International Atomic Energy Agency, on the other hand, has
said it believes Iraq no longer has much to hide in the area of
nuclear weapons.
	   The IAEA, based in Vienna, has given Iraq fairly good marks,
saying it has provided ``the necessary level of cooperation'' to
enable the nuclear inspectors to complete their work ``efficiently
and effectively.''
	   But IAEA officials say their job has been easier than that of
UNSCOM, and therefore less confrontational.
	   ``They've had a harder time, so they had to pursue their work
much more toughly and with larger teams than we did,'' IAEA
spokesman David Kyd told The Associated Press.
	   Iraq's nuclear facilities were heavily damaged during the 1991
Gulf War and, Kyd noted, it is harder to hide a clandestine nuclear
program. ``Biological and chemical weapons can be squirreled away
anywhere in pharmaceutical or plants or elsewhere,'' he said.
	   At the United Nations in New York, Butler referred to the
differences in the two inspection agencies' missions, telling
reporters Thursday that the IAEA ``has had a different job from
ours because they were never dealing with a completed weapons
program.''
	   ``They were only dealing with one that was in the making,''
Butler said. ``And that makes it vastly different from what we have
had to deal with in missile, chemical and biological weapons, where
we were dealing with fabricated weapons. And that's a much
different situation.''
	   The IAEA says it has dismantled much of what survived the Gulf
War. However, the Washington-based Nuclear Control Institute
suggests nuclear inspectors were relatively unimpeded because they
were less demanding.
	   If UNSCOM, rather than IAEA, was responsible for nuclear
inspections, ``there would not be the dangerously mistaken
impression that exists today that Iraq's nuclear weapons threat is
dead,'' said Paul Levanthal, president of the Nuclear Control
Institute.

Major oil producers commit to continue cuts

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Major oil producers Saudi Arabia, Venezuela
and Mexico agreed Thursday to maintain reduced output through 1999
and to seek cuts by other oil producers in order to bring down
supplies and improve sagging prices.
	   Oil and energy ministers from the three nations are searching
for ways to bring the price of oil higher. Crude prices, depressed
by overproduction amid a global economic crisis, have hovered this
year around 12-year lows, costing oil-producing nations billions of
dollars in revenue.
	   A statement from the oil ministers said Saudi Arabia, Mexico and
Venezuela reaffirmed their commitment to reductions agreed upon in
June 1998. Saudi Arabia will produce 725,000 barrels a day; Mexico
will produce 200,000 barrels, and Venezuela will produce 525,000 a
day.
	   Currently, Saudi Arabia is the leading producer among the
11-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, with
output at about 8 million barrels per day. Venezuela produces about
2.8 million barrels a day. Mexico, which is not an OPEC member,
produces 3.2 million barrels a day.
	   The restrictions are expected to last until December 1999.
	   Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico led an initiative to cut
production this year which prompted an agreement at the end of June
by OPEC, excluding Iraq, and non-OPEC members to cut production by
a total of 3.1 million barrels a day for a period of one year
starting July 1.
	   Analysts and some OPEC members have said another additional 1.5
million barrels must be taken off the market to begin having an
effect on prices.
	   Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Naimi was expected to fly to
Norway after the Madrid meeting. Norway has already agreed to cut
100,000 barrels a day until the end of the year.
	   A senior Saudi source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Saudi Arabia will consult with OPEC colleagues while Mexico and
Venezuela will initiate talks with oil producers in their region,
such as Colombia and Ecuador.
	   This week, as a threat of military action against Iraq became
real, oil prices changed only slightly. Thursday, after a brief
rise in the morning, prices slipped lower as traders realized that
Iraqi oil facilities hadn't been damaged.
	   The price of Brent crude has dipped to around dlrs 10 a barrel
in recent weeks.

Fossil of warm climate animals shows Arctic once was balmy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The frigid Arctic regions were as balmy as
present-day Florida some 90 million years ago, according to
researchers who found fossils in northern Canada of a
crocodile-like animal.
	   At a place just 950 kilometers (600 miles) from the North Pole,
researchers from the University of Rochester found the fossilized
remains of the champosaur, a toothy, eight-foot-long extinct
crocodile.
	   ``We found a whole assemblage of fossils, from both young and
adults,'' said geophysicist John H. Tarduno, the lead author of a
study appearing Friday in the journal Science. ``There were also
turtles and fish.''
	   The champosaur and the turtles are cold-blooded animals that
could not have survived in the current climate of the Canadian
Arctic where the fossils were found, Tarduno said.
	   ``These fossils tell us that there had to have been a
substantial growing season there then, and that the climate was
very unlike the Arctic now,'' he said.
	   Temperatures at the fossil site now routinely drop to minus 15
degrees Celsius (60 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter. But when the
champosaur lived there 86 million to 92 million years ago,
temperatures rarely reached freezing and summertime readings of 25
degrees Celsius (80 degrees Fahrenheit) were common.
	   ``We think it was typical of what Florida is now,'' Tarduno
said.
	   No one had found a champosaur so close to the Arctic before,
said David B. Weishampel, a Johns Hopkins University dinosaur
expert.
	   ``The new find suggests that the poles were a lot warmer and
more stable then than they are now,'' Weishampel said.
	   The closest previous find of champosaur fossils was about 1,500
kilometers (1,000 miles) south of the Canadian location, Tarduno
said.
	   The champosaur closely resembled the modern-day crocodile. It
had a long snout, powerful jaws filled with teeth and a long tail.
	   Weishampel, the dinosaur expert, said the champosaur was
probably cold blooded, which means it had little tolerance for cold
weather. It also was too small to have migrated seasonally.
	   Cold-blooded animals depend on the environment for warmth and
become immobile if the temperature is too cold. Warm-blooded
animals can regulate their body temperature even in cold weather.
	   A field team from the University of Rochester found the fossils
in a layer of sediment sitting atop a 300 meter (1,000 foot) deep
bed of lava rock.
	   Tarduno said the Canadian lava flowed during a period of global
volcanism that saw immense basalt lava formations created near
Australia, in the Indian Ocean, near Madagascar, Brazil, and in
South Africa and the American southwest.
	   The lava was different from the formations created by explosive
volcanoes. Instead, the melted rock flowed in great surges that
covered wide areas hundreds of feet deep and continued for hundreds
of years.
	   Such a worldwide volcanic activity, said Tarduno, would have
released huge amounts of carbon dioxide, setting off a greenhouse
effect that would explain why the Arctic was warm enough for the
champosaur.
	   ``It is very reasonable to suggest that so much CO2 was dumped
into the atmosphere that it overwhelmed the system, causing global
warming,'' he said.
	   Tarduno said the warming period ``was a very narrow interval in
history, lasting only one to two million years. It was only a spike
in the Earth's climate pattern.''
	   Starting about 65 million years ago, around the time that the
dinosaurs were wiped out, the planet started a cooling trend, he
said.
	   As for the champosaur, it lived for several million years after
the dinosaurs disappeared. Then it, too, became extinct.

British tour operators evacuate tourists from Red Sea resort

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with gas mask distribution to some tourists, graf 8 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   EILAT, Israel (AP) _ Fearing a possible Iraqi missile attack
against Israel, British tourist operators evacuated their clients
from this Red Sea resort Thursday while airline companies postponed
flights to Israel.
	   Air 2000 and Britannia sent shuttle buses to Eilat hotels to
collect 600-700 of their passengers to be flown back on specially
arranged flights.
	   ``I had 12 British tourists on a scuba diving course and the
representatives of the British tour operators came and ordered them
back to their hotels to pack,'' said Uri Prigal, director of
Eilat's Red Sea Sports Club. ``They practically peeled the rubber
suits off them.''
	   Airline companies told their clients that if they didn't leave
Thursday, they would forfeit their seats on the flights, said Clive
Newton of Longwood Holidays, one of the tour companies evacuating
the tourists.
	   ``This is ridiculous,'' said Julius Benton as he waited for the
shuttle bus to bring him to the airport. ``I feel less safe in
Manchester.''
	   Michelle Peters of London, who not flying with the British
airline companies, planned to stay in Eilat with her husband and
newborn baby.
	   ``We're close to Jordan and Egypt,'' she said. ``Eilat is the
safest place in the area.''
	   Israel's tourism ministry in coordination with the army began
distributing gas mask kits for tourists staying in hotels
throughout the country on Thursday, the army spokesman said. Other
tourists and foreign workers would get masks if Israel declares a
state of emergency, the army's Home Front command said.
	   The British government, like the United States, has advised its
citizens not to travel to Israel but has not instructed those
already there to return home.
	   A British Airways Boeing 777 due to arrive in Israel Wednesday
night was held until Thursday because of the bombings, British
Airways confirmed.
	   And a Swiss Air was holding back a flight scheduled to land
after sundown Thursday until Friday morning, presumably when an
anticipated U.S. air strike Thursday night would be over, Swiss Air
spokeswoman Dorit Tzup said.
	   While some Israeli tourists in Eilat also packed their bags,
others arrived for a long week-end during the Jewish holiday of
Hannukah.
	   During the 1991 Gulf War, Israelis flocked to Eilat, believing
its location at the southern tip of Israel kept it safely out of
Iraqi missile range. Iraq fired 39 scud missiles with conventional
warheads at Israel during the Gulf War, most of which landed in or
near Tel Aviv.
	   Canada also advised its citizens Thursday not to travel to
Israel or the Palestinian areas. Those already there should
``consider departing if their presence is not essential,'' the
embassy said in a statement.
	   The U.S. was evacuating all State Department personnel and their
dependents under the age of 18 or over the age of 65, U.S.
spokesman Larry Schwartz said.

Broadcasting group emerges as takeover bidder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new 7th graf with background on NTL &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ U.S. media and broadcasting group NTL
emerged Thursday as the company planning to take over Newcastle
United.
	   New York-based NTL announced it had bought a 6 percent share in
the club and had reached agreement with Newcastle's main
shareholder, Cameron Hall Developments, to buy a further 51 percent
if the broadcasting company makes an offer.
	   NTL president and chief executive officer Barclay Knapp said the
company was hoping to gain a foothold in screening live soccer but
did not intend to have a say in the running of the team.
	   ``NTL's approach across its business activities is to be a force
for wider choice, diversity and customer value,'' said Knapp, who
added that the deal would be done through a subsidiary, Premium TV.
	   ``Through Premium TV, we have been looking at ways of bringing
more quality sport to more viewers and today's deal is in line with
that strategy,'' he said. ``Our involvement will be for the benefit
of football, Newcastle United and its supporters. We believe
strongly that the future success of football will continue to be
developed on the enthusiasm and active support of fans.
	   ``Whilst NTL will not be involved in any way in managing
Newcastle United and will have no influence on the running of the
club, our strategic stake on 6.3 per cent in Newcastle United gives
us a significant foothold in the market for sports television.''
	   NTL services 25 percent of the cable television customers in
Britain and operates three of the five television channels in the
country, channels 3, 4 and 5. It also is a fiberoptic long-distance
telephone carrier and operates one of only five independent telecom
networks in the United Kingdom.
	   NTL said such a decision depends on a ruling by the government's
Monopolies and Mergers Commission whether BSkyB's takeover bid for
Manchester United contravenes fair trading.
	   Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB satellite TV company has made a 623
million pound (dlrs 1 billion) bid for Manchester United but the
deal is on hold pending a ruling by the MMC.
	   When Newcastle plc announced last week that it was the target of
a takeover, newspaper speculation suggested the company involved
was the Sony electronics firm, with U.S. media group Time Warner
also reported to be interested.
	   Newcastle's chief executive, Freddie Fletcher, welcomed the
approach by NTL.
	   ``This is good news for Newcastle United, its fans and its
shareholders,'' he said. ``I think this is the way football is
going to develop on a more internationalized basis.
	   ``If the best clubs are to compete with Manchester United in
Britain, and the Milans and Barcelona, they need the strength of a
company like NTL behind them.''
	   The ownership of Newcastle has been in the headlines for the
wrong reasons during the past year.
	   Cameron Hall Developments is owned by Douglas Hall, a Newcastle
United director who resigned, along with co-director Freddie
Shepherd, after they were caught on tape making derogatory comments
about the women of Newcastle. They also mocked the club's fans and
called Magpies' top striker, England captain Alan Shearer, ``Mary
Poppins.''
	   Last week, Hall and Shepherd regained their places on the board
of directors and chairman Dennis Cassidy and directors John Josephs
and Tom Fenton resigned in protest.
	   The club's stockbrokers, BT Alex Brown, also resigned their
contract with the club because of the return of Hall and Shepherd.

Unlike others, nuclear inspectors have it easier in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Butler's comments on IAEA in grafs 8,9. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Not all U.N. weapons inspectors are down
on Iraq. The agency investigating Iraq's nuclear program says it
has run into far fewer problems than Richard Butler's inspection
teams.
	   Butler's U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, rejects
Iraq's claims it has destroyed all of its weapons of mass
destruction, and he accuses the Baghdad government of obstructing
teams trying to verify their elimination. UNSCOM inspects and
monitors chemical and biological weapons programs as well as those
involving long-range missiles.
	   The International Atomic Energy Agency, on the other hand, has
said it believes Iraq no longer has much to hide in the area of
nuclear weapons.
	   The IAEA, based in Vienna, has given Iraq fairly good marks,
saying it has provided ``the necessary level of cooperation'' to
enable the nuclear inspectors to complete their work ``efficiently
and effectively.''
	   But IAEA officials say their job has been easier than that of
UNSCOM, and therefore less confrontational.
	   ``They've had a harder time, so they had to pursue their work
much more toughly and with larger teams than we did,'' IAEA
spokesman David Kyd told The Associated Press.
	   Iraq's nuclear facilities were heavily damaged during the 1991
Gulf War and, Kyd noted, it is harder to hide a clandestine nuclear
program. ``Biological and chemical weapons can be squirreled away
anywhere in pharmaceutical or plants or elsewhere,'' he said.
	   At the United Nations in New York, Butler referred to the
differences in the two inspection agencies' missions, telling
reporters Thursday that the IAEA ``has had a different job from
ours because they were never dealing with a completed weapons
program.''
	   ``They were only dealing with one that was in the making,''
Butler said. ``And that makes it vastly different from what we have
had to deal with in missile, chemical and biological weapons, where
we were dealing with fabricated weapons. And that's a much
different situation.''
	   The IAEA says it has dismantled much of what survived the Gulf
War. However, the Washington-based Nuclear Control Institute
suggests nuclear inspectors were relatively unimpeded because they
were less demanding.
	   If UNSCOM, rather than IAEA, was responsible for nuclear
inspections, ``there would not be the dangerously mistaken
impression that exists today that Iraq's nuclear weapons threat is
dead,'' said Paul Levanthal, president of the Nuclear Control
Institute.

	   LONDON (AP) _ BBC's World Service radio announced Thursday that
it has extended its broadcasts in Arabic in response to the crisis
in Iraq over U.S-British airstrikes.
	   The service, which normally broadcasts from 0330 to 2115 GMT, is
now broadcasting almost continuously ``and will continue to do so
for the forseeable future,'' a BBC statement said.
	   The broadcasts can be heard through northern Africa and the
Middle East, but do not reach Iraq or Libya.

Palestinian Authority caught in dilemma after U.S. attack on Iraq

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ It was a fleeting romance.
	   Thousands of Palestinians enraged by Bill Clinton's decision to
bomb Iraq chanted ``Death to America'' on Thursday and burned the
very U.S. flags they had waved when the U.S. president visited the
West Bank and Gaza Strip just three days earlier.
	   In three West Bank towns, marchers threw stones at Israeli
soldiers who fired rubber-coated steel pellets. In one
confrontation outside Ramallah, a 20-year-old Palestinian, Mohammed
Daoud, was killed and 16 others were injured by Israeli fire.
	   The Israeli army acknowledged using live rounds during the
protests but said no such ammunition was fired in the area where
Daoud was wounded.
	   ``This is only the beginning,'' said one of the protesters,
Maher Hilmi. Expressing a view widely held by Palestinians, Hilmi
said Clinton attacked Iraq to delay the impeachment vote in
connection with the Monica Lewinsky affair. ``This is all because
of Monica, because of an immoral man,'' he said.
	   Clinton sent a letter to Yasser Arafat to explain his reasons
for the attack on Iraq which has placed the Palestinian leader in a
difficult position.
	   Arafat and Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan made a joint call for a
diplomatic solution to the crisis in Iraq after meeting Thursday in
Amman, Israel Radio reported.
	   The anti-U.S. marches in the West Bank and Gaza threatened to
undercut Arafat's special new relationship with the United States
which blossomed during the Clinton visit, widely seen as implicit
U.S. recognition of Palestinian claims to independence.
	   However, Arafat could not simply stifle the protests because of
the widespread support among his people for Iraq.
	   The largest rally was held in the West Bank town of Nablus where
about 3,000 Palestinians took to the streets, chanting ``Death to
America'' and ``Death to Clinton.''
	   Protesters burned a dozen U.S. flags, including those that had
been distributed by the Palestinian Authority several days earlier
to cheer the arrival of Clinton in Gaza and the biblical West Bank
town of Bethlehem.
	   ``Two days ago, Clinton was here and we thought he carried a
message of peace,'' said Majeda Masri, a teen-age marcher. ``But
now it is clear that he is a murderer.''
	   In Israel, the government opened 65 gas mask distribution and
deployed three Patriot anti-missile batteries outside the cities of
Tel Aviv and Haifa as a precaution against a possible Iraqi attack.
	   In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein fired 39 Scud
missiles at Israel after being attacked by the United States. At
the time, Saddam hoped to provoke an Israeli response and thus
break up the Arab coalition that had formed against him. However,
at the urging of the United States, Israel did not strike back.
	   Israeli military commanders said Thursday that the probability
of an Iraqi strike was very low. However, if pushed to the verge of
collapse by U.S. airstrikes, Saddam might fire missiles with
chemical or biological warheads at Israel, said Gen. Amos Gilad,
the head of research in Israel's military intelligence.
	   Clinton called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and told him
that the United States would not stand by if Israel were attacked,
according to a statement by Netanyahu's office.
	   Netanyahu said Israel does not want to get involved in the
conflict, but reserves the right to defend itself.
	   ``We have no intention of being part of this conflict, but we
are preparing for every eventuality,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Unlike in earlier Gulf crises, there was no sign of panic in
Israel. One hardware store hoping to boost sales offered customers
a free flashlight if they bought two rolls of tape for sealing
rooms. Gas mask distribution centers did brisk business, but there
were no long lines.
	   At one Jerusalem school, the average waiting period was three
minutes. Elissa Polan, 28, who immigrated from Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, a week ago, said she was concerned, but would stay.
	   ``I'm worried that something might happen, but I guess that's
just life in the Middle East,'' she said. ``I didn't think I'd have
to be getting a gas mask the first week I got here.
	   In the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat, British tour operators
evacuated several hundred tourists on special flights.
	   ``I had 12 British tourists on a scuba diving course and the
representatives of the British tour operators came and ordered them
back to their hotels to pack,'' said Uri Prigal, director of
Eilat's Red Sea Sports Club. ``They practically peeled the rubber
suits off them.''
	   Gas masks were distributed Thursday to tourists in major Israeli
hotels, the army said. Other tourists and foreign workers would be
issued masks if the army declares a state of emergency, the Home
Front command said.
	   The families of U.S. Embassy and Consulate staff in Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem prepared to leave by Friday, complying with a U.S. State
Department order.
	   One U.S. official said there was concern that children would be
at risk in case of a biological weapons attack. The antidote to
Anthrax, a biological agent mostly likely to be used by Iraq, has
not been tested on children, said the official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.

Fossil of warm climate animals shows Arctic once was balmy

 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The frigid Arctic regions were as balmy as
present- day Florida some 90 million years ago, according to
researchers who found fossils in northern Canada of a
crocodile-like animal.
	   At a place just 600 miles (100 kilometers) from the North Pole,
researchers from the University of Rochester found the fossilized
remains of the champosaur, a toothy, eight-foot-long extinct
crocodile.
	   ``We found a whole assemblage of fossils, from both young and
adults,'' said geophysicist John H. Tarduno, the lead author of a
study appearing Friday in the journal Science. ``There were also
turtles and fish.''
	   The champosaur and the turtles are cold-blooded animals that
could not have survived in the current climate of the Canadian
Arctic where the fossils were found, Tarduno said.
	   ``These fossils tell us that there had to have been a
substantial growing season there then, and that the climate was
very unlike the Arctic now,'' he said.
	   Temperatures at the fossil site now routinely drop to minus 60
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 50 degrees Celsius) in the winter. But
when the champosaur lived there 86 million to 92 million years ago,
temperatures rarely reached freezing and summertime readings of 80
degrees (27 degrees) were common.
	   No one had found a champosaur so close to the Arctic before,
said David B. Weishampel, a Johns Hopkins University dinosaur
expert.
	   ``The new find suggests that the poles were a lot warmer and
more stable then than they are now,'' Weishampel said.
	   The champosaur closely resembled the modern-day crocodile. It
had a long snout, powerful jaws filled with teeth and a long tail.
	   Weishampel, the dinosaur expert, said the champosaur was
probably cold blooded, which means it had little tolerance for cold
weather. It also was too small to have migrated seasonally.
	   Cold-blooded animals depend on the environment for warmth and
become immobile if the temperature is too cold. Warm-blooded
animals can regulate their body temperature even in cold weather.
	   A field team from the University of Rochester found the fossils
in a layer of sediment sitting atop a bed of lava rock.
	   Tarduno said the Canadian lava flowed during a period of global
volcanism that saw immense basalt lava formations created near
Australia, in the Indian Ocean, near Madagascar, Brazil, and in
South Africa and the American southwest.
	   The lava was different from the formations created by explosive
volcanoes. Instead, the melted rock flowed in great surges that
covered wide areas hundreds of feet deep and continued for hundreds
of years.
	   Such a worldwide volcanic activity, said Tarduno, would have
released huge amounts of carbon dioxide, setting off a greenhouse
effect that would explain why the Arctic was warm enough for the
champosaur.
	   Tarduno said the warming period ``was a very narrow interval in
history, lasting only one to two million years. It was only a spike
in the Earth's climate pattern.''
	   Starting about 65 million years ago, around the time that the
dinosaurs were wiped out, the planet started a cooling trend, he
said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S.-British military action in Iraq is about a
defiant dictator and has nothing to do with an American president's
possible impeachment, Prime Minister Tony Blair said Thursday.
	   Blair, who has unflinchingly supported U.S. President Bill
Clinton throughout the Monica Lewinsky saga, disputed suggestions
that his friend may have sought a distraction from the looming
impeachment debate in the House of Representatives.
	   And he bristled when one lawmaker said the military action was
led by ``Clinton the liar.''
	   ``I have no doubt at all that action is fully justified now,''
said Blair, the only national leader to commit military forces to
support the U.S. airstrikes against Iraq.
	   ``That is my own strong personal view,'' he told the House of
Commons. ``I know that President Clinton reached the same
conclusion for the same reason.''
	   Blair added of Clinton: ``Not for the first time, he has shown
the courage to do the right thing, and he has my full support.''
	   Blair also told lawmakers that British Tornado jets, all
designed primarily for low-level bombing missions, went into action
for the first time Thursday afternoon, but would disclose no
details of the operation.
	   In part, Britain's military commitment against Saddam Hussein
reflects its self-image as America's strongest ally and special
friend in Europe.
	   But there also is a personal bond between Blair and Clinton,
both young centrists leading traditional left-leaning parties.
	   Their mutual admiration recalls similarly strong ties between a
very different pair of leaders _ Ronald Reagan and Margaret
Thatcher.
	   Visiting Washington in February, Blair stood with Clinton at a
news conference dominated by questions about possible military
action in Iraq and about Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   At a time when many people were reluctant to even stand next to
him in public, Blair said he had found that Clinton was ``someone I
could trust, someone I could rely upon, someone I am proud to call
not just a colleague, but a friend.''
	   And on the night Independent Council Kenneth Starr's report was
released in September, Blair was on the telephone in London for a
long talk with Clinton, in a clear gesture of support.
	   Defending the U.S.-British military campaign in Iraq, Blair said
Saddam had been given another chance in November, when airstrikes
were called off at the last minute.
	   ``Saddam Hussein is a man to whom a last chance to do right is
just a further opportunity to do wrong. He is blind to reason,'' he
said.
	   Most lawmakers appeared to support Blair's action, but there was
sharp criticism from two left-wingers in his own Labor Party.
	   Tony Benn called the attacks ``deeply immoral and contrary to an
ethical foreign policy of which we boast.''
	   George Galloway said the attacks would be deeply resented by
Muslims, adding, ``An Arab-Muslim capital is in flames at the hands
of a new crusade, but this time led, not by Richard the Lionheart
but by Clinton the liar.''
	   Blair responded: ``I find it curious that you should attack
President Clinton personally and mention not a word of condemnation
of Saddam Hussein. It is a curious sense of priority that you
have.''
	   Winding up a long evening of debate, Defense Secretary George
Robertson said the airstrikes were ``on-going _ U.K. aircraft are
in the air as we speak _ and it will continue for as long as is
necessary.''
	   No vote was taken at the end of the debate.
	   No polling data was available showing how Britons viewed their
country's involvement, but demonstrators were plentiful outside the
main government offices in London.
	   In one incident Thursday, protesters used red paint to daub the
Foreign Office with the words ``Stop Killing'' and ``Lift the
Sanctions,'' referring to U.N.-imposed embargoes on Iraq.

Non-oil foreign investment down 65 percent in Venezuela
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Foreign investment outside of
Venezuela's petroleum and mining sectors is expected to drop 65
percent this year, the industry and trade minister said Thursday.
	   Investment has fallen to an estimated dlrs 1.5 billion this year
compared to dlrs 4.3 billion last year, Hector Maldonado Lira said.
	   The main causes were plummeting oil prices that hit a 12-year
low, a crisis in international financial markets and worries about
the country's presidential election. Oil accounts for three-fourths
of Venezuela's exports.
	   Investors feared that former coup leader Hugo Chavez, who won
the Dec. 6 presidential race, might reverse free market economic
policies. He takes office Feb. 2.
	   ``If the government of Hugo Chavez doesn't give clear messages
about what its economic policies will be and who will handle them,
it won't be possible to reverse the negative trend in foreign
investments,'' said Luis Soto, head of the National Council for the
Promotion of Investment.
	   Chavez has tried to soothe fears in recent weeks, declaring that
his administration will honor the country's foreign debt, trim the
bloated government bureaucracy and pursue ``rigid fiscal
discipline.''

Guyanese president orders army into streets following robberies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT WILKINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Alarmed by a spate of armed robberies,
Guyanese President Janet Jagan on Thursday ordered troops to help
police patrol Georgetown's streets.
	   The move followed the killing and robbery on Tuesday of jewelry
store owner Kawall Tiwari, a fatal attack on a convenience store
owner last week and the wounding of a jewelry store owner during a
robbery Friday.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, about 20 businessmen and taxi
drivers have been robbed or carjacked, police said. They are
blaming many of the attacks on heavily armed groups of muggers.
	   ``We believe that one or two gangs are involved and they must be
caught,'' said Prime Minister Samuel Hinds. ``No effort will be
spared in trying to catch them.''
	   Business leaders are warning the increase in robberies could
scare more investors from Guyana, which is still trying to lure
back foreign companies put off by race riots earlier this year.
	   ``Surely, we cannot allow a wretched fraction of the society to
hold the entire Guyana to ransom,'' the Georgetown Chamber of
Commerce and Industry said in a written statement.
	   Trade groups note Guyana's weak dollar means business owners are
forced to make night deposits at commercial banks in order to beat
lowering exchange rates. That exposes more of them to muggings,
they say.
	   Police chief Laurie Lewis said Thursday investigators would
begin offering rewards for information about the robberies.

	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) _ Former world cycling champion Lance
Armstrong has signed with the Trek Volkswagen Professional Mountain
Bike Racing Team.
	   Armstrong won the 1993 world championship and competed for the
U.S. Olympic team in 1992 and 1996. He also won his second Tour
DuPont title in 1996 before cancer forced him into rehabilitation
for 16 months.
	   Armstrong returned to road racing this year, riding for the U.S.
Postal Service team. Armstrong's mountain bike racing contract will
not affect his status on the road racing circuit.
	   ``Never before has a road racer of Lance's caliber attempted a
world class mountain bike race series,'' Trek spokesman Nate
Tobecksen said. ``I'm expecting him to be a factor in every race he
enters, both off-road or on.''

<TEXT>
	   Fear of greater instability in the Middle East and a surge of
sympathy for the Iraqi people led many Thursday to oppose U.S. and
British airstrikes on Baghdad. Most NATO allies, however, backed
the attacks.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the attack with a
warning that it could shatter regional security, while China and
France appealed for an immediate end to the strikes. They, as
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, can veto
resolutions. Britain and the United States are the other two
permanent members, leaving that body deeply divided.
	   The Security Council makes the final decision on when to lift
the sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which
sparked the Gulf War. The council has said it will not do so until
inspectors certify the destruction of Iraq's weapons programs.
	   During the 1991 Gulf War, the West and part of the Muslim world
lined up against Iraq. Now, there is little consensus even on the
question of whether the United States and Britain had the right to
attack without council approval. That would have been nearly
impossible to get, with China, Russia and France urging adoption of
a more conciliatory line.
	   France, which had a good trade relationship with Iraq before
sanctions were imposed, blamed both sides. ``But Saddam Hussein is
the person who bears the main responsibility for the conflict,''
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said.
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a strong U.S. ally, said
the Iraqi president had only himself to blame.
	   Italian premier Massimo D'Alema was quoted in newspapers
Thursday as saying that ``the strikes were legitimate but
useless.''
	   Others urged U.S. President Bill Clinton to end the military
operation quickly.
	   ``We hope that the air operations will not last long,'' Turkey's
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said. ``No harm should come to
the civilian populations.''
	   Russia's warning about the possibility of greater instability is
a familiar concern. Saddam's bloody rule has left little in the way
of successors outside his immediate family, and some fear that his
removal could lead to Iraq's disintegration into warring camps.
	   Iran fought a 1980-88 war against Iraq, yet opposed the American
military strikes Thursday.
	   ``Such unilateral attacks against Iraq will lead to even more
pain and misery for the people of that country and will bring about
insecurity in the region,'' Iranian television reported a Foreign
Ministry spokesman as saying.
	   Supporters of the airstrikes said doing nothing could have been
even more dangerous.
	   ``The developing of mass-destruction weapons is a threat against
stability and security in the whole region,'' Norwegian Foreign
Minister Knut Vollebaek told local media.
	   In Yugoslavia, which narrowly avoided U.S. airstrikes just two
months ago, newspapers were clearly sympathetic to Iraq. ``U.S. and
British aggression against Iraq'' blared a headline in Belgrade.
	   Right-wing Pakistani religious groups burned effigies of Clinton
in Islamabad. Protest leader Sajjid Chaudhry warned that ``Muslims
can strike any where, any time.''
	   And in the West Bank and Gaza, thousands of Palestinians quickly
turned against Clinton. The protesters chanted ``Death to
America!'' and burned the same American flags they had waved just
three days earlier during Clinton's historic visit.

Many see bombing as end of U.N. inspections, but resolutions stand
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ After seven years of painstakingly trying
to ferret out and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, U.N.
arms inspectors have again left Iraq. Security experts and even
some diplomats say they may never return _ at least not with the
teeth to effectively do their job.
	   Many point to President Bill Clinton's own acknowledgment last
month that a U.S. military strike on Baghdad would spell the end of
the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the dismantling of
Iraq's arms programs.
	   But others said Thursday inspectors must resume their work
because they alone are responsible for verifying the destruction of
Iraq's ability to produce weapons _ the key according to U.N.
resolutions to lifting tough economic sanctions which Iraq
desperately wants.
	   To be sure, the Iraqis didn't expel the inspectors prior to the
U.S. and British bombing raids. Chief inspector Richard Butler
ordered them out and promised Thursday to send them back if Iraq
gave them the full cooperation it has promised, but in seven years
has failed to deliver.
	   ``We can do our work the moment that Iraq genuinely decides to
give us cooperation _ without rancor, without regard to the past,''
Butler said.
	   Iraq hasn't said whether it would prevent inspectors from
returning. Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Sahhaf said Thursday it was
``premature'' to discuss future inspections.
	   But John Chipman, director of the International Institute for
Strategic Studies in London, said it was in the interest of both
Saddam Hussein and the Security Council to have inspectors return _
regardless of the level of cooperation they receive.
	   ``Everybody recognizes that having inspectors on the ground _
even without being able to have full access to all sites _ is
better than not having inspectors at all,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
	   Portuguese Ambassador Antonio Monteiro echoed his comments,
saying the Security Council must ensure the objectives of its own
resolutions are kept: that Iraq is disarmed and no longer a threat
to the region.
	   ``I believe the only way of doing that is through cooperation,''
between inspectors and Iraq, he said. ``Military attacks will not
attain this objective.''
	   Others, however, were less optimistic that any semblance of the
inspection regime could be resurrected after what Clinton said
would be a sustained bombing campaign to degrade Iraq's weapons
capabilities.
	   ``I think we can forget about UNSCOM, I think for a very long
time,'' said Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, who harshly
criticized the United States and Britain for the attack.
	   Robert Kagan, a senior associate with the Washington-based
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said he thought the
inspections were finished, but cautioned that the Clinton
administration would be hard pressed to justify maintaining
sanctions against Iraq without UNSCOM on the ground.
	   ``Sanctions are only as good as countries' willingness to impose
them,'' Kagan said, suggesting a gradual erosion of the measures by
Iraq's friends.
	   David Kay, a former inspector and now a Washington consultant,
said Clinton had acted knowing that bombing risked ending
inspections altogether.
	   ``It's not that we're losing something that was working,'' he
said.
	   Several experts said the only way to ensure Iraq is disarmed is
for Saddam to be out of power.
	   ``An UNSCOM with real teeth will never be acceptable to an Iraq
with Saddam Hussein as head of state,'' said Stephen Cimbala,
political science professor at Penn State University.

Berisha announces he will defy summons, refuse to submit to

interrogation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Former President Sali Berisha announced
Thursday he will refuse an order to appear at the state
prosecutor's office to answer allegations that he organized riots
three months ago which threatened to topple the government.
	   Berisha, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, was ordered
to report for interrogation Friday morning. In a statement late
Thursday, however, the 53-year-old Berisha said he would not appear
before a ``political prosecutor'' and would instead respond to the
charges ``in public.''
	   He would send his lawyers instead. Under Albanian law, Berisha
can refuse two summons before facing automatic arrest. His
Democratic Party has denounced charges against him as a ``wild
vendetta'' by the former Communists who control the government.
	   Allegations against Berisha stem from two days of rioting in the
Albanian capital Tirana last September which erupted after the
still-unsolved assassination of a leader of Berisha's party, Azem
Hajdari.
	   Berisha accused then-Prime Minister Fatos Nano of ordering the
killing. A series of protests exploded into violence in which at
least three people were killed and dozens injured.
	   Rioters briefly seized the headquarters of state television and
other government installations.
	   Following the riots, Albania's parliament, controlled by Nano's
Socialist party, stripped Berisha of his parliamentary immunity,
paving the way for criminal charges. Nano later resigned as prime
minister.
	   International diplomats and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe have been trying to mediate between the
Democrats and the Socialists.

Report: Uganda purchased 62 Soviet-era tanks from Israeli dealer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli company denying involvement in the deal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Uganda purchased 62 T-55 Soviet-era tanks
through an Israeli arms dealer and some were defective on arrival,
the government-owned New Vision Newspaper said Thursday.
	   The newspaper said Uganda allegedly purchased the tanks from
Israeli arms dealer Amos Golan of Silver Shadow Ltd.
	   Silver Shadow Advanced Security Systems Ltd. issued a statement
Thursday through its lawyer's office in Tel Aviv denying any
involvement in the deal.
	   ``Our clients never supplied _ directly or indirectly _ tanks to
Uganda, and it goes without saying that they were not involved in
any sale of tanks which have technical defects,'' the statement
said.
	   Earlier, the Israeli Embassy declined to comment on the
newspaper report.
	   The newspaper said the tanks arrived last month in the Tanzanian
port of Dar es Salaam and were transported by rail to Masaka, 80
miles (130 kilometers) southwest of the capital Kampala.
	   The newspaper said the tanks were shipped from Ukraine, but may
have come from Bulgaria or Romania.
	   Opposition legislator Aggrey Awori, a critic of President Yoweri
Museveni's government, told The Associated Press this week the
government paid dlrs 750,000 each for the tanks, which he said are
in poor condition.
	   Awori said the market price for tanks in such condition would be
dlrs 230,000.
	   ``They are definitely junk,'' he said. ``We do not believe they
are combat-worthy.''
	   He accused the Ugandan government of buying the tanks to supply
the Congolese rebellion in eastern Congo. Uganda and Rwanda are
backing the Congolese rebels in their fight to oust President
Laurent Kabila.
	   Previous New Vision reports have said the tanks were more than
30 years old and that 10 did not even operate. The T-55 tank was
first manufactured in 1958, but continued to be manufactured in
Eastern European countries until 1981.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United
States and Britain on Thursday for attacking Iraq and demanded an
immediate end to the bombing, warning it could shatter hopes of
peace in the Middle East.
	   ``Russia demands an immediate end to military action, to show
common sense and restraint and not to allow further escalation of
the conflict which could result in the most dramatic consequences
not only for the Iraqi settlement but for the stability of the
entire region,'' Yeltsin said in a statement.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, in a telephone conversation
with U.S. Vice President Al Gore on Thursday night, expressed
Russia's indignation at the attacks and urged the United States to
stop the strikes, the Interfax news agency cited the government
press service as saying. Primakov has had close ties with Iraq for
many years.

Orioles sign reliever Hernandez
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with value of deal in 1st graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ The Baltimore Orioles shored up their bullpen
on Thursday by signing right-hander Xavier Hernandez to a two-year,
dlrs 2.5 million deal with a club option for the 2001 season.
	   Hernandez, 33, made 46 relief appearances with Texas last
season, going 6-6 with one save and a 3.57 ERA. He allowed 43 hits
in 58 innings, walked 30 and struck out 41. The 10-year
major-leaguer has appeared in 463 games, all but seven in relief,
with a 40-35 record, 35 saves and a 3.90 ERA.
	   The Orioles, who have lost right-handers Alan Mills and Armando
Benitez this off-season, also have reached a tentative agreement
with right-hander Ricky Bones. That announcement is expected by
this weekend.
	   ``Xavier has been very solid the last few years,'' said Orioles
General Manager Frank Wren. ``It gives us another right-handed
pitcher in our bullpen. He has a very good split-finger pitch and
has worked very well in the middle role.''
	   Also on Thursday, the team announced the signing of right-hander
Doug Linton to a Triple-A contract and invited him to spring
training.
	   Linton, 33, has been pitching for Caguas of the Puerto Rico
Winter League. He spent 1998 at Minnesota's Triple-A Salt Lake
affiliate, going 4-4 in 14 starts with a 5.99 ERA. He last pitched
in the majors in 1996 with Kansas City.

Many see bombing as end of U.N. inspections, but resolutions stand
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMIT to change slug &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ After seven years of painstakingly trying
to ferret out and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, U.N.
arms inspectors have again left Iraq. Security experts and even
some diplomats say they may never return _ at least not with the
teeth to effectively do their job.
	   Many point to President Bill Clinton's own acknowledgment last
month that a U.S. military strike on Baghdad would spell the end of
the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the dismantling of
Iraq's arms programs.
	   But others said Thursday inspectors must resume their work
because they alone are responsible for verifying the destruction of
Iraq's ability to produce weapons _ the key according to U.N.
resolutions to lifting tough economic sanctions which Iraq
desperately wants.
	   To be sure, the Iraqis didn't expel the inspectors prior to the
U.S. and British bombing raids. Chief inspector Richard Butler
ordered them out and promised Thursday to send them back if Iraq
gave them the full cooperation it has promised, but in seven years
has failed to deliver.
	   ``We can do our work the moment that Iraq genuinely decides to
give us cooperation _ without rancor, without regard to the past,''
Butler said.
	   Iraq hasn't said whether it would prevent inspectors from
returning. Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Sahhaf said Thursday it was
``premature'' to discuss future inspections.
	   But John Chipman, director of the International Institute for
Strategic Studies in London, said it was in the interest of both
Saddam Hussein and the Security Council to have inspectors return _
regardless of the level of cooperation they receive.
	   ``Everybody recognizes that having inspectors on the ground _
even without being able to have full access to all sites _ is
better than not having inspectors at all,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
	   Portuguese Ambassador Antonio Monteiro echoed his comments,
saying the Security Council must ensure the objectives of its own
resolutions are kept: that Iraq is disarmed and no longer a threat
to the region.
	   ``I believe the only way of doing that is through cooperation,''
between inspectors and Iraq, he said. ``Military attacks will not
attain this objective.''
	   Others, however, were less optimistic that any semblance of the
inspection regime could be resurrected after what Clinton said
would be a sustained bombing campaign to degrade Iraq's weapons
capabilities.
	   ``I think we can forget about UNSCOM, I think for a very long
time,'' said Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, who harshly
criticized the United States and Britain for the attack.
	   Robert Kagan, a senior associate with the Washington-based
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said he thought the
inspections were finished, but cautioned that the Clinton
administration would be hard pressed to justify maintaining
sanctions against Iraq without UNSCOM on the ground.
	   ``Sanctions are only as good as countries' willingness to impose
them,'' Kagan said, suggesting a gradual erosion of the measures by
Iraq's friends.
	   David Kay, a former inspector and now a Washington consultant,
said Clinton had acted knowing that bombing risked ending
inspections altogether.
	   ``It's not that we're losing something that was working,'' he
said.
	   Several experts said the only way to ensure Iraq is disarmed is
for Saddam to be out of power.
	   ``An UNSCOM with real teeth will never be acceptable to an Iraq
with Saddam Hussein as head of state,'' said Stephen Cimbala,
political science professor at Penn State University.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Czechs came from behind to score four goals in
a six-minute span of the third period and went on to beat Russia
5-3 on Thursday in the Baltika Cup.
	   After a scoreless first period, Russia broke through in the
second with Dmitry Vlasenkov scoring in the 27th minute. The game
was tied two minutes later on a goal by Czech Tomas Vlasak.
	   Seconds later, Russia's Alexander Barkov put his team ahead 2-1
after a fast counter-attack. Alexei Kudashov added another for
Russia five minutes later to make it 3-1.
	   The 9,500 spectators at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium looked certain
that the home team would keep their lead. But the Czechs changed
tactics and roared back in the third period.
	   Frantisek Kaberle scored in the 41st minute to make it 3-2. Two
minutes later, Jan Hlavac scored to tie the game and just over a
minute after that Roman Meluzin put the Czechs ahead 4-3. Jan
Caloun added an insurance goal in the 46th minute.
	   The tournament, which also includes Sweden, Finland and Canada,
is the third of four legs of the Euro Hockey Tour and features each
country's best players outside the North American National Hockey
League.
	   The final is Sunday.

U.S. Justice Deptartment considers Salt Lake bribery probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Thursday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CARTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ The U.S. Justice Department is reviewing
allegations of bribery in Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002
Olympics even as city officials acknowledge giving a paid
internship to the son of an IOC member.
	   The actions Thursday came on the eve of an emergency closed-door
session of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee to begin
investigating alleged corruption in the race to win the Winter
Games.
	   Attorney General Janet Reno said in Washington the department is
reviewing allegations that the Salt Lake bid committee provided
scholarships and other favors to IOC members and their relatives in
efforts to win votes.
	   ``My understanding is that the criminal division has that under
review,'' Reno said.
	   Local Olympics organizers acknowledged there may be problems
with the defunct bid committee's tax returns, which made no mention
of the scholarships.
	   Those were the latest developments in a 3-week-old case that has
become the biggest corruption scandal in the 104-year history of
the International Olympic Committee.
	   Last weekend, Swiss IOC member Marc Hodler said blackmail and
bribery played some role in other recent Olympic site elections,
including the Summer Games in Atlanta (1996) and Sydney (2000), and
the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. The IOC is investigating
the Salt Lake bid, but it could be expanded.
	   The embattled organizing committee will meet Friday and an
ethics panel will take up an independent investigation to include
the scholarships, gifts, possible cash payoffs and free medical
treatment to IOC members, all in apparent violation of the rules.
	   ``At this point, we're hearing lots of alleged details and all
we have now are a lot of questions and no answers,'' SLOC
spokeswoman Shelley Thomas said. ``We welcome any and all scrutiny
to the bid process. It's what we've said all along, and the sooner
the better.''
	   Details of the lengths to which the bid committee apparently
went in order to curry favor with key members of the IOC continue
to trickle out. Most seem to involve a dlrs 500,000 National
Olympic Committee humanitarian fund. Established to help athletes
in emerging countries, it apparently was used to provide favors to
influential and often wealthy IOC members.
	   It included six scholarships to relatives of IOC members. The
SLOC has said most were from Africa, but has refused to identify
them. It has confirmed, however, that one was Sonia Essomba,
daughter of the late IOC member Rene Essomba of Cameroon, former
secretary general of the African National Olympic Committee
Association.
	   Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini _ a former member of the
bid committee _ said the son of IOC member David Sikhulumi Sibandze
of Swaziland was given a city government internship for one year in
1993-94.
	   ``It was not (the mayor's) initiative,'' said Corradini
spokesman Ken Connaughton.
	   He said the intern, Sibu Sibandze, worked for the city's policy
and budget division for dlrs 6 an hour while attending the
University of Utah, but there was no evidence the internship was
tied to the Olympic bid.
	   The senior Sibandze, an IOC member since 1984, is a leading
member of the African sports community and an influential
businessman.
	   The Associated Press identified a second relative of an IOC
member who may have received scholarship money. Suhel Attarabulsi,
son of Libyan IOC member Bashir Attarabulsi, applied to attend
Brigham Young University in 1995.
	   On his application, he listed his address as 215 S. State, suite
2002 _ the address of the Salt Lake bid committee.
	   Suhel Attarabulsi is now enrolled at Utah Valley State College,
about 10 miles from BYU. A telephone message left at his apartment
Thursday was not immediately returned.
	   His father, an IOC member since 1977, was a past vice president
of the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa.
	   The scholarship program, according to the SLOC, was initiated
after Salt Lake lost the bid for the 1998 Winter Games in 1991. No
new grants were given after the city won the 2002 Winter Games in
1995, although payments on previous scholarships were made as
recently as October.
	   During those years, the bid committee held tax-exempt status as
a nonprofit charitable organization. Its returns _ called Form 990s
_ are public record and offer the only peek so far into the bid
committee's privately funded, dlrs 13 million pursuit of the
Olympics.
	   In each fiscal year between 1991 to 1997, the question, ``Does
the organization make grants for scholarships, fellowships, student
loans, etc.,'' was answered ``No,'' and lines used to report grants
or assistance to individuals were left blank.
	   Between fiscal years 1992 and 1994, the bid committee reported
expenses for an unspecified national Olympic committee program.
SLOC officials have said the scholarship program went through the
NOCs that represent each country's Olympic interests.
	   ``It certainly has raised a question and we're looking at the
issue,'' said Kelly Flint, SLOC's senior vice president for legal
affairs and commerce.
	   Also Thursday, former bid committee head Tom Welch told the
Deseret News he had met with SLOC President Frank Joklik, and they
had agreed the best approach was to come clean quickly.
	   Welch was president of the bid committee and Joklik was chairman
when the scholarship program was created.
	   ``It's one of those instances where the perceptions are much
worse than the reality,'' Welch said.
	   Gov. Mike Leavitt urged a quick, complete disclosure of any
wrongdoing and said he considered the bribery allegations more an
ethics problem than a crime.

Haitian parliament takes second step toward approving premier

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Parliament on Thursday declared
Jacques-Edouard Alexis eligible to become Haiti's next premier,
raising the possibility that the country will finally approve a
government after an 18-month political stalemate.
	   The Chamber of Deputies voted to certify that Alexis' age,
citizenship and property deeds conformed with the law.
	   The Senate certified Alexis' credentials Tuesday. Both houses
must now issue a vote of confidence before Alexis can become
premier.
	   Haiti has not had a working government for 18 months,
undermining hopes for stability in the Western Hemisphere's poorest
country.
	   There has been no government budget for two years, investors
have shied away, and millions of dollars in foreign aid are on
hold.
	   Nominated July 12, Alexis, 51, is President Rene Preval's fourth
choice to succeed former Premier Rosny Smarth, who resigned in June
1997. Since then, the power struggle between Smarth's majority
party and Preval has blocked the installation of a new premier.
	   Alexis probably has enough support in the lower house to win a
vote of confidence in his general policy statement, the next step
toward approval.
	   But it is uncertain whether Alexis can win as similar vote in
the Senate, where some senators are opposed to the
internationally-backed economic modernization program that Alexis
would inherit from Smarth.
	   Preval's mentor, former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has
condemned the plan.
	   But pressure on Parliament to vote Alexis into office is
building from Haitian businessmen and labor leaders as well as the
international community.
	   ``The immediate future of most democratic institutions is heavy
with incertitude,'' stated a November U.N. situation report on
Haiti, which criticized ``all the parties'' involved in the impasse
for their ``incredible nonchalance.''

to National Basketball Association players Thursday, mailing each
of them a nine-page letter outlining the owners' latest collective
bargaining proposal.
	   The letter, complete with charts and graphs, was sent by
overnight mail as the opposing sides were deep into another lull in
talks. No new negotiations are expected until after Christmas.
	   ``I urge you to focus on the extent of the compromises the
owners have made from their initial bargaining demands,'' Stern
wrote. ``The proposals now on the table represent the following
significant concessions that were made in direct response to your
union's forceful assertion of your concerns'':
	   _ No hard salary cap.
	   _ The retention of the Larry Bird exception.
	   _ No immediate changes to free agency timing rules.
	   _ A limit to the escrow tax that would be collected from
players' paychecks.
	   The union did not immediately issue a formal response, but
negotiating team member Jim McIlvaine of the Seattle SuperSonics
said the letter offered no bombshells.
	   ``It's basically what we've been telling the players, so I don't
think anyone who reads it will be surprised,'' McIlvaine said.
	   Union director Billy Hunter, meanwhile, moved forward with his
newfound eagerness to take his case to the public. After holding
his longest and most detailed conference call of the 5
1/2-month-old lockout a day earlier, Hunter visited an all-sports
radio station in New York before going on a nationwide cable
television sports talk show.
	   After previously insisting that there undoubtedly will be a
season, Hunter changed his tune somewhat.
	   ``At this stage I'm not so sure,'' he said. ``I can't say I'm
convinced there will be a season. I think the owners have already
decided if they have to sacrifice this year in exchange for their
long-term gain, they're prepared to do it. But if they are ready to
make a deal and are prepared to compromise, we can make a deal
tomorrow.''
	   The sides are fighting over how to split dlrs 2 billion in
annual revenues.
	   Several major issues remain unresolved, with the main points of
contention being what percentage of revenues will be devoted to
salaries, whether the union will accept an absolute limit on what
players with more than seven years' experience can be paid, and
whether the owners will accept additional salary cap exceptions
that would increase the number of players in the league's so-called
``middle class.''
	   Stern's letter, which also was released to the media, included a
12-point summary of the principal economic terms of a new
agreement.
	   Details included overall salary growth, maximum and minimum
salaries, cap exceptions, maximum annual raises, changes to the
rookie scale and the group licensing agreement, and the length of
the new deal.
	   Some of the owners' changes to their previous proposals had not
previously been disclosed. Among them:
	   _ An increase in the maximum allowable raise, from 10 percent on
Bird contracts and 5 percent on other contracts, to 12.5 percent on
Bird contracts and 7.5 percent on others.
	   _ Allowing a maximum contract length of seven years for Bird
players, up from six years, and six years for other contracts, up
from five.
	   _ Allowing a team to use the new ``middle class exception'' to
re-sign its own free agent, instead of limiting it to another
team's free agent.
	   McIlvaine said the letter was suspiciously vague in mentioning
changes ``in certain other salary cap rules'' without detailing
them. He also pointed out that salaries are guaranteed to rise 5
percent annually after growing 16 percent annually in previous
years.
	   A union attorney also noted that the owners' offer would
decrease salaries for second-year players from the approximately
dlrs 315,000 they would have received under the old agreement to
dlrs 250,000.

Chief inspector defends report on Iraq and says he won't quit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout to UPDATE with Butler defending himself,
council holding second day of consultations, Russians circulating
draft statement calling for end to bombing &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Facing sharp criticism from Russia and
China, chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler defended his
report that Iraq did not fully cooperate with U.N. monitors and
said Thursday he had absolutely no intention of quitting.
	   ``I want to say simply, slowly and plainly that any suggestion
that that report was not factual, was not objective, is utterly
false,'' he said.
	   Butler also dismissed as ``utterly wrong'' any suggestion that
the report's release Tuesday night was timed to suit the U.S.
government and help President Bill Clinton deflect attention from
impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives.
	   On Nov. 24, Butler promised to deliver the report in two or
three weeks and he said he told the Russians, the French and other
ambassadors that his target date was Dec. 14 or 15. It was handed
to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Dec. 15.
	   ``It danced to no one's tune,'' he told reporters. ``It was not
written for anyone's purposes including, as some of you have
suggested, for the purposes of the United States.''
	   Speaking hours after Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said
Moscow would insist on his dismissal, Butler was asked if he would
quit. ``Absolutely not,'' he shot back.
	   During a divisive U.N. Security Council meeting Wednesday night,
China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasun said Butler had played ``a
dishonorable role in this crisis'' and called the report
``unfounded and evasive of the facts.''
	   Russia's U.N. envoy, Sergey Lavrov, who called the formal
council meeting, said the report's conclusion was biased and echoed
Iraq's contention that Butler cited only five incidents in 300
inspection operations.
	   Russia, China, Iraq and Kenya called for a cease-fire at
Wednesday night's council meeting but no action was taken because
of divisions among the 15 members.
	   Russia called another round of council consultations on Thursday
and circulated a draft presidential statement calling for an
immediate cessation of hostilities, expressing regret that force
was used against Iraq and calling for the early resumption of
cooperation between the inspectors and Baghdad.
	   Presidential statements are not legally binding but must be
adopted by consensus, and given the divisions on the council the
Russian draft has virtually no chance of being approved.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which Butler
heads, is charged with verifying the destruction of Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction. Over the past month inspectors tested the
promise Iraq made on Nov. 14, under threat of U.S. and British
airstrikes, to resume full cooperation with UNSCOM.
	   Butler's report, which triggered U.S. and British airstrikes
Wednesday, concluded that Iraq had not cooperated fully and had
placed new obstacles on the inspectors' work.
	   ``Iraq's conduct ensured that no progress was able to be made in
either the fields of disarmament or accounting for its prohibited
weapons programs,'' it said.
	   Defending the report Thursday, Butler said he consulted with
inspectors in the field ``and there is no doubt in my mind'' that
the conclusion is correct: Iraq did not keep its promise of full
cooperation ``whether we're talking about inspections or documents
or interviews.''
	   ``We did some work but it was not what we are expected to do,''
he said.
	   Butler said he expects the Security Council sometime in the days
and weeks ahead to once again tell Iraq it is legally obligated to
cooperate with UNSCOM and it should ``tell us the truth and let us
verify it honestly.''
	   ``We would go back and start our work tomorrow if they would
give us genuine cooperation,'' he said.
	   Butler was asked why UNSCOM's conclusions were in sharp contrast
to the report of the International Atomic Energy Agency which
concluded that Baghdad had cooperated with nuclear inspectors.
	   He said the IAEA's job was different because it was dealing with
a nuclear weapons program ``that was in the making'' _ which is
vastly different from UNSCOM's work with already completed
missiles, chemical and biological weapons.
	   Butler withdrew his inspectors hours after delivering his report
for security reason. The head of the U.N. humanitarian program in
Iraq, Benon Sevan, said Thursday he had decided to maintain 134 of
his staffers in Baghdad because that's where they are needed.
	   ``We are there for humanitarian reasons,'' Sevan said after
briefing the council on the situation on the ground in Iraq. ``We
are doing our work irrespective of the situation.''

Britain plans to update its anti-terrorism laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government announced legislative plans on
Thursday to update Britain's anti-terrorism laws and to redefine
terrorism.
	   Existing anti-terrorist law, which must be renewed annually, is
focused on Irish organizations. Home Secretary Jack Straw said it
was time to bring the legislation in line with the ``dismal
realities'' of modern terrorism.
	   The proposed law would put the legislation permanently on the
statute books, while also giving police extra powers to arrest and
question terrorist suspects.
	   It is to cover not only bomb attacks but hi-tech crimes such as
hacking into vital computer equipment to disrupt services, and the
use of chemical, biological and nuclear weaponry.
	   ``Terrorism is a reality and it will not disappear in the
foreseeable future,'' Straw said.
	   ``The proposals take proper account of the peace process and the
security situation in Northern Ireland, but also put great emphasis
on additional measures to combat other forms of domestic terrorism,
the continuing threat from international terrorism and the
likelihood of these threats continuing in the future.''
	   Under the new law, terrorism would be defined as ``the use of
serious violence against persons or property or the threat to use
such violence, to intimidate or coerce a government, the public or
any section of the public for political, religious or ideological
ends.''
	   Current laws cover only the ``use of violence for political ends
including any use of violence for the purpose of putting the public
or any section of the public in fear.''
	   Straw said the act would also outlaw any conspiracy to commit a
terrorist act abroad.

No snow puts a chill on U.S. ski resorts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SANDY SHORE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ With Christmas a week away, U.S. ski resorts from
Aspen to Vail to Winter Park have cranked snowmaking machines into
overdrive to cover their slopes.
	   Storms have left plenty of snow in the southern resorts of
Telluride, Wolf Creek and Purgatory, but they have skirted the
northern and central mountains since mid-November.
	   Ski industry representatives say the resorts are in good shape,
with healthy holiday bookings. But as days pass without natural
snowfall, some business owners are pondering just what the season
will hold.
	   ``It's been nice and sunny and it's beautiful, but there's no
snow,'' said Mark Esteppe, owner of Marko's Pizza and Pasta
Pizzeria in Edwards, 12 miles (20 kilometers) west of Vail. ``Vail
and Summit County are known for bringing people up from Denver on
the weekends. But if people know there's not a lot of snow here,
they don't come.''
	   Weather patterns have favored the Pacific Northwest and
California resorts with plenty of snow.
	   Nolan Doeskin, assistant state climatologist, said the central
and northern resorts logged above-average snowfall in mid-November,
but there has not been any significant precipitation since, which
is unusual.
	   ``When you walk through December, you expect to see the storm
frequency increasing, but it hasn't,'' he said.
	   The warm weather delayed openings for a few resorts until
nighttime temperatures fell below freezing, which allowed them to
begin using snowmaking equipment.
	   Arapahoe Basin delayed its opening until Saturday, the
second-latest opening day since 1990, resort spokeswoman Leigh
Hierholzer said.
	   The last resort in Colorado to open, A-Basin, was at a
disadvantage because it lacks snow-making equipment. ``We're at
Mother Nature's discretion,'' she said.
	   The delay cost the resort about 15 percent of its year-end
revenue, she said.
	   Mid-mountain reports Thursday showed most northern and central
resorts had bases with inch counts in the teens to low 20s (35 to
55 cms). At the same time last year, the bases for those resorts
ranged from the low 20s to the mid-30s (60-90 cms).
	   Chamber officials in the Summit County area, home to
Breckenridge, Keystone and Copper Mountain, say there have been
some holiday cancellations, which is typical when some vacationers
realize how much money they have spent on holiday gifts.
	   However, Lynn Skall, executive director of the Summit County
Chamber of Commerce, said some business owners are concerned about
meeting revenue goals if the dry weather continues.
	   Some hotels and restaurants are running specials to attract
customers. ``It's a little unusual for this time of year and that
is directly tied to the weather,'' she said.
	   Chris Sprenger, a shift manager at Mountain View Sports in
Keystone, believes business has been below average because of a
lack of snow.
	   ``But we're still jammed full of reservations,'' he said.
``People will be coming up.''
	   Perkins Miller, editor in chief for Mountain Sports and Living
magazine, believes the Rocky Mountain states will do well during
the holidays, noting that most skiers book those vacations as much
as three months in advance.
	   What all the resorts need, he said, is winter weather so skiers
think more about snow.
	   Miller said snowmaking equipment has advanced to the stage where
some skiers, like ski racers, prefer the artificial stuff.
	   ``You're never going to convince anybody that a day on
artificial snow is going to be better than 3 feet (0.9 meters) of
fresh powder, but the skiing experience as far as going up and
sliding down and having a good time is very equal,'' he said.
	   For Colorado, a cold front is headed into the state with the
promise of snow, forecasters said Thursday.
	   ``It's wait and see right now,'' Doeskin said. ``Four days from
now, it may be snowing like crazy and all the fears that have been
developing will quickly go away.''

Archie Moore remembered for more than just boxing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Boxing's Archie Moore was remembered Thursday
for more than just his remarkable career.
	   ``My husband set high standards for his children and for
others,'' his widow, Joan Hardy-Moore, said prior to a memorial
service in his adopted hometown of San Diego. ``He was an
extraordinary man who celebrated his life and lived it well. We
were fortunate to have him.''
	   Moore was 84 when he died Dec. 9 in a San Diego hospice. He had
heart surgery a few years ago, and his health had deteriorated in
the weeks before his death.
	   He spent 28 years of his life in the ring, a long career for any
professional athlete, especially a boxer. He held the light
heavyweight title for 11 years, and knocked out a record 141
opponents in 228 bouts.
	   He is the only fighter to go up against boxing mammoths Muhammad
Ali, then still known as Cassius Clay, and Rocky Marciano. He lost
both fights.
	   He counted among his friends boxers George Foreman, whom Moore
trained, Ken Norton and Yvon Durelle, a Canadian who lost two
memorable title fights to Moore in the late 1950s.
	   Biographer Mike Fitzgerald detailed Moore's life during the
memorial service, officiated by San Diego County Sheriff Bill
Kolender and attended by Durelle, local politicans and dozens of
people who were touched by his generosity over the years.
	   Born in Benoit, Mississippi on Dec. 13, 1916, Moore was raised
by an uncle in St. Louis. As a child, he wanted to be a musician,
but around age 15, during a brief stay in reform school, he decided
to become a boxer.
	   He started his professional career in 1935 and changed managers
eight times before retiring in 1963. He fought during a time when
managers frequently took advantage of black boxers and he would
change when he felt he was being exploited.
	   He took a brave stand during the Civil Rights movement after
winning a fight in New York. He told a national television audience
he was donating a portion of his purse to the Freedom Riders, who
challenged segregation in the South. Moore understood the risk of
his decision, but also the opportunity to make a statement, his
widow said.
	   Moore was nicknamed ``The Mongoose'' for his quick moves in the
ring, but also ``Ageless Archie'' because there was always a debate
over his age. Moore shaved three years off his age when he first
started boxing because family records showed 1913 and 1916 as his
year of birth.
	   He finished his career with 194 victories, 26 losses and eight
draws.
	   He was honored by presidents Eisenhower and Reagan for his work
as a world ambassador for boxing and the United States.
	   Moore was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in
1990 at Canastota, New York. Even in his later years, he had a
sharp memory and liked to illustrate his style by shadow boxing.
	   He lived modestly in San Diego in a home near Interstate 15 with
a distinguishing feature _ a swimming pool shaped like a boxing
glove.
	   His body was cremated, and his urn will be displayed in a
glass-fronted niche in about two weeks at Cypress View Mausoleum.

U.S. Justice Deptartment considers Salt Lake bribery probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede to clarify U.S. Justice Department's involvement.
ADDS new 5th graf explaining. &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CARTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ The U.S. Justice Department is weighing
whether it needs to investigate allegations of bribery in the
awarding of the 2002 Olympics.
	   Meanwhile, Salt Lake City officials acknowledged giving a paid
internship to the son of an International Olympic Committee member.
The IOC selects the Olympic host cities.
	   Last week, the Salt Lake committee of civic leaders that
successfully bid for the 2002 Winter Games said it spent dlrs
400,000 on scholarships for 13 student-athletes _ six of them
relatives of IOC members.
	   In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno said the Justice
Department's criminal division is considering whether it should
open a formal probe into the allegations.
	   Such reviews are common and fall far short of an actual criminal
investigation, which would be undertaken by the U.S. Attorney for
Utah.
	   Steven Sorenson, the chief deputy to U.S. Attoney Paul Warner,
would not discuss whether an investigation would be pursued into
the scholarships and allegations of other favors.
	   Gov. Mike Leavitt said the bribery question is something better
left up to an investigation by the ethics panel of the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee, the successor group to the committee that bid
for the games.
	   ``The world needs to hear anything that we wouldn't be proud of
from us and they need to hear it from us first,'' he said. ``And
they need to hear it from us soon.''
	   The 3-week-old controversy has snowballed into the biggest
corruption scandal in the 104-year history of the IOC.
	   Last weekend, Swiss IOC member Marc Hodler claimed extortion and
bribery played a role in other bids for the Olympic Games,
including the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta and the 1998 Winter
Olympics in Nagano, Japan. The IOC is investigating the Salt Lake
bid and could expand its probe.
	   The Salt Lake Organizing Committee plans to meet Friday and its
ethics panel will begin investigating the scholarships as well as
gifts, possible cash payoffs and free medical treatment _ all
apparent IOC violations.
	   ``At this point, we're hearing lots of alleged details and all
we have now are a lot of questions and no answers,'' said SLOC
spokeswoman Shelley Thomas.
	   Olympic organizers said there also may be problems with the
now-defunct bid committee's tax returns, which made no mention of
the scholarships.
	   Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini _ a former member of the
bid committee _ said the son of IOC member David Sikhulumi Sibandze
of Swaziland was given a city government internship at dlrs 6 an
hour while he attended the University of Utah in 1993-94.
	   The mayor's office said it found no evidence Sibu Sibandze's
one-year internship was tied to the Olympic bid.
	   The SLOC has refused to identify the people awarded
scholarships. But it confirmed that one was Sonia Essomba, daughter
of Rene Essomba, former secretary general of the African National
Olympic Committee Association and an IOC delegate from Cameroon.
	   The Associated Press has identified a second relative of an IOC
member who may have received scholarship money. Suhel Attarabulsi,
son of Libyan IOC member Bashir Attarabulsi, applied to Brigham
Young University in 1995. On his application, he listed his address
as 215 S. State, suite 2002 _ the address of the Salt Lake bid
committee.
	   Suhel Attarbulsi, who ultimately enrolled at Utah Valley State
College, did not return a call Thursday.
	   The SLOC said the scholarship program was started after Salt
Lake lost the bid for the 1998 Winter Games in 1991. No new grants
were given after the 1995 vote awarding the 2002 Games, although
payments on previous scholarships were made as recently as October.
	   The bid committee held tax-exempt status as a nonprofit
charitable organization. Its tax returns are public record and
offer the only peek so far into Salt Lake City's privately funded,
dlrs 13 million pursuit of the Olympics.
	   In each fiscal year from 1991 to 1997, the question ``Does the
organization make grants for scholarships, fellowships, student
loans, etc.'' was answered ``No.'' Lines used to report grants were
left blank.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks shot higher Thursday, as investors cast
aside concerns about the latest U.S. attack on Iraq and the
impending presidential impeachment vote. At the close on Wall
Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 85.22 points _ 1.0
percent _ at 8,875.82, reaching its peak in the last minutes of
trading. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ European and Asian markets ended up Thursday, as
investors shrugged off the launch of American military strikes
against Iraq and its implications for the impeachment efforts
against President Clinton. The airstrikes against Iraq, which got
under way Wednesday, didn't spark dramatic responses in Asia or
Europe. Oil prices, which rose Wednesday as air strikes became
imminent, fell Thursday as traders realized that Iraqi oil
facilities hadn't been damaged. The U.S. Treasury bond, normally a
safe haven in uncertain times, also fell slightly, and the U.S.
dollar was mixed against other dominant currencies. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A big jump in sales of soybeans, wheat and
other American farm products helped offset a rise in U.S. purchases
of foreign cars and oil, narrowing the trade deficit for a second
straight month. The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the
October deficit fell 1.2 percent to dlrs 14.2 billion, the lowest
level since April. Even with the improvements in September and
October, the overall deficit is still running at a record annual
rate of dlrs 167 billion, far above last year's gap of dlrs 110.2
billion, as the Asian financial crisis continues to batter key
parts of the American economy. (US-ECONOMY)
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Major oil producers Saudi Arabia, Venezuela
and Mexico agreed Thursday to maintain reduced output through 1999
and to seek cuts by other oil producers in order to bring down
supplies and improve sagging prices. Ministers of oil and energy
from the three nations said after a meeting in the Spanish capital
that they ``urge other producing countries to strictly comply with
their commitments.'' The meeting followed similar gatherings of oil
ministers from other countries. All were searching for a thus-far
elusive answer to the question of how to bring the price of oil
higher. (OIL-MEETING)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ DaimlerChrysler AG is considering
buying a stake in Japan's debt-laden Nissan Motor Corp. and not in
its truck-making subsidiary as originally contemplated, a German
news magazine reported Thursday. However, DaimlerChrysler
co-Chairman Juergen Schrempp is hesitant to do so at present,
according to an advance copy of next week's Der Spiegel.
DaimlerChrysler spokesman Eckhard Zanger in Stuttgart said Thursday
that the automaker and its German predecessor, Daimler-Benz AG,
have been in talks with Nissan and its Nissan Diesel subsidiary for
about a year on possible cooperation in commercial vehicle
production. (GEREMANY-DAIMLERCHRYSLER-NISSAN)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Parliament dealt a severe
blow to the European Union's Commission on Thursday by rejecting
its 1996 accounts amid allegations of fraud and spending
irregularities. A total 270 members of the 518 parliamentarians
present voted to withhold approval of the 1996 budget; 225 voted in
favor of approving the budget and 23 abstained. ``It's very clear
the vote was a loss for the Commission,'' the EU's Budget
Commissioner Erkki Liikanen told a news conference in Strasbourg,
France, where the 626-legislature is meeting. But, he added, the
Parliament ``has not asked the Commission to resign, and the
Commission has no intention of resigning,'' he added. The vote has
no direct impact on the Commission's day-to-day activities.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Mohamed Al Fayed, O.J. Simpson, Prince
Charles, Mohammed Ali and Mike Tyson &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mohamed Al Fayed agreed Thursday to pay an
unspecified amount to a former bodyguard who claims he was
pressured to quit after refusing to appear in a documentary about
the Paris car crash that killed Princess Diana and Al Fayed's son.
	   Alexander Wingfield had testified during a hearing this week
that the billionaire owner of the Harrods department store wanted
him to help advance the theory that Diana and boyfriend Dodi Fayed
were murdered.
	   As a result of his reluctance, Wingfield said, he felt pressured
to resign. He then sued one of Al Fayed's companies, Hyde Park
Residence, for breach of contract.
	   During the hearing, Wingfield also testified that Al Fayed had
introduced him to the maker of the documentary as the person
responsible for the Aug. 31, 1997, crash.
	   Al Fayed has publicly blamed Wingfield and bodyguard Trevor
Rees-Jones, the sole survivor in the wrecked Mercedes, for the
accident.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The U.S. federal tax agency wants the estate
of Nicole Brown Simpson to pay dlrs 6.5 million in taxes, a claim
based on a dlrs 12 million civil judgment against O.J. Simpson that
was never paid, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.
	   Ms. Simpson's father and administrator of her trust, Louis H.
Brown, said Wednesday he is appealing the Internal Revenue Service
demand because ex-football star O.J. Simpson has ``not paid one
penny'' of the dlrs 12 million wrongful-death judgment against him.
	   Simpson was aquitted in 1996 for the murders of his ex-wife,
Nicole Brown and her boyfriend, Ron Goldman, was later held liable
for monetary damages in the ``wrongful death'' of the pair.
	   Lawyers for Simpson declined comment.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ In a tribute to a charity's recycling
skills, Prince Charles unveiled a plaque Thursday sporting his
crest _ fashioned from a broken coffee table.
	   Charles, a keen conservationist, toured a formerly defunct
factory that's now the headquarters of Track 2000, a charity that
restores donated household appliances, beds and furniture.
	   The charity, which has distributed 3,500 metric tons (4,000
tons) of recycled goods to the needy, also oversees training
programs in carpentry and electronics for disabled and
disadvantaged people.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BEACON, New York (AP) _ A bronze casting of Muhammad Ali's
famous fists was missing from a foundry that was producing a
limited number of the replicas.
	   Peter Homestead, president of the Tallix Art Foundry, was
optimistic that the boxer's hands were merely misplaced in the
25,000-square-meter (80,000-square-foot) foundry.
	   ``I'm not naive,'' Homestead said Tuesday, ``but I'm hoping
they're going to turn up in some corner _ not that we haven't
already looked very closely.''
	   It was producing 1,998 of the replicas for sale by Virtual
Presence Recreations. The 7 1/2-pound casts _ about 9 1/2 inches
long _ were to be sold for dlrs 4,195.
	   The foundry is noted for casting Leonardo da Vinci's Lost Horse,
the Korean War Memorial in Washington and many sculptures for late
pop artist Roy Lichtenstein.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Mike Tyson wants to go back to jail _ to counsel
teen-agers.
	   The former heavyweight champion has asked permission to visit
convicted teens in the Arizona's Maricopa County Jail system.
	   Tyson, who plans to fight Francois Botha on Jan. 16 in Las Vegas
in his first bout since his boxing license was restored in October,
wants to tell the young offenders ``to make correct life choices so
as to avoid many of the pitfalls that Mr. Tyson has faced in his
life,'' his attorney, Darrow Soll, said in a letter to Sheriff Joe
Arpaio.
	   Tyson, who recently moved to Phoenix, spent three years in
prison for his 1993 sexual assault conviction in Indiana. He could
be sent back to jail if a judge determines his no-contest plea to
misdemeanor assault charges earlier this month in Maryland violated
his probation.

25 killed as Baghdad hit by second round of U.S. missile strikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with death toll climbing to 25, 75 injured &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ U.S. missiles struck the Iraqi capital Thursday
night in a second round of air strikes, and officials said at least
25 people were killed. A dozen explosions were heard in Baghdad,
and a pall of smoke hung over the downtown.
	   The attack came as U.S. officials were still assessing damage
from the strike by hundreds of missiles in the early morning hours
of Thursday.
	   In Washington, officials at the Pentagon, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said cruise missiles were fired deep into Iraq in the
second attack and Navy strike aircraft fired laser-guided bombs
along Iraq's borders.
	   At the government's press office in downtown Baghdad, witnesses
said one missile was seen flying over Thursday night. After the
first explosion was heard at 9:57 p.m. (1857gmt), anti-aircraft
fire came in response and tracer bullets darted into the night sky.
	   The blasts grew increasingly louder as they came nearer the
downtown. One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the
government's Military Industrial Corporation, from where smoke
drifted into the sky.
	   The Military Industrial Corporation, which is in charge of
Iraq's factories, was heavily damaged during the 1991 Gulf War but
has since been rebuilt. It is near the Rashid Hotel, where Iraq
houses visiting dignitaries and reporters.
	   Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak said at least 25 people were
killed and 75 injured from the two rounds of attacks.
	   Iraq's ill-equipped sanctions-hit hospitals will find it hard to
cope with the growing number of casualties, Mubarak told reporters
in a Baghdad hospital damaged by explosions nearby.
	   The sound of the blasts was far louder than the attack Thursday
morning since the missiles struck in the heart of the Iraqi
capital.
	   Unlike the first round of raids when all the missiles were
launched from ships, many in the second round were fired by B-52
bombers. British Tornado jets also took part in the raids Thursday
night.
	   Earlier in the day, sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS
Enterprise in the Gulf loaded thousands of pounds of laser-guided
weapons on warplanes.
	   Despite urging by Russia and China for a halt to the attacks,
U.S. President Bill Clinton had said earlier that the strikes would
continue. U.S. officials have said the strikes would go on for four
days.
	   The full extent of damage and casualties from the hundreds of
missiles fired in the early morning hours Thursday was unclear.
Foreign reporters in Baghdad are based at a press center in the
Information Ministry and cannot move around the sprawling city of 5
million without official escorts.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. missiles struck the Iraqi capital
Thursday night in a second round of airstrikes. At least a dozen
explosions were heard in Baghdad, and a pall of smoke hung over the
downtown. The attack came as U.S. officials were still assessing
damage from the strike by hundreds of missiles early Thursday. In
Washington, officials at the Pentagon said cruise missiles were
fired deep into Iraq in the second attack and Navy strike aircraft
fired laser-guided bombs along Iraq's borders. There was no
immediate word on casualties from the Thursday night attack. The
sound of the explosions was far louder than the attack Thursday
morning since the missiles struck in the heart of the Iraqi
capital. (IRAQ)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Over the vehement protests of Democrats, House
Republicans decided to open the impeachment debate against
President Bill Clinton on Friday despite an ongoing bombing
campaign against Iraq. No schedule was set for a vote on the four
articles of impeachment against the president. The Senate majority
leader, meanwhile, ruled out Thursday a deal to spare the president
a Senate trial. ``We will go to a trial, and there won't be any
deal making,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said on an
interview with CNN. Incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston set the
debate to begin at 10 a.m. Friday and pleaded with Democrats not to
stall lawmakers from voting on Saturday as Republicans had planned.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Rattling the judiciary and stalling Spain's
efforts to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Britain's highest court
on Thursday set aside its own ruling against the former Chilean
dictator because a judge failed to disclose ties with Amnesty
International. In an implied rebuke over the unprecedented legal
debacle in the House of Lords, the head of Britain's judiciary said
top judges must be required to declare any possible conflicts and
withdraw from cases where bias might be inferred. ``We must make
every effort to ensure that such a state of affairs could not occur
again,'' wrote Lord Derry Irvine, the Lord Chancellor.

	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police who said they were hunting
for the murderers of six Kosovo Serbs attacked a suspected
rebel-controlled village Thursday, reportedly killing two ethnic
Albanian fighters in a daylong battle. The clash that began around
dawn near Glodjane was one of the biggest in months in Kosovo,
where a wobbly October truce that has held across most of the
Serbian province is in increasing danger of breaking down
altogether. International monitors who got near the western Kosovo
village, located 10 kilometers (six miles) south of the city of
Pec, said they heard shelling and heavy fighting.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ With early elections looming, opposition
leader Ehud Barak stressed social issues over security concerns
Thursday as he launched his campaign against Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu. With President Bill Clinton's campaign
strategist, James Carville, at his side, Barak said he was ready
for elections, expected in April. Netanyahu said Wednesday he would
call Israelis to the polls more than a year ahead of schedule if he
could not muster enough support for his hard-line peace policies
before a no-confidence motion Monday in parliament. Netanyahu's
coalition has been crumbling since he signed the latest Mideast
peace accord _ which is opposed by most of his Cabinet because it
calls for Israel to cede war-captured West Bank land.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Venezuela's president-elect said
Thursday he hopes to visit the United States before taking office
in early February.
	   Midway through a South American tour that followed his Dec. 6
landslide victory, former leftist coup leader Hugo Chavez talked
trade and investment in conciliatory tones that contrasted with his
populist campaign rhetoric.
	   At a news conference in Argentina, the second of three nations
he is visiting in South America, Chavez said he would also likely
visit Europe before his inauguration on Feb. 2.
	   Chavez was denied a U.S. visa in 1996 and has been on an
immigration service ``lookout list'' of undesirable aliens barred
from the entering the United States because of his unsuccessful
1992 coup attempt.
	   But Chavez's victory, coupled with encouraging comments since
his triumph, appear to have eased concerns in the U.S. government
about his election.
	   Chavez, who met in Buenos Aires with Argentina's President
Carlos Menem and visiting Chilean President Eduardo Frei, was
headed to Colombia next. Earlier this week, he traveled to Brazil
and met with President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
	   ___
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Police searched the headquarters
of the Buenos Aires archdiocese late Wednesday as part of an
investigation into a local bank accused of fraud.
	   Police said they were looking for documents related to a dlrs 10
million loan the former archbishop of the archdiocese received from
the Bank of Provincial Credit.
	   The bank was shut down last year on charges of fraudulent
operations. Its owners are two sons of the former Argentine
ambassador to the Vatican.
	   After the bank's closing, former Archbishop Antonio Quarracino
alleged his name was forged on the loan documents. He died earlier
this year.
	   It was the first time in the archdiocese's history that police
had raided its offices.
	   ___
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Anti-riot police surrounded San
Salvador's police headquarters Thursday and fired tear gas to
dislodge striking officers who had taken over the building.
	   None of the estimated 50 striking municipal police inside the
building were injured in the brief clash, but one local reporter
suffered tear-gas inhalation.
	   The municipal police are striking to demand higher salaries and
to protest the demolition of an officer's union building in order
to expand the police headquarter's parking lot.
	   The strikers agreed to leave police headquarters after the brief
confrontation. The police officers agreed to meet Friday with local
government officials for negotiations.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ For the second straight year, more than
500 police officers were killed in Colombia, a third of them by
leftist rebels, police reported Thursday.
	   The officers' deaths were a sign of social decay and the
``uncontrollable levels of violence'' in the country,'' national
judicial police chief Gen. Ismael Trujillo told reporters.
	   Roughly 27,000 people die violently each year in Colombia, a
country of nearly 40 million people.
	   Trujillo said 503 police officers were killed between January
and November, 168 of them in attacks by guerrilla groups, who
ambush patrols and raid remote, outmanned police posts. The
statistics included deaths in auto accidents.
	   Last year 552 officers were killed, nearly 200 of them in
guerrilla attacks.
	   ___
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Severe thunderstorms pummeled
Argentina's midsection with rain and high winds that ripped away
rooftops and left nine people dead, news reports said Thursday.
	   The storms barreled northward across a swath of Argentina's
interior Tuesday and Wednesday, leaving four dead of electrocution
from downed power lines, one by lightning and others by falling
trees and debris.
	   Meteorologists said winds up to 75 mph (120 kph) tore rooftops
from makeshift homes near Cordoba, 475 miles (650 kilometers)
northwest of Buenos Aires, while torrential rains inundated
streets.
	   Thousands lost power in Rosario, 1,280 miles (280 kms) to the
north and hail was reported in some areas, according to the capital
newspaper La Nacion. Hail was reported elsewhere.
	   Winds toppled trees, telephone poles, grain silos and even a
flying club's airplane hangar, according to the Buenos Aires daily,
Clarin.
	   ___
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Police are stepping up security at the U.S.
Embassy in the event there are violent reactions in Peru to the
U.S. attack on Iraq.
	   Police have added anti-riot officers, extra-patrol cars and a
team specialized in deactivating bombs to the regular security
detail at the embassy.
	   ``The Department of State always recommends that embassies pay
attention to security during situations likes these. But we have
not received any threats and there have not been any
demonstrations,'' said an embassy official who asked not to be
named.
	   In the 1980s and early 1990s the U.S. Embassy was attacked
repeatedly by leftist rebels when it was located in an exposed area
of downtown Lima. It is now located in a residential neighborhood.
	   Guerrilla attacks have declined since the capture of major rebel
leaders in the early 1990s, but violence continues in isolated
rural areas.

Kosovo truce appears unraveling, verifiers powerless to stop it
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Kosovo's fragile truce
threatening to unravel, ethnic Albanian rebels are vowing revenge
for the killing of 36 guerrilla fighters in a border clash this
weekend.
	   At the same time, Serb police launched a strong crackdown
Thursday on a suspected rebel-controlled village, reportedly
killing two ethnic Albanian fighters and capturing 34 in a day-long
battle.
	   Serb authorities said they raided the village of Glodjane in
search of gunmen who slaughtered six Serb teen-agers Monday in a
bar in Pec, 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina.
	   Police also sealed off a northwestern suburb of Pec as part of
the sweep. An armored personnel carrier and police officers wearing
flak jackets blocked a bridge leading to the suburb Kapesnica.
Police snipers looked down from surrounding rooftops.
	   The barroom killings, which took place hours after Yugoslav army
troops killed 36 Kosovo Liberation Army rebels near the Albanian
border, enraged the Serb population, which makes up about 10
percent of the population of Kosovo. Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic threatened to crush ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' in the
province, which is a part of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   In a statement Thursday, the KLA denied responsibility for the
Pec killings and blamed the Serb secret police for the slayings.
	   ``We are convinced that this is the act of Serb secret police in
order to further strain relations between Serbs and Albanians,''
the rebel statement said. ``The murders of more than 30 of our
soldiers and commanders will not induce us to take revenge on the
civilian population _ we shall take revenge on the Serb police and
the military.''
	   The recriminations have raised concern that the Oct. 12 truce,
which ended months of fighting in this rebellious province, is
unraveling. The October agreement, hammered out by Milosevic and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, was designed to buy time for Serbs
and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians to negotiate a long-term agreement on
the province's future.
	   But U.S.-led diplomatic efforts have failed to narrow the gap
between the ethnic Albanians -- who seek independence for Kosovo --
and the Serbs who refuse more than autonomy within Serbia.
	   Under the October accord, Milosevic agreed to allow up to 2,000
unarmed international civilians to verify compliance. But the
verifiers were unable to enter Glodjane, 10 kilometers (six miles)
south of Pec during Thursday's fighting.

NATO gives qualified support for airstrikes; other experts question
</HEADLINE>
the strategy &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq drew
qualified endorsements from most NATO allies and agreement that
Saddam Hussein had only himself to blame. Some European military
analysts, however, questioned the strategy.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said backing for the
airstrikes was ``practically complete'' at a NATO defense ministers
meeting, even though the alliance did not orchestrate the attacks.
	   German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping expressed political
support for the airstrikes and ``regret that it was necessary.''
	   French Defense Minister Alain Richard broke ranks by deploring
the first-wave of U.S. attacks early Thursday and stressing the
``grave human consequences they could have on the Iraqi
population.''
	   But Solana singled out Saddam Hussein, saying, ``He alone is
responsible for the grave situation and for the consequences that
his defiance of the will of the international community has
entailed.''
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and his British
counterpart, George Robertson, skipped the NATO meeting to deal
with the Iraq crisis at home.
	   Independent analysts, meanwhile, questioned how airstrikes could
contribute to the goal of stabilizing the Middle East by ensuring
Iraq no longer threatens its neighbors and bringing it back into
the family of nations.
	   Jonathan Eyal of the Royal United Services Institute in London
said the airstrikes have effectively ended U.N. arms inspections in
Iraq.
	   ``It is impossible now to talk about a return of the U.N. (arms)
monitors,'' he said.
	   ``We are moving to a new strategy, that of containment to keep
Iraq at a very low level of military capability. It'll be a wrecked
country,'' Eyal said.
	   Dik Leurdijk of the Clingendael Institute in The Hague,
Netherlands, wondered about the timing of the airstrikes, a few
days before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
	   If the Americans ``stop on the weekend that would give Saddam
Hussein a reprieve of at least another month,'' Leurdijk said.
	   Paul Beaver of Jane's Information Group in London said the
airstrikes will ``work in a military sense.''
	   Allied airplanes can now ``hit targets now four times more
accurately than during the Gulf War,'' he said. ``The allies have
had seven years to get the targets right,'' but that will not
guarantee that Iraq can be forced into submission.
	   ``It is like the Kentucky Derby. You know the horses. You know
how fast they can go and you still don't win the race.''
	   At the NATO meeting, even France joined in blaming Saddam
Hussein, citing his efforts to frustrate U.N. arms inspectors. But
support for military measures was cool in France, which has tangled
with Washington in the past over that.
	   ``I don't know what the solution is,'' said French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine, adding that France had long lobbied for
``serious and effective checks'' for any Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction from the 1990-91 Gulf War.
	   Russia, which has consistently opposed military action against
Iraq, an old ally, denounced the airstrikes. Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev canceled his trip to meet with his NATO colleagues Friday.

South Korea claims sinking of North Korean submarine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A suspected North Korean submarine was
sunk in an exchange of fire with South Korean navy ships Friday off
South Korea's southern coast, the Defense Ministry said.
	   The 10-ton craft was first spotted shortly before midnight
Thursday as it approached the shore near Yosu, a port city 320
kilometers (200 miles) south of Seoul, it said.
	   The sub then fled southeast, pursued for 5 1/2 hours by South
Korean navy ships and air force planes, the ministry said.
	   Hemmed in 100 kilometers (62 miles) off the coast, the fleeing
sub opened fire at the pursuing South Korean ships. In a brief
exchange of fire, South Koreans sank the sub, it said.
	   The body of one of the sub's crewmen was recovered in a wet
suit, the ministry said.
	   North Korea routinely uses submarines to drop off or pick up
spies along South Korea's long coastline, officials say. Several
have been detected in recent years.

Iraq attacks keep Clinton out of impeachment fire _ for a day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With missiles raining down on Iraq, President
Bill Clinton found himself temporarily in a foxhole at home,
figuratively speaking, out of range of the rat-a-tat of Republican
impeachment fire.
	   The haven would not hold, but for a short period the commander
in chief could enjoy a wave of American public support for
Operation Desert Fox and watch Republicans struggle to respond.
	   Instead of debating articles of impeachment against Clinton on
Thursday, as had been planned before the Iraq attack, Republicans
and Democrats alike took to the floor to condemn Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein and express support for U.S. troops.
	   Afterward, over Democratic objections, the House decided to
start the impeachment debate Friday.
	   The Republicans made clear that supporting the troops should not
be mistaken for applauding the president. Many resent him not only
for the allegations that triggered the impeachment process but also
for his lack of military service _ and yet they could only stand by
and watch as surveys showed the American public overwhelmingly
approved of his decision to bombard Iraq.
	   In poll after poll, big majorities said they considered it the
right thing to do.
	   Was that actually a solid salute to the commander in chief, or a
reflex reaction to Saddam, whom the U.S. government has
relentlessly demonized since he invaded Kuwait in the summer of
1990?
	   ``The heart of it, I think, is against America's favorite bad
guy,'' said Robert Gates, former CIA director who was deputy
national security adviser when former President Bush presided over
the ouster of Iraqi forces from Kuwait in 1991. ``People have been
conditioned to understand Saddam's behavior'' as a threat to U.S.
interests.
	   Still, it seemed to play in Clinton's favor to have some
Republicans criticizing him for the Iraq bombing.
	   Former President Carter, who occasionally has been critical of
Clinton's foreign policy, alluded Thursday to comments by Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, who on Wednesday questioned whether
Clinton had ordered the attack as a way to divert Congress'
attention from impeachment.
	   ``Allegations by some members of Congress that the president of
the United States and his security advisers would launch an attack
on Iraq for political purposes are both unjust and ill-advised,''
Carter said.
	   Clinton himself addressed the point Thursday during a brief
session with reporters in the White House.
	   ``I don't think any serious person would believe that any
president would do such a thing,'' he said.
	   When Defense Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, went to the House chamber
Wednesday night to brief members on the Iraq operation, the only
moment of discord was when Majority Whip Tom DeLay asked whether
there was any reason the impeachment proceeding couldn't continue
during the bombing campaign.
	   Some colleagues responded with hisses and boos.
	   Still, the fact that Lott and others would raise these question
shows Clinton's reservoir of credibility has shrunk.
	   To Peter Rodman, a national security aide during the Bush
administration, ``This guy's credibility is shot,'' and if that is
seen during a crisis, ``it undercuts his effectiveness as a leader,
even if he's doing the right thing.''

<TEXT>
	   The United States says ``Operation Desert Fox'' was launched to
prevent Iraq from building the chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons it was prohibited from having under U.N. resolutions after
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sound of the explosions Thursday night was far louder than
the first round of attack since the missiles struck in the heart of
the Iraqi capital.
	   Unlike the first round of raids when all the missiles were
launched from ships, many in the second round were fired by B-52
bombers. British Tornado jets also took part in the raids Thursday
night.
	   Earlier in the day, sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS
Enterprise in the Gulf loaded thousands of pounds of laser-guided
weapons on warplanes.
	   Despite urging by Russia and China for a halt to the attacks,
U.S. President Bill Clinton had said earlier that the strikes would
continue. U.S. officials have said the strikes would go on for four
days.
	   The full extent of damage and casualties from the more than 200
missiles fired in the first round was unclear. Foreign reporters in
Baghdad are based at a press center in the Information Ministry and
cannot move around the sprawling city of 5 million without official
escorts.
	   In Washington, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said headquarters of Iraq's special forces and
military intelligence were leveled by sea-launched Tomahawk cruise
missiles.
	   Pentagon officials said Navy EA-6B attack planes also struck
Iraqi air defense radars.
	   Clinton, meeting in the Oval Office with top military and
foreign policy advisers Thursday morning, expressed regret that
there would inevitably be ``unintended casualties.''
	   In Baghdad Thursday, one sign of an expected second attack was
residents lining up at gas stations to stock up on fuel.
	   But many people went about their normal routines _ government
workers showed up at their offices and children at schools _ and
some gave a show of defiance.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
Salam Mohammed, 34, mumbled from a bed in Baghdad's al-Yarmouk
Hospital bed, his face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Air raid sirens sounded repeatedly in Baghdad Thursday afternoon
and evening.
	   Al-Sahaaf, the foreign minister, accused the United States and
Britain of committing crimes against the Iraqi people.
	   He accused both nations of lying in claiming that the report of
the U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler proved Iraq had not
cooperated in the search for its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This aggression against Iraq is a crime against international
law, the U.N. charter, and we will hold our full right to hold them
responsible _ the Americans and British _ for all the crimes they
are committing against our people,'' al-Sahaaf told the news
conference.
	   As he was speaking, an air-raid siren went off.
	   He said inspection teams had carried out visits to 427 sites
since the last stand-off over weapons inspections in mid-November
and there had been only five cases of non-cooperation.
	   The inspectors have the job of certifying Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step before the U.N.
Security Council will lift damaging trade sanctions imposed on Iraq
for its invasion of Kuwait.

	   Al-Sahhaf said the five sites that caused trouble did not
justify ``a dangerous crime against the people of Iraq.''
	   One proposed visit was to an office of Iraq's ruling Baath
Party, he said. Two others were a problem because they occurred on
Friday, the Muslim day of worship when most people are not working,
al-Sahhaf said.
	   In one case, he said, the inspectors tried to visit a former
office of a security official that had been changed into a guest
house. He said inspectors were delayed for 45 minutes in entering
the building as Iraqi authorities tried to explain the change.
	   ``Do you deserve to be bombarded because you have delayed an
inspection team 45 minutes?'' al-Sahhaf asked.
	   Al-Sahhaf also listed examples of targets struck in the American
attack, including factories and the headquarters of the security
police and military intelligence.
	   He said the two headquarters have been inspected more than once
by U.N. arms experts and many of the factories had U.N. cameras as
part of permanent monitoring of potential weapons sites.
	   The minister said that instead of calling their campaign
Operation Desert Fox, the allies should have named it ``Operation
Villains in the Arabian Desert.''
	   President Saddam Hussein visited some of the targeted sites
Thursday, including the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad Radio
reported. Hala, the youngest of his three daughters, was safe, but
the house was demolished, it said.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said. The house, built since the
Gulf War, was in a complex of buildings that was home to several of
Saddam's relatives.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in a radio address,
saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face'' but
``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known at the time
of the attack.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.

	   In Washington, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said headquarters of Iraq's special forces and
military intelligence were leveled by sea-launched Tomahawk cruise
missiles.
	   Clinton, meeting in the Oval Office with top military and
foreign policy advisers Thursday morning, expressed regret that
there would inevitably be ``unintended casualties.''
	   The American president said Wednesday he ordered ``Operation
Desert Fox'' to prevent Iraq from building the chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons it was prohibited from having under U.N.
resolutions after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Many in Baghdad went about their normal routines during the day.
Government workers showed up at their offices and children at
schools.
	   Some residents lined up at gas stations to stock up on fuel.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
Salam Mohammed, 34, mumbled from a bed in Baghdad's al-Yarmouk
Hospital bed, his face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   With an air raid siren blaring in the background, Al-Sahhaf told
journalists that the United States and Great Britain lied in
claiming that U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler's report
Tuesday proved Iraq had not cooperated in the search for its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This aggression against Iraq is a crime against international
law, the U.N. charter, and we will hold our full right to hold them
responsible _ the Americans and British _ for all the crimes they
are committing against our people,'' al-Sahhaf told the news
conference.
	   The inspectors have the job of certifying Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step before the U.N.
Security Council will lift damaging trade sanctions imposed on Iraq
for its invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf said inspection teams had carried out visits to 427
sites since the last standoff over weapons inspections in
mid-November and there had been only five instances where they
didn't cooperate.
	   Those instances _ which he said involved misunderstandings or
occurred during the Muslim Sabbath _ did not justify ``a dangerous
crime against the people of Iraq,'' he said.
	   Saddam visited some of the targeted sites Thursday, including
the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad Radio reported. Hala, the
youngest of his three daughters, was safe, but the house was
demolished, it said.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their

Pro Bowl snub is just fine with Favre
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GREEN BAY, Wisconsin (AP) _ Brett Favre says he didn't want to
go to the Pro Bowl anyway.
	   So, the five-time Pro Bowl selection isn't bummed over the snub,
a result undoubtedly of his NFC-leading 21 interceptions and the
Green Bay Packers' 0-4 record in prime time.
	   Plus, Randall Cunningham, Steve Young and Chris Chandler, who
did make it, all have better quarterback ratings and their teams
have better records.
	   Favre agrees they all deserved the honor, too.
	   Yet, as the Packers (9-5) struggle just to make the playoffs,
the three-time MVP says his play hasn't slipped below Pro Bowl
standards.
	   ``I feel like if I take away five interceptions, I'm having my
best year by far, I really do,'' said Favre, who has thrown for an
National Football League-best 3,806 yards and needs just three
touchdown passes to become the first player ever with five
30-touchdown seasons.
	   ``Completion percentage is up, yardage is up, yards per attempt
is up, touchdowns is still high,'' Favre said. ``We haven't won as
many games as we would like, but if I take away five interceptions
and we stay healthy, I think it's a little different year.''
	   Favre was named first alternate, not that it will matter.
	   ``I'm not going,'' he said. ``If one of them turns it down, I'm
not going.''
	   And that's not just sour grapes, he said.
	   ``I couldn't care less that I'm not going to the Pro Bowl,
really,'' Favre said.
	   ``I remember almost crying when I found out the first time I
made it, that's how excited I was. And I almost started crying
(Wednesday) when I found out I didn't make it, because I was that
happy.''
	   Favre is thinking about other things.
	   ``What I would like to do is get into the playoffs and see what
happens,'' he said. ``And there's a chance we can do that. The Pro
Bowl has never gotten me anything. Very rarely have you ever heard
me going around saying, `Hey, I want to make it to the Pro Bowl.'
Who cares?''
	   Coach Mike Holmgren wasn't surprised that Favre failed to make
the team, which is voted on by fans, coaches and players.
	   ``Not really, for this reason: I think he should go every year
because he's one of the best quarterbacks to ever play the game,''
Holmgren said. ``However, Steve Young is certainly having a great
year. Randall Cunningham is having a great year and Chris Chandler
is having a great year.
	   ``Those three fellows are certainly deserving of going. Brett is
having a great year. Those guys are having phenomenal years and
their teams are doing very well,'' Holmgren said.
	   But none of them has had to face the adversity Favre has this
season.
	   Favre has had a revolving door of receivers and running backs.
Four players have started at halfback, including Dorsey Levens, a
Pro Bowl selection last year who missed 10 weeks with a broken leg
and damaged ankle ligaments.
	   Flanker Robert Brooks has had a bad back, broken fingers and a
hamstring pull that's reduced him to a part-time receiver, and a
possession one at that.
	   Derrick Mayes missed six weeks with a knee injury, and Bill
Schroeder and Corey Bradford were lost for the season with
injuries.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Venezuela's president-elect said
Thursday he hopes to visit the United States before taking office
in early February.
	   Midway through a South American tour that followed his Dec. 6
landslide victory, former leftist coup leader Hugo Chavez talked
trade and investment in conciliatory tones that contrasted with his
populist campaign rhetoric.
	   At a news conference in Argentina, the second of three nations
he is visiting in South America, Chavez said he would also likely
visit Europe before his inauguration on Feb. 2.
	   Chavez was denied a U.S. visa in 1996 and has been on an
immigration service ``lookout list'' of undesirable aliens barred
from the entering the United States because of his unsuccessful
1992 coup attempt.
	   But Chavez's victory, coupled with encouraging comments since
his triumph, appear to have eased concerns in the U.S. government
about his election.
	   Chavez, who met in Buenos Aires with Argentina's President
Carlos Menem and visiting Chilean President Eduardo Frei, was
headed to Colombia next. Earlier this week, he traveled to Brazil
and met with President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Police searched the headquarters
of the Buenos Aires archdiocese late Wednesday as part of an
investigation into a local bank accused of fraud.
	   Police said they were looking for documents related to a dlrs 10
million loan the former archbishop of the archdiocese received from
the Bank of Provincial Credit.
	   The bank was shut down last year on charges of fraudulent
operations. Its owners are two sons of the former Argentine
ambassador to the Vatican.
	   After the bank's closing, former Archbishop Antonio Quarracino
alleged his name was forged on the loan documents. He died earlier
this year.
	   It was the first time in the archdiocese's history that police
had raided its offices.
	   ___
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Anti-riot police surrounded San
Salvador's police headquarters Thursday and fired tear gas to
dislodge striking officers who had taken over the building.
	   None of the estimated 50 striking municipal police inside the
building were injured in the brief clash, but one local reporter
suffered tear-gas inhalation.
	   The municipal police are striking to demand higher salaries and
to protest the demolition of an officer's union building in order
to expand the police headquarter's parking lot.
	   The strikers agreed to leave police headquarters after the brief
confrontation. The police officers agreed to meet Friday with local
government officials for negotiations.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ For the second straight year, more than
500 police officers were killed in Colombia, a third of them by
leftist rebels, police reported Thursday.
	   The officers' deaths were a sign of social decay and the
``uncontrollable levels of violence'' in the country,'' national
judicial police chief Gen. Ismael Trujillo told reporters.
	   Roughly 27,000 people die violently each year in Colombia, a
country of nearly 40 million people.
	   Trujillo said 503 police officers were killed between January
and November, 168 of them in attacks by guerrilla groups, who
ambush patrols and raid remote, outmanned police posts. The
statistics included deaths in auto accidents.
	   Last year 552 officers were killed, nearly 200 of them in
guerrilla attacks.
	   ___
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Severe thunderstorms pummeled
Argentina's midsection with rain and high winds that ripped away
rooftops and left nine people dead, news reports said Thursday.
	   The storms barreled northward across a swath of Argentina's
interior Tuesday and Wednesday, leaving four dead of electrocution
from downed power lines, one by lightning and others by falling
trees and debris.
	   Meteorologists said winds up to 75 mph (120 kph) tore rooftops
from makeshift homes near Cordoba, 475 miles (650 kilometers)
northwest of Buenos Aires, while torrential rains inundated
streets.
	   Thousands lost power in Rosario, 175 miles (280 kms) to the
north and hail was reported in some areas, according to the capital
newspaper La Nacion. Hail was reported elsewhere.
	   Winds toppled trees, telephone poles, grain silos and even a
flying club's airplane hangar, according to the Buenos Aires daily,
Clarin.
	   ___
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Police are stepping up security at the U.S.
Embassy in the event there are violent reactions in Peru to the
U.S. attack on Iraq.
	   Police have added anti-riot officers, extra-patrol cars and a
team specialized in deactivating bombs to the regular security
detail at the embassy.
	   ``The Department of State always recommends that embassies pay
attention to security during situations likes these. But we have
not received any threats and there have not been any
demonstrations,'' said an embassy official who asked not to be
named.
	   In the 1980s and early 1990s the U.S. Embassy was attacked
repeatedly by leftist rebels when it was located in an exposed area
of downtown Lima. It is now located in a residential neighborhood.
	   Guerrilla attacks have declined since the capture of major rebel
leaders in the early 1990s, but violence continues in isolated
rural areas.

Council keeps UN in Western Sahara for another month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council decided Thursday to
keep a U.N. force in the disputed Western Sahara for another month
to allow both sides to work towards a referendum on the territory's
future.
	   In a unanimous resolution, the council called on Morocco and the
rebel group Polisario Front to allow the U.N. refugee agency begin
working to repatriate voters ahead of the vote, expected by next
December.
	   Western Sahara was abandoned by Spain, its former colonial
ruler, in 1975. Morocco invaded, claiming historical links, and a
war broke out between Moroccan troops and the rebel Polisario Front
that ended with a 1991 U.N.-negotiated cease-fire.
	   A U.N. force has been trying to identify voters because of
disagreements about who is eligible to cast ballots. Each side has
accused the other of trying to pad voter rolls.
	   The council decided to maintain the U.N. force in Western
through Jan. 31 _ time to allow both sides to hold consultations on
the identification process and the referendum.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan visited the region last month to
try to accelerate the process.

 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Nationwide Insurance loses age discrimination lawsuit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Nationwide Insurance has lost a
dlrs 4.4 million age discrimination lawsuit filed by two employees
in its Puerto Rican branch, El Nuevo Dia newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   A federal jury on Friday awarded the amount to Juan Gonzalez
Perez and Manuel A. Baralt, who were fired in 1994 by the company.
	   Gonzalez, a manager in the personal and commercial insurance
department, was 60 when he was fired and had worked for Nationwide
for 25 years. Baralt, a claims manager, was 49 and had 25 years
with the company.
	   The U.S. District Court jury ordered the company to pay Gonzalez
dlrs 1.5 million for mental anguish, dlrs 400,000 in lost wages and
dlrs 500,000 for his wife's suffering.
	   It awarded Baralt dlrs 2 million, including dlrs 500,000 for his
wife's suffering.
	   It was unclear Thursday if Nationwide planned to appeal the
decision.
	   A third age discrimination lawsuit filed by former vice
president and general manager Enrique A. Lopez is still pending, El
Nuevo Dia reported.
 &UR; SURINAME: State Oil to sell crude to Trinidad's Petrotrin
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Suriname's State Oil has signed a
dlrs 40 million contract to sell crude oil to Trinidad's Petrotrin,
company officials said Thursday.
	   State Oil will supply Petrotrin with 110,000 to 175,000 barrels
of crude per month over two years, according to the contract signed
Wednesday. Petrotrin has processed part of State Oil's crude since
1986.
	   The two countries are separated by about 400 miles (650
kilometers). In a written statement, government-owned State Oil
said the deal fit into the country's plans to strengthen trade ties
to the Caribbean.
	   State Oil also said in a written statement it has signed an
agreement with Canadian firm Koch Exploration to negotiate oil
exploration in the country's Wayombo area.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Hotel stays drop in October because of hurricane
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Hotel reservations in Puerto Rico
dropped 7 percent from September to October because of damage
caused by Hurricane Georges, tourism officials said Thursday.
	   However, they noted the numbers for 1998 are still up over 1997.
	   Georges hit Puerto Rico on Sept. 21 and forced temporary
closures at 14 hotels, most of them outside San Juan, the Puerto
Rico Tourism Co. said. The number of registrations outside San Juan
dropped 38.3 percent.
	   Total room nights sold in October increased 6.4 percent over
October 1997, from 171,870 to 182,941. Occupancy rates averaged
76.3 percent _ about 16 percent higher than last year because of
the reduced number of rooms.
	   During the first 10 months of 1998, registrations totaled 1.3
million _ 4.7 percent higher than in 1997.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: French buying Consolidated Cigars, newspaper says
	   MIAMI (AP) _ France's largest tobacco company is buying
Consolidated Cigar Holdings _ makers of Dutch Masters, Don Diego
and Muriel cigars, among other brands _ in a dlrs 730 million deal.
	   The French concern, Seita SA, agreed to buy Consolidated for
dlrs 531 million in cash, or about dlrs 17.85 a share. Seita also
was to assume nearly dlrs 200 million in debt owed by Fort
Lauderdale, Florida-based Consolidated, The Miami Herald reported
Thursday.
	   Consolidated has 5,400 employees. Just 550 employees work in the
United States, while the rest work in Consolidated's cigar
factories in the Caribbean and in Central America.
	   The move will let Seita get its foot in the door in the U.S.
cigar market, which is the world's largest market for stogies.
Consolidated already commands 24 percent of cigar sales in this
country.
	   The move also appeared certain to cement Seita's position as the
world's leading cigar maker.
	   Consolidated Cigar is controlled by billionaire investor Ronald
Perelman, who has a 65 percent stake in the company _ which would
be worth about dlrs 350 million in the sale. Perelman has said he
backs the offer from Seita.
 &UR; ST. MAARTEN: Most passengers from stricken cruise ship leave
	   PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) _ Hundreds of tourists who
abandoned ship when a cruise liner struck a Caribbean reef were
flew home to the United States Wednesday.
	   Most of the 2,557 tourists evacuated from the Monarch of the
Seas on Tuesday were flying to Miami or San Juan, Puerto Rico, or
had already arrived, said Gloria Jacaruso, spokeswoman for Royal
Caribbean International.
	   Some tourists, unwilling to shorten their vacations, were
staying in the island of St. Maarten, 150 miles (240 kilometers)
east of Puerto Rico.
	   The Monarch slammed into a reef less than a mile (kilometer) off
Philipsburg at 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, opening a 120-foot-by-3-foot gash
(40-meter-by-1-meter) in the forward left side of the hull. The
crew decided to beach the 74,000-ton ship on sand in Great Bay
harbor to prevent it from sinking, and all passengers were safely
evacuated. No one was hurt.
	   Investigators from the U.S. Coast Guard, Dutch St. Maarten and
Royal Caribbean were on the scene, trying to determine what caused
the accident.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Third man arrested in alleged kickback scheme
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The Federal Bureau of Investigation
has arrested a third man in an alleged kickback scheme during the
aftermath of Hurricane Georges.
	   Subcontractor Luis A. Rodriguez Sierra was charged Tuesday with
conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government, the agency said
Wednesday. It claims he inflated estimates of hurricane debris in
the town of Toa Alta in order to win more funds from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
	   On Nov. 24, the FBI arrested Toa Alta mayor Angel Rodriguez and
contractor Jose Orlando Figueroa on charges they demanded dlrs 2.5
million in bribes from Mississippi-based JESCO, a company hired to
collect debris after Hurricane Georges struck on Sept. 21.
	   Angel Rodriguez and Figueroa pleaded innocent on Monday to
conspiracy, extortion and bribery indictments.
	   U.S. prosecutors claim Figueroa contacted Rodriguez Sierra
through the telephone book and directed him to show dlrs 500,000
cubic yards of debris.
	   Figueroa paid Rodriguez Sierra dlrs 2,500 and promised him a
bonus after the inflated estimate was submitted to the U.S.
government, prosecutors allege.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Parliament raises money laundering reporting threshold
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The Jamaican parliament has passed
money laundering legislation raising the reporting threshold for
banks from dlrs 10,000 to dlrs 50,000.
	   All ``suspicious'' transactions of any amount must still be
reported, the law says. The changes were passed Tuesday.
	   The change was made to ease restrictions on tourism-related
businesses that transact large amounts of money in foreign
currency, said National Security Minister Keith Knight.
	   The amendments also raise the reporting threshold for foreign
currency exchange house from dlrs 5,000 to dlrs 8,000.
	   Under Jamaican law, banks are required to report transactions
above the threshold to the island's director of public prosecution.
Some government bodies, international agencies and diplomatic
offices are given exemptions.
	   During debate in parliament, the opposition Jamaica Labor Party
claimed that the amendment forces banks to do more detective work
instead of automatically reporting transactions.
 &UR; TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO: Economy shrinks in third quarter
	   PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Dashing predictions of growth, a
report by Trinidad and Tobago's central bank says slipping oil
prices drove the country's economy down a half-percent during the
third quarter of 1998.
	   A dip in contract prices for natural gas also contributed to the
sluggish numbers, the Trinidad Central Bank said in the report
released Tuesday. It covers July, August and September of 1998.
	   Government officials had predicted a 5 percent economic growth
rate earlier this year.
	   But the report said revenue from crude and refined oil tumbled
almost dlrs 16 million during the quarter. Taxes from the petroleum
sector, which were as high as 40 percent of total revenue during
the oil boom years of the 1970s and 1980s, dropped to just under 10
percent during the quarter.
	   Overall, however, the petroleum sector showed a gain of 0.4
percent, due mostly to dramatic increases manufacturing of
petrochemicals like fertilizers _ which saw production rise 16.4
percent _ and methanol.
	   However, declines in distribution, transport, communications and
the finance and real-estate sectors overwhelmed the slight gain in
the petroleum sector.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Architects to appeal demolition of hotel to supreme
court
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The Puerto Rican Architects'
Association says it will appeal the demolition of a San Juan hotel
to the island's supreme court.
	   The group wants La Concha Hotel in the Condado tourist district
declared an historic landmark, but its case has been rejected by
both a trial judge and an appeals court.
	   On Wednesday, El Nuevo Dia newspaper quoted the association's
executive director, Cristina Cardalda, as saying the group would
appeal the case to the high court. ``This was what we had
anticipated since the beginning,'' Cardalda said.
	   The state-owned hotel, named ``The Shell'' for a shell-shaped
wing on the beach, is due to be destroyed along with the San Juan
Convention Center as part of Gov. Pedro Rossello's plans to shed
money-losing government enterprises.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Government behind on pineapple production
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The Puerto Rican government said it
is behind on deliveries of pineapples to fruit processor
Procesadora Campofresco, which bought the Lotus pineapple brand
from the government in 1995.
	   The San Juan Star on Wednesday reported Agriculture Secretary
Miguel Munoz saying state-owned farms had produced 23,000 tons
(20,700 metric tons) of the 27,000 tons (24,300 metric tons)
promised to the company this year.
	   Campofresco accused the government of planting only 165 acres
(66 hectares) of the 291 acres (116 hectares) that must be seeded
by Nov. 30, but Munoz said the government had reduced production at
Campofresco's request while the company moved equipment to another
plant.
	   The government is still considering bids for the sale of the
government's pineapple farms and hopes to reach a deal next year.
	   The plan is part of Gov. Pedro Rossello's efforts to privatize
government enterprises including a sugar company, the telephone
utility, a shipping firm and the management arm of the water
utility.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Kiwi to fly from JFK airport to Aguadilla, Puerto
Rico
	   NEWARK, New Jersey (AP) _ Newark-based Kiwi International
Airlines announced today it's adding service from Kennedy
International Airport in New York starting next month.
	   The carrier will offer two round-trip flights a week to
Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.
	   Kiwi already flies to the western Puerto Rican city from Newark,
Orlando and Miami.
	   The airline will not add jets to its fleet of eight 727s, just
shift planes to accommodate the new route.
 &UR; GUYANA: Business group urges consumers to avoid imports
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A business group has joined government
calls for consumers to buy more locally produced goods to prevent
further declines in the value of the Guyanese currency.
	   The Guyanese dollar has declined in value by 20 percent in
recent months to a rate of 170 to one U.S. dollar, triggering fears
of inflation.
	   On Monday, the Private Sector Commission, an umbrella
organization of business groups, said reducing imports to the South
American country is a key part of propping up the currency.
	   ``All we are asking is that people buy a little more of what is
manufactured locally. We have passed the stage where we can call
for a restriction of imports with all the conventions we have
signed to open up the economy and with globalization on the
horizon,'' said David Yankana.
	   The currency has also been weakened by depressed world market
prices for sugar, bauxite, gold and timber. Most of these are key
Guyana exports.
 &UR; BAHAMAS: Stars, extravagance christen resort in Bahama
	   PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas (AP) _ With a gold-gilded beauty queen
atop an ice sculpture and Grace Jones rising from a cloud billowing
smoke, celebrities christened Atlantis, billed as the biggest
island resort in the world.
	   ``The Bahamas has been catapulted to the point of dominance in
the tourism business in our region,'' Prime Minister Hubert
Ingraham said after cutting the ribbon of a dlrs 20 million,
three-lane bridge to Paradise Island.
	   He said the dlrs 400 million hotel and its dlrs 450 million
second phase was the island's largest private investment.
	   Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Quincy Jones and his 45-piece
orchestra, Bebe Winans and Natalie Cole performed Saturday night.
Billionaire real estate magnate Donald Trump and media queen Oprah
Winfrey mingled with guests beneath the hotel's 70-foot (21-meter)
domed lobby as fireworks soared over the Atlantic Ocean.
	   Actress and signer Grace Jones rose from a billowing cloud of
smoke as the Goddess of Atlantis, presiding over an aquatic routine
performed by the U.S. synchronized swim team.
 &UR; GUYANA: Exxon negotiating for rights to search for oil
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ U.S. oil company Exxon is negotiating
with Guyana officials for the rights to explore for oil in an
off-shore area already searched unsuccessfully by a French
conglomerate.
	   Officials with the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission said
Saturday they expect to reach an agreement within weeks with Exxon
for the rights to explore an 11,000-square-mile
(28,600-square-kilometer) area.
	   French company TOTAL unsuccessfully probed the area in 1991, but
Guyana officials want to try again. The South American country is
surrounded by oil-producing nations such as Venezuela, Brazil and
Trinidad and Tobago.
 &UR; MARTINIQUE: Port blockage scuttles negotiations to end strike
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ A scheduled meeting Friday
morning between banana growers and striking workers fell apart
because the growers' representatives refused to meet while
protesters continued to block the port.
	   The representatives of the growers decided not to negotiate as
long as the port is blocked by strikers, Louis Daniel Berthome,
farmers federation president, told RFO radio Friday.
	   On Thursday, the workers' union proposed opening the port to
allow the export of 20 containers of bananas, but growers refused
the offer, citing solidarity.
	   ``It was as if they asked us to choose among a hundred
containers, and the growers refused to negotiate on that basis,''
said Berthome.
	   Meanwhile, merchants said the inability to import goods right
before Christmas was increasingly hurting their businesses.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Nicaragua files suit against tobacco companies
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Nicaragua has filed suit against
U.S. tobacco companies in federal court, modeled after the lawsuit
filed by U.S. state attorneys general.
	   The suit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court in the U.S.
commonwealth of Puerto Rico, names several cigarette companies
including Philip Morris, Liggett Group and British American
Tobacco.
	   Guatemala, represented by the same Houston law firm that
represents Nicaragua, has filed a similar suit and a Brazilian
official said Thursday his country is also considering legal
action.
	   ``This is very similar to cases filed by the U.S. attorneys
general and we anticipate using a number of documents used
throughout the United States in (related) litigation matters and
many of the witnesses we anticipate using at trial are in U.S.
jurisdiction,'' said lawyer D'Lisa Simmons of the Houston-based law
firm of Fleming, Hovenkamp and Grayson, which is representing
Nicaragua and Guatemala.
 &UR; TRINIDAD: Official criticizes hike in cement prices
	   PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ An 18 percent price increase by
the country's sole supplier of cement was criticized by Minister of
Trade and Industry Mervyn Assam as ``scandalous.''
	   In a radio interview broadcast Thursday, Assam joined others in
criticizing Trinidad Cement Ltd. for the price hike. The company's
chief executive officer Rollin Bertrand said the increase was
necessary to pay greater dividends to shareholders.
	   Assam called the increase ``totally and completely inimical to
the interests of Trinidad and Tobago.'' TRINIDAD: Repeal of
registration fees boosts used car imports
	   PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Dealers who sell used cars
imported from other countries have reported huge sales increases
since a 50 percent hike in registration fees was repealed by the
government a week ago.
	   In October, Finance Minister Brian Kuei Tung announced an
increase in the registration fee for imported used cars. For those
with engine displacement up to 1599cc the fee rose from dlrs 20,000
TT (dlrs 3,250 US) to dlrs 30,000 TT (dlrs 4,875 US).
	   On Dec. 4, the government repealed the increase, causing an
instant boom in sales, dealers said.
 &UR; BARBADOS: Barbados and Venezuela sign economic pact
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Barbados and Venezuela signed a
taxation agreement Friday which Barbados Foreign Minister Billie
Miller said could result in greater trade and investment between
the countries.
	   Miller said the agreement is part of Barbados' resolve to work
toward further economic integration in the Caribbean and greater
economic ties with Latin America.
	   ``This agreement ... will allow our business persons to plan
their activities between the two countries more effectively and
securely and will further the process of economic integration in
our region,'' said Miller.
	   Foreign Minister Angel Burelli signed the agreement for
Venezuela.

Outback satellite stations said playing role in Iraq strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Satellite ground stations in the
Australian Outback may have been used to help plan and carry out
the air strikes on Iraq, an American intelligence specialist said
Friday.
	   Dr. Jeffrey Richelson, a senior fellow at the National Security
Archive in Washington, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio
that the joint U.S.-Australian bases may have been used in the same
manner as they were during the 1991 Gulf War.
	   He said the Nurrungar base in South Australia state was a ground
station for the U.S. Defense Support Program east satellite, which
could monitor the launch of Iraqi missiles just as it did in 1991.
	   That satellite could also detect explosions on the ground,
collecting data which could be used to assess bomb damage in almost
real time, he said.
	   A second facility at Pine Gap, near the central Australian town
of Alice Springs, was a ground station for various U.S. signal
intelligence satellites able to intercept electronic communications
within Iraq.
	   There was no confirmation that Pine Gap had been used during the
Gulf war, he said.
	   ``We do know for certain that the Nurrungar ground station for
DST played an important role in the 1991 war because it controlled
at least one of the satellites that was used to monitor the Scud
launches throughout the Gulf war,'' Richelson said.
	   Prime Minister John Howard on Thursday declined to comment on
activities at the joint facilities.

As supporters protest, Chinese dissidents go to trial

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WUHAN, China (AP) _ Their lawyers detained or scared off, two
prominent Chinese dissidents accused of subversion personally
argued their innocence Thursday in trials underscoring the
Communist Party's resolve to keep its monopoly on power.
	   But their statements were repeatedly cut off by the judges who,
sitting in courtrooms 300 miles (480 kilometers) apart, needed less
than 2 1/2 hours to hear the separate cases against Wang Youcai and
Qin Yongmin.
	   Dissidents and friends gathered outside the courthouses, defying
police sweeps on the eve of the trial that they said put at least
15 people, including Wang's brother and sister, in detention.
	   About 200 Wang supporters staged a rare protest in the eastern
city of Hangzhou, while in the central city of Wuhan, police broke
up a huddle of several dozen Qin supporters and later detained two
of them.
	   The trials are the highest-profile prosecutions of dissidents in
two years, a period in which China has worked to improve relations
with the United States and other Western countries.
	   The skewed proceedings undercut the Communist Party's claims to
progress in fashioning a fairer legal system. China has won praise
recently from the United States and others for signing U.N. rights
treaties.
	   For Wang and Qin, authorities undermined even the slim legal
safeguards for criminal defendants. Qin's family was given three
days notice of the trial. Police warned lawyers away and detained
one noted attorney ready to represent both men, family members
said.
	   Foreign reporters were barred from the trials and the courts
allowed only select family members inside, three in Wang's case,
one in Qin's.
	   The tactics belied concern about the China Democracy Party, the
would-be opposition group Wang and Qin tried to form. Since June,
dissidents in 14 provinces and cities have tried to meet legal
requirements to register the party. At least 30 members have been
detained or questioned in the crackdown begun three weeks ago that
saw Qin arrested and Wang, who was already in custody, charged.
	   ``The government's sole concern is to maintain its unchallenged
grip on power at the cost of smothering the Chinese people's
fundamental rights and freedoms,'' said Xiao Qiang, executive
director of the New York-based group Human Rights in China.
	   Although judges planned to rule later, dissident trials almost
always result in guilty verdicts.
	   Wang, a former student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square
democracy movement, and Qin, a democracy campaigner for 20 years,
could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted of inciting the
subversion of state power.
	   Beijing's announcement in March that it would sign the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights _ which
affirms the freedom of assembly _ partly spurred dissidents to try
to form an opposition party.
	   During the trials, prosecutors accused both Wang and Qin of
being leading figures in the China Democracy Party and of working
with exiled dissidents to organize the group, family members said.
	   Judges and prosecutors treated the defendants abruptly. In
Hangzhou, a judge cut off Wang's self-defense statement after 30
minutes, calling it irrelevant to the indictment, said his wife, Hu
Jiangxia.
	   Qin was also interrupted seven times by judges and prosecutors,
although he was ultimately allowed to finish his statement, said
his brother Qin Xiaoguang.
	   In a rare display of public support for a dissident, 200 people
stood at the head of the narrow lane leading to Hangzhou courthouse
where Wang was on trial.
	   Local officials prevented foreign reporters from conducting
interviews and confiscated their tapes and film. China's
government-controlled news media did not report on the trials.

25 killed as Baghdad hit by second round of U.S. missile strikes

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ U.S. missiles again pounded the Iraqi capital,
and officials said at least 25 people were killed in two rounds of
punishing raids. A dozen explosions were heard in Baghdad, and a
pall of smoke hung over the downtown.
	   The attack on Thursday night came as U.S. officials were still
assessing damage from the strike by hundreds of missiles in the
early morning hours of Thursday.
	   In Washington, officials at the Pentagon, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said cruise missiles were fired deep into Iraq in the
second attack and Navy strike aircraft fired laser-guided bombs
along Iraq's borders.
	   At the government's press office in downtown Baghdad, witnesses
said one missile was seen flying over Thursday night. After the
first explosion was heard at 9:57 p.m. (1857gmt), anti-aircraft
fire came in response and tracer bullets darted into the night sky.
	   The blasts grew increasingly louder as they came nearer the
downtown. One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the
government's Military Industrial Corporation, from where smoke
drifted into the sky.
	   The Military Industrial Corporation, which is in charge of
Iraq's factories, was heavily damaged during the 1991 Gulf War but
has since been rebuilt. It is near the Rashid Hotel, where Iraq
houses visiting dignitaries and reporters.
	   Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak said at least 25 people were
killed and 75 injured from the two rounds of attacks.
	   Iraq's ill-equipped hospitals will find it hard to cope with the
growing number of casualties, Mubarak told reporters in a Baghdad
hospital damaged by massive nearby explosions.
	   Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf referred to
``heavy casualties'' in civilian areas of Baghdad, but declined to
give specific figures.
	   The United States says ``Operation Desert Fox'' was launched to
prevent Iraq from building the chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons it was prohibited from having under U.N. resolutions after
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sound of the explosions Thursday night was far louder than
the first round of attack since the missiles struck in the heart of
the Iraqi capital.
	   Unlike the first round of raids when all the missiles were
launched from ships, many in the second round were fired by B-52
bombers. British Tornado jets also took part in the raids Thursday
night.
	   Earlier in the day, sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS
Enterprise in the Gulf loaded thousands of pounds of laser-guided
weapons on warplanes.
	   Despite urging by Russia and China for a halt to the attacks,
U.S. President Bill Clinton had said earlier that the strikes would
continue. U.S. officials have said the strikes would go on for four
days.
	   The full extent of damage and casualties from the more than 200
missiles fired in the first round was unclear. Foreign reporters in
Baghdad are based at a press center in the Information Ministry and
cannot move around the sprawling city of 5 million without official
escorts.
	   In Washington, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said headquarters of Iraq's special forces and
military intelligence were leveled by sea-launched Tomahawk cruise
missiles.
	   Pentagon officials said Navy EA-6B attack planes also struck
Iraqi air defense radars.
	   Clinton, meeting in the Oval Office with top military and
foreign policy advisers Thursday morning, expressed regret that
there would inevitably be ``unintended casualties.''
	   In Baghdad Thursday, one sign of an expected second attack was
residents lining up at gas stations to stock up on fuel.
	   But many people went about their normal routines _ government
workers showed up at their offices and children at schools _ and
some gave a show of defiance.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
Salam Mohammed, 34, mumbled from a bed in Baghdad's al-Yarmouk
Hospital bed, his face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Air raid sirens sounded repeatedly in Baghdad Thursday afternoon
and evening.
	   Al-Sahhaf, the foreign minister, accused the United States and
Britain of committing crimes against the Iraqi people.
	   He accused both nations of lying in claiming that the report of
the U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler proved Iraq had not
cooperated in the search for its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This aggression against Iraq is a crime against international
law, the U.N. charter, and we will hold our full right to hold them
responsible _ the Americans and British _ for all the crimes they
are committing against our people,'' al-Sahhaf told the news
conference.
	   As he was speaking, an air-raid siren went off.
	   He said inspection teams had carried out visits to 427 sites
since the last stand-off over weapons inspections in mid-November
and there had been only five cases of non-cooperation.
	   The inspectors have the job of certifying Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step before the U.N.
Security Council will lift damaging trade sanctions imposed on Iraq
for its invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf said the five sites that caused trouble did not
justify ``a dangerous crime against the people of Iraq.''
	   One proposed visit was to an office of Iraq's ruling Baath
Party, he said. Two others were a problem because they occurred on
Friday, the Muslim day of worship when most people are not working,
al-Sahhaf said.
	   In one case, he said, the inspectors tried to visit a former
office of a security official that had been changed into a guest
house. He said inspectors were delayed for 45 minutes in entering
the building as Iraqi authorities tried to explain the change.
	   ``Do you deserve to be bombarded because you have delayed an
inspection team 45 minutes?'' al-Sahhaf asked.
	   Al-Sahhaf also listed examples of targets struck in the American
attack, including factories and the headquarters of the security
police and military intelligence.
	   He said the two headquarters have been inspected more than once
by U.N. arms experts and many of the factories had U.N. cameras as
part of permanent monitoring of potential weapons sites.
	   The minister said that instead of calling their campaign
Operation Desert Fox, the allies should have named it ``Operation
Villains in the Arabian Desert.''
	   President Saddam Hussein visited some of the targeted sites
Thursday, including the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad Radio
reported. Hala, the youngest of his three daughters, was safe, but
the house was demolished, it said.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said. The house, built since the
Gulf War, was in a complex of buildings that was home to several of
Saddam's relatives.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in a radio address,
saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face'' but
``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known at the time
of the attack.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.

NATO gives qualified support for airstrikes; other experts question
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to make slug conform to digest &QL; 
the strategy &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq drew
qualified endorsements from most NATO allies and agreement that
Saddam Hussein had only himself to blame. Some European military
analysts, however, questioned the strategy.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said backing for the
airstrikes was ``practically complete'' at a NATO defense ministers
meeting, even though the alliance did not orchestrate the attacks.
	   German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping expressed political
support for the airstrikes and ``regret that it was necessary.''
	   French Defense Minister Alain Richard broke ranks by deploring
the first-wave of U.S. attacks early Thursday and stressing the
``grave human consequences they could have on the Iraqi
population.''
	   But Solana singled out Saddam Hussein, saying, ``He alone is
responsible for the grave situation and for the consequences that
his defiance of the will of the international community has
entailed.''
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and his British
counterpart, George Robertson, skipped the NATO meeting to deal
with the Iraq crisis at home.
	   Independent analysts, meanwhile, questioned how airstrikes could
contribute to the goal of stabilizing the Middle East by ensuring
Iraq no longer threatens its neighbors and bringing it back into
the family of nations.
	   Jonathan Eyal of the Royal United Services Institute in London
said the airstrikes have effectively ended U.N. arms inspections in
Iraq.
	   ``It is impossible now to talk about a return of the U.N. (arms)
monitors,'' he said.
	   ``We are moving to a new strategy, that of containment to keep
Iraq at a very low level of military capability. It'll be a wrecked
country,'' Eyal said.
	   Dik Leurdijk of the Clingendael Institute in The Hague,
Netherlands, wondered about the timing of the airstrikes, a few
days before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
	   If the Americans ``stop on the weekend that would give Saddam
Hussein a reprieve of at least another month,'' Leurdijk said.
	   Paul Beaver of Jane's Information Group in London said the
airstrikes will ``work in a military sense.''
	   Allied airplanes can now ``hit targets now four times more
accurately than during the Gulf War,'' he said. ``The allies have
had seven years to get the targets right,'' but that will not
guarantee that Iraq can be forced into submission.
	   ``It is like the Kentucky Derby. You know the horses. You know
how fast they can go and you still don't win the race.''
	   At the NATO meeting, even France joined in blaming Saddam
Hussein, citing his efforts to frustrate U.N. arms inspectors. But
support for military measures was cool in France, which has tangled
with Washington in the past over that.
	   ``I don't know what the solution is,'' said French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine, adding that France had long lobbied for
``serious and effective checks'' for any Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction from the 1990-91 Gulf War.
	   Russia, which has consistently opposed military action against
Iraq, an old ally, denounced the airstrikes. Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev canceled his trip to meet with his NATO colleagues Friday.

Opposition leader launches campaign against Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Opposition leader Ehud Barak opened his
campaign against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by
stressing social concerns in a country where security issues
usually dominate elections.
	   With U.S. President Bill Clinton's campaign strategist, James
Carville, at his side, Barak said Thursday he was ready for
elections, expected in April.
	   Netanyahu said Wednesday he would call Israelis to the polls
more than a year ahead of schedule if he could not muster enough
support for his hard-line peace policies before a no-confidence
motion Monday in parliament.
	   Netanyahu's coalition has been crumbling since he signed the
latest Mideast peace accord _ which is opposed by most of his
Cabinet because it calls for Israel to cede war-captured West Bank
land.
	   Barak, leader of the Labor Party, which reached historic peace
accords with the Palestinians in 1993, wants the accord implemented
to the letter and has rejected Netanyahu's calls for support.
	   Barak accused Netanyahu of capitulating to his right-wing
coalition and freezing further Israeli troop withdrawals from the
West Bank. ``We are determined to put an end to yielding to
extremists,'' Barak said.
	   Barak promised to divert millions of dollars now being spent by
the Netanyahu government on Jewish settlements and give it instead
to domestic concerns, such as education, health and ending
record-high unemployment.
	   He also pledged to cut government grants to yeshivas, or Jewish
seminaries, and to draft seminary students into military service
like other Israelis.
	   ``Education before settlements, job creation before yeshivas,''
Barak said.
	   Focusing on social issues and the economy worked for Carville in
the 1992 and 1996 Clinton campaigns. In tiny Israel, however,
security has always been the No. 1 campaign issue and candidates
have usually left social issues on the back burner for smaller
parties to champion.
	   Barak, a former commander-in-chief of Israel's armed forces,
also said Netanyahu's policies had harmed the strong strategic ties
between Israel and the United States, its closest ally.
	   Netanyahu's 1996 campaign, characterized by attacks on
then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres as soft on security, was aided by
Arthur Finkelstein, the U.S. political guru who helped elect many
Republicans to office.
	   Barak recently employed Carville, pollster Stanley Greenberg and
media specialist Robert Strom, who helped elect Clinton, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.

25 killed as Baghdad hit by second round of U.S. missile strikes
</HEADLINE>

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ U.S. missiles struck the Iraqi capital Thursday
night in a second round of airstrikes, and officials said at least
25 people were killed. A dozen explosions were heard in Baghdad,
and a pall of smoke hung over the downtown.
	   The attack came as U.S. officials were still assessing damage
from the strike by hundreds of missiles early Thursday.
	   In Washington, officials at the Pentagon, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said cruise missiles were fired deep into Iraq in the
second attack and Navy strike aircraft fired laser-guided bombs
along Iraq's borders.
	   At the government's press office in downtown Baghdad, witnesses
said one missile was seen flying over Thursday night. After the
first explosion was heard at 9:57 p.m. (1857gmt), anti-aircraft
fire came in response and tracer bullets darted into the night sky.
	   The blasts grew increasingly louder as they came nearer the
downtown. One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the
government's Military Industrial Corporation, from where smoke
drifted into the sky.
	   The Military Industrial Corporation, which is in charge of
Iraq's factories, was heavily damaged during the 1991 Gulf War but
has since been rebuilt. It is near the Rashid Hotel, where Iraq
houses visiting dignitaries and reporters.
	   Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak said at least 25 people were
killed and 75 injured from the two rounds of attacks.
	   Iraq's ill-equipped sanctions-hit hospitals will find it hard to
cope with the growing number of casualties, Mubarak told reporters
in a Baghdad hospital damaged by explosions nearby.
	   The sound of the blasts was far louder than the attack Thursday
morning since the missiles struck in the heart of the Iraqi
capital.
	   Unlike the first round of raids when all the missiles were
launched from ships, many in the second round were fired by B-52
bombers. British Tornado jets also took part in the raids Thursday
night.
	   Earlier in the day, sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS
Enterprise in the Gulf loaded thousands of pounds (kilos) of
laser-guided weapons on warplanes in preparation for the second
attack.
	   Despite urging by Russia and China for a halt to the attacks,
U.S. President Bill Clinton had said earlier that the strikes would
continue. U.S. officials have said the strikes would go on for four
days.
	   The full extent of damage and casualties from the hundreds of
missiles fired in the early morning hours Thursday was unclear.
Foreign reporters in Baghdad are based at a press center in the
Information Ministry and cannot move around the sprawling city of 5
million without official escorts.
	   In Washington, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said headquarters of Iraq's special forces and
military intelligence were leveled by sea-launched Tomahawk cruise
missiles.
	   Clinton, meeting in the Oval Office with top military and
foreign policy advisers Thursday morning, expressed regret that
there would inevitably be ``unintended casualties.''
	   The American president said Wednesday he ordered ``Operation
Desert Fox'' to prevent Iraq from building the chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons it was prohibited from having under U.N.
resolutions after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Many in Baghdad went about their normal routines during the day.
Government workers showed up at their offices and children at
schools.
	   Some residents lined up at gas stations to stock up on fuel.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
Salam Mohammed, 34, mumbled from a bed in Baghdad's al-Yarmouk
Hospital bed, his face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   With an air raid siren blaring in the background, Al-Sahhaf told
journalists that the United States and Great Britain lied in
claiming that U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler's report
Tuesday proved Iraq had not cooperated in the search for its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This aggression against Iraq is a crime against international
law, the U.N. charter, and we will hold our full right to hold them
responsible _ the Americans and British _ for all the crimes they
are committing against our people,'' al-Sahhaf told the news
conference.
	   The inspectors have the job of certifying Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step before the U.N.
Security Council will lift damaging trade sanctions imposed on Iraq
for its invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf said inspection teams had carried out visits to 427
sites since the last standoff over weapons inspections in
mid-November and there had been only five instances where they
didn't cooperate.
	   Those instances _ which he said involved misunderstandings or
occurred during the Muslim Sabbath _ did not justify ``a dangerous
crime against the people of Iraq,'' he said.
	   Saddam visited some of the targeted sites Thursday, including
the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad Radio reported. Hala, the
youngest of his three daughters, was safe, but the house was
demolished, it said.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said. The house, built since the
Gulf War, was in a complex of buildings that was home to several of
Saddam's relatives.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in a radio address,
saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face'' but
``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known at the time
of the attack.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.

South Korea claims sinking of North Korean submarine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with additional detail throughout; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL SHIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ After a nearly six-hour pursuit, South
Korean navy ships exchanged fire with and sank a North Korean
submarine off the south coast Friday, military officials said.
	   The body of one North Korean crewman was recovered after the
10-ton sub was sunk 100 kilometers (62 miles) off the tip of the
Korean Peninsula before dawn, the office of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff said.
	   The sub was first spotted as it approached shore near Yosu, a
small port 320 kilometers (200 miles) south of Seoul, shortly
before midnight Thursday, it said.
	   The sub then fled southeast, pursued for nearly six hours by
South Korean navy ships and air force planes, the office said.
	   Hemmed in and illuminated by nearly 100 flares dropped by a
South Korean transport plane, the fleeing sub opened fire at the
pursuing ships and was quickly sunk by return fire, it said.
	   About two hours later, South Korean troops recovered the body of
one crewman. A hand-grenade was found in his pocket, officials
said.
	   There were no South Korean casualties, they said.
	   South Korean officials said the sub, with an estimated four
crewmen, was believed to be on an espionage mission.
	   In Washington, National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley
said at the White House, ``We're aware of the reports. Any attempt
by North Korea to infiltrate agents into South Korea we would
consider a very serious matter.''
	   North Korea routinely uses submarines to drop off or pick up
spies along South Korea's long coastline, officials said. Several
have been detected in recent years.
	   In June, a 70-ton Yugo-class North Korean submarine was found in
South Korean waters off the east coast with its propeller and
periscope tangled in a fishing net.
	   South Koreans later cut through the hatch with welding torches
and found nine bodies, all shot dead in an apparent suicide pact.
Seoul officials said the sub was on a spy mission.
	   The latest incident comes as the United States is trying to
defuse tension over a suspected North Korean nuclear weapons site.
North Korea has rejected a U.S. demand for its inspection.
	   North Korea claims that the facility under construction at
Keumjang-ri north of the country's capital, Pyongyang, is for
civilian use, but U.S. officials suspect it to be nuclear-related.
	   North Korea's military has denounced the U.S. demand for
inspection as ``a declaration of war.''
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They are still technically at war,
because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty.

Dollar lower in Tokyo, stocks mixed in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar slipped Friday against the yen as U.S.
lawmakers moved forward with impeachment debate despite air strikes
on Iraq. Tokyo stocks traded mixed.
	   The dollar bought 116.05 yen in early trading, down 0.05 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of
116.13 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 46.86 points,
or 0.34 percent, to 14,080.13 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Thursday, the average closed up 30.69 points, or 0.22 percent.
	   The House of Representatives decided to resume debate Friday on
the impeachment of President Clinton after delaying it for a day
following attacks on Baghdad by U.S. and British forces.
	   The House will hold a vote on Saturday.
	   Traders also expressed confidence that the cruise missile
strikes against Iraqi government installations would end by the
start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on Saturday.
	   ``Then we have to focus back on the impeachment process,'' said
Jeffrey Yu, chief dealer at Sanwa Bank Ltd. in New York.
	   The dollar had surged Wednesday against the yen on the first
news of the attacks as traders moved assets into the U.S. currency,
which is seen as a safe haven in times international trouble.
	   On the stock market, prices were little changed as investors
judged the air strikes would have no impact on oil prices or
Japanese exports.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section edged up 3.24 points, or 0.30 percent, to 1,092.50.
The TOPIX fell 8.17 points, or 0.75 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.310 percent from Thursday's close of
1.335. The price rose to 104.13 yen from 103.91.

	   At the government's press office in downtown Baghdad, witnesses
said one missile was seen flying over Thursday night. After the

fire came in response and tracer bullets darted into the night sky.

	   There was no word on casualties from the latest attack.
	   But Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak said earlier that at
least 25 people were killed and 75 were injured from the two rounds
of attacks on early Thursday and Thursday night.
	   Iraq's ill-equipped hospitals would find it hard to cope with
the growing number of casualties, Mubarak told reporters in a
Baghdad hospital damaged by massive nearby explosions.
	   On Thursday, at least a dozen explosions were heard over
Baghdad, covering the downtown in a pall of smoke.
	   In Washington, officials at the Pentagon, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said Thursday that cruise missiles were fired deep
into Iraq and Navy strike aircraft fired laser-guided bombs along
Iraq's borders.

	   The sound of the explosions Thursday night was far louder than
the first round of attack since the missiles struck in the heart of
the Iraqi capital.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton had said earlier that the strikes
would continue despite calls by Russia and China for a halt to the
attacks. U.S. officials have said the strikes would go on for four
days.
	   The full extent of damage and casualties from the more than 200
missiles fired in the first round was unclear. Foreign reporters in
Baghdad are based at a press center in the Information Ministry and
cannot move around the sprawling city of 5 million without official
escorts.
	   In Washington, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said headquarters of Iraq's special forces and
military intelligence were leveled by sea-launched Tomahawk cruise
missiles.
	   Pentagon officials said Navy EA-6B attack planes also struck
Iraqi air defense radars in the second wave of attacks.
	   Clinton, meeting in the Oval Office with top military and
foreign policy advisers Thursday morning, expressed regret that
there would inevitably be ``unintended casualties.''
	   In Baghdad Thursday, one sign of an expected second attack was
residents lining up at gas stations to stock up on fuel.
	   But many people went about their normal routines _ government
workers showed up at their offices and children at schools _ and
some gave a show of defiance.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
Salam Mohammed, 34, mumbled from a bed in Baghdad's al-Yarmouk
Hospital bed, his face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Air raid sirens sounded repeatedly in Baghdad Thursday afternoon
and evening.
	   Al-Sahhaf, the foreign minister, accused the United States and
Britain of committing crimes against the Iraqi people.
	   He accused both nations of lying in claiming that the report of
the U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler proved Iraq had not
cooperated in the search for its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This aggression against Iraq is a crime against international
law, the U.N. charter, and we will hold our full right to hold them
responsible _ the Americans and British _ for all the crimes they
are committing against our people,'' al-Sahhaf told the news
conference.
	   As he was speaking, an air-raid siren went off.
	   He said inspection teams had carried out visits to 427 sites
since the last stand-off over weapons inspections in mid-November
and there had been only five cases of non-cooperation.
	   The inspectors have the job of certifying Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step before the U.N.
Security Council will lift damaging trade sanctions imposed on Iraq
for its invasion of Kuwait.

	   Al-Sahhaf said the five sites that caused trouble did not
justify ``a dangerous crime against the people of Iraq.''
	   One proposed visit was to an office of Iraq's ruling Baath
Party, he said. Two others were a problem because they occurred on
Friday, the Muslim day of worship when most people are not working,
al-Sahhaf said.
	   In one case, he said, the inspectors tried to visit a former
office of a security official that had been changed into a guest
house. He said inspectors were delayed for 45 minutes in entering
the building as Iraqi authorities tried to explain the change.
	   ``Do you deserve to be bombarded because you have delayed an
inspection team 45 minutes?'' al-Sahhaf asked.
	   Al-Sahhaf also listed examples of targets struck in the American
attack, including factories and the headquarters of the security
police and military intelligence.
	   He said the two headquarters have been inspected more than once
by U.N. arms experts and many of the factories had U.N. cameras as
part of permanent monitoring of potential weapons sites.
	   The minister said that instead of calling their campaign
Operation Desert Fox, the allies should have named it ``Operation
Villains in the Arabian Desert.''
	   President Saddam Hussein visited some of the targeted sites
Thursday, including the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad Radio
reported. Hala, the youngest of his three daughters, was safe, but
the house was demolished, it said.
	   ``It was targeted and destroyed by the evil enemies in their
latest aggression,'' the radio said. The house, built since the
Gulf War, was in a complex of buildings that was home to several of
Saddam's relatives.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in a radio address,
saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face'' but
``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known at the time
of the attack.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.

Hold your breath and the wheel: Lagos driving tests the fearless
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY309 &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ On the bad days, driving in Lagos is like
maneuvering through a nightmare.
	   Traffic jams can last for hours, longhorn cattle occasionally
wander across freeways, and armies of beggars descend on drivers
trapped in stifling cars. Buying gasoline can require a three-day
wait in line and the air is suffused with the stench of car fumes.
	   But at least it's not like it used to be.
	   ``You must have noticed that it's better on the roads now,''
insists Ambrose Somide at Lagos' Ray Power radio station.
	   Somide directed a team of traffic reporters until skyrocketing
prices for black market gasoline made it too expensive to send them
out. Anyway, he says, the traffic has improved.
	   ``It's fairly OK, compared to a couple of years ago,'' he says.
He ticks off the improvements: repaired roads, less congestion from
government offices moving out of town, more people taking buses
because of gas shortages.
	   Then he changes his mind: ``It's better than it was, but it's
still bad.''
	   Driving in Lagos is a chore and a challenge. In this overcrowded
city of 10 million people, with its battered streets and
fourth-rate policing, the infamous traffic jams _ or ``go-slows''
as Nigerians call them _ are as much a part of life as military
rulers.
	   Go-slows are famous for materializing without warning, lasting
for miles (kilometers) and disappearing abruptly. When they appear,
they create a theater of traffic, right down to a symphonic
accompaniment of blaring horns.
	   First come the peddlers: hordes of teen-age boys stalking
stalled cars and selling everything imaginable. They have cold
beer, toilet brushes, school pads, bread, videotapes, pens, dish
towels, air fresheners, dinosaur shaped breakfast cereal, file
folders, maps, candy.
	   One boy sells desktop electric organs, shuffling in the
suffocating equatorial heat with a battery-powered model programmed
to play ``Jingle Bells'' over and over again.
	   Make eye contact and you'll regret it. Hopeful hawkers will
stand at car windows for minutes on end, silently displaying their
wares, and will even jog alongside as drivers lurch forward.
	   Then the beggars arrive. In a country where the social security
net is tattered beyond repair, begging in Lagos traffic is the only
way to survive for thousands of people. Streets jammed with cars
are also often filled with people who have slipped through
society's cracks; the elderly, orphans, polio victims, the blind.
	   Finally, there are the drivers. Encounter Lagos in rush hour _
particularly on secondary roads on the Lagos mainland, far from the
wealthy enclaves on Ikoyi and Victoria islands with their
relatively genteel streets _ and discover Nigerian drivers at their
white-knuckle worst.
	   Hyper-aggressive motorists combine with crowded streets to
create automotive mayhem. Drivers go off the roads, straddle sewer
ditches and weave through oncoming traffic, all the while twisting
among everyone else doing the same thing. It can take 30 minutes to
go 30 feet (9 meters).
	   Then again, some days there are no problems at all.
	   ``In Lagos, it happens in one minute,'' Somide says. ``You go
through a place and it's fine, and five minutes later there's a
traffic jam.''
	   Somide sounds wistful talking about his halcyon days as a
traffic warrior, when his three reporters drove into the streets
each morning armed with cellular phones.
	   ``It was very effective,'' he insists. That seems hard to
believe, since his crew had no helicopter and simply called in when
they hit a go-slow. Then, of course, they'd be stuck like everyone
else.
	   He also talks wistfully of the bad old days of Lagos traffic,
when drivers sometimes spent entire afternoons trapped in traffic,
and would begin their morning commutes hours before they had to be
at work.
	   But just as Nigeria's military regime is finally giving way to
civilian rule, so Lagos go-slows have mellowed.
	   Gone are the days when assassins took advantage of a traffic jam
to gun down a military ruler, as coup-plotters did in 1976, and
when monstrous potholes _ some 25 feet long (8 meters long) and a
foot (30 centimeters) deep _ were ubiquitous. Where go-slows used
to appear at all hours, now it's just most hours.
	   These days, the traffic is just terrible.
	   That, they insist in Lagos, is an improvement.

for its invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf said inspection teams had carried out visits to 427
sites since the last standoff over weapons inspections in
mid-November and there had been only five instances where they
didn't cooperate.
	   Those instances _ which he said involved misunderstandings or
occurred during the Muslim Sabbath _ did not justify ``a dangerous
crime against the people of Iraq,'' he said.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in a radio address
Thursday, saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face''
but ``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   At least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's biggest
palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known at the time
of the attack.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.

The year that was had its share of odd news
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SCOTT NEUMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ At least some of the facts have always been
stranger than fiction. Just look at the past year: in some of the
weirder moments of 1998, you might have seen a human birth on the
Internet, been witness to a spate of piglet flinging or visited a
weeping statue of Elvis Presley.
	   Surveys were carefully avoided in compiling this unscientific
accounting of the year's bizarre events. What follows is a mere
sampling:
	   ---
	   ALL SHOOK UP _ Suspicious minds might have doubted it, but a
bust of Elvis Presley in the southeastern Dutch town of Deurne
reportedly began ``weeping'' for its fans. The white statuette,
decked out in a fur-trimmed cloak and framed by two pink candles,
loved his fans so tenderly that he wept for them, owner Toon
Nieuwenhuisen said. Nieuwenhuisen, himself an Elvis impersonator,
graciously offered to ``throw open'' his home to pilgrims hoping to
catch a glimpse of the miracle.
	   ---
	   BEST MAN FOR THE JOB _ They elected a man for the job and
nothing short of radical surgery could change that. Residents of
the eastern German village of Quellendorf took a vote to dismiss
their mayor after he announced he was becoming a woman. Norbert
Lindner, 40, was elected to a seven-year term in 1996, but shocked
many of his constituents when he began wearing women's clothes and
calling himself Michaela. Quellendorf residents decided to oust the
mayor, despite his appeal for tolerance. ``I think society as a
whole has some catching up to do,'' he said.
	   ---
	   VIRTUAL BIRTH _ The Orlando, Florida, mother who gained more
than a little exposure for giving birth live on the Internet soon
came to regret her fame. After the blessed event, authorities had
no trouble tracking down Elizabeth Ann Oliver. They charged her
with writing a series of bad checks in 1990. A judge later dropped
the charges, saying the statute of limitations on the crime had run
out.
	   ---
	   CAVEAT EMPTOR _ Hoping to cash in on the latest craze, two
Germans were arrested after selling a man peppermints dyed blue to
look like Viagra, the sexual potency drug. After a tipoff from a
hapless customer, police in Hanover, Germany, searched the
suspects' apartment and confiscated peppermints, blue dye and a
computer _ all apparently used in the counterfeiting crime.
Authorities said they didn't know how many men had been duped.
	   ---
	   GETTING ATTENTION _ In rural Albania, it can be easier to find
heavy artillery than a telephone. So when a quick-thinking villager
needed to summon police to the scene of an accident, he used what
was handy _ his very own antiaircraft gun. Police in Gramsh, south
of Tirana, appreciated the gesture enough not to arrest the man,
but they did take away the weapon.
	   ---
	   ACCIDENTAL TOURISTS _ Blown out to sea by a hurricane, some 15
iguanas braved the open seas between their home of Guadeloupe and
Anguilla in the Caribbean with nothing but a broken tree branch for
a life raft. They were just trying to survive, but their journey
turned out to have scientific import. Researchers said the iguanas'
cruise showed that land animals can migrate between islands through
accidental voyages.
	   ---
	   MEN NEED NOT APPLY _ A tribunal in Melbourne, Australia, granted
an exception to a law that made it illegal to advertise only for
women applicants to work on a phone-sex line. The owner of the
line, Peta King, said he was flooded with male applicants, but
couldn't hire them because there was no demand. ``Why would a woman
need to pay for a fantasy phone call when all she has got to do is
ring up the local army base or fire station?'' King argued before
the tribunal.
	   ---
	   PIG PROTEST _ A politician who tossed live piglets at Taiwan
Governor James Soong's entourage later apologized on national
television ``to all the pigs of the world.'' Hsu I-sheng of the
Democratic Progressive Party and his supporters had grabbed piglets
and tossed them across a parking lot at some of the governor's
staff.
	   ---
	   DRIVING HOME THE POINT _ Bangkok's police chief said reducing
the city's rising crime rate called for officers to give their all
to the job. Among the directives on the get-tough agenda: stop
golfing on duty. Police Gen. Wannarat Katcharak said no one on the
force would be allowed to hit the links unless their beat was crime
free. Policemen caught driving on the course rather than around
town would be transferred, he said.
	   ---
	   RUDE AWAKENING _ A 77-year-old Florida man with a habit of
sleepwalking awoke one night up to his ears in alligators. James
Currens had somnambulated his way into the middle of an
alligator-infested pond behind his home in Palm Harbor. Neighbors
called police after hearing the man's screams as he fended off the
beasts with his cane. Police said Currens suffered only minor cuts
on his arms.
	   ---
	   VIRGIN VOTE _ Hoping to get them to say ``yes ... oh, YES!'' to
their party, the youth wing of Sweden's governing Social Democrats
circulated a get-out-the-vote campaign video featuring a passionate
couple in bed. The couple romps while the voices of young people
talk about their ``first time.'' Then Mona Sahlin, a top party
figure, discusses first-time voting. The video was sent to about
120,000 Swedes who were eligible to vote for the first time.
Reaction was mixed.
	   ---
	   BETTER THAN SEX _ Fiji's health minister said a traditional
drink consumed in the island-nation's eastern Lau group was killing
the local sex drive. Kava, a concoction of mild sedatives made from
the powdered root of a pepper plant, suppresses the libido, causing
a precipitous decline in birth rates. The plant has been used for
generations in ceremonies in parts of the South Pacific, but it has
become more plentiful as Fiji encouraged its cultivation for sales
to overseas pharmaceutical companies.

Baghdad hit again by U.S. strikes as Iraq puts toll at 25

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ Deafening explosions rocked Baghdad Friday in
the latest wave of U.S. and British air raids that Iraq says have
killed at least 25 people in the last two days.
	   After an air-raid siren sounded the warning, the sky was lighted
by anti-aircraft fire only to be blanketed by the loudest
explosions heard so far in the Iraqi capital since the United
States launched cruise missile attacks early Thursday.
	   After that first round, the U.S. military in the Gulf began a
second wave on Thursday night with warships launching 1,000 pound
(450-kilogram) Tomahawk cruise missiles and B-52 bombers firing
from air the 2,000 pound (900 kilogram) variety of the missiles.
	   British Tornado jets also participated in the second wave of
attack, which continued through the night until early Friday.
	   There was no word on casualties from the Friday bombardment,
which began at about 4 a.m. (0100 GMT). Air raid sirens sounded at
4.45 a.m. signalling the end of the strikes.
	   At least three explosions were heard, the result of incoming
missiles or bombs. Loud reports also were created by anti-aircraft
guns firing at the unseen enemy.
	   There was no word on casualties.
	   Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak said earlier that at least
25 people were killed and 75 were injured from the two rounds of
attacks early Thursday and Thursday night when at least a dozen
explosions rocked Baghdad.
	   Iraq's ill-equipped hospitals would find it hard to cope with
the growing number of casualties, Mubarak told reporters in a
Baghdad hospital damaged by massive nearby explosions.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said there have been no
American casualties.
	   Navy strike aircraft from the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise
pummeled Iraqi air defenses along the border with laser-guided
bombs, a senior defense official said in Washington. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   At the government's press office in downtown Baghdad, witnesses
said one missile was seen flying over Thursday night.
	   The blasts grew increasingly louder as they came nearer the
downtown. One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the
government's Military Industrial Corporation, from where smoke
drifted into the sky.
	   The Corporation is in charge of Iraq's factories.
	   The United States says ``Operation Desert Fox'' was launched to
prevent Iraq from building the chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons it was prohibited from having under U.N. resolutions after
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sound of the explosions Thursday night was far louder than
the first round of attack since the missiles struck in the heart of
the Iraqi capital.
	   The full extent of damage and casualties from the more than 200
missiles fired in the first round was unclear. Foreign reporters in
Baghdad are based at a press center in the Information Ministry and
cannot move around the sprawling city of 5 million without official
escorts.
	   In Washington, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said headquarters of Iraq's special forces and
military intelligence were leveled by sea-launched Tomahawk cruise
missiles.
	   In Baghdad Thursday, many people went about their normal
routines _ government workers showed up at their offices and
children at schools _ and some gave a show of defiance.
	   ``Where is this Clinton? I wish I could get my hands on him,''
Salam Mohammed, 34, mumbled from a bed in Baghdad's al-Yarmouk
Hospital bed, his face bandaged and his body trembling.
	   Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf accused the
United States and Britain of lying in claiming that the report of
the U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler proved Iraq had not
cooperated in the search for its weapons of mass destruction.
	   He said inspection teams had carried out visits to 427 sites
since the last stand-off over weapons inspections in mid-November
and there had been only five cases of non-cooperation.
	   The inspectors have the job of certifying Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step before the U.N.
Security Council will lift damaging trade sanctions imposed on Iraq
for its invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf said the five sites that set off the crisis did not
justify the strikes.
	   One proposed visit was to an office of Iraq's ruling Baath
Party, he said. Two others were a problem because they occurred on
Friday, the Muslim day of worship when most people are not working,
al-Sahhaf said.
	   In one case, he said, the inspectors tried to visit a former
office of a security official that had been changed into a guest
house. He said inspectors were delayed for 45 minutes in entering
the building as Iraqi authorities tried to explain the change.
	   President Saddam Hussein visited some of the targeted sites
Thursday, including the house of his daughter Hala, Baghdad Radio
reported. Hala, the youngest of his three daughters, was safe, but
the house was demolished, it said.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in a radio address,
saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face'' but
``depending on a long technological arm.''
	   On Thursday, at least one missile fell in an area near Saddam's
biggest palace in Baghdad, but his whereabouts were not known at
the time of the attack.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.

Chief inspector defends report on Iraq and says he won't quit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with quote from Russian ambassador
on draft statement, Security Council to meet again on Iraq at 10:30
a.m. EST (1530 GMT) on Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Facing sharp criticism from Russia and
China, chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler defended his
report that Iraq did not fully cooperate with U.N. monitors and
said he had absolutely no intention of quitting.
	   ``I want to say simply, slowly and plainly that any suggestion
that that report was not factual, was not objective, is utterly
false,'' he said Thursday.
	   Butler also dismissed as ``utterly wrong'' any suggestion that
the report's release Tuesday night was timed to suit the U.S.
government and help President Bill Clinton deflect attention from
impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives.
	   On Nov. 24, Butler promised to deliver the report in two or
three weeks and he said he told the Russians, the French and other
ambassadors that his target date was Dec. 14 or 15. It was handed
to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Dec. 15.
	   ``It danced to no one's tune,'' he told reporters. ``It was not
written for anyone's purposes including, as some of you have
suggested, for the purposes of the United States.''
	   Speaking hours after Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said
Moscow would insist on his dismissal, Butler was asked if he would
quit. ``Absolutely not,'' he shot back.
	   During a divisive U.N. Security Council meeting Wednesday night,
China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasun said Butler had played ``a
dishonorable role in this crisis'' and called the report
``unfounded and evasive of the facts.''
	   Russia's U.N. envoy, Sergey Lavrov, who called the formal
council meeting, said the report's conclusion was biased and echoed
Iraq's contention that Butler cited only five incidents in 300
inspection operations.
	   Russia, China, Iraq and Kenya called for a cease-fire at
Wednesday night's council meeting but no action was taken because
of divisions among the 15 members.
	   Russia called another round of council consultations on Thursday
and circulated a draft presidential statement calling for an
immediate cessation of hostilities, expressing regret that force
was used against Iraq and calling for the early resumption of
cooperation between the inspectors and Baghdad.
	   Presidential statements are not legally binding but must be
adopted by consensus, and given the divisions on the council the
Russian draft has virtually no chance of being approved.
	   Lavrov said the statement was ``an attempt to start the
discussion in the council on how we can bring the situation back
into political and diplomatic efforts. We will continue to discuss
in the next few days.''
	   The council scheduled another meeting on Iraq for Friday
morning.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which Butler
heads, is charged with verifying the destruction of Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction. Over the past month inspectors tested the
promise Iraq made on Nov. 14, under threat of U.S. and British
airstrikes, to resume full cooperation with UNSCOM.
	   Butler's report, which triggered U.S. and British airstrikes
Wednesday, concluded that Iraq had not cooperated fully and had
placed new obstacles on the inspectors' work.
	   ``Iraq's conduct ensured that no progress was able to be made in
either the fields of disarmament or accounting for its prohibited
weapons programs,'' it said.
	   Defending the report Thursday, Butler said he consulted with
inspectors in the field ``and there is no doubt in my mind'' that
the conclusion is correct: Iraq did not keep its promise of full
cooperation ``whether we're talking about inspections or documents
or interviews.''
	   ``We did some work but it was not what we are expected to do,''
he said.
	   Butler said he expects the Security Council sometime in the days
and weeks ahead to once again tell Iraq it is legally obligated to
cooperate with UNSCOM and it should ``tell us the truth and let us
verify it honestly.''
	   ``We would go back and start our work tomorrow if they would
give us genuine cooperation,'' he said.
	   Butler was asked why UNSCOM's conclusions were in sharp contrast
to the report of the International Atomic Energy Agency which
concluded that Baghdad had cooperated with nuclear inspectors.
	   He said the IAEA's job was different because it was dealing with
a nuclear weapons program ``that was in the making'' _ which is
vastly different from UNSCOM's work with already completed
missiles, chemical and biological weapons.
	   Butler withdrew his inspectors hours after delivering his report
for security reason. The head of the U.N. humanitarian program in
Iraq, Benon Sevan, said Thursday he had decided to maintain 134 of
his staffers in Baghdad because that's where they are needed.
	   ``We are there for humanitarian reasons,'' Sevan said after
briefing the council on the situation on the ground in Iraq. ``We
are doing our work irrespective of the situation.''

Politician's murder shatters Mongolia's democratic peace

	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) _ From police sketches, the suspects
in the murder of the young government minister don't have the look
of menace. The woman has a straggly bob-cut. Her male accomplice
stands a half-head shorter, his hair swept boyishly across his
forehead.
	   But they struck down Sanjaasuren Zorig with brutal
effectiveness. The 36-year-old politician died of multiple knife
wounds, including a stab to the heart that his sister says bore the
hallmarks of a professional hit.
	   For Mongolia, the unsolved October killing has shattered the
peace of a nine-year transition from authoritarian communism to one
of Asia's most vibrant free-market democracies. The murder also
left questions: Was it a bungled robbery or something more
sinister?
	   With police keeping quiet about their investigation, speculation
has flourished. Some people speak darkly of a political plot.
Others wonder whether the killing was tied to Zorig's refusal to
accept bribes as minister of infrastructure in charge of awarding
lucrative contracts.
	   Whatever the reason, the killing dealt a blow to a political and
economic makeover that had been remarkable for its tranquility.
	   ``The murder of Zorig was a big black spot for the name and face
of democracy in Mongolia,'' said Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, a leading
democratic politician who was acting prime minister at the time of
the killing.
	   Erdeniin Bat Uul, a legislator who like Zorig was a leader in
the democracy movement, said that until Zorig's death, ``not one
person's nose was bloodied and not one window was broken. Around
the world, Mongolian democracy was valued as a peaceful, nonviolent
transition. We were proud of that.''
	   The winds of change that eventually led to the breakup of the
Soviet Union swept across Mongolia's rolling steppes, vast deserts
and snowcapped peaks in 1989. Peaceful rallies calling for reform
erupted on the streets of Ulan Bator, the capital. Zorig, a skinny,
young, bespectacled university lecturer, was a key leader.
	   Unlike the leadership in neighboring China, which in mid-1989
crushed the Tiananmen Square democracy movement, Mongolia's
communists bowed to the snowballing demonstrations and hunger
strikes by agreeing to the country's first multiparty elections.
	   Total victory for democracy proponents did not come until 1996,
however, when a coalition of democratic parties finally ousted
Mongolia's formerly communist ruling party with a landslide
election victory.
	   Since that surprise win, the difficulties of reform and the
burdens of power have taken their toll. An opposition boycott of
parliament over the privatization of a state bank forced Elbegdorj
and his Cabinet to resign in July, although they continued in a
caretaker role as wrangling delayed efforts to find replacements
for five months.
	   Infighting between the democrats over government posts and a
stalemate between their coalition and Mongolia's president, an
ex-communist, kept them from finding a compromise candidate until
Dec. 9. The new prime minister, Ulan Bator's well-liked but
politically weak mayor, Janlaviin Narantsatsralt, will now have to
forge unity in the fractured coalition.
	   Important reforms and economic legislation have languished
because of the political impasse. President Natsagiin Bagabandi
said the crisis has held up badly needed foreign investment and
loans and caused Mongolia's foreign partners to lose confidence.
	   With the backdrop of political infighting, rumors that Zorig was
about to be nominated as prime minister before his slaying have
fueled speculation the killing was politically motivated.
	   Zorig's killers made off from his home with three rings, five
silver cups, gold earrings and some cash, according to police
posters that offer a reward for information. But few people believe
the killing was a robbery gone wrong.
	   In the two months before his murder, Zorig's mother received
anonymous telephone threats from people who warned that she and her
son should leave the country, his sister, Sanjaasuren Oyun, said in
an interview. ``We didn't take them very seriously.''
	   She believes her brother's murder is linked to extremists or
people frustrated by the changes that have swept Mongolia. ``Either
it's one or two people who are prepared to do anything or it's a
bigger force,'' she said.
	   Before the killers left, they told Zorig's wife that Bat Uul,
the pro-democracy legislator, would be next to die, both Bat Uul
and Zorig's sister said.
	   Despite the morale blow of the killing, Zorig's death has not
destabilized Mongolia.
	   When news of the murder leaked out, thousands of people _ from
old monks in burgundy robes to young trendies in loafers and jeans
_ converged on the wide expanse of Sukhbaatar Square in the center
of Ulan Bator in a show of respect not just for Zorig but also for
Mongolia's democratic path.
	   The crowds spelled out Zorig's name and a Buddhist prayer using
thousands of candles. A month later, myriad clumps of wax were
still stuck to the plaza's snowswept pavement like frozen
teardrops.
	   ``I was afraid the totalitarian system could come back,'' said
Batmunkh, a 70-year-old, ruddy-cheeked monk who under communism had
to study Buddhist scriptures in secret for fear of arrest. ``I was
concerned for the future of the other young men. I love these other
young men who are building the future of the country.''

	   The transition to a market economy has not been without pain.
Privatization and closure of state factories produced widespread
unemployment. Poverty has increased, too, with 25 percent to 33
percent of the country's 2.4 million people living below the
poverty line.
	   But perhaps one reason why Zorig's death was not followed by
unrest is that the market economy is also starting to produce
tangible benefits, at least for some.
	   New bars and restaurants, offering everything from sushi to
pizza, are springing up across Ulan Bator. Private companies are
creating new jobs. Inflation is down from more than 300 percent in
the early 1990s to below 13 percent. Despite drops in world prices
for cashmere, copper and gold, all major Mongolian exports, the
economy is projected to grow again this year.
	   ``People are indeed making money. There is prosperity around
here. There are buildings going up; there's new businesses
opening,'' the U.S. ambassador to Mongolia, Alphonse F. La Porta,
said in an interview. ``People are not feeling economically
disadvantaged enough to turn out.''

Report: Thai police double security near Iraqi, U.S. embassies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police have doubled security
watches around the United States and Iraqi embassies in the wake of
the U.S. and British bombing of Iraq, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The beefed up security is a precautionary measure and not in
response to any intelligence reports of imminent terrorist attacks,
said Gen. Sawak Wattanakit of the police special branch, according
to The Nation.
	   Security has also been increased near the British, Canadian,
Iranian, Israeli, Saudi Arabian, Kuwaiti and Japanese embassies and
in areas housing international organizations, he said, according to
the report.
	   The U.S. embassy in Bangkok is one of the largest American
embassies in the world.

Berisha announces he will defy summons, refuse to submit to
</HEADLINE>
interrogation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Former President Sali Berisha says he
will refuse an order to appear at the state prosecutor's office to
answer allegations that he organized riots three months ago which
threatened to topple the government.
	   Berisha, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, was ordered
to report for interrogation Friday morning. In a statement late
Thursday, however, the 53-year-old Berisha said he would not appear
before a ``political prosecutor'' and would instead respond to the
charges ``in public.''
	   He would send his lawyers instead. Under Albanian law, Berisha
can refuse two summons before facing automatic arrest. His
Democratic Party has denounced charges against him as a ``wild
vendetta'' by the former Communists who control the government.
	   Allegations against Berisha stem from two days of rioting in the
Albanian capital Tirana last September which erupted after the
still-unsolved assassination of a leader of Berisha's party, Azem
Hajdari.
	   Berisha accused then-Prime Minister Fatos Nano of ordering the
killing. A series of protests exploded into violence in which at
least three people were killed and dozens injured.
	   Rioters briefly seized the headquarters of state television and
other government installations.
	   Following the riots, Albania's parliament, controlled by Nano's
Socialist party, stripped Berisha of his parliamentary immunity,
paving the way for criminal charges. Nano later resigned as prime
minister.
	   International diplomats and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe have been trying to mediate between the
Democrats and the Socialists.

African states regret military strikes in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Members states of the
Organization of African Unity said Friday they regretted the use of
military force against Iraq and hoped for a peaceful solution to
the conflict.
	   ``The Organization of African Unity regrets that at the
international level there was no means to transcend the crisis
between one individual state and the world community,'' said Blaise
Compaore, the president of Burkina Faso and the current chairman of
the OAU.
	   The comments came in response to the military airstrikes by
American and British forces against Iraq.
	   Heads of states and other delegates from member states of the
pan-African body issued the statement on Iraq at the conclusion of
a summit meeting on conflict resolution in Africa.
	   The meeting concluded early Friday morning, one day before the
scheduled end of the summit.

Mongolian entrepreneurs learn the ropes of the market economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: The names Bayasgalan and Jargalsaikhan are correct; many
Mongolians use just one name. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-FEA-Blow to Mongolia &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL KOHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) _ Under communism, Bayasgalan studied
fungus. Under capitalism, she's used her scientific knowledge to
build her own organic vegetable business.
	   The 35-year-old is in the vanguard of a budding army of
Mongolian entrepreneurs cashing in on the impoverished landlocked
country's nine-year transformation from the world's second oldest
communist state to a free-market democracy.
	   Private enterprise is adding new life and color to Ulan Bator,
the capital. New restaurants, bars and shops are opening. Food
markets that offered only the odd potato or turnip less than three
years ago now spill over with green vegetables.
	   ``We own our own property, we make our own decisions, and the
money we earn is our own. It is much better than before,'' said
Bayasgalan, who like many Mongolians uses only one name.
	   A microbiologist by training, she studied fungus for eight years
at the National Academy of Sciences. Fed up with irregularly paid
wages, she gave up state-sponsored research in 1990 _ the year
Mongolia began embracing the free market and democracy _ to farm
her family's vegetable plot on the outskirts of Ulan Bator with her
father.
	   Bayasgalan now employs three young laborers to help produce
organically grown broccoli, rhubarb, onions, lettuce, tomatoes,
cucumbers, spinach, turnips, cauliflower and five kinds of cabbage.
	   Small entrepreneurs are helping fill the economic vacuum created
when the Soviet Union ended aid in 1990. Many state-run factories
were forced to close and unemployment rose sharply.
	   The private sector is now bringing the jobless figure down. By
the end of last year, nearly 430,000 people were employed by small
private businesses, some 60,000 more than at the end of 1995, the
U.S. Embassy says.
	   One of those employers is Jargalsaikhan, a former cashmere
factory worker and black marketeer who started his own cashmere
business.
	   ``People didn't understand what it was like to have money,'' he
said, recalling his days under communism selling Levis jeans,
perfumes and records on the black market. ``They would arrest me,
and confiscate the money, but I usually got it back.''
	   Jargalsaikhan claims to be one of Mongolia's first millionaires.
His Buyan Cashmere company, started in 1989 with six employees, is
now one of the country's wealthiest private enterprises, with 900
workers.

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ The New York Islanders ended a long
contract battle with Zigmund Palffy by signing their top scorer to
a five-year contract on Thursday night.
	   Islanders coach Mike Milbury, with his team in Los Angeles to
face the Kings on Thursday night, confirmed the deal which was
reportedly worth dlrs 25 million.
	   Palffy, who was a restricted Group Two free agent, has been in
Slovakia all season long waiting for a new contract. Milbury
confirmed that he was en route to the United States.
	   The Islanders (11-18-0), are 3-7 in their past 10 games and have
only 70 goals this season.
	   Palffy tied for fifth in the National Hockey League in scoring
last season, when he scored 45 goals and added 42 assists in 82
games. His 13-game scoring streak last season was the NHL's
longest.
	   The native of Skalica, Slovakia, had his best season in 1996-97
when he scored 48 goals and added 42 assists in 80 games. In 281
career games, he has 146 goals and 135 assists.

India refuses to make up for lost time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ India defended its decision not to
use floodlights and make up for lost time as the first day of the
first cricket test was abandoned without a ball being bowled
Friday.
	   The two umpires, Steve Dunne and West Indian Eddie Nicholls,
called off the day's play midway through the scheduled second
session after the pitch remained covered all day.
	   The Indians also turned down a New Zealand request to reschedule
the test in the event of washout on the first day.
	   The Carisbrook lights will not be turned on nor will an hour be
added to the subsequent days because under the laws of test cricket
both nations must agree to the use of lights before the series.
	   The rule is in a two-year experimental stage.
	   Indian coach and former test cricketer Aunshuman Gaekwad said
because ground lights are a relatively new addition to the Indian
scene the tourists have not played much under those conditions,
particularly against the red ball.
	   ``The red ball gets dirty much faster and it is not practical,''
Gaekwad said. ``We are happy playing under natural light than
artificial light. It is alright if it was a white ball.''
	   Australia was the first country to use lights against New
Zealand in Perth in 1997.
	   Subsequently it was used between Australia and South Africa in
Sydney and later in the series between South Africa and Pakistan in
South Africa earlier this year.
	   New Zealand players have not had much practice with a red ball
under lights either but they wanted it.
	   ``It is not practical continuing with a game for the sake of it.
It won't be like a real game if the players are not happy,''
Gaekwad added.
	   ``If it becomes an ICC (International Cricket Council) rule we
will have to look into it, probably play some of our domestic games
under lights.''
	   Gaekwad said adding an hour to a day's play was too much
especially when three tests are played in the space of 19 days.
	   Match referee Barry Jarmon said it was disappointing that the
Indians have turned down to make up the lost time. ``This is the
second time they have done it. I am disappointed with the
reaction,'' Jarmon, a former Australian test wicketkeeper said.
	   India refused to play in South Africa early this year under
similar conditions.
	   ``We have a psychological edge over them now,'' Steve Rixon, the
New Zealand coach said. ``They have gone on the defensive.''
	   Indian opener Ajey Jadeja, who sprained his right ankle while
training, has been ruled out of the test. His place will be taken
by Venkat Laxman, who has appeared in 10 tests.

Dollar edges higher in Tokyo, stocks rise

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with midday trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar edged higher against the yen Friday
morning on some buying by institutional investors ahead of the
weekend, while Tokyo stock prices rose in thin trading.
	   The dollar bought 116.31 yen in late morning, up 0.21 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
116.13 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 64.07
points, or 0.45 percent, to 14,191.06 points at the end of the
morning session. On Thursday, the average closed up 30.69 points,
or 0.22 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar moved higher in thin trading as
some investors covered their short, or oversold, dollar positions
ahead of the weekend, dealers said.
	   Traders are watching a U.S. congressional move over President
Clinton's possible impeachment.
	   The House of Representatives decided to resume debate Friday on
the impeachment of President Clinton after delaying it for a day
following attacks on Baghdad by U.S. and British forces. The House
will hold a vote on Saturday.
	   Traders also expressed confidence that the cruise missile
strikes against Iraqi military installations would end by the start
of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on Saturday.
	   ``Then we have to focus back on the impeachment process,'' said
Jeffrey Yu, chief dealer at Sanwa Bank Ltd. in New York.
	   The dollar had surged Wednesday against the yen on the first
news of the attacks as traders moved assets into the U.S. currency,
which is seen as a safe haven in times international trouble.
	   On the stock market, share prices were slightly lower earlier in
the session but moved into positive territory later.
	   Traders said local newspaper reports that Haseko Corp., a major
condominium builder, has decided to ask its creditor banks to
forgive debts owed by the company helped buoy market sentiment.
	   Many Japanese general contractors are reportedly burdened with
bad debts, a leftover following the collapse of the nation's
easy-credit ``bubble'' economy of the late 1980s.
	   ``Investors are relieved as they have worried about Haseko's
financial health,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the
stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   Many investors judged the air strikes by U.S. and British forces
against Iraq would have no impact on oil prices or Japanese
exports.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 8.86 points, or 0.81 percent, to 1,101.12. The
TOPIX fell 8.17 points, or 0.75 percent, the day before.
	   Also supporting the Tokyo stock market was an 85.22-point gain
in the Dow Jones industrial average at 8,875.82 points at
Thursday's close, traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.315 percent from Thursday's close of 1.335 percent,
driving its price up to 104.09 yen from 103.91 yen.

South Korea claims sinking of North Korean submarine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with detail
 &UR; By PAUL SHIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ After a nearly six-hour pursuit, South
Korean navy ships sank a North Korean submarine Friday in a gun
battle off the south coast, military officials said.
	   The body of one North Korean crewman was recovered after the
10-ton sub was sunk 100 kilometers (62 miles) off the tip of the
Korean Peninsula before dawn, the office of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff said.
	   The sub was first spotted as it approached shore near Yosu, a
small port 320 kilometers (200 miles) south of Seoul, shortly
before midnight Thursday, it said.
	   The sub then fled southeast, pursued for 5 hours, 40 minutes by
South Korean navy ships and air force planes, the office said. The
planes dropped depth charges to block its escape, the office said.
	   Hemmed in and illuminated by nearly 100 flares dropped by a
South Korean transport plane, the fleeing sub opened fire at the
pursuing ships and was quickly sunk by return fire, it said.
	   ``We fired several warning shots, but the enemy craft continued
to flee and fired at us. Therefore, we attacked and sank it,'' said
Col. Hwang Dong-kyu, a Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman.
	   About two hours later, South Korean troops recovered the body of
the crewman. A hand-grenade was found in his pocket, officials
said. Navy frogmen were searching for more bodies.
	   There were no South Korean casualties, they said.
	   On shore, South Korean soldiers and police were put on high
alert, increasing security checks for possible infiltrators from
the sub, officials said.
	   South Korean officials said the sub, with an estimated four
crewmen, was believed to be on an espionage mission.
	   Chief presidential spokesman Park Jie-won praised the swift
military action and urged North Korea to stop armed provocations to
promote peace on the peninsula.
	   In Washington, U.S. National Security Council spokesman P.J.
Crowley called the sub's intrusion a ``very serious matter.''
	   North Korea routinely uses submarines to drop off or pick up
spies along South Korea's long coastline, officials said. Several
have been detected in recent years.
	   In June, a 70-ton Yugo-class North Korean submarine was found in
South Korean waters off the east coast with its propeller and
periscope tangled in a fishing net.
	   South Koreans later cut through the hatch with welding torches
and found nine bodies, all shot dead in an apparent suicide pact.
Seoul officials said the sub was on a spy mission.
	   The latest incident comes as the United States is trying to
defuse tension over a suspected North Korean nuclear weapons site.
North Korea has rejected a U.S. demand for its inspection.
	   North Korea claims that the facility under construction at
Keumjang-ri north of the country's capital, Pyongyang, is for
civilian use, but U.S. officials suspect it to be nuclear-related.
	   North Korea's military has denounced the U.S. demand for
inspection as ``a declaration of war.''
	   About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a
mutual defense treaty.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They are still technically at war,
because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty.

Islanders sign Palffy to five-year deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from Palffy, Milbury, more detail &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ The New York Islanders ended a long
and sometimes acrimonious contract battle with Zigmund Palffy by
signing their top scorer to a five-year contract on Thursday night.
	   Islanders coach Mike Milbury, with his team in Los Angeles to
face the Kings, confirmed the deal which was reportedly worth dlrs
25 million.
	   ``I think everybody's pleased that it's over,'' Milbury said.
``I wasn't sure that it would come to a conclusion, and this was
it. This was the last attempt to bridge the gap. Basically what we
did was go back to the long-term deal and revisited that to see if
they were more interested. And, in fact, they were.''
	   Speaking for the players, Islanders captain Trevor Linden said:
	   ``The guys in the room are excited and happy to have him back,
and certainly the fans are going to be happy. He had 20 percent of
the offense last year, and it isn't just his goal-scoring. His
playmaking ability is exceptional. So it adds another dimension (to
a team that lost seven of eight coming into the Kings game).''
	   Palffy, who was a restricted Group Two free agent, has been in
Slovakia all season long waiting for a new contract. Milbury
confirmed that he was en route to the United States.
	   ``I'm very happy to come to a conclusion,'' Palffy said in a
news release. ``In my heart I always wanted to be a New York
Islander. And I want to thank New York Islander fans. I cannot wait
to get back on the ice and play in front of them.''
	   The Islanders (11-18-0), are 3-7 in their past 10 games and have
only 70 goals this season.
	   Palffy tied for fifth in the National Hockey League in scoring
last season, when he scored 45 goals and added 42 assists in 82
games. His 13-game scoring streak last season was the NHL's
longest.
	   The native of Skalica, Slovakia, had his best season in 1996-97
with 48 goals and 42 assists in 80 games. In 281 career games, he
has 146 goals and 135 assists.
	   Last season, the 26-year-old Palffy became only the fourth
player in franchise history to score 40 or more goals in three
consecutive seasons. He is also one of only five NHL players to
score 40 goals in each of the last three seasons. Palffy led the
NHL in power-play goals last season with 17.

Thugs end Thai environmentalists' protest against Hollywood film
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thugs under the leadership of a Thai
government official intimidated environmentalists into ending a
protest against the filming of a Hollywood movie starring Leonardo
DiCaprio, local papers reported on Friday.
	   The dozen or so activists had been staging a sit in for two
weeks on Phi Phi Island's Maya Beach, a national park conservation
area, where they say producers of the film, ``The Beach'' have
ripped out natural vegetation and were set to begin planting 92
coconut trees on Friday.
	   The activists, some island residents, hotel owners and prominent
lawyers have argued that altering the conservation area violates
national laws, and will further erode the beach and fragile coral
reefs.
	   They have been powerless, however, to stop local businessmen,
government officials and the chief of the Royal Forestry Department
who have thrown their weight behind the project.
	   Supporters of the filming say the enhancement of Thailand's
image and the increased business and tourists dollars a Hollywood
film will generate outweigh what they call minimal environmental
disruption.
	   The environmental protesters were surrounded on Thursday by 70
policemen and a mob of local residents who support the film led by
the deputy governor of Krabi province.
	   They were then forced to negotiate with Damrong Kittihorakul,
head of the Provincial Administration Organization, The Nation
newspaper reported.
	   Damrong is also known as Kamnan Daeng, or Headman Red. The
leaders of the film's supporters were described by the activists as
``influential people,'' a code phrase in Thailand for businessmen
or government officials who have dual identities as crime bosses.
	   The Nation reported that the film's backers threatened the
protesters and also journalists whom they kept away from the scene
of the confrontation.
	   Activists said the film's supporters did not listen to any of
their arguments, and the threat of violence forced them to vacate
the beach.
	   Andrew MacDonald, the film's producer, said he was undeterred by
the delay and would have all the coconut trees planted in a few
days, according to The Nation.

Banks allege Finance Ministry lied to them, report says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Several Japanese banks may sue the Ministry of
Finance for allegedly hiding the size of bad loans at Nippon Credit
Bank Ltd. when it asked them last year to help bail out the failed
lender, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The banks, which the report by the Mainichi newspaper didn't
name, are among 34 finance companies that loaned Nippon Credit 210
billion yen (dlrs 1.8 billion) last year in a ministry-orchestrated
rescue effort.
	   A ministry spokeswoman refused to comment on the report.
	   Despite the loans, the government on Saturday proclaimed Nippon
Credit to be insolvent with 3.7 trillion yen (dlrs 32 billion) in
debt. It will nationalize the bank, leaving the companies little
hope of recovering their money.
	   The banks considering filing suit allege ministry officials told
them in April 1997 that Nippon Credit's bad loans totaled 476
billion yen (dlrs 4.1 billion) but then failed to inform them a
month later when the bank reported to the ministry that the actual
sum was more than 700 billion yen (dlrs 6 billion), the report
said.
	   As has been the case in all three failures by large banks over
the last year, the actual size of bad loans turned out to be far
larger than what either the ministry or the banks had said.
	   According to the Mainichi, the banks said the ministry told them
the bad-loans figure wouldn't be revised and promised them Nippon
Credit would be back on its feet within five years.
	   The banks said they would never have made the loans if they'd
known the true extent of Nippon Credit's problems, the report said.

Stern sends written appeal to players
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to update with response from Hunter &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Commissioner David Stern took his case directly
to National Basketball Association players on Thursday, mailing
each of them a nine-page letter outlining the owners' latest
collective bargaining proposal.
	   The letter, complete with charts and graphs, was sent by
overnight mail as the opposing sides were deep into another lull in
talks. No new negotiations are expected until after Christmas.
	   ``I urge you to focus on the extent of the compromises the
owners have made from their initial bargaining demands,'' Stern
wrote. ``The proposals now on the table represent the following
significant concessions that were made in direct response to your
union's forceful assertion of your concerns'':
	   _ No hard salary cap.
	   _ The retention of the Larry Bird exception, which allows clubs
to disregard the salary cap to re-sign their own free agents.
	   _ No immediate changes to free agency timing rules.
	   _ A limit to the escrow tax that would be collected from
players' paychecks.
	   ``We view this as a desperation tactic by the NBA,'' union
director Billy Hunter said in a statement. ``They had counted on
the passage of time to weaken the players, and it has become
obvious that strategy has failed. The fact is, we have kept the
players fully apprised of the league's offer.''
	   The union sent its players a 19-page response, and Hunter moved
forward with his newfound eagerness to take his case to the public.
After holding his longest and most detailed conference call of the
5{-month-old lockout a day earlier, Hunter visited an all-sports
radio station in New York and spent 90 minutes on the air before
going on a nationwide cable television sports talk show.
	   After previously insisting that there undoubtedly will be a
season, Hunter changed his tune somewhat.
	   ``At this stage I'm not so sure,'' he said. ``I can't say I'm
convinced there will be a season. I think the owners have already
decided if they have to sacrifice this year in exchange for their
long-term gain, they're prepared to do it. But if they are ready to
make a deal and are prepared to compromise, we can make a deal
tomorrow.''
	   The sides are fighting over how to split dlrs 2 billion in
annual revenues.
	   Several major issues remain unresolved, with the main points of
contention being what percentage of revenues will be devoted to
salaries, whether the union will accept an absolute limit on what
players with more than seven years' experience can be paid, and
whether the owners will accept additional salary cap exceptions
that would increase the number of players in the league's so-called
``middle class.''
	   Stern's letter, which also was released to the media, included a
12-point summary of the principal economic terms of a new
agreement.
	   Details included overall salary growth, maximum and minimum
salaries, cap exceptions, maximum annual raises, changes to the
rookie scale and the group licensing agreement, and the length of
the new deal.
	   Some of the owners' changes to their previous proposals had not
previously been disclosed. Among them:
	   _ An increase in the maximum allowable raise, from 10 percent on
Bird contracts and 5 percent on other contracts, to 12.5 percent on
Bird contracts and 7.5 percent on others.
	   _ Allowing a maximum contract length of seven years for Bird
players, up from six years, and six years for other contracts, up
from five.
	   _ Allowing a team to use the new ``middle class exception'' to
re-sign its own free agent, instead of limiting it to another
team's free agent.
	   McIlvaine said the letter was suspiciously vague in mentioning
changes ``in certain other salary cap rules'' without detailing
them. He also pointed out that salaries are guaranteed to rise 5
percent annually after growing 16 percent annually in previous
years.
	   A union attorney also noted that the owners' offer would
decrease salaries for second-year players from the approximately
dlrs 315,000 they would have received under the old agreement to
dlrs 250,000.

World Bank delays dlrs 1 billion loan to Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The World Bank has delayed a dlrs 1
billion loan to Indonesia amid unexpected improvements in its sick
economy as well as fears of government corruption, a newspaper
reported Friday.
	   The loan had been set for disbursement this fiscal year to help
plug the budget deficit in Indonesia, which is enduring its worst
economic turmoil in decades. Millions of people have lost their
jobs and inflation has soared to 80 percent.
	   Improvements in the country's economy and currency reduced the
1998-99 budget deficit to around 6 percent of gross domestic
product, said Dennis de Tray, the World Bank's director for
Indonesia.
	   International aid groups had earlier predicted a deficit of 8.5
percent.
	   Interest rates have fallen and the rupiah has made a partial
recovery in recent weeks, although a full economic recovery is
expected to take years.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted de Tray as saying the disbursement of
the loan would depend on the government's progress in implementing
reforms and preventing the misuse of funds.
	   The funds are expected to be disbursed after next year's general
elections, which are scheduled in June. Some aid officials fear
loans could be used for political purposes in the runup to the
vote.
	   The World Bank pledged dlrs 3.5 billion to the dlrs 43 billion
bailout package for Indonesia led by the International Monetary
Fund. It agreed to provide an additional dlrs 1 billion in July to
help fill the budget gap.
	   Discontent over Indonesia's economic crisis helped force
authoritarian President Suharto from office after 32 years in
power. Students who demonstrated against Suharto have staged
sometimes violent protests against his successor, President B.J.
Habibie.
	   The new president has implemented some political reforms, but
students complain he is not moving fast enough on democratic
change.

Asians ready to breach last sports barriers and challenge the West
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENIS D. GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ When it comes to their sports race with
the West, Asians hope they're in the track shoes of Koji Ito.
	   Running a 100-meter heat at the Asian Games, the Japanese
sprinter fell just one hundredth of a second short of breaking into
the world's elite sub-10-second club.
	   Ito's blazing effort in this glamor event, in which Asians long
have lagged behind, symbolized for many that the continent was on
the threshold of closing a once yawning gap with the West.
	   In many sports the twain, East and West, have already met as
equals _ or more. China is a world power, holding a slew of records
and a fourth place in medal standings at the last Olympics in
Atlanta.
	   But at those 1996 games, Asians collected only 12 percent of the
gold medals, although they account for 60 percent of the world's
population. With 980 million people, the world's second most
populous nation, India, managed only one bronze.
	   A raft of explanations are offered. Many in the potential talent
pool of 3.5 billion Asians are still too busy eking out a marginal
existence, and not well enough nourished, to take part in sports.
	   Their governments don't have funds for elaborate sports
programs, or have slashed them amid Asia's economic crisis, which
forced some countries to send smaller teams to the Asian Games,
fire expensive foreign coaches and reduce allowances for athletes.
	   Although growing taller and stronger by the year, Asians
generally have a disadvantage against Western competitors in
disciplines requiring power and bulk.
	   New, middle-class affluence is also a drawback in some
countries.
	   ``Young kids from wealthier families prefer recreation like
playing golf or watching television. They don't want to run around
a track 24 times a day, inflicting pain on themselves,'' says
Maurice R. Nicholas, secretary-treasurer of the Asian Amateur
Athletic Association, who hails from prosperous Singapore.
	   Despite this, Asians have marshaled world-class athletes in a
large _ but not always glamorous _ number of sports. These include
archery, badminton, baseball, diving, gymnastics, shooting, squash,
softball and table tennis. And they excel in Asian-bred disciplines
like judo, karate and taekwondo.
	   In several sports, Asian women have already bested Western
rivals while leaving their men still lagging behind. At the Asian
Games, seven Chinese women shattered world weightlifting records in
as many days.
	   Although some of its athletes have been caught using
performance-enhancing drugs and suspicions have been raised about
others, China's women also hold seven world marks in swimming and
four in middle and longer distance track events.
	   The impression by some that Asians haven't quite made it into
the big time stems from their lackluster results in sports that
attract the most international attention and money.
	   Asians have yet to produce a heavyweight boxing champion or a
Carl Lewis in men's track, and they've never won a Wimbledon tennis
singles title. Asia's great hopes in the world's No. 1 sport, South
Korea and Japan, were winless at last year's soccer World Cup.
	   There are still chasms between East and the rest in some track
and field as well as swimming events. The men's 1,500-meter track
world record stands at 3 minutes, 26 seconds, against Asia's
fastest of 3:40.00.
	   An American quartet holds the world mark in the 400-meter
swimming freestyle relay in 3:15.ll, whereas the Asian best, set by
Japanese swimmers, stands at 3:23.80.
	   ``We're still behind the West, to be honest, except in the
marathon. As Asians progress in track, the Europeans also get
better,'' says Nicholas, the Asian athletics official. ``We're used
to blueblood, amateur sports and that won't do any more when other
countries go for a scientific approach and government support.''
	   Alan Thompson, president of the World Swimming Coaches
Association, said Asian swimmers were seeking more Western-style
sports education and training under foreign coaches.
	   ``That's paying dividends. Through sheer force of numbers Asia
could be a world swimming power in the next century,'' said
Thompson, adding that the 2000 Olympics in Australia and the 2002
World Cup soccer in Japan and South Korea would boost Asian sports
in general.
	   ``We have improved tremendously. Asians have closed the gap in
almost every sport,'' said Bangkok Post sports writer Edward
Thangarajah. ``They are no longer content with winning gold medals.
They're breaking world records.''
	   Thangarajah, who has covered Asian Games since they started 47
years ago, predicted Japanese sprinter Ito would join the 26
runners, all of African descent, who have dipped below 10 seconds
in the 100 meters.
	   And that Japan's wispy Naoko Takahashi would break the world
women's marathon record of 2 hours, 20 minutes, 47 seconds. She
came within a minute of doing so at the Asian Games, running
against little opposition.
	   Those feats would wipe out forever any sports inferiority
complex that may still be lingering in Asia.

Shaw, out of retirement, wins again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEND, Oregon (AP) _ Olympic snowboarder Betsy Shaw of East
Dorset, Vermont came out of retirement _ and out of sixth place on
her second run _ to win a snowboard Grand Prix giant slalom and
dlrs 10,000 first prize Thursday by two-hundredths of a second at
Mount Bachelor Ski Area.
	   Canada's Mark Fawcett won the men's race by .01 seconds over
Stephen Copp of Sweden.
	   Shaw, who turns 33 Sunday, had the fastest second run for a
two-run time of 2 minutes, 6.13 seconds. Lidia Trettel of Italy
took second place in 2:06.15 with first-run leader Rosey Fletcher
of Anchorage, Alaska, third in 2:07.20.
	   ``I was retired,'' Shaw said, ``but I had another year left on
my snowboard contract and I wasn't going to be paid if I didn't
ride, so I've decided to do these American events.''
	   The Grand Prix started two years ago as a qualifier for the
first Olympic Snowboard Team last winter. However, the events and
the prize money proved so popular that the U.S. Ski and Snowboard
Association, which governs the two Olympic sports, decided to
continue the series and open the three-stop series to all riders,
which has helped attract a mini-Olympic field for these events.
	   Fletcher, upset because her father saw her drop from the lead,
said riding conservatively on her second run cost her the victory.
	   ``I forgot these girls are at this level because they can rip,''
Fletcher said. ``I don't even bother looking at the scoreboard when
I finish; I look for my dad ... and today he was just clapping
routinely, so I knew I blew it.''
	   In the men's race later, Fawcett nipped Copp by .01 to win in
1:54.72. Ian Price of Manchester Center, Vermont, took third in
1:55.04. First-run leader Jeff Greenwood of Granby, Connecticut
also rode too cautiously and fell to seventh place.

Report: Major Hong Kong bank latest to announce salary freeze
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A major local bank has joined the growing rank
of large Hong Kong companies to freeze salaries during the economic
downturn, a newspaper report said Friday.
	   Hang Seng Bank, the largest locally incorporated bank, will
freeze salaries next year for its 7,800 staff members to cut costs,
the Chinese-language Apple Daily reported.
	   The bank operates 156 branches and has a handful of employees
working overseas and China.
	   Hang Seng Bank officials did not immediately return a reporter's
phone call for comments early Friday.
	   The news followed a flurry of layoffs, pay cuts and salary
freezes as Hong Kong sinks deeper into recession.
	   The bank's parent, British banking giant HSBC Holdings, also
announced earlier that it will freeze salaries for more than 13,000
employees in Hong Kong at its flagship unit, Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corp.
	   Two blue-chip property developers also reportedly announced pay
freezes for some employees.
	   On Thursday, the government announced that unemployment is at
5.5 percent, the highest since it started keeping such statistics
in 1981.
	   Officials say more people face layoffs or pay cuts ahead of the
Chinese New Year in February, when most companies review their
operations and lay off unneeded staff.
	   The once-robust economy contracted 7 percent in the third
quarter and is forecast to shrink by 5 percent for the entire 1998.

	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ During talks at an Organization
of African Unity summit in Burkina Faso, warring parties in the
Congo agreed to sign a cease-fire treaty later this month, the
pan-African body's chairman said Friday.
	   Following separate talks during the meetings, representatives
from five countries embroiled in the five-month war agreed to meet
in Lusaka, Zambia, on Dec. 27 and 28.
	   Hostilities in the Congo, the Horn of Africa and Angola were the
central focus of the OAU meeting that began Thursday and concluded
early Friday. The summit was to continue through Friday, but ended
early without explanation.
	   ``The warring groups have worked on a pre-agreement, and we hope
the finalization of this pact will be put into effect on in
Lusaka,'' said Blaise Compaore, president of Burkina Faso and
current chairman of the OAU.
	   President Laurent Kabila's Democratic Republic of Congo,
formerly Zaire, erupted into civil war in August when former
government military forces and their ethnic Tutsi allies launched
an uprising aimed at toppling the government.
	   With the backing of neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, the rebel
force marched to the outskirts of the capital Kinshasa before being
turned back by Kabila's Angolan and Zimbabwean allied forces.
Although the rebels were driven back toward eastern Congo, fighting
continues and the rebels still control a number of key towns.
	   Earlier peace initiatives for Congo have failed, but Compaore
said he had confidence in the latest effort.
	   ``The representatives who were here agreed unanimously to work
on the cease-fire agreement,'' he said.
	   Along with Kabila, delegates from Angola, Zimbabwe, Uganda,
Rwanda and the rebel movement were in Burkina Faso for the meeting.
OAU member heads of state endorsed a recommendation that foreign
observers be prepared to monitor the anticipated treaty.
	   On Thursday, Kabila said he would back the treaty if the terms
included a clear timeline for the withdrawal of foreign forces from
Congo. Kabila maintains the rebel war is a front for Rwandan and
Ugandan aggression against his country.
	   ``If we sign a cease-fire pact with the aggressors, it must be
linked to a calender,'' he said. ``We cannot sign any agreement if
we don't know when the aggressors are going to leave our country.''
	   Meantime, there were no major breakthroughs to solve the border
dispute in the Horn of Africa between Ethiopia and Eritrea, where
the simmering conflict erupted into battles and airstrikes in May
and June that left hundreds dead.
	   Although Compaore said both sides expressed hope for a
resolution, leaders from the two countries continued to openly
accuse each other of unprovoked aggression.
	   ``A lasting peaceful solution requires that Ethiopia rescind its
illegal claims on Eritrea,'' said Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki.
	   Ethiopia's Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said Eritrea was holding
up peace efforts by refusing to agree to the terms of earlier
cease-fire initiatives.
	   U.S. envoy Anthony Lake earlier this month concluded two days of
shuttle diplomacy between Ethiopia and Eritrea with no definitive
conclusion.
	   The OAU also issued a statement deploring the resumption of
hostilities between Angola's rebel UNITA movement and that
country's government. The OAU deferred to peace efforts by the
United Nations, which brokered an earlier treaty that has been
unraveling in recent months.

Israel may return to Asian Games in 2002
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Excluded from the Asian Games for
political reasons, Israel may return to the continental sporting
fraternity at the next games in South Korea.
	   A games' press release said a special invitation was being
considered for Israel, which was excluded before the 1978 games
under pressure from participating Middle Eastern nations.
	   In its last games appearance, at Tehran in 1974, Israel won
seven gold medals and finished sixth in the medals race.
	   Also banned from the games is Iraq, an action that followed its
invasion of Kuwait prior to the 1990 Gulf War.
	   The 2002 games will be staged in Pusan, South Korea's
second-largest city and major port. It is expected to attract
17,000 athletes, officials and media representatives, with
competition planned in 32 sports.
	   The theme of the 2002 games will be ``Asia is One,'' and the
mascot a sea gull displaying ``dynamic power, purity and valiant
spirit.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TAKING IF OFF, AGAIN: The departure of the last Asian Games
athletes from Bangkok will signal for some that it's time again to
take it off.
	   So as not to tarnish Thailand's image, police put a curb on the
normally anything-goes nightlife scene during the Dec. 6-20 games,
including a ban on stripping.
	   Aware of Bangkok's sex city reputation, some foreign visitors
during the games were surprised at the relatively sedate activities
along the city's nightlife strips.
	   ``The bad news when the Asian Games close is that the traffic
jams will resume. The good news is that go-go dancers will be
showing (read: stripping) again,'' Bernard Trink, the entertainment
columnist of the Bangkok Post, wrote Friday.
	   Authorities closed schools, opened new expressways and took
other effective measures to combat Bangkok's notoriety for massive
traffic jams.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   THE NEXT GAMES: Taking hardly a breather after staging the Asian
Games, Bangkok will hold the 7th Far East and South Pacific Games
for the Disabled next month.
	   The Jan. 10-16 event will see 2,500 athletes from 42 countries
and territories competing under the motto ``Equality in One
World.''
	   The FESPIC Games will be held in some of the same modern
stadiums built for the Asian Games, which end Sunday.
	   The first FESPIC Games were held in Oita, Japan, in 1975. The
last were in Beijing four years ago.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   RECORDS GALORE: Eleven world and 48 continental records have
been broken so far at the Asian Games, and more countries are on
the medals chart than at the last games, officials say.
	   Weightlifting accounted for all the new world marks, with China
breaking 10 and South Korea one.
	   Records in weightlifting been dropping like flies following a
decision by the sport's ruling body to wipe all records prior to
1998 off the books. The reason: too much doping in the sport
tainted previous records.
	   Of the 41 participating countries in Bangkok, 32 have been able
to win medals while only 22 shared in the medals at the last games
four years ago in Hiroshima, Japan.
	   Still noticeably missing from the medals chart are Yemen, Bhutan
and the Maldives, which have never won medals at any games.
	   ``The best way to promote sport (in Asia) is to let nations get
medals at the Asian Games,'' says Wei Jizhong, a senior official of
the Olympic Council of Asia. ``When a sport developing country
brings home a medal, their people will be happy. ... The government
will put more money into sport.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   FLEDGLING FANS: To inculcate a love of sports in kids, 4,000
tickets at rock-bottom prices are being reserved for them to watch
Thailand's soccer team take on China at the Asian Games Saturday.
	   Paying only 20 baht (55 U.S. cents), the children will get a
chance to see the two teams battle for the soccer bronze medal in
the southern city of Songkhla. A capacity crowd is expected at the
city's main stadium.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Pavol Demitra scored with 3:21 to go as the St.
Louis Blues beat the suddenly struggling Phoenix Coyotes 3-2
Thursday night to end a six-game winless slump.
	   Phoenix got off to a franchise-best 17-5-4 start, but is 0-2-1
in its last three games and goaltender Jimmy Waite absorbed his
first loss after going 6-0-2.
	   Marty Reasoner and Scott Pellerin also scored for the Blues, who
won for the first time in December. They had been 0-4-2 in their
previous six games, one shy of coach Joel Quenneville's worst
winless slump since becoming coach in January 1997.
	   Teppo Numminen and Rick Tocchet scored for the Coyotes, who have
38 points, one behind NHL-leading Dallas.
 &UR; Bruins 5, Senators 2
	   In Boston, Ray Bourque tied Gordie Howe for third place in
career assists with 1,049 and became just the 10th player to appear
in 1,400 NHL games in the Boston Bruins' win over the Ottawa
Senators.
	   Bourque had two assists and now trails only Wayne Gretzky and
Paul Coffey. The only other active players with 1,400 games are
Gretzky and Larry Murphy.
	   Boston had two power-play goals and Bourque assisted on both of
them.
 &UR; Flyers 3, Flames 3
	   In Philadelphia, Cory Stillman's power-play goal at 6:59 of the
third period helped Calgary erase a pair of two-goal deficits and
tie the Philadelphia Flyers.
	   Clarke Wilm and Jeff Shantz also scored for the Flames in a game
that featured three goals in a 1:49 stretch in the third period.
	   Petr Svoboda, Mikael Renberg, and Mark Bureau scored for the
Flyers, who were unable to hold on to a 2-0 lead in the second
period and a 3-1 advantage in the third.

China vows to continue reforms, reject Western-style democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China will ``unswervingly'' press ahead with
reforms that have transformed the lives of its 1.2 billion people,
but will never copy Western political models, President Jiang Zemin
said Friday in a speech celebrating 20 years of reforms.
	   The ruling Communist Party's policy of ``seizing opportunity,
deepening reforms, expanding, opening up, promoting development and
maintaining stability is absolutely correct,'' Jiang told an elite
gathering of 6,000 Communist Party, government and military
notables in Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People.
	   Jiang's 75-minute address, heavily larded with Marxist and
Chinese communist slogans and ideology, reaffirmed China's
commitment to developing an internationally competitive economy
while resisting democratic political reforms.
	   ``The system must not be shaken, weakened or discarded at any
time. The western mode of political systems must never be copied,''
said Jiang, who also is Communist Party chairman and head of the
nation's military.
	   Friday marks the 20th anniversary of a pivotal Dec. 18-22, 1978,
Communist Party meeting that initiated the current era of pragmatic
economic reforms, eliminating Marxist ``class struggle'' in favor
of modernization.
	   The gathering helped bring to an end decades of chaotic
political campaigns under revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung that
had hindered economic development and cost the lives of tens of
millions of people.
	   During the 1978 gathering, the party's Central Committee set in
motion rural reforms that allowed farm families to tend their own
land and reap rewards based on their productivity, breaking up
communes.
	   State-owned industries began reforms, still under way, intended
to replace a centrally planned economy with one that could compete
in international markets.
	   The reforms loosened Communist Party social and economic
controls, gradually enabling many Chinese citizens to choose their
own careers, set up private businesses, and travel and study
overseas.
	   In order to achieve ambitious economic goals, China under
then-leader Deng Xiaoping began pursuing foreign investment and
technology needed to modernize its backward economy.
	   In his speech, Jiang reaffirmed China's need to continue opening
up to the rest of the world, while developing the country ``through
its own efforts.''
	   ``We must never rely on others to promote economic
construction,'' Jiang said, adding that China should try to
minimize the impact of international risks and ``decadent thoughts
and lifestyles.''
	   Jiang's speech did not appear to set out any new policy
initiatives or a vision for the future, but repeatedly vowed to
uphold the ``Communist Party line.''
	   Emphasizing the party's continued loyalty to its Marxist
origins, during the live broadcast on state-run television, the
camera lingered on a large, golden sickle and hammer hanging on the
front curtain facing the audience.
	   While celebrating two decades of largely successful reforms,
China is struggling with widespread unemployment due to layoffs by
defunct state-run factories and lagging incomes for the vast farm
population. The regional economic crisis has taken a bite out of
critically needed foreign investment and exports.
	   While most Chinese are pleased with the improved living
standards resulting from the reforms, they are troubled by the
yawning gap between rich and poor as well as rising crime and
endemic corruption.
	   Jiang said the party would continue to improve China's still
incomplete legal system and improve the political system. But such
changes would come only gradually and could not be allowed to
threaten the country's stability.
	   The Communist Party demonstrated its determination to ward off
any challenges to its 49-year monopoly on power Thursday when it
put on trial two prominent dissidents accused of attempting to
subvert state power for having tried to set up an opposition party.
	   No verdicts were announced following the half-day trials
resulting from the party's harshest crackdown on dissent in two
years.
	   ``Only by sticking to and perfecting China's socialist political
system can we achieve the country's unification, national unity,
social stability and economic development,'' Jiang said.

Chief inspector defends report on Iraq and says he won't quit

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Facing sharp criticism from Russia and
China, chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler defended his
report that Iraq did not fully cooperate with U.N. monitors and
said he had absolutely no intention of quitting.
	   ``I want to say simply, slowly and plainly that any suggestion
that that report was not factual, was not objective, is utterly
false,'' he said Thursday.
	   Butler also dismissed as ``utterly wrong'' any suggestion that
the report's release Tuesday night was timed to suit the U.S.
government and help President Bill Clinton deflect attention from
impeachment proceedings.
	   Speaking hours after Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said
Moscow would insist on his dismissal, Butler was asked if he would
quit. ``Absolutely not,'' he shot back.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which Butler
heads, is charged with verifying the destruction of Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction. Over the past month inspectors tested the
promise Iraq made on Nov. 14, under threat of U.S. and British
airstrikes, to resume full cooperation with UNSCOM.
	   Butler's report, which triggered U.S. and British airstrikes
Wednesday, concluded that Iraq had not cooperated fully and had
placed new obstacles on the inspectors' work.
	   During a divisive U.N. Security Council meeting Wednesday night,
China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasun said Butler had played ``a
dishonorable role in this crisis'' and called the report
``unfounded and evasive of the facts.''
	   Russia's U.N. envoy, Sergey Lavrov, who called the formal
council meeting, said the report's conclusion was biased and he
echoed Iraq's contention that Butler had cited only five incidents
in 300 inspection operations.
	   Russia, China, Iraq and Kenya called for a cease-fire at
Wednesday night's council meeting but no action was taken because
of divisions among the 15 members.
	   Russia called another round of council consultations on Thursday
and circulated a non-binding draft presidential statement calling
for an immediate cessation of hostilities. However, given the
divisions on the council, the Russian draft has little chance of
being approved.
	   Lavrov said the statement was ``an attempt to start the
discussion in the council on how we can bring the situation back
into political and diplomatic efforts. We will continue to discuss
in the next few days.''
	   The council scheduled another meeting on Iraq for Friday
morning.
	   Butler said he expected the Security Council in the days and
weeks ahead to again tell Iraq to cooperate with UNSCOM.
	   ``We would go back and start our work tomorrow if they would
give us genuine cooperation,'' he said.
	   Butler was asked why UNSCOM's conclusions were in sharp contrast
to the report of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which
concluded that Baghdad had cooperated with nuclear inspectors.
	   He said the IAEA's job was different because it was dealing with
a nuclear weapons program ``that was in the making'' _ which is
vastly different from UNSCOM's work with already completed
missiles, chemical and biological weapons.
	   Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said the United States
claims to be after Iraq's weapons, but he said Washington's real
aim is to topple Saddam Hussein.
	   ``I don't think it's a question of those weapons,'' Hamdoon said
on CNN's ``Larry King Live''. ``They know for sure that there is no
more such weapons in the whole country of Iraq.''

	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Warring parties involved in
Congo's five-month civil war moved toward a truce during summit
talks, Burkina Faso's president said Friday.
	   Representatives from five countries embroiled in the war agreed
to meet in Lusaka, Zambia, later this month to sign a cease-fire
treaty.
	   ``The warring groups have worked on a pre-agreement and we hope
the finalization of this pact will be put into effect on in
Lusaka,'' said President Blaise Compaore, who is also chairman of
the Organization of African Unity summitOAU.
	   Hostilities in Congo, the Horn of Africa and Angola were the
focus of the meeting, which concluded early Friday. The summit was
to continue through the day, but ended early without explanation.
	   Civil war erupted in Congo, formerly Zaire, in August when
former government military forces and their ethnic Tutsi allies
launched an uprising aimed at toppling the government of President
Laurent Kabila.
	   With the backing of neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, the rebel
force marched to the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, before
Kabila turned them back with help from Angola and Zimbabwe.
	   The rebels, however, still control a number of key towns.
	   Earlier peace initiatives for Congo have failed, but Compaore
said he had confidence in the latest effort. ``The representatives
who were here agreed unanimously to work on the cease-fire
agreement,'' he said.
	   Along with Kabila, delegates from Angola, Zimbabwe, Uganda,
Rwanda and the rebel movement were in Burkina Faso. The same
representatives have agreed to meet in Lusaka on Dec. 27 and 28.
	   OAU member heads of state endorsed a recommendation that foreign
observers be prepared to monitor the anticipated treaty.
	   Kabila said Thursday that he would back the treaty so long as
the terms included a clear timeline for the withdrawal of foreign
forces.
	   ``If we sign a cease-fire pact with the aggressors, it must be
linked to a calendar,'' he said. ``We cannot sign any agreement if
we don't know when the aggressors are going to leave our country.''
	   Other than Congo, there were no major breakthroughs on the
border dispute in the Horn of Africa between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
	   Although Compaore said both sides expressed hope for a
resolution to the conflict, leaders from the two countries
continued to openly accuse one another of unprovoked aggression.
	   ``A lasting peaceful solution requires that Ethiopia rescind its
illegal claims on Eritrea,'' said Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki.
	   The simmering conflict erupted into battles and airstrikes in
May and June that left hundreds dead.
	   The OAU also issued a statement deploring the resumption of
hostilities between Angola's rebel UNITA movement and that
country's government.
	   The organization deferred to peace efforts by the United
Nations, which had brokered an earlier treaty between the battling
sides that has been unraveling in recent months.

Report: Myanmar preparing strikes against rebels near Thai border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's military is preparing a major
offensive against at least three ethnic rebel armies based near the
Thai border, local papers quoted a Thai general as saying.
	   Gen. Sommai Vichavorn, commander of the Third Army, said Myanmar
was deploying troops along the border with three northern Thai
provinces as it gears up for a dry-season offensive against the
rebels, the Bangkok Post reported Friday.
	   On Wednesday, Gen. Surayud Chulanont, commander in chief of the
Royal Thai Army, told The Associated Press that units along the
border had been put on alert since last week in response to
intelligence reports and anticipation of renewed fighting in the
dry season.
	   No extra troops had been sent to the region, but rapid
deployment forces were ready to counter any incursions onto Thai
soil, Surayud said.
	   Myanmar troops and guerrillas allied with them have crossed into
Thailand repeatedly in the past to burn refugee camps, and at times
attack Thai villagers.
	   More than 100,000 refugees from Myanmar are living in camps
inside Thailand, having fled repeated offensives by the Myanmar
military and a campaign of what they have called ethnic cleansing.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military
since 1962.
	   ``We will not let foreign troops enter Thai soil,'' Gen. Sommai
was quoted as saying by the Post. ``The army will dispatch its
soldiers to the border areas to protect national sovereignty and
border villagers.''
	   Sommai said that Yangon was massing troops opposite the Thai
provinces of Chiang Mai, Mae Hong Son and Tak with the aim of
attacking the Shan State Army, the United Wa State Army and the
Karen National Union.
	   All have been fighting for autonomy from Yangon for decades. The
United Wa State Army signed a ceasefire agreement with Yangon that
allows it to grow and traffic in opium, but relations between the
Wa and Yangon have deteriorated since last year.
	   Myanmar's government spokesman does not comment on ongoing
military actions.
	   Amnesty International reported earlier this year that the
Myanmar military has forcibly relocated more than 100,000 villagers
in Shan State in an effort to cut off support for the rebels.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's Wang Yinghang overtook favorite
Sergey Korepanov of Kazakstan in the final 300 meters Friday to win
the men's 50-kilometer walk at the Asian Games.
	   Wang collapsed after crossing the finish line in 3 hours, 59
minutes, 26 seconds, a second ahead of Korepanov, who was eighth in
the event at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
	   Japan's national record holder Fumio Imamura took the bronze but
Wang's victory gave China an 11-10 lead over Japan in track and
field gold medals.

East Timorese separatists protest ahead of U.N. envoy visit

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ At least 1,000 protesters Friday demanded
independence in the disputed territory of East Timor ahead of a
planned visit by a special envoy from the United Nations.
	   The U.N. diplomat, Jamsheed Marker, headed to the nearby island
of Bali for talks with military commanders who oversee East Timor,
a former Portuguese colony that was invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
	   Marker was expected to fly to Dili, East Timor's capital, on
Saturday in a visit that has heightened fears that demonstrations
timed for his arrival could degenerate into riots.
	   Pro-independence activists who gathered peacefully outside the
local Parliament in Dili ignored an appeal from East Timor's Nobel
laureate, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, to stay off the
streets.
	   A harsh critic of Indonesian policy, Belo urged demonstrators to
work for change through dialogue and refrain from disrupting
Christmas celebrations as well as Ramadan, the Islamic fasting
month which begins Sunday.
	   East Timor is predominately Roman Catholic, while some 90
percent of Indonesia's 200 million people are Muslim.
	   ``How can you fight for (your) aspirations by parading all over
the city, an act which will only be disadvantageous to you?'' the
official Antara news agency quoted Belo as saying on Thursday.
	   ``The best way to fight for your aspirations is to sit down and
have a dialogue,'' said Belo, a co-winner of the 1996 Nobel peace
prize for his efforts to solve the long-running conflict in his
homeland.
	   Some protesters waved separatist rebel flags but there were
several conciliatory speeches.
	   ``In order to get independence, we have to hold a peaceful
dialogue,'' demonstrator Matias Guviar told the crowd of students
and townspeople.
	   Long-running talks between Indonesia and Portugal and chaired by
Marker were revitalized earlier this year when Jakarta offered to
grant autonomy to East Timor.
	   In exchange, Indonesia wants international recognition of its
sovereignty over the half-island territory of 800,000 people.
	   However, sporadic fighting between separatist guerrillas and the
Indonesian military persists and many independence activists want a
total withdrawal of Indonesian troops.
	   On Thursday, more than 1,000 pro-independence protesters also
rallied outside East Timor's local Parliament as Marker held talks
with a guerrilla commander in a Jakarta prison.
	   The Antara agency quoted the rebel leader, Xanana Gusmao, as
saying he would agree to Indonesia's autonomy plan as long as a
referendum on independence was held after 10 years.
	   Marker visited East Timor last July and was heavily guarded by
Indonesian troops when he held talks with local community leaders
at a remote airport.
	   During a visit in March 1997, Indonesian soldiers shot and
killed two pro-independence protesters at a rally outside a Dili
hotel where the envoy was staying.
