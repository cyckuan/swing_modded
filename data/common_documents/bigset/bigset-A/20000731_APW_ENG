Chavez Elected Venezuelan President
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelans endorsed President Hugo Chavez's
''social revolution'' on Sunday by electing him to a fresh six-year term,
consolidating Latin America's second leftist regime after Cuba. With 77 percent
of the votes counted, 59 percent went to Chavez and 37 percent went to his
nearest challenger, former Zulia state Gov. Francisco Arias Cardenas.
Celebrations broke out in the capital of Caracas, with fireworks and revelers in
the streets after the National Electoral Council announced the results.

Boomer Battle May Not Draw Boomers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aging baby boomers, for the first time, will have two of
their own to choose from in this fall's presidential election, but analysts
caution that it may not be enough to lure a generation once known for political
protests. Census Bureau projections being released Monday show that the number
of Americans ages 45 to 64 has increased from 54.3 million in 1996 to 61.9
million this year, a 14 percent jump. Baby boomers are generally classified as
those born between 1946 and 1964, meaning the oldest ''boomers'' will be 54 this
year. But even an increase in that age group and a race that features two baby
boomers --Republican George W. Bush is 54 and Democrat Al Gore is 52 -- doesn't
necessarily mean there will be a reversal of voter turnout rates that have been
declining since the 1960s, analysts say.

Koreas To Reopen Border Liaisons
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Negotiators announced Monday that North and South
Korea agreed to reopen border liaison offices and reconnect a major rail line
across their heavily armed border. The measures were announced in a six-point
joint statement issued at the end of Cabinet-level talks in Seoul. They also
agreed to hold regular high-level talks to implement an accord reached at a
historic summit of their leaders in June. ''The first step we've taken is very
good,'' said chief North Korean delegate Jon Kum Jin. ''We've demonstrated that
if we muster our strength and wisdom, we can make a big achievement.''

Calif. Fire Forces Evacuations
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   RIDGECREST, Calif. (AP) -- A fire raging in the rugged Sierra Nevada swept
through a tiny community on the remote Kern Plateau, destroying eight homes as
it swelled to more than 60,259 acres Sunday. ''The last folks in there were the
firefighters and they headed out just in time to get out of the fire's way,''
said Kern County Fire Department spokesman Chuck Dickson. The flames charred
pine forest and brush as they spread from the Sequoia National Forest, gaining
10,000 acres overnight Saturday and threatening homes along the fire line, about
120 miles north of Los Angeles on Sunday. Firefighters estimate it will take
nearly two weeks of digging and burning fire lines to surround it.

McCain Urges Delegates: Back Bush
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- On the eve of the most unified Republican National
Convention in years, Sen. John McCain urged his delegates Sunday to cross over
and support George W. Bush's nomination for president. ''We're on our way to
victory,'' said the Texas governor. Democrats, concerned about the GOP place in
the spotlight and lead in the polls, set a multi-million dollar barrage of
television advertisements. Increasingly, they aimed sharp criticism at vice
presidential candidate Dick Cheney's conservative voting record while a member
of Congress. Bush described his vice presidential pick as ''a solid man, a man
of integrity'' as he continued a tour of battleground states.

Concorde Makes Emergency Stop
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A British Airways Concorde flying from London to New York had
to make an emergency stop Sunday in eastern Canada after a crew member smelled
gasoline in the cabin, the airline said. The 57 passengers, who included singer
Tony Bennett and guitarist George Benson, were told midway across the Atlantic
that the supersonic jet would have to be diverted -- giving them a scare in the
wake of Tuesday's crash of an Air France Concorde. Emergency vehicles were on
alert as the Concorde Flight 003 descended into the Gander, Newfoundland,
airport but the landing went without incident, the Canadian Transportation
Ministry said. Earlier Sunday, another Concorde was unable to take off from
Heathrow because of a refueling problem, the airline said.

<HEADLINE> Empire State Games end with the Western region atop the medal count </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - An exhausted Fred Smith leaned back in
his chair at Binghamton University and sighed his annual sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ''The games are over and we already have this melancholy
feeling,'' Smith, director of the Empire State Games, said Sunday,
only a few hours after the four days of Olympic-style competition
in 28 sports had ended. ''Binghamton has really raised the bar. The
enthusiasm here was incredible, almost unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   It marked the first time that Broome County had hosted the
games, and local officials made it clear they want to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look forward to the opportunity,'' Binghamton Mayor Richard
Bucci said. ''We want it back more so than ever. At the end of this
event we're just as enthused about it as we were a year ago. We'd
take them back next year if that were a possibility without any
reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not likely to happen for at least three years. The 2001
Empire State Games will be next July 25-29 in the Utica-Rome area
before returning to their original home in Syracuse for the 25th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Ithaca, Rochester, Buffalo and Albany already have
submitted letters or called inquiring about hosting future games
after that, and Bucci said he would, too.
</P>
<P>
   About the only drawback here was that the swimming venue was 40
miles away in Cortland. That didn't allow competitors there to
sample one of the games' nicest features, mingling with the other
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to work real hard next year to make sure we
address these issues,'' Smith said. ''We'll have our work cut out
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the basic blueprint for 2001 was in place and the
venues, which will be spread out considerably, will be solidified
in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll make it work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said sports like Tai Kwon Do and women's lacrosse might be
added for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The final medal counts by region ended like this: Western led
with 89 golds and 252 total; Central had 218 medals, 54 of them
gold; Long Island had 191, including 67 gold; Adirondack had 165,
including 50 gold; Hudson Valley had 158, including 52 gold; and
New York City had 154, including 70 gold.
</P>
<P>
   During competition, 97 records were set, all but 11 of them by
Masters competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Fiore didn't set any marks, but she did win her first
gold medal after eight failures.
</P>
<P>
   Fiore, the all-time leading scorer at Canisius College and now
women's coach at Johnstown High School, scored 16 points and
Melanie Halker of Watervliet had 21 as Adirondack defeated New York
City 103-95 on Sunday in the open women's championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is awesome!'' said Fiore, whose 3-pointer with 7:04
remaining gave Adirondack a 75-67 lead. ''This one was tough. I've
been out of school for three years. Getting back into shape was
challenging. I don't have time to run and do all those things.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She finally got one,'' Adirondack coach Theresa Wenzel said.
''It had to do with teamwork and pure desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Holohan added 18 points, Mary McKissack had 12, and
Jolene Johnston 10 for Adirondack.
</P>
<P>
   Fiore, who did not play for Adirondack when it won gold in 1997,
said it didn't take long to realize that this team was different
from the other eight she had played on.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the first day of practice, this team came in and worked
as hard as it could,'' said Fiore, whose basketball low point was
losing the state championship on her home court at Queensbury High
School in 1992. ''Everybody got along very well. We worked
together. I don't know if I've ever been on a team where we've
worked that hard together. We knew that it was a special team, that
it was going to be tough to beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, New York City made it difficult, building an early lead
behind the hot shooting of Cindy Johnson, who scored 19 of her
game-high 28 points in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   Antoinette Saitta had 18 points, Carolyn Harvey had 17, and
Kimberly MacMillan 12 for New York.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer by Catrina Washington with 2:29 left in the first
half put New York up 42-34, but two baskets in the final minute by
former Siena star Cori Drummond made it 42-40 at the break.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went in at halftime and said, 'You've worked too hard to
let it slip away. Stop playing scared and start playing like a team
instead of individuals,' '' Wenzel said. ''And that's what they
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied four times in the second half before
Adirondack went on an eight-point run. A lay-in by Drummond gave
Adirondack a 70-63 lead midway through the period and New York was
unable to rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''The second half we really picked up our defense,'' said
Halker, who also starred for Siena in college. ''She (Johnson) was
ready to win the game. In the first half, it was hard stopping her.
But in the second half, we focused on her more.''
</P>
<P>
   Two free throws by Fiore, who missed only one of 12 foul shots,
gave Adirondack an 84-74 lead with 4:38 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''We couldn't get it together,'' said Johnson, who plays college
ball for Delaware. ''We fell apart with the offense. We weren't
running the plays the way we were in the first half, and I think it
fell apart a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Adirondack hit 13 free throws in a row in the final three
minutes to secure the victory, its second win over New York in as
many days. Adirondack won Saturday night 105-93.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we enjoyed playing that team again,'' Fiore
said. ''It's hard to play teams back-to-back, especially playing
them at eight at night and then coming back and playing them at
noon. We knew what they did, but they knew us, too. It came down to
who had the legs at the end of the game. Everybody was pretty
tired, but when you want something as badly as we wanted it you
don't think about being tired anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   For Fiore, the elation of winning might have to last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if I'll play next year. This could be my last
one,'' she said. ''This was my goal and I got it.''

<HEADLINE> Steelers 38, Cowboys 10  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- For their first two quarters of the
preseason, the Pittsburgh Steelers showed what they hope will be
midseason form.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie receiver Plaxico Burress made several big plays as the
Steelers scored on five of eight first-half drives and got a
touchdown from cornerback Deshea Townsend to beat the Dallas
Cowboys 38-10 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh led 14-10 when both teams used frontline players,
then broke things open as soon as the second-teamers took over.
Pittsburgh outscored Dallas 31-3 in the second quarter, with 24 of
the points coming off four turnovers. Neither team scored in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took advantage of some things Dallas gave us,'' Pittsburgh
coach Bill Cowher said. ''We had some big plays. We had no
turnovers and few penalties. Those were the things that were most
pleasing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The blowout spoiled the debut of Cowboys coach Dave Campo. His
consolation is that he still has five weeks to prepare for the
debut that counts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not concerned,'' Campo said. ''I'm not happy with the
score, but it's not the No. 1 goal. There's going to be individual
performances that were good.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams suffered serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's Destry White dislocated his right ankle and broke
his right leg, likely ending his season. Dallas lost tight end Mike
Lucky to a knee injury, safety Sean Key broke two bones in his
right leg and cornerback Kareem Larrimore broke his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Burress, Pittsburgh's top pick, was impressive from the start.
He caught four passes for 60 yards and a touchdown and drew another
37 in penalties, most of them setting up another touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Burress showed he can take advantage of his 6-foot-5 frame,
reaching over smaller cornerbacks for two catches -- including a
2-yarder in the end zone. Cowher was most impressed by a short pass
Burress turned into a 24-yard gain by running over Dallas' top
pick, cornerback Dwayne Goodrich.
</P>
<P>
   ''That one catch was a great catch,'' Cowher said. ''He caught
it and then he did some nice running after it. He did some good
things. He was a factor out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Burress, though, also showed some of his cocky side. He followed
his touchdown by spiking the ball near the cornerback he beat,
drawing a 15-yard penalty for taunting.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend first made himself noticed with a jarring hit on
Randall Cunningham that helped force him to the bench after one
series. Townsend then intercepted third-stringer Paul Justin twice,
returning the first 22 yards for a score.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas showed little of the new offense it's breaking in, unless
the new plan emphasizes linebacker-turned-fullback Robert Thomas.
He caught three of Troy Aikman's six completions for 21 yards and
he ran once for three yards.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's first possession ended when he lost a fumble on a
blind-side sack caused by left tackle Flozell Adams missing a
block.
</P>
<P>
   His second drive was more typical of Dallas' offseason changes:
25-yard pass to newly acquired Joey Galloway, 23-yarder to Raghib
Ismail, 5-yard dump to Thomas and a 1-yard touchdown run by Chris
Warren, filling in for the injured Emmitt Smith. That made it 14-10
and sent the regulars to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''We moved the ball well and put it in the end zone,'' Aikman
said. ''With a limited number of snaps, you have to be happy with
that. We used an offensive game plan that was scaled back, but I
feel we executed well for the most part.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman finished 6-of-7 for 83 yards. Cunningham played only one
series and went 1-of-4 for seven yards, but scrambled for 21 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Justin, signed to be the backup before Cunningham became
available, played five series and had three interceptions, a
fumbled handoff and a three-and-out series.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year receivers Wane McGarity and Chris Brazzell both had
several drops and didn't make plays that could've avoided
interceptions. Rookie cornerbacks Mario Edwards and Goodrich were
beat several times -- mainly by Burress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those guys have to see things and be under pressure,'' Campo
said. ''That's something we have to build on.''
</P>
<P>
   Kordell Stewart was 5-of-9 for 101 yards, including a screen
that Amos Zereoue turned into a 31-yard touchdown. Kent Graham
threw two touchdowns, including a 29-yarder to Malcolm Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas made it 14-10 on a 48-yard field goal by Tim Seder, who
left his job as a high school teacher to try making the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's Kris Brown, who grew up a few miles from Texas
Stadium, answered with a 44-yarder that made it 17-10.

<HEADLINE> Slaves Helped Build White House  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The slaves who helped build Washington left
their mark in the stones they quarried and the walls they raised
for two citadels of liberty: the White House and the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation is moving through Congress to examine the historical
record of their work and consider ways to honor those known in the
documents of the time only by first names such as Davy, Newton,
Moses, Gabriel or Nace.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors, Reps. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., and John Lewis, D-Ga.,
have hopes of a monument on the Capitol grounds -- or perhaps a
commemorative postage stamp -- marking the contribution of the
slaves to the building of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any efforts to notice the work of African Americans as slaves
and freemen are appropriate,'' said Rep. James E. Clyburn, D-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Slaves were the largest locally available labor pool in 1790
when Congress ordered a new capital to be carved out of two
slave-owning states, Virginia and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   When the three commissioners in charge of construction started
building in 1792 they hired field hands from local small farmers
and planters.
</P>
<P>
   In the following eight years, the commissioners also employed
skilled labor wherever it could be found, recruiting stone masons,
for example, from Edinburgh, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   But for the heavy, dirty work of city building, local slaves
were available to be rented from their owners cheaply, an average
of $55 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The owners supplied clothing and blankets. The city
commissioners made sleeping space available in a barracks and
provided food: cornmeal, pork or beef, and shad in season.
</P>
<P>
   Many white laborers worked under similar conditions and ate the
same food, but their employment was voluntary and they could keep
the money they earned.
</P>
<P>
   Local historian Bob Arnebeck, in his 1991 book, ''Through a
Fiery Trial, Building Washington, 1790-1800,'' wrote that as work
began, slaves served as axmen, cutting trees on Jenkins Hill on
which the new Capitol would stand. Some helped square logs needed
for construction. Others cleared trees and stumps from the new
streets laid out by city planner Pierre L'Enfant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1796, according to Arnebeck, 21 slaves were cutting timber
for the president's house while 18 white laborers cut logs for the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Other slaves worked in the brickyards and stone quarries in
which sandstone was cut for both the Capitol and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Slaves assisted the masons laying stone for the walls of the two
major public buildings. The number of workers used at any one time
varied, depending on the work to be done and the money available.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1794, five slave carpenters worked with 15 white
carpenters at the president's house.
</P>
<P>
   Slavery continued to be a fact of life in Washington for more
than 60 years. Slaves worked as domestic servants at the White
House in several administrations.
</P>
<P>
   The city became a thriving slave-trading center, and visitors
from the North and from abroad often voiced shock at witnessing
slaves being led past the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Randolph of Virginia remarked in the 1820s that there
was never ''so great, so infamous a slave market, as in the seat of
the government of this nation which prides itself on freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony grew even sharper when the Capitol was expanded in the
late 1850s and slaves were put to work to help cast the statue of
Armed Freedom destined for the top of the new dome.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those slaves were to be free shortly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln signed legislation
emancipating the slaves of the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   It was a forerunner of the Emancipation Proclamation, which
signaled the coming end of slavery everywhere in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainians Complete OpSail Journey  </HEADLINE>
By ANN S. KIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- It isn't the tallest of tall ships, the
oldest, or the prettiest. And its journey in this summer's
international parade of tall ships has been far from smooth
sailing.
</P>
<P>
   But a Ukrainian ship that struggled to reach the OpSail 2000
finish line in Portland Harbor after about three months at sea has
also won the hearts of many Americans as the little ship that
could.
</P>
<P>
   The Bat'kivshchyna, sailing with no government funding, ran
aground and sustained damage days into its journey. Its radio gave
out in the Atlantic, leaving the U.S. Coast Guard unsure of its
whereabouts. And it missed OpSail's first stop in Puerto Rico
because of a navigational error.
</P>
<P>
   Dymtro Biriukovich, the vessel's 63-year-old captain, took the
miscues in stride during his 8,000-mile journey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, we had some small problems,'' said Biriukovich.
''But it is normal because it is a long trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Once it reached U.S. shores, the Bat'kivshchyna (pronounced
bat-keev-SHIN'-a) attracted its own following. Admirers brought
gifts -- food, beer, cigarettes, fuel and equipment -- to help the
ship continue its journey. In Portland, the crew was feted with a
feast of Maine lobster Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Americans have sort of adopted the ship as their
sweetheart of all of the ships,'' said Roy Kellogg, the captain's
son-in-law. ''They love the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   Biriukovich, who holds a doctorate degree in civil engineering,
spent about 2&AMP;frac12; years building the ship out of an old trawler. He
coated the hull in cement, added two collapsible masts, fixed the
deck and installed the cabin. Completed in 1991, the trawler was
reborn as a 90-foot gaff-rigged schooner named Bat'kivshchyna, or
''Fatherland.''
</P>
<P>
   The OpSail trip -- its first venture beyond Mediterranean waters
-- began in April. Within a week, the Bat'kivshchyna hit rock bottom
in the Dnieper River, leaving a 3-foot gash in the hull and
destroying a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Storms in the Mediterranean then ripped the mainsail, and the
ship had to stop so the crew could sew it up.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were bobbing around and that's when they got seasick,''
Kellogg said. ''It took them two days, because everybody was
getting seasick. They could do it for about 15 minutes at a time
before vomiting.''
</P>
<P>
   The satellite phone went out near Gibraltar, cutting off the
steady stream of e-mail messages the ship had been sending ashore.
It turned out the phone company was sold and the Bat'kivshchyna's
service was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-May the Bat'kivshchyna's radio had died. The Coast Guard
sent out broadcasts asking other ships to be on the lookout and
considered launching a search as far back as Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg and his wife, Katya, were waiting in San Juan, Puerto
Rico, the site of the first OpSail stop. They heard no word about
the Bat'kivshchyna until a Danish sailboat passed along a confused
message that indicated the ship was bypassing San Juan and heading
to Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg later learned that the ship's global positioning system
-- bought for about $100 in Ukraine -- was giving false readings and
that the Bat'kivshchyna ended up farther north than intended. The
crew navigated to Virginia with a sextant and compass and arrived
early for the festivities there.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed sort of like something my father-in-law would do.
'Oh we missed it,''' Kellogg said.
</P>
<P>
   In Portland this weekend, tens of thousands of people waited for
hours to tour some of the world's largest tall ships, Argentina's
Libertad, Brazil's Cisne Branco, and the U.S. Coast Guard's Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   But the smaller Bat'kivshchyna did not go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't realize how many Ukrainians were in Maine,'' said
Steve Femiak, the founder of Connecticut Friends of Ukraine
Expedition. ''They're all just happy to be on a boat from the
homeland and to see the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the old friends made themselves at home below deck,
while first-time visitors perused information about Ukraine. The
crew hawked souvenirs -- flasks with Russian insignias, refrigerator
magnets shaped like musical instruments, fake fur hats -- to help
pay for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The OpSail voyage is just the beginning for Biriukovich's
seaworn ship. He wants to sail around the world -- albeit slowly --
to teach people about his country. Next year, he wants to sail the
Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my dream,'' he said. ''Let us step by step inform
everybody.''

<HEADLINE> Sports, Politics Converge in Philly  </HEADLINE>
By TED ANTHONY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- You pass the people, and you hear the
platitudes: phrases like ''giving 110 percent'' and ''the back
nine'' and ''the home stretch'' and ''came to play.'' And why not?
This is a pro-sports complex, after all.
</P>
<P>
   But these words aren't coming from the usual suspects -- the
sundry Flyers and Phillies and 76ers who usually haunt arena row at
the rump of South Philly. This time around, they're coming from
handlers and delegates, politicians and press secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: The walls, precarious for years, have fallen.
Sports is politics, politics is entertainment, and a building that
began the year as a sports arena for cheering, victory-rabid fans
is, for a week, the country's premier political arena for cheering,
victory-rabid partisans.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the Super Bowl of American politics,'' says Leslie
Goodman, the GOP convention's chief spokeswoman. ''This,'' she
says, ''is our Greatest Show on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   A telling comparison for an entertainment epoch. And it can veer
into the decidedly bizarre: On Wednesday night, House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., will open the evening's session with the
help of none other than The Rock, the glowering
athlete-slash-entertainer who cracks skulls and threatens inferiors
each week for the World Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just wondering if The Rock is going to get up there and
say, 'Finally! The Rock! Has come back! To Philadelphia!''' jokes
Ike Richman, the PR guy for Comcast Spectacor, which operates First
Union Center, the convention venue.
</P>
<P>
   Used to be that politicians appreciated actors and athletes but
didn't necessarily emulate them -- or become them. But then came
Ronald Reagan, a one-man vessel of acting (''Bedtime for Bonzo''),
sports (''Win one for the Gipper'') and savvy politics (''It's
morning in America''). The NBA's Bill Bradley and baseball's Jim
Bunning went to Congress, and by the 1990s cross-pollination was
here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Then, quickly: The creator of ''Designing Women'' got tight with
the Clintons. Michael Jordan made ''Space Jam.'' Shaquille O'Neal
cut a CD. Former Clinton press secretary Dee Dee Myers started
doing scripts for ''The West Wing.'' Garth Brooks practiced with
the San Diego Padres. Nebraska's football coach is running for the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, Bob Dole, erstwhile GOP presidential candidate,
will be a convention correspondent for -- get this -- Comedy Central.
</P>
<P>
   So what better site for a political production? A convention
center seems so button-down, a big hotel so corporate and beige.
Why not the home of major-market sports teams, the place celebrity
and money and forward-moving, easily understood narratives call
home?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the perfect place,'' says John Dizikes, a professor at
the University of California-Santa Cruz who studies the places that
sports and politics occupy in American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''Politics is far more entertainment than it used to be,'' he
says. ''The conventional political types, the political
establishment, are not willing to accept that they've entered into
a different cultural period.''
</P>
<P>
   At the First Union Center, nearly all the visible Flyers and
76ers trappings, from basketball hoops to backup hockey sticks to
actual staffers, have been moved out -- many to the nearby
Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. There are Republicans in Flyers head
coach Craig Ramsay's office, Republicans in the locker room,
Republicans in the team whirlpool room and laundry facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The arena's operators, walking Sunday afternoon through what was
recently a hockey rink and is now a floor for state delegates, see
many similarities between athletic and political spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oklahoma's about at center ice,'' says Peter Luukko, president
of Comcast Spectacor Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Delaware's about where the backboard is,'' Richman volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goalie's in Arkansas,'' Luukko shoots back.
</P>
<P>
   He elaborates. ''Sports, entertainment and politics are meshing.
They're all becoming one. Everything is designed to totally
entertain people instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Spectacor officials are trying to learn from the unique amalgam
of political fanfare and entertainment that the Republicans have
brought to town.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's consensus-building,'' Luukko says. ''We've got to make
people feel like they're in charge, but make sure they do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs. ''I guess we've become politicians.''

Chavez Wins Venezuela Election
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelans endorsed President Hugo Chavez's
''social revolution'' on Sunday by electing him to a fresh six-year term,
consolidating Latin America's second leftist regime after Cuba. With 77 percent
of the votes counted, 59 percent went to Chavez and 37 percent went to his
nearest challenger, former Zulia state Gov. Francisco Arias Cardenas.
Celebrations broke out in the capital of Caracas, with fireworks and revelers in
the streets after the National Electoral Council announced the results.

Korea agreed to reopen border liaison offices and reconnect a major rail line
across their heavily armed border. The measures were announced in a six-point
joint statement issued at the end of Cabinet-level talks in Seoul. They also
agreed to hold regular high-level talks to implement an accord reached at a
historic summit of their leaders in June. ''The first step we've taken is very
good,'' said chief North Korean delegate Jon Kum Jin. ''We've demonstrated that
if we muster our strength and wisdom, we can make a big achievement.''

Boomer Battle May Not Draw Boomers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aging baby boomers, for the first time, will have two of
their own to choose from in this fall's presidential election, but analysts
caution that it may not be enough to lure a generation once known for political
protests. Census Bureau projections being released Monday show that the number
of Americans ages 45 to 64 has increased from 54.3 million in 1996 to 61.9
million this year, a 14 percent jump. Baby boomers are generally classified as
those born between 1946 and 1964, meaning the oldest ''boomers'' will be 54 this
year. But even an increase in that age group and a race that features two baby
boomers --Republican George W. Bush is 54 and Democrat Al Gore is 52 -- doesn't
necessarily mean there will be a reversal of voter turnout rates that have been
declining since the 1960s, analysts say.

Concorde Makes Emergency Stop
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A British Airways Concorde flying from London to New York had
to make an emergency stop Sunday in eastern Canada after a crew member smelled
gasoline in the cabin, the airline said. The 57 passengers, who included singer
Tony Bennett and guitarist George Benson, were told midway across the Atlantic
that the supersonic jet would have to be diverted -- giving them a scare in the
wake of Tuesday's crash of an Air France Concorde. Emergency vehicles were on
alert as the Concorde Flight 003 descended into the Gander, Newfoundland,
airport but the landing went without incident, the Canadian Transportation
Ministry said. Earlier Sunday, another Concorde was unable to take off from
Heathrow because of a refueling problem, the airline said.

Israel, Palestinian Negotiators Meet

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Far-reaching proposals for a permanent Israeli-Palestinian
peace did not necessarily die when the Camp David summit failed, negotiators
said Sunday, launching efforts to bring the two sides' leaders back together.
When the summit failed last week, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said all
proposals on the table -- including long-standing taboo-breakers on control of
Jerusalem, borders of a Palestinian state and the future of Palestinian refugees
-- were now ''invalid.'' But on Sunday, in their first meetings since the
summit, negotiators suggested the groundbreaking U.S.-brokered proposals were
still on the table.

Students Plan Off-Campus Bonfire

   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- A group of students trying to continue Texas
A&AMP;M University's annual bonfire tradition are planning an off-campus bonfire
this fall, in spite of a two-year moratorium ordered after last year's deadly
collapse. Texas A&AMP;M officials are critical of the plan and say they will not
support an off-campus bonfire now or in the future. Twelve people were killed

collapsed during construction. The bonfire had been a 90-year tradition lit

<HEADLINE> McCain Urges Delegates: Back Bush  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Brimming with confidence and boasting of
harmony, Republicans are raising the curtain on George W. Bush's
convention with opening-night appeals to women, minorities and
moderates by the Texas governor's wife, Laura, and retired Gen.
Colin Powell, one of the GOP's biggest stars.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're on our way to Philadelphia and we're on our way to
victory!'' Bush exulted at an Ohio rally on a bus trip to the
Republican National Convention. He'll make nightly appearances by
satellite links on the road before arriving in town Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of red, white and blue balloons hung in nets high
above the floor of the First Union Center in anticipation of Bush's
acceptance speech Thursday. Three gigantic television screens lined
the stage to project larger-than-life images of convention
speakers. The over-arching theme: ''Renewing America's Purpose.
Together.''
</P>
<P>
   New polls showed Bush leading Democrat Al Gore anywhere from
seven to 12 percentage points. Democrats tried to burst Bush's
bubble with television ads in 17 battleground states attacking
running mate Dick Cheney's conservative voting record.
</P>
<P>
   Bush described his vice presidential pick as ''a solid man, a
man of integrity,'' and Cheney defended himself on Sunday
television talk shows. Cheney acknowledged that might vote
differently now on issues ranging from gun control to women's
rights -- prompting Democrats to seize on his turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to figure how someone could change his position on
all of those issues without undergoing a partial lobotomy,'' said
Ed Rendell, co-chairman of the Democratic National Committtee.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, arriving in Philadelphia, told several hundred
sign-waving supporters that ''one of the things I feel best about
... is my record.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans boasted that the party was more united than at any
time since the 1984 re-election of Ronald Reagan. ''It's very
important to us that there is unity and a feeling of optimism about
winning the White House,'' said Gerald Parsky, chairman of the
California delegation, who said many Republicans in his state voted
for Ross Perot in 1992 and stayed home in 1996 .
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of harmony, Sen. John McCain released his
delegates and urged them to give Bush's campaign ''the same amount
of enthusiasm and participation you did for our primary campaign.''
He said the nation does not like ''sore losers.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's supporters -- totaling about 160 in all -- groaned in
disappointment and a few said they could not back Bush. ''I don't
think I can vote in good conscience for Bush. I think he's sending
the wrong message,'' said James Manning, a McCain delegate from New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's speeches by Laura Bush, a former librarian, and
Powell, a black military leader who rose to become chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, are the opening of a concerted effort to
soften some of the party's hard edges of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush, for example, is expected to focus on literacy, an
issue she has championed from the governor's mansion. The first
day's theme is ''Leave No Child Behind.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first pieces of business was ratifying the GOP's
platform of policy principles, a manifesto that reaffirms a desire
to ban abortion with no exceptions and toughens language against
gay rights and family planning counseling for teens. At the same
time, it eases some stands, dropping calls for abolishing the
Education Department and setting a more welcoming tone for
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ''This platform is putting the flesh on compassionate
conservatism,'' said Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, the platform
chairman, using Bush's slogan.
</P>
<P>
   This marks the first political convention in Philadelphia since
1948 near the dawn of the television era. A half century later,
major TV networks are slashing back their reports on grounds that
there's no suspense about the outcome. But that hasn't deterred
cable outlets -- and Internet reporters -- from saturation coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will open their convention in Los Angeles on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   GOP organizers promised ''different kind of convention for a
different kind of Republican'' -- in line with Bush's theme of being
a ''compassionate conservative'' focusing on issues like education
and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''My job is to lift the spirit of the country,'' Bush said at a
rain-soaked rally at a suburban baseball field in Cincinnati. ''My
job is to set our sights high. My job is to say a united nation can
achieve that which we want: to make sure people are not left
behind,'' Bush told the ballpark rally.
</P>
<P>
   In a break with tradition, the convention will begin a rolling
roll call of the states Monday night, spreading out the
state-by-state declarations of support over several nights instead
of making the audience endure what usually is an hours long
process.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the convention hall, several thousand activists in
colorful costumes and bearing signs and banners with diverse
messages crowded downtown streets in a mostly peaceful protest
Sunday. Several tense confrontations erupted between police and
smaller groups of protesters but they were negotiated with no
arrests. However, protesters have promised greater disruptions
beginning Monday, and police have indicated they won't be as
willing to compromise.

<HEADLINE> Philadelphia Has Solid GOP Past  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE FEINSILBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Strange thing about the Republicans meeting
here in Philadelphia. You'd think they'd brag about this city's
solidly Republican past. Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   When every other big city in America was voting Democratic, and
many were in the hands of Democratic machines and bosses,
Philadelphia was in the hands of a Republican machine. In the dark
Depression, Philadelphians even supported Republican Herbert Hoover
over Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   From Lincoln through FDR, the Democrats were a fringe party
locally, on the outside looking in. The dominant Republicans
themselves were divided between blue-blood old aristocracy
reformers and the GOP bosses. The bosses generally prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Philadelphia stood for everything that made
Republican blood boil elsewhere: bloated contracts. Votes bought
with booze. Dead people voting. Ward politics. The spoils system.
If you wanted a job as a cop, or you wanted a zoning variance, or
you wanted to fix a ticket, you went to your Republican ward
leader.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when national Republicans stood for civil service
reform and temperance and were unwelcoming toward immigration,
Philadelphia Republicans stayed in power through patronage, whiskey
and finding jobs for immigrants, says local historian Kyle Farley.
</P>
<P>
   Farley and Christopher Klemek are Ph.D. candidates in history at
the University of Pennsylvania, earning their way through school by
giving history tours of their city. This week they are showing off
the city's GOP roots to visiting Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   They point to Philadelphia's massive City Hall as a testament to
the city's old ways. When it was under construction, it was
intended as the tallest building in the country, but Republican
contractors kept winning lucrative contracts to add on to it.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years passed before it was finished in 1901, and by that
time other buildings elsewhere were taller. But it was big, and it
provided a lot of jobs to just-off-the-boat immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia was the despair of reformers everywhere. The city,
wrote Lincoln Steffens, the famed turn-of-the-century muckraker,
was ''corrupted beyond redemption.'' Not merely corrupt, but
content to be so.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because Philadelphia was so good to Republicans, the GOP
liked to meet here. This week's is the sixth Republican convention
since the newly minted party first assembled in Musical Fund Hall
in 1856 and nominated John Fremont on an anti-slavery platform. He
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant was successfully nominated for a
second term in the Academy of Music, the nation's oldest grand
opera house, and the Republicans came up with a third winner here
with William McKinley, president from 1897 to 1901.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans returned to Philadelphia twice in the 20th
century to award their nomination to Wendell Wilkie in 1940 and
Thomas E. Dewey in 1948. Both came up losers.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, corruption finally drove the Republicans out after
World War II. Democratic reformers Joseph Clark and Richardson
Dilworth campaigned against the machine and took over City Hall.
The Republicans elected their last mayor, Barney Samuel, in 1948.

<HEADLINE> Hundres Protest Dr. Laura Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. (AP) -- About 300 people rallied outside
KARE-TV studios to protest the station's decision to air Dr. Laura
Schlessinger's upcoming television show.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters Sunday vowed to boycott businesses that advertise
during the Paramount-syndicated show, which will begin airing on
KARE Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights activists have criticized the radio talk-show host
for her views on homosexuality, which she has called ''deviant''
and a ''biological error.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This sort of message, which is about so many things, but in
particular about homophobia, continues to foster the kind of
behavior that allows hate crimes,'' said Tom Kane, a member of the
Episcopal Diocese of Minnesota's Department of Outreach and
Advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   KARE officials said the station purchased the show for its fall
lineup before learning about Schlessinger's controversial views.
But they said the station will honor its contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''Silencing voices of any kind prior to seeing even a single
frame of tape, raises a whole other set of potentially harmful
issues regarding freedom of expression,'' KARE general manager John
Remes said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Boomer Battle May Not Draw Boomers  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first election between two presidential
candidates of their own generation may not be enough to get
millions of baby boomers to the voting booths and reverse a decline
in turnout that began in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau projections released Monday show that the number
of Americans ages 45 to 64 increased from 54.3 million in 1996 to
61.9 million this year, a 14 percent jump. Baby boomers are
generally classified as those born between 1946 and 1964, meaning
the oldest ''boomers'' will be 54 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, older Americans are more likely to vote than their
younger counterparts, Census analyst Jennifer Day said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who vote usually own their own home, are older, and
have a higher level of education,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the baby boomers, many of whom protested the Vietnam War and
grew jaded by the Watergate scandal in their youth, may not rush to
the booths this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither of these are exciting candidates,'' said G. Terry
Madonna, political science professor at Millersville University in
Millersville, Pa. ''A lot of voters believe they are looking at two
sides of the same coin without any big differences.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, both major parties will feature candidates
from the baby boom generation: Texas Gov. George W. Bush (age 54),
the presumptive Republican nominee, and his Democratic counterpart,
Vice President Al Gore (52).
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Gans, director of the Washington-based Committee for the
Study of the American Electorate, said the candidates are trying to
overcome ''a turnoff of the political enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It will take a long time to reverse'' declining voter turnout
rates, Gans said.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout for the 1996 presidential election dipped to 48.9
percent, a record low according to Census data dating back to 1930.
Turnout was 55.1 percent in 1992, and 62.8 percent in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 32.7 percent of the voting-age population cast ballots
in the midterm congressional elections, down 4 percent from four
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   While it's early to forecast what turnout will be in November,
Gans said he wouldn't be surprised to see turnout dip even lower.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real question is do people care,'' Madonna said. ''Is the
interest sufficient to have turnout hold its own?''
</P>
<P>
   By November, the number of Americans eligible to vote will be
about 206 million, 9 million more than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While the 45-64 age group increased 14 percent from 1996, there
also was an 8 percent increase in the 18-24 age group, signifying
the maturation of baby boomers' children.
</P>
<P>
   ''But typically, those kids don't vote,'' Day said.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jelen, a political science professor at the University of
Nevada at Las Vegas, says the correlation between age and voting is
not based on how old people are, but on ''when they were young.''
</P>
<P>
   The very oldest age group, those 65 and older who lived through
World War II, tend to be more active in civics. ''You find high
turnout with them throughout the years,'' Jelen said.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect to see a big spike in turnout thanks to the
aging baby boomers, he added. ''Their formative experiences will
affect that.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Fire Forces Evacuations  </HEADLINE>
By BILL MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIDGECREST, Calif. (AP) -- A fire raging in the rugged Sierra
Nevada swept through a tiny community on the remote Kern Plateau,
destroying eight homes as it swelled to more than 63,270 acres late
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last folks in there were the firefighters and they headed
out just in time to get out of the fire's way,'' said Kern County
Fire Department spokesman Chuck Dickson.
</P>
<P>
   The flames charred pine forest and brush as they spread from the
Sequoia National Forest, gaining 10,000 acres overnight Saturday
and threatening homes along the fire line, about 120 miles north of
Los Angeles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters estimate it will take nearly two weeks of digging
and burning fire lines to surround it, and there's no telling how
much the fire will grow in the meantime, said U.S. Forest Service
spokeswoman Geri Adams.
</P>
<P>
   The weather forecast for the area was for hotter and drier
conditions combined with afternoon thunderstorms, Adams said,
adding, ''That wind won't help us either.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Nevada blaze was one of about 50 fires burning more
than 500,000 acres across the nation Sunday, the National Fire
Information Center reported. In the West, wildfires continued to
burn in Montana, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming,
Washington, Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In the scattered California community of Kennedy Meadows, which
includes the tiny Pine Creek village that burned, some of the 43
permanent residents were moving horses and mobile home trailers to
safety Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy smoke hid the mountains, and blackened trees and shrubs
lined the narrow road to the community already under orders to
evacuate. A group of residents gathered at a general store to
collect information and supplies, while others watched firefighters
burning a fire line about a quarter-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're waiting for them to say, 'This is it. Get out of here.'
And when they do, we'll be out of here in a flash. We're not going
to be heroes,'' said Leona Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,350 firefighters, with the help of nine helicopters and
four air tankers, were fighting the blaze, which has cost more than
$3 million, Adams said. Eight firefighters have been injured since
it began July 22.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have an outstanding order (to bring in more
firefighters), but with all the other fires we have in the U.S.,
we're still waiting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fires also burned on the Pechanga Indian Reservation in the
Cleveland National Forest to the south and in Los Padres National
Forest, where three firefighters have been injured.
</P>
<P>
   A man trying to spark the pilot light of his recreational
vehicle's water heater with a burning piece of paper ignited the
Los Padres fire a week ago about 100 miles southeast of San
Francisco, said Forest Service spokesman Maeton Freel. He said the
man could face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, a fire triggered by lightning on Wednesday had
burned more than 65,000 acres by Sunday about 60 miles northeast of
Elko, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, a cluster of six fires that had burned 50,000 acres
and three Forest Service buildings in Custer National Forest was
threatening 20 homes Sunday in southeast corner of the state. Nine
homes and 29 other buildings had been destroyed in a 29,000-acre
fire north of Helena.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had some really extreme nighttime fire weather,'' fire
information officer Jack Conner said. Night humidity in the forest,
normally 80 to 90 percent, has been topping out at 35 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado's Mesa Verde National Park, the famous Anasazi ruins
survived a 10-day fire that blacked more than 23,000 acres and
uncovered more than a dozen new archaeological sites.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was contained Sunday, but damage to roads and utility
lines are expected to keep the park closed at least two more weeks.
The blaze was so hot, the railroad ties supporting the steel
guardrails along the park's winding roads burned, and officials
worried about erosion on the charred hills when the first heavy
rain comes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want people to know that we have sort of burned the skin of
Mesa Verde, but the creature is still whole,'' park spokesman Will
Morris said.

<HEADLINE> President Takes Aim At Cheney  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Offering partisan advice as the GOP gathers
for its convention, President Clinton says the economic boom of the
last eight years has been so effective that voters who want to
''live like Republicans'' should vote for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who scheduled a round of speeches and party
fund-raisers in Florida on Monday, took advantage of a friendly
audience of trial lawyers in Chicago on Sunday to take a shot at
Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney's 1986
congressional vote against recommending freedom for South Africa's
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, all the big publicity is about, in the last few days, an
amazing vote cast by their vice presidential nominee when he was in
Congress against letting Nelson Mandela out of jail,'' Clinton
said. ''That takes your breath away.''
</P>
<P>
   As a House member from Wyoming, Cheney voted against a
nonbinding resolution calling for Mandela's release and for U.S.
recognition of Mandela's African National Congress. Cheney said
Sunday his vote reflected the view then that the ANC was ''a
terrorist organization,'' not that he favored keeping Mandela in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Crediting his administration with policies he said worked like a
charm to turn around a once-stumbling economy, Clinton drew a laugh
when he added: ''I keep saying that if people want to live like
Republicans they should vote Democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a noontime reception that raised $250,000 for
Democrats, Clinton said Republicans are going to Philadelphia to
nominate Texas Gov. George W. Bush for president and promote
moderate policies that he said are belied by their own far harsher
record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I bet butter won't melt in their mouths'' at the convention,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Bush-Cheney ticket is clearly to the right of the
Republican ticket of Bob Dole and Jack Kemp that he and Vice
President Al Gore defeated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited Cheney's Mandela vote as a way of moving to a
broader point -- his contention that GOP senators have kept many of
his nominees for the federal bench, especially minorities, ''in
political jail because they can't get a hearing from this
Republican Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And their nominee won't say a word about it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   At the lunch and a later address to about 3,000 people at the
Association of Trial Lawyers of America, Clinton held up the 4th
Circuit Court of Appeals as an example.
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court hears cases from Maryland, Virginia,
West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina -- a region with
more black residents than any other federal court jurisdiction. The
4th Circuit has never had a black judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been trying for seven long years to fix that, and they've
blocked every one,'' of his nominees, Clinton said. ''They're so
determined to keep an African-American off that they have allowed a
25 percent vacancy rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has nominated three blacks to be 4th Circuit
judges, but none has been confirmed. Two nominations are still
pending, but no Senate confirmation hearings are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to stay overnight Monday in the West Palm Beach
area.

<HEADLINE> Group Spotlights Philly Homeless  </HEADLINE>
By TODD SPANGLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Yolonda Johnson-Young has a tarp roof over
her head, an old couch to relax on and a cot to sleep on at night.
The kids are slurping up Fruit Loops and looking around at the
weed- and gravel-covered lot they call home for now.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome, Johnson-Young says, to Bushville.
</P>
<P>
   That's the name activists have given their encampment on a plot
ringed with trash and broken bottles in North Philadelphia, an
abandoned property that the Kensington Welfare Rights Union and its
leader, Cheri Honkala, selected as base camp for protests designed
to bring attention to the impoverished during the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it helps,'' said Johnson-Young, a market researcher
who has lived in a shelter for more than a year. ''The issue is
very serious here in Philadelphia and we have groups from all
across the country here trying to make the same point.''
</P>
<P>
   The point, the urban campers say, is affordable housing, better
wages and health care -- more help for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Bushville's 150 or so tenants include students from
Massachusetts and Maine, homeless from Rhode Island and a women's
group from Little Rock, Ark. Their tents and tarpaulins pitched,
they talk about subjects as disparate as civil disobedience and
child care and plan for a Monday march through the city.
</P>
<P>
   People line up for milk and corn flakes. Flies buzz the lot. The
rules include no drugs or alcohol, and shirts and shoes must always
be worn.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to win the American public,'' says Willie
Baptist, who is with the welfare rights union. We're not just here
for self-expression.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, where police are allowed to ticket people
living or lying on city streets, the plight of the impoverished has
been brought to a head, not only by the convention, but also by the
recent fatal shooting of a homeless man by Amtrak police.
</P>
<P>
   City police have said no homeless are moved unless problems
arise and that policy would remain in effect during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Baptist contends, however, that police have moved the homeless
off the streets over time.
</P>
<P>
   Other activists see it differently.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Mary Scullion, who runs Project HOME -- which houses
hundreds of homeless and provides jobs and education services --
said $5.6 million in city funding has helped reduce the number of
homeless on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In a yearly census of homeless in Philadelphia, Project HOME
counted 220 people. Last summer, the number was more than 470,
Scullion said.
</P>
<P>
   She estimated that Philadelphia has about 20,000 people who
experience homelessness each year, but the vast majority of those
go to a shelter or find a program to enter.
</P>
<P>
   ''People think about the person on a grate, but homelessness
mostly affects women and children you don't even see,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Congressmen Get Private Philly Party  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- They flew over the Philadelphia skyline in a
helicopter owned by an aerospace contractor. Their kids took a dive
in a pool hastily built for free by union workers.
</P>
<P>
   They jumped in the cockpit of a Commanche helicopter flight
simulator, stood near a Scud missile and peeked inside the Marine's
latest aircraft -- the troubled MV-22 Osprey.
</P>
<P>
   Life's not so bad for members of Congress at the Republican
convention who are ''roughing it'' in some old Navy row houses near
the convention center.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Congressional Village,'' as it is being called, is
temporary home to 75 GOP congressmen this week in Philadelphia.
It's the product of a novel merger of political money, Pentagon
goodwill and a congressional need.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is great,'' said Rep. Rick Hill, R-Mont., as he whizzed
by on a scooter. Hill was one of the congressman who took up the
opportunity to have a close, secure location near the convention
center.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., a senior member of the House Armed
Services Committee, came up with the idea to convert a closed Navy
base on the grounds of the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard into a
mini-entertainment capital.
</P>
<P>
   And special interests, including many major defense contractors
with business before Weldon's committee, came through with $100,000
in cash and donated services to complete the job.
</P>
<P>
   There were free hot-air balloon rides, antique cars to drive,
live elephants, a parade of 300 fire trucks, a swimming pool
quickly erected by union workers who donated their time, free
helicopter rides donated by contractor Augusta Aerospace and a tent
full of food and drink provided by Metro Machine, a defense
contractor at the adjacent Naval shipbuilding yard.
</P>
<P>
   Among those to attend: California Reps. Mary Bono and Randy
''Duke'' Cunningham, Missouri Rep. Jo Anne Emerson, New York Rep.
Amo Houghton and Nebraska Rep. Lee Terry, who sat smiling on the
steps of his row house Sunday with his wife and newborn baby.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't just for fun. ''This is all about building
relationships. This is a long-term investment,'' said Charles
Pizzi, an official with the Chamber of Commerce, which helped
underwrite the effort, including a party Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Others to chip in included local Philadelphia businesses and
major defense contractors such as Litton Industries, Lockheed
Martin, Boeing and Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon is hosting his own fund-raiser, complete with
entertainment from the Mummers, a famous hometown band that marches
in the city's New Year's parade, and rock guitarist Stump Baxter of
the Doobie Brothers rock group.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman will raise a couple hundred thousand dollars for
his political action committee, CURTPAC, which he will use this
fall to try to help Republicans keep control of Congress, aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, another congressman key to military contractors,
Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, will be honored on the grounds with
a party and ''tribal feast'' with the theme of the summer TV hit
''Survivor.'' Lewis is chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee that controls defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which is helping underwrite Weldon's fund-raiser, got an
added bonus when the Pentagon agreed to ship more than 40 pieces of
its hardware to the site for congressmen to tour hands-on.
</P>
<P>
   One of those to make it -- the much-maligned MV-22 Osprey, the
Marine's newest aircraft that operates both like a helicopter and
airplane but which has had some high-profile crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it is important to support the process,'' said Boeing
Vice President Roger Krone, standing just a few feet from Weldon.
He noted his company will donate to the Democratic convention next
month in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Boeing executives and military officials get
the chance to bend congressmen's ear about business and try to
allay any concerns about the Osprey. ''The people who fly it feel
it's safe,'' Navy Lt. Commander Mike Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon makes no apologies for calling on special interests to
help pay for the makeshift accommodations for members of Congress,
noting he openly identified the contributors. He added a bipartisan
flavor by bringing Democratic congressmen and the city's Democratic
mayor to the site.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledges the event will help defense contractors,
including those who chipped in, and the Pentagon, which took the
rare step of moving its wares for display at the site.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't get members to go to military bases,'' Weldon said.
''I want them to see this.''

<HEADLINE> Spoon Invented For Unsteady Hands  </HEADLINE>
By NICK P. DIVITO
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- It was a big day for Samantha Crabtree. For
the first time in her life, the 4-year-old spoon-fed herself.
</P>
<P>
   Born with arthrogryposis, a rare occurrence where missing muscle
mass and bone deformities limit range of motion, Samantha wasn't
able to bring a spoon to her mouth without spilling.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding herself was nearly impossible -- she isn't able to bend
her elbows against the pull of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   But gravity became her greatest ally thanks to Alex Weinstein,
38, an inventor from Richmond who put a techno-twist on a very
simple device: the spoon.
</P>
<P>
   The spoon is attached to a push rod that runs through the tubing
that doubles as the handle. The scoop locks into place when it
plunges into food; then it unlocks, and a counterbalance takes over
to keep the scoop level.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who knew a spoon could be so complicated?'' the inventor said
recently as he whirled around his creation, the SteadySpoon. As he
twisted and contorted, the spoon's use of gravity and basic physics
principles kept the scoop level.
</P>
<P>
   The spill-proof spoon is ideal for children and people with
cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease or other muscular dysfunctions
that make keeping a steady hand difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The 9&AMP;frac12;-inch-long spoon weighs about 7 ounces and is too heavy
for Samantha to maneuver, so her physical therapist, Carol Elliott,
rigged it with a mounting system where the spoon sits on a pivot,
rocking back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   When Samantha first got her spoon in February, she couldn't help
showing it off, said the girl's mother, Pam Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha ''likes being able to do everything possible for
herself,'' Crabtree said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Samantha showed off her ability with her new spoon,
digging into a pudding cup at the Children's Hospital in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   After a bobbled first attempt and a dollop of vanilla pudding on
her nose, Samantha said proudly, ''I eat at home all by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Often taken for granted, the ability to feed oneself is ''the
ultimate in independence,'' said Elliott, Samantha's occupational
therapist since the girl was 5 weeks old.
</P>
<P>
   That day of independence came to Samantha on Feb. 21 when she
downed a bowl of pudding and took stabs at a bowl of water, which
served as make-believe soup.
</P>
<P>
   ''She ate like a champ,'' Elliott said. ''It was very exciting.
We watched her feed herself for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   In her 13 years as an occupational therapist, Elliott says she
has never seen an invention like the SteadySpoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always had to sit there and bend and contort spoons, and
it works for scooping but it doesn't work when it gets to their
mouth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the spoon came to Weinstein, a 1984 graduate of
Virginia Military Institute, after he struggled with an invention
he was working on for the aircraft industry. Frustrated, he turned
his ideas toward home after listening to his mother-in-law talk
about the messes that came with feeding babies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started looking for things around the house that I could
invent,'' he said. ''I found there are a lot of children and
handicapped people who are not able to feed themselves because they
didn't have the coordination or dexterity to keep the spoon
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein took a plastic spoon scoop, fitted it with PVC pipe
and attached it with strings and pulleys to a melted fishing lure
at the base. He later substituted a push rod for the pulley.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a year after being patented and marketed, 150,000
spoons have been sold globally for about $50 apiece, said Sam
Aronow, president of Handle With Care Inc., the Agoura Hills,
Calif., company distributing the spoon. Weinstein gets a royalty on
each spoon sold.
</P>
<P>
   The spoons have been sold overseas, to places like New Zealand,
Australia, Japan, Germany and England, Aronow said.
</P>
<P>
   The spoon has soothed often-hectic mealtimes for Andrew and
Catherine Elsey of Manchester, England, whose 9-year-old son,
Matthew, has severe cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Meal times have been hectic for a number of years as we have
had to juggle the feeding of (our) other three children around
Matt. In general, one of us would have to have our meal separate so
the other could feed Matt,'' Andrew Elsey wrote in an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Stories like that keep Weinstein inventing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It goes beyond money. An experience like that -- you can't buy
that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Knesset To Vote on Barak  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Two parliament votes taking place on the same
day could be the key to reversing Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
political fortunes, teetering on the brink of disaster since he
agreed to attend the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
   The Knesset on Monday was to determine Israel's next president
and also vote on a no-confidence motion brought by opponents of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Barak commands the loyalty of only 42 Knesset members. But
another 20 or so in the opposition in the 120-member unicameral
chamber have said they would not topple his government over peace
moves.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's candidate for president was a better bet. Shimon Peres,
a former prime minister who was an architect of the first interim
peace accord with the Palestinians, was favored to win the largely
ceremonial role.
</P>
<P>
   The votes come on the last day of the Knesset's summer session,
and if Barak's minority government survives the no-confidence
motion -- as it is likely to -- Barak will be free to pursue his
peace agenda unhampered by parliamentary maneuvers until October.
</P>
<P>
   That would allow Barak time to build up support for far-reaching
concessions to the Palestinians proposed at Camp David, especially
on giving them some control over East Jerusalem. Barak's readiness
to go to Camp David, Md., lost him the support of three hawkish
coalition partners and plunged him into a minority government.
</P>
<P>
   Channel Two said Peres was far ahead of the only other
contender, Moshe Katsav of the hard-line opposition Likud party.
Peres can count on 58 legislators, while Katsav has 40 backers.
</P>
<P>
   That left 22 legislators belonging to two ultra-Orthodox parties
holding the swing vote. The ultra-Orthodox have identified more
with the Likud's foreign policy in recent years, and many see the
54-year-old Katsav -- who himself is religiously observant -- as the
more sympathetic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Peres also has advantages among the ultra-Orthodox, and has
only to win three of their votes to secure the presidency. When he
was prime minister, his governments were consistently generous to
this chronically impoverished sector of Israel's society; in
addition, Peres' wife, Sonya, is herself Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Katsav's Likud party infuriated the ultra-Orthodox
last month when it opposed a bill that would enshrine into law
exemptions from the military draft for religious seminarians. At
the time, some ultra-Orthodox leader openly said Katsav had lost
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Peres would be an asset to Barak's peace agenda. Precisely
because the presidency is seen as above politics, presidential
pronouncements on matters of state carry considerable weight. In
1982, President Yitzhak Navon's hinted opposition to Israel's
Lebanon invasion was decisive in reversing support for that war.
</P>
<P>
   Peres' predecessor, Ezer Weizman, openly backed Barak's peace
initiatives, and helped earn them popular support. Weizman was
forced to resign this month after a police report concluded he may
have committed fraud and breach of trust, although it did not
recommend prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Katsav has tried to turn his resume as a gray, second-tier
minister -- he held the transport portfolio -- into an advantage,
saying he would be less ''political'' and more unifying than Barak.
''We don't need a second prime minister, we don't need a second
foreign minister,'' has been his motto.
</P>
<P>
   In public opinion polls, Peres is by far the more popular
candidate. Controversial as prime minister -- a job he assumed from
1984-86 and from 1995-96 -- the 76-year-old Nobel laureate has
assumed the mantle of elder statesman since losing the 1996
elections.

<HEADLINE> Knotts Attends High School Reunion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Even if Morgantown High School's class
of 1942 wasn't dwindling in size, actor Don Knotts would probably
still stand out.
</P>
<P>
   Knotts, best known as Barney Fife, the bumbling deputy to
Sheriff Andy Taylor in ''The Andy Griffith Show,'' joined 80 former
classmates at a reunion Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Knotts, 76, smiled and laughed with ex-classmates as they
reminisced about their high school days. The comedian, with dozens
of movies and TV programs to his credit, said he was ''a giggler
and always got people in trouble for telling jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   The 356-member class was the largest of its time, but the
turnout for the reunion was the smallest ever, alumnus Jack Feck
said. Of the graduates, 124 have died.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be the last single meeting of this type,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knotts seldom passes up a class reunion. ''It feels like I never
left,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dance Hall In Welk's Town Destroyed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRASBURG, N.D. (AP) -- Fire destroyed a historic dance hall in
bandleader Lawrence Welk's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze at the Blue Room started shortly before noon Saturday,
said Bruce Schumacher, who has co-owned the building for two years.
A cause had not been determined Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Locals disagree on whether Welk ever played the Blue Room, which
was built in the early 1900s and was the oldest building in town.
Welk, who died in 1992 at age 89, was a Saturday night staple on
television for 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Supposedly it's where (Welk) got his start; he played there as
a young boy,'' Schumacher said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the loss is ''quite devastating for the community. There
probably isn't a family in the community that hasn't had a wedding
in there or an anniversary. In some cases folks were married there,
and their kids had their receptions there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher said he is not sure whether the Blue Room will be
rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to meet with the insurance people, take a couple of
days to sort of sort out our thoughts,'' he said.

   PROVO, Utah (AP) -- A Brigham Young University student who was
suspended after appearing on MTV's ''Real World'' says the show
will prove she didn't do anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Stoffer, a business major from Delafield, Wis., was
suspended for the fall semester for breaking the school's honor
code. The Mormon university prohibits single students from living
with members of the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   Stoffer lived with four men and two other women in New Orleans
during the show's filming, which lasted five months.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Saturday, Stoffer said that to ''insinuate
that I was sleeping with a guy, or having sex, is totally false and
slanderous.''
</P>
<P>
   She said TV footage proves she didn't have sex and she can no
longer respect the school's Honor Code office.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Elected Venezuelan President  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelans endorsed President Hugo
Chavez's ''social revolution'' on Sunday by electing him to a fresh
six-year term, consolidating Latin America's second leftist regime
after Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   With 77 percent of the votes counted, 59 percent went to Chavez
and 37 percent went to his nearest challenger, former Zulia state
Gov. Francisco Arias Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrations broke out in the capital of Caracas, with fireworks
and revelers in the streets after the National Electoral Council
announced the results.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting, ''Chavez! Chavez!'', thousands of people, many of them
wearing the president's trademark red paratrooper's beret, rejoiced
inside the gates of the presidential palace in the capital,
Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day I feel more proud and more committed to you, my
brothers and my sisters,'' the president told the crowd from a
balcony draped with the Venezuelan flag, frequently breaking into
song. ''We will demonstrate to you that we are here out of love for
our people.''
</P>
<P>
   The voting was to determine the presidency, a new 165-member
unicameral legislature, governors, mayors and other offices -- all
institutions that had to be ''re-legitimized'' under a new
constitution Chavez pushed through after taking office last year.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who has completely overhauled Venezuela's institutions
during his short term, had asked voters to look past sharp rises in
crime and unemployment by re-electing him and giving his reform
movement a majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hugo, I am sure that nothing and no one can stop you now,''
Cuban President Fidel Castro told his friend Chavez in a chummy
telephone conversation Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with Chavez's overwhelming victory, he could emerge
from the voting with a weaker mandate.
</P>
<P>
   The partial results showed opposition candidates winning 10 of
Venezuela's 23 governorships.
</P>
<P>
   No results were immediately available on the congressional
races. While the president's movement was expected to win at least
a simple majority in the legislature, Chavez may fall short of the
two-thirds needed to rubber-stamp presidential appointments and
proposed laws.
</P>
<P>
   Most Venezuelans seemed to believe Chavez's promises that he
will now refocus his revolution from erasing the old political
order to what matters most to the people: jobs and personal safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''These problems can't be fixed in one day or one year,'' said
Milagros Iguerara, a 50-year-old housewife standing in line to
vote. ''He is going to need five years or eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's support among the poor majority of Venezuela's 23
million people had made him the favorite over Arias, who helped
Chavez lead a failed 1992 coup attempt but who broke away from the
president this year.
</P>
<P>
   The country's poor overwhelmingly put their faith in Chavez's
''social revolution,'' while the bulk of the middle and upper
classes, frightened by Chavez's attacks on business and his
coziness with Cuba, supported Arias.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Chavez, 46, is a testament to previous
governments' failure to provide a decent standard of living in the
world's third-largest oil-exporting country -- and a reminder that
not everyone accepts globalization and free markets as a model for
society.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people waited in lines for hours in Sunday's hot
tropical sun to cast ballots filled with dozens of candidates and
parties. The national election board ordered polling stations to
stay open an extra two hours to accommodate the crowds and to
compensate for technical glitches that delayed voting in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
   About 12 million Venezuelans were eligible to vote. The
balloting was originally set for May 28, but was postponed because
of computer difficulties in the vote-tallying system.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at a Caracas hotel late Sunday, Arias refused to
concede defeat, saying his campaign had collected election results
that differ from the official tally. He said he would provide more
details on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate vowed to ''maintain the civic struggle,'' adding:
''This country wants and seeks to live in freedom. It wants and
seeks democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Arias had said he wanted to reverse what he
calls Chavez's militarization of Venezuelan society and take a
friendlier stance with business leaders to attract foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country is not going to advance with populism, but rather
with technology,'' said Carlos Piniero, a 40-year-old businessman
who supports Arias.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, through his fiery speeches attacking a ''rancid
oligarchy,'' has rekindled hope among Venezuelans who have seen
their standard of living steadily decline over the last two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in memory, the Venezuelan economy has fallen
into recession during an oil boom: The gross domestic product
shrank by 7 percent last year despite a quadrupling of petroleum
prices. And the almost religious support Chavez enjoyed a year ago
has begun to evaporate, with polls showing his approval rating
falling from more than 80 percent when he took office to about 60
percent now.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Sunday, Chavez told the business community to
''fear no more'' and urged them to help ''save the Venezuelan
economy.''

<HEADLINE> Time Warner signs deal to open cables to first outside Net provider </HEADLINE>
By PETER SVENSSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Several days after facing scrutiny from
regulators for its planned merger with America Online Inc., Time
Warner Inc. has made its first deal to allow an independent
Internet service provider access to its cable system.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Cable was set to announce Monday a preliminary
agreement with Juno Online Services Inc. to offer high-speed
Internet service to cable customers, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Time Warner's promise to open its cable system to
competing Internet service providers is being carefully monitored
by regulators and the issue was highlighted on Thursday during
Federal Communications Commissions hearings on the Time Warner-AOL
merger.
</P>
<P>
   The merger has been criticized by NBC, ABC, and consumer groups,
who fear that the combination could result in an unfair
concentration of power.
</P>
<P>
   ''This groundbreaking agreement underscores Time Warner Cable's
commitment to offer its cable customers a choice of Internet
service providers,'' said Glenn Britt, president of Time Warner
Cable. He said the company would try to sign agreements with other
Internet service providers, or ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's regulatory hearings, FCC Chairman William Kennard
challenged AOL chairman Steve Case and Time Warner chief Gerald
Levin to offer details about when the cable systems would begin
carrying other Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said the company was working to open access by
restructuring an agreement with Road Runner LLC, a joint venture
between Time Warner and AT&AMP;T, and the only ISP currently available
to Time Warner Cable subscribers. Levin said the company is
conducting technical trials of how such a system would operate.
</P>
<P>
   Levin also issued an open invitation to any Internet provider
that wanted to talk to Time Warner about operating on the company's
cable systems, and predicted that an agreement with a separate
online service business was forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Cable and Juno said that rollout dates for the Juno
service would depend on Time Warner renegotiating its exclusive
agreement with Road Runner.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Cable has more than 12.6 million customers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Juno offers both free and paid Internet access.
It had 3 million active subscribers in March, making it the third
largest ISP after AOL and EarthLink.

<HEADLINE> Clippers Offer Job to Huggins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Los Angeles Clippers have offered their
head coaching job to University of Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins,
the school's athletic director confirmed Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins, who has turned Cincinnati into a perennial Top 25
program during his 11 years as head coach, told athletic director
Bob Goin about the offer over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   WXIX-TV in Cincinnati said the Clippers have offered a four-year
contract worth roughly $2 million per year. Goin, contacted through
a university official, declined to confirm specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins is expected to decide in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's weighing it very thoroughly,'' Goin told the television
station. ''He's talked to a lot of people he has confidence in. I
really couldn't tell you what that decision will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers would not confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bob Huggins has been and continues to be a candidate for the
Clippers' head coaching vacancy. He was in Los Angeles for an
initial meeting Friday afternoon,'' said Joe Safety, Clippers' vice
president of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins' name has been linked with various NBA coaching
vacancies since the end of the season. He denied a report earlier
this month that that Clippers owner Donald T. Sterling had
discussed the job with him.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 11, Angels 7, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Jeff Abbott and Carlos Lee hit two-run
singles in the 10th inning Sunday night as the Chicago White Sox
rallied for an 11-7 victory over the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox scored two runs in the eighth, three in the ninth
and four in the 10th in winning for just the fourth time in 11
games.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas and Magglio Ordonez opened the 10th with singles
off Al Levine (2-4), the fifth Angels pitcher, and Herbert Perry
sacrificed but reached on a fielder's choice to load the bases with
nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott and Lee followed with their hits to give the White Sox a
four-run lead and knock out Levine.
</P>
<P>
   Winner Keith Foulke (2-0), the fifth Chicago pitcher, got the
final five outs for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's Garret Anderson hit a sacrifice fly off Foulke with
one out and the bases loaded in the ninth to tie the game 7-7. Troy
Glaus then lined to third, sending the game into extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox took a 7-6 lead in the top of the inning off
Angels closer Troy Percival on a two-out, two-run double by Mark
Johnson and an RBI double by Ray Durham.
</P>
<P>
   Durham's hit was his first in six at-bats, and just Chicago's
third in 17 at-bats with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   The blown save was the eighth for Percival, who preserved 6-5
Anaheim victories the previous two days for his 24th and 25th
saves.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took a 6-2 lead by scoring three runs in the seventh
on pinch-hitter Orlando Palmeiro's suicide squeeze bunt and a
two-out, two-run triple by Tim Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox scored two unearned runs in the eighth on a
two-out error by third baseman Glaus, the fourth of five Anaheim
miscues, and a check-swing double by Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, mired in a 1-for-20 slump, blooped a two-out, RBI
double off Jim Parque in the fifth to give the Angels a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Valentin hit a solo homer in the first off Seth Etherton,
his 17th, and Chris Singleton added an RBI double in the second to
make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Bengie Molina's sacrifice fly in Anaheim's half of the second
and a solo homer by Benji Gil in the third, his second in two days
and fifth of the season, tied the game 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Parque allowed eight hits and five earned runs in 6 1-3 innings.
Etherton gave up nine hits and two runs in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Angels acquired outfielder Ron Gant from
the Philadelphia Phillies for pitcher Kent Bottenfield, the winning
pitcher in Anaheim's victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox acquired catcher Charles Johnson and designated
hitter Harold Baines from Baltimore for catcher Brook Fordyce and
three minor league pitchers Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Etherton and Parque, opposing each other in the big leagues
for the first time, were crosstown rivals in college. Etherton
(USC) beat Parque (UCLA) in their two head-to-head meetings. Glaus,
then UCLA's third baseman, homered in both games. ... Darin Erstad,
who has a big league-leading 170 hits and a .372 batting average,
hit a first-inning single to snap an 0-for-10 dry spell. He also
singled in the fifth and seventh innings, giving 56 multiple-hit
games -- tops in the majors. ... Anaheim starters combined for a
10.07 ERA in the team's previous eight games, allowing 44 runs on
75 hits in 39 1-3 innings. ... Johnson and Baines are expected to
be in uniform Tuesday night when the White Sox play at Texas.
Chicago is idle Monday. ... Gant is expected to report to the
Angels in time for Monday night's game against Detroit.

well, but that's going to change come November,'' he told a
rain-soaked rally Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly making his way to the convention, Bush is spending two
days in Ohio, which carries 21 electoral votes. He had rallies
planned Monday in Dayton and Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the convention, Bush reached out for bipartisan
support.
</P>
<P>
   ''My job is to lift the spirit of the country,'' Bush said
Sunday. ''My job is to set our spirits high. My job is to say a
united nation can achieve that which we want: to make sure people
are not left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving Austin, Texas, on Friday, Bush has been traveling
through states that voted for Clinton in the last two elections but
which GOP strategists hope to capture in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   He and wife Laura went to church Sunday and worked on their
convention speeches. Mrs. Bush addresses the convention Monday
night, during its first prime-time session.
</P>
<P>
   Between his wife's speech and one by retired Gen. Colin Powell,
Bush will make a live video presentation to convention delegates
from a school in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush had campaign stops scheduled in Charleston,
W.Va., and Harrisburg, Pa. He planned to arrive in Philadelphia,
the convention city, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Besides making one reference to ''my opponent'' Sunday during
his pitch for saving Social Security, Bush left the partisan
fireworks to others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever would have thought you would see Microsoft split up
and the Clintons still together?'' said Rep. Steve Chabot, the
second impeachment prosecutor to stump with Bush on his tour to the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cunningham, a local radio talk show host, compared Bush's
White House bid to Ronald Reagan's 1980 win against Democrat Jimmy
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's elect another governor from the West to scour out the
White House of filth and degradation. God bless America!''
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, Bush campaign spokesman, said the speakers were
''expressing their own opinions'' and that they were not
necessarily shared by Bush. ''The governor is focusing on his
agenda,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, President Clinton won Ohio, 47 percent to Bob Dole's 41
percent; 11 percent of the voters here picked Reform Party
candidate Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Four years earlier, Clinton took 42 percent to President Bush's
38 percent, while Perot received 21 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the keys to winning is reaching out to independents and
ticket-splitters,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer. ''That's one
of the reasons why Ohio is so important to Governor Bush -- it's
home to so many independent voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance Sunday was delayed by 15 minutes while medics
tended to Helen L. Geiger, 73, of Cincinnati, who collapsed at the
rally and was rushed to Bethesda North Hospital where she was
pronounced dead, Blue Ash firefighters said.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Misses GOP Convention  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- For the first time in 32 years, Pat Buchanan
is not attending the Republican National Convention. He plans to
head to the beach in Delaware for ''some writing and thinking'' --
maybe even watching a little convention coverage on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Establishment Republicans seemed relieved, though some
conservatives say the absence of Buchanan, a Reform Party
presidential candidate, leaves a void.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois said if there's much nostalgia for
Buchanan at the convention, ''I haven't seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When he left the Republican Party, he marginalized himself,''
said Hyde. ''I wish he would return to journalism and give up his
quest for the Holy Grail.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan doesn't expect too many surprises at the GOP
convention, which he says will be scripted ''like the Academy
Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sort of a Muzak convention,'' Buchanan said in an
interview with The Associated Press. ''The ones we went to were
rock 'n roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has been to conventions as a young aide to Richard
Nixon, an aide to Ronald Reagan, a conservative commentator and for
the last two conventions as a feisty challenger for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservatives said they will miss him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really sad,'' said Buchanan enthusiast Sharon Kray of
Athena, Ore. ''He added a sparkle to the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said conventions should have some surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ''My old belief is that conventions are a place where people and
parties come together to argue over ideas and issues and agendas,''
he said. ''That is the kind of politics I love, the passion of
ideas and conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's their party now. It's who they are and what they want
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   When he failed to gain traction against well-heeled opponents
like Steve Forbes and George W. Bush, the likely nominee, Buchanan
switched to the Reform Party and is involved in a power struggle to
remain on its ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the most conservative wing of the GOP acknowledge
Buchanan's absence gave Bush the freedom to mold this convention in
a centrist image.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have to be happy he isn't here,'' conservative activist
Paul Weyrich said. ''He was red meat for the conservative
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's most memorable moment at the Republican National
Convention came in 1992 when he gave a fiery speech on opening
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what conventions are all about,'' said Phyllis
Schlafly, a veteran conservative activist and president of the
Republican National Coalition for Life. ''Where are the exciting
speakers? We need some excitement in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to have quite a few nobodies as speakers, plain
people,'' she said, referring to plans to have a diverse set of
ordinary Americans speak at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's 1992 speech drew a clear line about the division
between conservatives and their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul
of America,'' he told the cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats immediately jumped on the reference to ''a religious
war'' and some Republicans later said the speech hurt President
Bush's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Buchanan wasn't given a prominent role at the
convention that nominated Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our people were treated horribly,'' Buchanan said. ''When you
walk into a convention with 200 delegates and 3 million votes, you
should be treated as part of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Many here say the 2000 convention -- and the Republican Party --
is not about Pat Buchanan any more.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is ''not in the equation,'' said Andrea Sheldon
Laffery, executive director of the Traditional Values Coalition, a
group representing evangelical interests. ''The issue here is
George W. Bush and the Clinton-Gore record.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, the Rev. Lou Sheldon, said GOP sentiment for
Buchanan has about disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason that Pat Buchanan is fading is that a greater than
Buchanan has arisen,'' he said, referring to the joy conservatives
felt when Bush named conservative Dick Cheney to the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Buchanan's presence would be good for Bush in the fall
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Buchanan were here, there would be creative tension,''
Weyrich said. ''The Bush people would be worried about what he
would say or do.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like firebrand politics. This is dull.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Family Warms the Stage  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Slow to embrace the political spotlight,
Laura Bush will move to center stage Monday to symbolically open
the Republican National Convention for her husband, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The prime-time address will bring the reserved former librarian
front and center before an audience of millions, and serve as the
bookend to Bush's closing speech Thursday, when he accepts his
party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks will focus on literacy, an issue central to her
private life as a teacher and which she has championed from the
governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush's pivotal role in launching the four-day convention
reflects her own journey, even as she accompanied Bush down a
winding political path.
</P>
<P>
   When they married in 1977, Bush promised that she would never
have to make a political speech. Then, in no time flat, Bush
mounted a losing bid for Congress and his wife was called on to
address the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   He often jokes that it's the only political promise he ever
broke.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Sunday in Ohio, Bush proudly noted his wife's
presence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Guess who's kicking off the convention tomorrow?'' he teased.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's two gubernatorial campaigns and his presidential bid each
drew a cautious response from his wife, who feared exposing herself
and their twin daughters -- now age 18 and college-bound around
Labor Day -- to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was the last person on board,'' she told The Associated
Press earlier this year about her husband's White House bid.
</P>
<P>
   But she has increasingly stepped out on her own, giving
interviews and stumping on her own for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   As first lady of Texas, her causes have mirrored her interests.
She has coordinated an annual book festival to help Texas authors
and raise money for libraries. She has said she will continue those
pursuits if her husband wins.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, Mrs. Bush will be feted at a luncheon by the
Federation of American Women where, in a twist, the Texas governor
will be one of the featured speakers on behalf of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush is not the only relative taking up the mantle here
until Bush arrives here at the convention on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, will be ''very actively
engaged as a surrogate speaker,'' said convention Chairman Andrew
Card.
</P>
<P>
   And Jeb's son, George P. Bush, plans to be visible this week.
His string of convention-related appearances ends with a floor
speech Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Though not fully bilingual -- his mother Columba is Mexican --
George P. said his speech would ''be peppered with phrases in
Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old is viewed as a lightning rod to help attract
young and Hispanic voters. On Sunday, he greeted youth activists
painting signs for the gathering and attended a clean-up project in
a park across from the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I consider myself a minor player in the whole process,'' the
younger Bush said. He said he's using the opportunity ''to add a
personal touch to politics,'' by touring the country on behalf of
his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   His prominence in the campaign is in marked contrast to Bush's
twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, who have kept a low profile
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   They ''will not have much of a public schedule during the
convention,'' Card said, although they will be on hand for each of
their parents' speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's other siblings also expected to attend the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Doro, his sister and wife of a Washington lobbyist, plans to
help ''energize the delegates and volunteers,'' Bush spokesman Ray
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Neil, a business consultant, and Marvin, a venture
capitalist, are expected to be part of a pool of activists who will
speak daily to state delegations, according to Card, the convention
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush will be saluted Tuesday night during a
tribute to past GOP presidents, but is unlikely to make any formal
remarks. He and former first lady Barbara Bush are expected to
avoid the spotlight this week.

<HEADLINE> GOP Platform Light on Attack  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Republicans ratify a statement of policy
principles Monday oddly lacking in that staple of political
discourse -- attacks on the other guy.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to a Democratic platform cast in the tradition of
slamming the opposition while tooting your own horn, the Republican
one toots and toots.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Republicans mentioned President Clinton 153
times in their platform, seeming to spend as much time going after
him as promoting their own candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In the new GOP platform, Al Gore is named twice. And that was by
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Word went out to platform writers: Keep Clinton and Gore out.
Make it about what candidate George W. Bush and his Republicans
have in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very conscious decision,'' said Ginny Wolfe, speaking
for the Republican National Committee on the eve of the party's
convention. ''This is a document that is about what we want to do
with the future. It's not about the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats did not hesitate to take on Bush by name in the
document they approved in Cleveland on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Their platform is suffused with criticism of Republicans in
general, and major policy areas have something biting about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they link him with the Republican whose name they most
like to use, a former House speaker gone from politics but not
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Bush tax slash ... is bigger than any cut Newt Gingrich
ever dreamed of,'' the Democratic platform says. ''It would let the
richest one per cent of Americans afford a new sports car and
middle class Americans afford a warm soda.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic platform does not measure up to the
Republican one of 1996 when it comes to being preoccupied with the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans that year introduced Clinton in their own preamble
and went on to call him things like ''master of excuse and
evasion'' and attack ''Clintoncare'' -- his old health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   They slammed ''Bill Clinton's tax bill of 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's platform refers only to the no-name ''largest tax
hike in history in 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism is made here and there of the ''current''
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates on the GOP platform committee sometimes struggled for
words that would make the point about supposed Democratic sins
without naming the sinners.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know we don't want to say 'Clinton-Gore,''' delegate Ellen
Williams of Kentucky mused as she reviewed a draft.
</P>
<P>
   The platform that delegates settled on during the weekend
showcases Bush's centrist-sounding agenda while yielding to social
conservatives on the abortion and family issues they care about
most.
</P>
<P>
   But habit dies hard and the effort to ignore the Democratic
presidential candidate and the president fell just a bit short.
</P>
<P>
   In rushed language on defense, there's an errant slap at Clinton
for a ''kowtow'' to China. Gore is mentioned twice in a critical
reference to his security agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The words made it past a subcommittee and the full platform
committee even as GOP officials boasted about the fruits of the
party's forward-looking, self-defining and Gore-free labors.
</P>
<P>
   Unless they can find a last-minute way to reopen a done
document, the wayward language will remain.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is some limit to candidate Gore's new agenda for
America as global social worker,'' the passage concludes, ''he has
yet to define it.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Tries To Woo Young Voters  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- James Cortez is just the kind of voter John
McCain is trying to bring to the Republican Party -- young, Hispanic
and enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Cortez, 21, got the Arizona' senator's autograph
after traveling from San Diego to the Republican convention with a
group of other young Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   He says McCain appealed to his generation in part by comparing
himself to Luke Skywalker -- hero of the original ''Star Wars''
films.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was the coolest thing!'' Cortez said. ''It said,
'Hey, I'm not above you, I'm on your level.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is trying to get other young Americans to think that
voting Republican is the coolest thing. He planned to speak Monday
to MTV correspondent John Norris at the Hard Rock Cafe. And he was
to join Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts to talk up plans for a bus tour to
campaign for congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain often says that fighting the cynicism and lack of
political participation of young people is one of his main goals,
and one reason he has worked hard to cut the influence of money in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many Americans, particularly the young, can't see beyond the
veil of cynicism and indifference,'' McCain said Sunday in a speech
to a ''shadow convention'' organized by political reform activists.
''They can't imagine themselves as part of a cause greater than
their self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   That cause, McCain now says, should include electing Texas Gov.
George W. Bush president. McCain on Sunday asked the delegates he
won in last winter's primaries to vote for Bush, saying the nation
doesn't like ''sore losers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I need every one of you to give this campaign the same amount
of enthusiasm and participation you did for our primary campaign,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates groaned when he said he was releasing them to
Bush, and several said they would not support the Texan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I can vote in good conscience for Bush. I think
he's sending the wrong message,'' said James Manning, a McCain
delegate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, loudly cheered, told his delegates, ''You have our
eternal gratitude.'' He choked up with emotion, his eyes
glistening, as he thanked his political supporters for ''a good
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain won about 240 convention delegates before ending his
campaign under the weight of Bush's bigger victories in March. Much
of McCain's support had come from moderate Republicans,
independents and ticket-switching Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 of his delegates had been replaced by Bush loyalists,
and many among the 170 or so he had left had said they would fall
in line behind the victor.
</P>
<P>
   ''John McCain is a great candidate,'' said Connecticut delegate
Benjamin Davol. ''But George Bush is our standard bearer and it is
time to rally behind our nominee and get going.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Roll Out Negative TV Ads  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Democrats were set to unveil a new TV ad
going after George W. Bush and his running mate for a second time
in two days as they try to steal some of the Republican media
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the ad targeted running mate Dick Cheney for his
conservative voting record in Congress. On Monday, the attack will
hit Bush himself, probably his environmental record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The ads come as Republicans open their national convention, a
made-for-TV show sure to show Bush and his party in the best
possible light.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an unwritten rule against attack ads during the opposing
convention, the Democratic National Committee launched its first
negative spot in what is sure to be a hard-fought, sharply critical
TV ad war.
</P>
<P>
   The ads will air in 17 battleground states and cost more than
$3.5 million over the next week -- about a million more than the DNC
has been spending weekly.
</P>
<P>
   They come as some national polls show Bush widening his lead
over Vice President Al Gore, although others show the race is
tight. Democrats desperately want to contain any bounce Bush may
get from the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The blitz begins with an ad about Cheney, but Democratic
officials said new ads about Bush's record will soon replace or
crowd out the Cheney spot.
</P>
<P>
   A third ad is set for release Tuesday, probably about health
insurance. And other critical spots may be rolled out later this
week.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the same aggressive strategy, Democrats launched a
new horror-themed Web site, blasting Bush's record in Texas. They
bussed Texas Democrats to Philadelphia on Sunday to criticize life
under Bush. And they were importing a daily lineup of Congress
members and governors to counter the Republican show.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just going to correct his record as the infomercial
rolls on,'' said DNC Chairman Ed Rendell, referring to Cheney.
''These are the facts. If the truth hurts, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee had planned to respond with
negative ads of its own as soon as the DNC, which has been running
pro-Gore spots since early June, changed its tune.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Republican official said the RNC will not return
fire because the Bush campaign doesn't want anything to mar a
convention designed to be upbeat and feel-good.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans agreed with the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a positive, inclusive message we're putting out,''
said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif. ''We've made a decision not to go
into attack mode.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP officials will on their response next week after polls
indicate whether the DNC spots hurt Bush, the senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans painted the new ads as a sign of Democratic
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ''To go this negative, this early, in the middle of someone
else's convention, is a sign of how attack-oriented they are
willing to be,'' Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheney ad focuses on his votes against the Clean Water Act,
Head Start funding and the school lunch program. It also mentions
his position as executive of an oil services company, advocating
less oil production so gas prices could rise.
</P>
<P>
   ''What does Cheney's record say about their plans?'' the ad
asks.
</P>
<P>
   But while much is made of a campaign's decision to ''go
negative,'' voters are unlikely to mind a commercial like this, ad
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've become so accustomed to a permanent campaign, I don't
think anybody's going to be offended,'' said Kathleen Jamieson,
dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of
Pennsylvania. ''In my judgment, it's a smart, strategic move.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Benoit, who studies political advertising at the University
of Missouri, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The backlash will come from Republicans and conservatives,''
he said. ''It won't come from the people they're trying to
persuade.''
</P>
<P>
   The DNC ads are airing in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland (aimed at viewers in
Delaware), Michigan, Missouri, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Oregon, Wisconsin and Washington state.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Brokerage Massacre Remembered  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR, Ga. (AP) -- It's been a painful year for the families
and friends of the nine people killed last summer at two Atlanta
brokerage offices.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them came together to share their experiences at a
memorial service in a suburban Atlanta church Sunday, a year and a
day after former trader Mark Barton began firing randomly through
All-Tech Investment Group's trading office.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Webb, whose brother Scott Webb was killed July 29, 1999,
said she decided to visit the building where her brother traded and
died. But it didn't ease her grief, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It never leaves,'' Webb said after the service, wiping tears
from her eyes. ''It never goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   The service was organized by Dr. Gulshan Harjee, whose husband
was killed in Barton's spree at All-Tech and Momentum Securities.
Harjee said she hoped the service might allow victims' families to
visit and offer each other solace.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Barton, who had reportedly lost more than $400,000
from his investments, killed his wife and two young children the
day before his rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The three -- Leigh Ann Barton, and her children, Matthew and
Michelle -- were included in the service bulletin, and a candle for
each victim was lighted at the front of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the shooting, Barton fatally shot himself when
police stopped his minivan at a convenience store northwest of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The incident has prompted close public scrutiny of the industry,
in which people rapidly buy and sell shares electronically, hoping
to profit from the market's slight price swings.
</P>
<P>
   Victims and their relatives also have filed 10 lawsuits in the
past year, naming as defendants the brokerages, their landlords,
their security firms and Barton's estate.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, the focus remained the pain of loss and the search
for strength coping with it. About 2,000 people attended the
ecumenical service at The Cathedral at Chapel Hill, an
interdenominational church.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes survival depends on our ability to cry, to feel the
hurt,'' said Archbishop Earl Paulk, the church's founder, urging
the families to strive for a ''sense of forgiveness'' even if they
consider Barton's actions unforgivable.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, ''it's no longer who was wrong, it's no longer who
made the mistake, it's about how we deal with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For some at the service, dealing with it is almost a full-time
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every single day, it's a reminder. Every single day,'' said
Shala Havash, whose brother, Jamshid Havash, was killed. ''I can't
forget that day.''

<HEADLINE> Corrupt Chinese Official Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China sentenced a senior official to death Monday
for bribery in a high-level prosecution aimed at reducing public
anger over corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng Kejie and his mistress amassed nearly $5 million in
bribes, the largest amount ever divulged by the government. He
would be the most senior official executed in a yearslong campaign
against corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng, 66, a former deputy chairman of the national legislature,
was convicted of accepting the bribes while he headed a poor
southern province, the official Xinhua News Agency said in
announcing his sentence by the No. 1 Intermediate People's Court in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng has 10 days to appeal but Xinhua did not say if he would
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Pervasive graft and a string of large corruption and smuggling
scandals involving government, police and army officials have badly
damaged public acceptance of the communist party's half-century in
power.
</P>
<P>
   To restore their image, Chinese leaders have announced a series
of punishments against senior officials, breaking with the party's
traditional penchant for secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Party investigators found that Cheng took kickbacks to approve
building projects, promotions and commodity deals, plotting with
his mistress to amass a fortune for their future marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng was expelled from the party and dismissed as vice chairman
of the national legislature in April. A party spokesman blamed his
downfall on the ''temptations of women and money.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheng's ill-gotten gains far surpasses the $850,000 in illegal
earnings for which a deputy provincial governor was put to death in
March, the highest-ranked corrupt official executed to date.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese and party functionaries believe Beijing is really
using the anti-corruption campaign to settle scores with officials
now in disfavor.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng's case is said to have tainted Li Peng, the party's No. 2
leader and head of the national legislature. Cheng was caught in a
widening investigation into smuggling, kickbacks and other
corruption in Guangxi, a poor southern region whose rugged coast is
a haven for smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng, a member of China's Zhuang ethnic minority, headed
Guangxi's government from 1990-98 and was its deputy Communist
Party secretary.

<HEADLINE> Activists Gather on Convention Eve  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Police say they are willing to ''bend over
backward'' to accommodate peaceful protests around the Republican
convention, but demonstrators say they are willing to go to jail
for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   A homeless march, which did not receive a city permit, was
planned at midday Monday, and both police and protesters expect it
to feature arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizer Cheri Honkala, director of the Kensington
Welfare Rights Union, said up to 5,000 people will march to the
First Union Center where they plan a large-scale civil
disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got this one moment in time to demonstrate to people in
this country and around the world that this is how serious we are
about raising these issues of homelessness and poverty in this
city. People are willing to go to jail to raise those issues,''
Honkala said.
</P>
<P>
   Protests this weekend were mostly peaceful with little need for
police action.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're willing to bend over backward, only to a point though,''
police commissioner John Timoney said. ''What can you do when they
say, 'We're taking to the streets? We're going to march, we're
going to disrupt the convention.' Well, that's not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, a festival atmosphere prevailed at the Unity 2000 rally,
which police say drew up to 5,000 people. Protesters listened to
musicians and inspirational speakers, as they marched and danced
through downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported few incidents and no arrests. So far, the
rallies have lacked the confrontation of the protests last fall in
Seattle at the World Trade Organization meetings, which featured
about 50,000 people and resulted in millions of dollars in property
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today was about showing solidarity in a peaceful way, showing
we can live the message we are preaching,'' said Margaret Richards,
a member of the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's parade, protesters held an afternoon rally near
the Philadelphia Museum of Art and listened to speakers including
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and National Organization of Women
Executive Director Patricia Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The few confrontations over the weekend illustrated police's
willingness to allow protesters leeway.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not going to push things to a confrontation unless we
have to,'' said Capt. William Fisher, who got into a shouting match
with an abortion rights activist Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Face flushed red, Fisher stood chest to chest with the protester
and told him that the group's permit only covered a block down the
street. But after the argument, about 30 police who had clustered
across the street backed down, allowing the protesters to remain.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said the weekend freebies would not continue
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's Sunday, we're in a very forgiving mood. We're not going
to be as forgiving in Monday morning traffic,'' Timoney said.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters said conflicts with police this week were
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just concentrate on doing what we have to do to get our
message out,'' said David Cartney, 19, who marched with 11 other
self-proclaimed anarchists Sunday. ''The police are going to arrest
whoever they want to arrest and beat up whoever they want to beat
up.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji Resorts Feel Political Pinch  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   YUNACA ISLAND, Fiji (AP) -- The local women wade from the beach
across the narrow strait to the mainland, breaking into harmony as
they drag their nets of shells and crabs, some swimming with slow,
easy strokes when the water, shimmering gold and crimson from the
sunset, reaches chest high.
</P>
<P>
   No tourists witness this perfect moment. The chaise lounges by
the pricey private bungalows known as bures sit empty, as do entire
wings of the 436-room Shangri-La's Fijian Resort during what should
be the prime weeks of high season.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji, a South Pacific archipelago described as ''paradise'' in
brochure after brochure, is suffering -- not from the typhoons that
are the usual hazard, but from a prolonged political crisis that
has set the tourism industry back by years.
</P>
<P>
   Want a great deal? This is the place. But Australia, New Zealand
and the United States have advised their citizens to stay away out
of concerns that a recent wave of civil disturbances could begin
anew at any time. Hotels report occupancy rates in single-figure
percentages.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have 109 acres, and when we're 80 percent full, it can
still look empty,'' said Wolf-Dieter Flecker, general manager of
the Fijian Resort. ''You can imagine what it's like in the single
digits.''
</P>
<P>
   Some resorts closed right after the May 19 coup led by rebel
leader George Speight. Others struggled along, selling the fact
that two coups in 1987 did not touch the resorts because of an
unwritten hands-off policy toward tourists. It looked like just
another internal political affair again this time.
</P>
<P>
   But the crisis dragged on, with Speight and his men holding the
prime minister and other legislators hostage in Parliament for
nearly two months.
</P>
<P>
   Largely peaceful civil disturbances broke out in early July,
orchestrated by Speight and his backers to bolster their stated
cause of guaranteeing the rights of indigenous Fijians take
precedence over those of ethnic Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover of the hydroelectric power dam has left the main
island of Vanua Levu dependent on expensive diesel turbines.
Protesters took over a military barracks and began occupying police
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Then, everything took a strong turn for the worst on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   It was ''Children's Week'' at Turtle Island, one of the toniest
resorts, where bures go for up to $1,000 a night. Its perfect
beaches had drawn film crews here to film both versions of the
movie ''Blue Lagoon.'' American Richard Evanson bought the island
in 1972 and turned it into a five-star destination.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 Americans, Australians, New Zealanders and Britons were
staying there, including a dozen kids, when the armed men from a
nearby island came ashore and told them to stay inside, claiming
the island belonged to them.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists were allowed to leave the next day. Evanson was
kept until he negotiated a deal to pay for distress caused to the
locals, even though they admitted Evanson had bought the land
properly. But the damage was done, and three other resorts were
taken over the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Americans normally arrive every week for honeymoons
or other vacations, primarily on the northern island of Viti Levu
or the islets off its coasts. Viti Levu has seen its share of the
recent unrest, with two New Zealand pilots taken hostage Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Though no tourists were involved, word of the wave of
occupations got worldwide exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The Tourism Action Group, largely funded by the hotels, plans to
launch a multimillion-dollar tourism campaign once the crisis is
finally settled. But the general consensus is that the fallout will
be worse and longer than two years than from the 1987 coups.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people already have lost their tourism jobs;
many others are scraping by on reduced shifts. International
sanctions have begun and are likely to keep hitting Fiji unless it
makes moves to restore democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Fijian Resort normally would have added 150-180 seasonal
workers to its 441 permanent staff. None were hired this year, and
the regular staffers were cut back in late July to 24-hour weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Just about the only guests are regular visitors to the
family-oriented resort.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese, who normally make up 14 percent of the resort's
occupants, stopped coming the day of the coup, Flecker said. A few
Australians and a handful of New Zealanders and Europeans are the
sole residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once we get out of the news, it will help,'' Flecker said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the long crisis has been a boon for one hotel, the
Centra. Its location just on the edge of downtown Suva, the
capital, drew the dozens of foreign journalists who flocked to Fiji
on near-empty flights as tourists fled on full ones.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Reconsiders Congress Votes  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Dick Cheney is defending his voting record
amid attacks from Democrats, saying his votes for ''the policies of
Ronald Reagan'' were among his best achievements in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But George Bush's pick for vice president acknowledged that as
times have changed so have his views and he'd probably support
funding for Head Start and vote for the Equal Rights Amendment --
things he opposed back in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Greeted by a cheering crowd of several hundred supporters upon
his arrival at the Republican National Convention, Cheney played up
his experience as both a seasoned Washington insider and corporate
executive who has ''been out in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasted no time taking on the issue of his voting record in a
short speech, underscoring how GOP-friendly it was. He didn't
mention votes against a resolution to free Nelson Mandela and a ban
on ''cop-killer'' bullets -- all under attack by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things I feel best about ... is my record voting
for smaller government, lower taxes ... the policies of Ronald
Reagan,'' said Cheney, whose wife, Lynne, and daughter, Mary,
accompanied him to the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a former House member from Wyoming who was secretary of
defense in the Bush administration, was scheduled to attend a
breakfast honoring Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer on Monday. He also
planned to attend convention sessions and work on his acceptance
speech, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are focusing on Cheney's votes against the school
lunch program, Head Start and the Clean Air Act in TV ads that
started airing in 17 battleground states Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''What does Cheney's record say about their plans?'' the ad
asks. ''What are their plans for working families?''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday talk shows, Cheney said, ''I might find a couple I
would do differently'' if he had to vote on the same issues today.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would support funding for Head Start, consider a ban
on cop killer bullets and support the Equal Rights Amendment with
modifications.
</P>
<P>
   He defended his vote on Mandela, saying his political party was
viewed as a terrorist organization that has ''mellowed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign issued a point-by-point rebuttal of the ad,
saying Cheney did support a bill that increased funding for Head
Start in 1982 and opposed other bills because he thought it was
more important to deal with the government's huge budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   While he spoke proudly of his 25 years as a Washington insider,
Cheney attempted to distance himself from the political arena in
Washington and praised states for being at the root of the nation's
economic success.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get out there and look back at Washington, you
frequently end up scratching your head,'' said Cheney, who will
leave his post as chief executive officer of the oil services firm
Halliburton Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said he and Bush would unite the Republican Party and
''reach out across the aisle'' to conservative Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what we're trying to do ...'' he said, stumbling on the
year, ''with the 19, excuse me, the 2000 campaign -- that's right,
it's the 21st century.''

<HEADLINE> Koreas To Reopen Border Liaisons  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Taking a major step toward
reconciliation, North and South Korea agreed Monday to reopen
border liaison offices and reconnect a railway linking their
capitals that has been cut for 55 years by their heavily armed
border.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators in the Cabinet-level talks also agreed to hold
regular high-level talks to implement an accord reached at a
historic summit of their leaders in June.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first step we've taken is very good,'' said chief North
Korean delegate Jon Kum Jin. ''We've demonstrated that if we muster
our strength and wisdom, we can make a big achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's chief negotiator Park Jae-kyu hailed the progress,
saying that his government ''will make its utmost efforts to carry
through with the historic agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   The five North Korean delegates later met President Kim Dae-jung
and inspected a semiconductor plant.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's agreements, announced in a joint communique, came amid
a conciliatory mood fueled by the first-ever summit of leaders of
the Koreas in Pyongyang, the North's capital, on June 13-15.
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting, Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong
Il agreed to work together to bring peace to their divided
peninsula, the world's last Cold War frontier. They also said they
hoped to prepare the way for reunification, a process that could
take years or even decades.
</P>
<P>
   The next round of the Cabinet-level talks will be held in the
North's capital, Pyongyang, on Aug. 29-31, the joint statement from
this weekend's talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement had no mention of military and security issues,
although South Korea had hoped to discuss opening a military
hotline. Seoul officials said such issues will be discussed at the
next rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also had no mention of a proposed visit to Seoul
by North Korea's Kim Jong Il. But the North Korean chief delegate,
Jon, said his leader ''always keeps a promise he makes.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides instead focused on economic and less sensitive
issues, agreeing to reopen the liaison offices at the border
village of Panmunjom on Aug. 15. The offices, which serve as a
permanent channel of government dialogue, were shut down in 1996
because of political tension after a four-year run.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed to reconnect a rail line that links Seoul to
Pyongyang, then continues on to Shinuiju, a major city on the
North's border with China. That line has been cut since the 1945
division of the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Talks on reconnecting the rail line will begin at an earliest
possible date, the statement said. South Korean nationals cannot
enter the North, but the line would give South Korea a link to
Russia's trans-Siberian railway, through which Seoul hopes to ship
products to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the historic summit, the Koreas will hold festive
unification-related programs for a week around Aug. 15, the date of
Korean independence from Japanese colonialism in 1945, the
negotiators in Seoul announced.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Koreas also plan to exchange 100 people each for
temporary family reunions, the first since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas have been bitter enemies since the division of their
peninsula into the communist North and the pro-Western South in
1945. Their three-year war in the early 1950s ended without a peace
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a senior North Korean delegation visited Seoul was
in 1992, when the prime ministers of the two sides visited each
other's capital for reconciliation talks. Those negotiations were
overshadowed by political tension.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's Kim Dae-jung has said reunification could take two
or three decades and has warned his military to stay on alert in
close cooperation with the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed in his
country.
</P>
<P>
   The North's missile programs are a source of great concern in
the region and are a major reason for Washington's decision to
consider whether to build a national missile defense system.

<HEADLINE> Va. Black Republican Tells His Story  </HEADLINE>
By BOB LEWIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Paul Harris will tell anyone willing to
listen why he joined the GOP and how he became the first black
Republican in the Virginia Legislature since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, he gets a chance to tell the nation.
</P>
<P>
   For about three minutes on the opening night of the Republican
National Convention, Harris, 36, will discuss his ascent from
public housing to the General Assembly seat once held by Thomas
Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't have two pennies to rub together back then,'' Harris
said. ''What we did have, though, was a sense of community. I'd
come home and see a brown paper bag on the doorstep filled with
canned food, and we'd go to church and people would give us
hand-me-down clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris' story fits well into George W. Bush's message of
''compassionate conservatism,'' and Republicans think he can help
them reach out to minority voters across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' mother was an unwed teen-ager when he was born. She
shunned welfare and worked two jobs in their hometown of
Charlottesville.
</P>
<P>
   At 11, Harris began delivering newspapers to help out. His
academics earned him two scholarships to Hampton University.
</P>
<P>
   ''Up till then, I didn't know what a Republican was. Everyone I
knew was a Democrat. I thought Republicans had horns and a pointed
tail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His antipathy toward taxes and his insistence that welfare
recipients should have to work caught the attention of a professor
who gave him books about the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was first elected in 1997, and he won a second term last
year as the GOP won its first Virginia House majority.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is helping guide the U.S. Senate campaign of former Gov.
George Allen, traveling the state helping raise the GOP's profile
among black voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paul is an inspiration to everybody in this party, not just
black people,'' said Tucker Watkins, the party chairman for the
district. ''When you listen to his message, it just strikes a
chord.''

   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelans endorsed President Hugo Chavez's
''social revolution'' on Sunday by electing him to a fresh six-year term,
consolidating Latin America's second leftist regime after Cuba. With 77 percent
of the votes counted, 59 percent went to Chavez and 37 percent went to his

Celebrations broke out in the capital of Caracas, with fireworks and revelers in

the key to reversing Prime Minister Ehud Barak's political fortunes, teetering
on the brink of disaster since he agreed to attend the Camp David summit. The
Knesset on Monday was to determine Israel's next president and also vote on a
no-confidence motion brought by opponents of the peace process. Barak commands

Boomer Battle May Not Draw Boomers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aging baby boomers, for the first time, will have two of
their own to choose from in this fall's presidential election, but analysts
caution that it may not be enough to lure a generation once known for political
protests. Census Bureau projections being released Monday show that the number
of Americans ages 45 to 64 has increased from 54.3 million in 1996 to 61.9
million this year, a 14 percent jump. Baby boomers are generally classified as
those born between 1946 and 1964, meaning the oldest ''boomers'' will be 54 this
year.

Concorde Makes Emergency Stop
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A British Airways Concorde flying from London to New York had
to make an emergency stop Sunday in eastern Canada after a crew member smelled
gasoline in the cabin, the airline said. The 57 passengers, who included singer
Tony Bennett and guitarist George Benson, were told midway across the Atlantic
that the supersonic jet would have to be diverted -- giving them a scare in the
wake of Tuesday's crash of an Air France Concorde. Emergency vehicles were on
alert as the Concorde Flight 003 descended into the Gander, Newfoundland,
airport but the landing went without incident, the Canadian Transportation
Ministry said. Earlier Sunday, another Concorde was unable to take off from
Heathrow because of a refueling problem, the airline said.

<HEADLINE> BA Concorde Makes Emergency Landing  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLINE RNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A British Airways Concorde flying from London to
New York had to make an emergency stop Sunday in eastern Canada
after a crew member smelled gasoline in the cabin, the airline
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 57 passengers, who included singer Tony Bennett and
guitarist George Benson, were told midway across the Atlantic that
the supersonic jet would have to be diverted -- giving them a scare
in the wake of Tuesday's crash of an Air France Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency vehicles were on alert as the Concorde Flight 003
descended into the Gander, Newfoundland, airport but the landing
went without incident, the Canadian Transportation Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second problem with one of British Airways'
supersonic luxury jets Sunday and the third in two days -- all after
the Air France Concorde crashed Tuesday outside Paris, killing 114
people.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the weekend's incidents, British Airways expected to
continue operating regular service out of London and New York on
Monday, Moore said. ''We wouldn't be flying unless we thought it
was safe,'' she said. The airline briefly halted its flights by its
seven Concordes after the Air France crash, but resumed them
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's diversion of Flight 003 was ''purely a precautionary
measure,'' British Airways spokeswoman Jemma Moore in London said.
''The captain became aware of a smell at rear of the cabin, and we
never take any chances.''
</P>
<P>
   When the announcement of the emergency stop was made,
''considering the Paris crash, of course quite a lot of passengers
got quite nervous and quite upset,'' passenger Jostein Svendsen, a
Norwegian businessman, told the British Broadcasting Corp. ''But it
wasn't full panic, as you may expect.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight, scheduled to fly from London's Heathrow airport to
New York's John F. Kennedy airport, was grounded in Gander pending
safety checks. The airline chartered a Boeing 737 that left early
Monday morning to take the 57 passengers to New York.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways engineers from New York were being flown in late
Sunday to inspect the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, another Concorde was unable to take off from
Heathrow because of a refueling problem, the airline said. That
flight to New York, scheduled to depart at 10:30 a.m., was delayed
for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers were put onto another Concorde, which arrived safely
in New York, spokeswoman Moore said. The airline called the
procedure ''standard.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday evening, fire trucks and ambulances were put on
standby at Heathrow after a Concorde flight from New York to London
experienced a mixture of fuel and air in the engine. A loud bang
was heard inside the jet, which was ''something like an engine
backfiring,'' a British Airways' spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Air France grounded its fleet of five remaining Concordes after
Tuesday's tragic crash. British Airways briefly halted flights by
its seven Concordes, but resumed them Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   French investigators have been looking into the theory that a
burst tire on the plane's undercarriage could have damaged the
plane near the engines, causing a fire. Expert said Sunday that
flames spewing from the back of the plane were likely caused by a
major fuel leak.
</P>
<P>
   Air France Flight 4590 went down Tuesday minutes after takeoff
when the jet crashed in a ball of flames into a small hotel in the
town of Gonesse, near Charles de Gaulle airport. All 109 people on
board were killed and five bystanders died on the ground.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Hunters Track Storms  </HEADLINE>
By SHELIA HARDWELL RD
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- Technical Sgt. Scott Persinger describes
one of nature's most destructive wind-driven beasts as ''absolutely
gorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Persinger's job requires him to get a closer view of
hurricanes than the average person.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, known
as Hurricane Hunters, Persinger flies into the eye of the always
destructive, sometimes deadly storms.
</P>
<P>
   His mission: obtain information that pinpoints the storm's
location and shows the direction it's moving.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we have a storm threatening land, we couldn't do our job
properly without them,'' said James Franklin, a hurricane
specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Since hurricane season began June 1, there have been few storms
to observe, and Persinger is missing the thrill he gets as he flies
through a cloud wall.
</P>
<P>
   ''My first storm was Hurricane Hugo. I was real anxious to get
in and fly it. After I did it the first time, I just loved it,''
Persinger said of the 1989 hurricane. ''You get inside the eye of
the storm and it's absolutely gorgeous. You look straight up and
you see beautiful, blue sky.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also aware of a storm's ability to turn cities and towns
into rubble. His squadron was the first to land with supplies on
the Caribbean island of Antigua after it was struck in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw houses that used to be on a hilltop on one side of the
runway that were now on the other side of the runway,'' Persinger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Persinger, 35, is one of about 120 reservists who track
hurricanes in the Air Force's WC-130Hs. Their work helps save lives
as well as federal and private dollars. Studies show a typical
hurricane warning costs nearly $1 million a mile. The squadron's
data help improve the forecast accuracy by about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the human factor is even better than technology.
Franklin said his agency relies heavily on satellites, but the
information is not as precise that provided by the hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing we can see from satellite technology that can
replace the reconnaissance aircraft -- not for the next 10 years or
so,'' Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Hunters, based at Keesler Air Force Base for the past
27 years, was first activated in 1944 as the 30th Weather
Reconnaissance Squadron at Gander, Newfoundland. Since that time,
the operation has been shuffled from base to base, and had its
number of active personnel reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the squadron members are traditional reservists, whose
day jobs range from firefighters to teachers to computer
programmers. The squadron is authorized 20 aircrews, made up of six
people each.
</P>
<P>
   Persinger and Val Hendry are two of the full-time reservists.
</P>
<P>
   Hendry, one of five female hurricane hunters, has been in 50
named storms. She said she was a natural for the job because ''I
always loved flying and was a meteorology major.''
</P>
<P>
   When she's not in the eye of a hurricane, Hendry keeps busy with
the squadron's Web site, which according to ''Popular Science''
magazine, was one of the top 50 sites in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Persinger's official job is to launch the dropsonde, a device
dropped into the eye to record temperature, relative humidity and
winds per second. That data is used to determine the intensity of
the hurricane and where it may make landfall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that it's a lot of people out there counting on this
every time it comes in, so it has to be precise,'' Persinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Persinger has been in the squadron since 1988, but it wasn't
until recently that his wife became concerned about the dangers
involved in his job.
</P>
<P>
   ''She never worried about my job until we went to see 'A Perfect
Storm,''' a movie about a fishing crew killed in a powerful
confluence of weather forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of wished I hadn't taken her,'' said Persinger, who
actually flew in the eye of Hurricane Grace, one of the weather
systems on which the film is based, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Persinger said the storm was only moderate in comparison to
others he's flown, such as Hurricane Hugo and Hurricane Mitch. He
said turbulence in those storms sometimes gave him a scare.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Joseph Roche, one of the traditional reservists, says he's
not easily bothered by the storms. Roche, who earns a living flying
passenger planes, flew in four different storms last year -- his
first with the squadron.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a big deal,'' Roche said. ''Most of the time it's not
that bad.''

<HEADLINE> La Russa: No Word on Mac's Return  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tony La Russa isn't sure when Mark McGwire will
return to the St. Louis Cardinals' lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless you have a crystal ball or you're Mother Nature, you're
prepared for whatever it takes,'' the manager said before Sunday's
4-2 loss to the New York Mets. ''It could be sooner, it could be
later, it could be as long as late August. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire went on the disabled list July 6 with pain in his right
knee and hasn't played since, missing the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, which has lost four straight for the first time this
season and six of eight, is 7-13 since McGwire went on the DL. Its
NL Central lead, 10 games on July 5, was cut to four games with
Cincinnati's 7-4 win at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely a little different,'' Jim Edmonds said. ''We
have to learn from it. They pitch everybody a little differently,
the guy in front of him, the guy behind him, because they're
worried about him.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't want to walk the guy in front of him, then they
don't want to walk him (because) then they've got to worry about
the guy following him.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is hitting .303 with 30 homers and 69 RBIs, playing 70
games and missing 34.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's getting treatment every day,'' La Russa said. ''He's a
little better. But he's not going to join us in Montreal, which is
the way I look at it -- the next series.''
</P>
<P>
   With McGwire out, the Cardinals have made moves to fortify their
pitching, acquiring right-hander Mike Timlin from Baltimore after
Saturday's game for first baseman Chris Richard and right-hander
Mark Nussbecak, and getting left-hander Jason Christiansen from
Pittsburgh after Sunday's game for minor league infielder Jack
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been trying to get Christiansen for a couple of years,
and we were finally able to do it,'' said Cardinals general manager
Walt Jocketty. ''Obviously, we're in desperate need of a
left-hander. He's a left-hander with quality stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Timlin pitched a hitless eighth inning in his Cardinals debut on
Sunday, striking out two and walking one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Changing teams is something tough to deal with, but it's quite
a pick-me-up to go from fourth place to first,'' Timlin said. ''I
was pretty nervous. You want to get off on the right foot. You want
to throw strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   La Russa said Timlin will be used primarily to set up closer
Dave Veres but also will close on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's had experience. I would use him anytime after the
seventh,'' La Russa said. ''I wouldn't hesitate to use him as a
closer.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Timlin. He was 2-3 with a 4.89 ERA in 37 games
with Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pitch in relief, you go from there,'' he said. ''I've done
both jobs. Whatever they want me to do.''

<HEADLINE> MSG Goes To Court To Stop Yankees  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees want to form their own
cable television network with the help of the International
Management Group.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Square Garden, whose network has televised Yankees games
since 1989, says the deal should be blocked because MSG hasn't been
presented with an offer it can match.
</P>
<P>
   A judge will have to decide.
</P>
<P>
   MSG headed to court Monday, asking New York Supreme Court
Justice Barry Cozier to block the Yankees' July 5 agreement with
IMG's Trans World International subsidiary. The team would own 95
percent of the new network and be guaranteed $838 million for its
TV rights in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   MSG Network, as part of its $486 million, 12-year contract with
the Yankees that runs through this season, has the right to match
any offer for the Yankees' TV rights. It claims the Yankees-TWI
deal is a ruse.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, the new network would pay YankeeNets, the
parent company of the baseball and basketball teams, $96.7 million
for rights to televise New Jersey Nets' games for 10 years starting
with the 2001-02 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''MSG cannot be made to pay to acquire benefits or obligations
unrelated to the television exploitation of Yankees' games,'' the
network said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   MSG Network also objected to a clause that would force its
parent company, Cablevision Systems Corp., to pay the Yankees if
MSG matched the offer. A clause in the Yankees-TWI deal would give
the team a minimum 25 percent of net income from all its sports
networks in the United States owned by any Yankees' TV partner.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a commercial standpoint, the exclusivity agreed to by TWI
may be difficult -- though not impossible -- for an existing network
with other sports team alliances to match,'' YankeeNets chairman
Harvey Schiller said in an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that MSG still could match the proposal but
never discussed it with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Former MSG head Bob Gutkowski has sided with the team in the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''At no time did I believe (nor do I now believe) that the
Yankees Partnership was somehow forbidden from forming a new
network in which the Yankees Partnership would hold the sole, or
any equity stake, and on which the Yankees' games would be
televised,'' Gutkowski said in an affidavit signed July 24 and
obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of MSG, Gutkowski negotiated the contract with the
Yankees in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Gutkowski is a disgruntled former employee of MSG, who was
fired in 1994,'' MSG responded in a brief to the court Friday.
''Since his termination, Mr. Gutkowski has solicited business from
and provided consulting services to the Yankees Partnership.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball Trades Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ron Gant moved to Anaheim, the Chicago Cubs tried to close a
deal for Rondell White, and two relievers changed places as several
contenders got busy a day before baseball's trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals got left-hander Jason Christiansen from
Pittsburgh on Sunday while San Francisco acquired righty Doug Henry
from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Other deals seemed to be in the works as teams approached
Monday's 4 p.m. EDT deadline for making trades without waivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels hoped to boost their lineup, getting Gant and cash
from the Philadelphia Phillies for pitcher Kent Bottenfield.
</P>
<P>
   ''We obviously needed a right-handed bat to help us,'' Anaheim
manager Mike Scioscia said. ''He's versatile, he can play the
outfield, he can DH, neutralize some left-handed pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia made the move four days after trading ace Curt
Schilling to Arizona. Though he officially was a member of the
Angels, Gant did not leave the Phillies right away -- he took the
team charter to San Diego on his way to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still saying 'us' instead of 'them,''' Gant said.
</P>
<P>
   Gant, 35, led the Phillies with 20 homers. He hit .254 with 38
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield, sent from St. Louis with Adam Kennedy to Anaheim in
the offseason for Jim Edmonds, was 7-8 with a 5.71 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not surprised,'' Bottenfield said. ''I knew it was coming,
I've known for the last week something was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Expos reached agreement to trade White to the Cubs,
provided Chicago can sign the outfielder to a multiyear contract
extension, The Associated Press learned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, there's something on the table, but if it's not right,
I'm not going to sign with the Cubs,'' White said after the Expos
lost to Cincinnati 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   White's name has been prominently mentioned in trade talks. The
New York Yankees, Seattle, Atlanta and Milwaukee had been
interested, but may have backed off because of his history of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Cubs nor Expos would comment on whether there was a
trade, and White did not know the details. But a source familiar
with the deal, speaking on the condition that he not be identified,
said the Cubs would be allowed to negotiate with White until 10
a.m. EDT Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known what other players were involved in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've known from the get-go that they were trying to trade
me,'' White said. ''Tomorrow, everything will be over with. I might
be here, I might not.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after acquiring Mike Timlin from Baltimore, the NL
Central-leading Cardinals added another reliever by getting
Christiansen from the Pirates for minor league infielder Jack
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen was dealt shortly after allowing four of the five
batters he faced to reach base in the Pirates' 9-8 loss to San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   While leaving the mound, Christiansen flipped the ball to
manager Gene Lamont, prompting a heated exchange in the tunnel
leading to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did something you shouldn't do to a manager,'' Christiansen
said. ''You should never show up your manager. I did that when I
threw the ball in the air. It's tough for me right now. I just got
traded and the last thing he and I have to remember about each
other is that.''
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen was 2-8 with one save and a 4.97 ERA in 44 games.
He also had a seven-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been trying to get Christiansen for a couple of years,
and we were finally able to do it,'' Cardinals general manager Walt
Jocketty said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, who helped San Francisco win the NL West in 1997, was
traded by the Astros to the Giants for pitcher Scott Linebrink.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, 36, was 1-3 with a 4.42 ERA in 44 appearances. He also
had one save, which came June 18 at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Henry worked 75 games as a setup man for San Francisco
closer Rod Beck.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our familiarity with Doug and his track record makes this a
win-win situation for us,'' Giants general manager Brian Sabean
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, the AL Central-leading Chicago White Sox got
catcher Charles Johnson and DH Harold Baines from Baltimore for
catcher Brook Fordyce and three minor league pitchers.

By The Associated Press	   Brook Fordyce hustled the whole way.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traded late Saturday night while the Chicago White Sox were in
California, he rushed across the country to Baltimore. He joined
the Orioles just in time Sunday to get two hits and score twice in
a 10-7 win over Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, several teams might be in a hurry to make deals. The
deadline for making trades without waivers is 4 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't even get a chance to thank Brook for what he's done
here,'' White Sox manager Jerry Manuel said. ''We hate to lose him,
he's been a big part of the energy and chemistry here.''
</P>
<P>
   Told Fordyce had contributed to a victory, Manuel said: ''They
won. Way to go, Brook.''
</P>
<P>
   In other AL games, Chicago outlasted Anaheim 11-7 in 10 innings,
Detroit edged Texas 8-7, Oakland beat Boston 5-2, Seattle topped
Toronto 10-6, New York downed Minnesota 7-4, and Tampa Bay beat
Kansas City 7-6 in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles got Fordyce and three minor league pitchers from the
AL Central leaders for catcher Charles Johnson and designated
hitter Harold Baines.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Mora, traded to Baltimore from the New York Mets in a
package for Mike Bordick on Friday, added an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Luis Matos drove in four runs and stole four bases, tying
the Orioles' record set by Brady Anderson. John Parrish (1-1)
earned his first major league victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of them games where I just got by. The guys really
did a great job behind me,'' Parrish said.

   David Segui, in his second game with Cleveland after being
traded by Texas, hit his fifth career grand slam.

<P>
   At Anaheim, Jeff Abbott and Carlos Lee hit two-run singles in
the 10th for Chicago, which scored two runs in the eighth and three
in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas and Magglio Ordonez opened the 10th with singles
off Al Levine (2-4), and Herbert Perry sacrificed but reached on a
fielder's choice to load the bases with nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott and Lee followed with their hits to give the White Sox a
four-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Foulke (2-0) got the final five outs for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's Garret Anderson hit a sacrifice fly off Foulke with
one out and the bases loaded in the ninth to tie it 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox took a 7-6 lead in the top of the inning off
Angels closer Troy Percival on a two-out, two-run double by Mark
Johnson and an RBI double by Ray Durham.
Tigers 8, Rangers 7:
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer hit a two-run homer and an RBI single in the first
two innings as Detroit built a big early lead at The Ballpark in
Arlington and held on.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers scored six runs in the first inning for the second
straight night. Juan Gonzalez had an RBI single, Palmer hit his
20th homer and Shane Halter had a three-run triple.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, traded by the Rangers to the Tigers in the offseason,
was 3-for-5 and finished 8-for-16 in his only trip to Arlington
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Blair (8-2) went five-plus innings, giving up four runs
on seven hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones got three outs for his league-leading 29th save in 30
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Texas starter Darren Oliver (2-6) lasted only two innings,
allowing seven runs on eight hits.
Athletics 5, Red Sox 2:
</P>
<P>
   Rolando Arrojo lost in his Boston debut as Sal Fasano homered
twice and drove in a career-high five runs at Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo was 5-9 with a 6.04 ERA with Colorado before being sent
to the Red Sox in a seven-player trade Thursday. He lost his fifth
straight decision, walking the bases loaded in the second inning
and setting up Fasano's first career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Fasano added a solo homer in the seventh.
Mariners 10, Blue Jays 6:
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson drew a team record-tying five walks, scored two
runs and stole two bases as Seattle beat Toronto at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez and Jay Buhner homered for the Mariners, who won
despite being outhit 10-5. Seattle is 6-1 against the Blue Jays
this year, outscoring them 71-42.	   Henderson matched the club mark for walks
shared by Rodriguez
and Tino Martinez. Henderson has 2,031 career walks and moved
closer to the record of 2,056 held by Babe Ruth.
Yankees 7, Twins 4:
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez and Paul O'Neill each drove in three runs and New
York won at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The AL East leaders returned home after a 5-2 road trip.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, who once angrily kicked a ball back to the infield
while with Cincinnati, made another blooper-like play in the sixth
inning. After fielding a single in right field, he wound up to make
a throw -- only to have the ball slip out of his hand and roll
behind him.
Devil Rays 7, Royals 6, 10 innings:
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams capped a big series by hitting an RBI single in
the 10th inning that gave Tampa Bay a four-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also homered as the Devil Rays won their fifth in a
row. He drove in eight runs in the series.

<HEADLINE> National League Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks after seemingly surrendering the NL Central title to
St. Louis, the Cincinnati Reds have fought their way back into the
race.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds have shaved six games off St. Louis' lead in the past
3&AMP;frac12; weeks, moving within four games Sunday after beating the Expos
7-4 to complete a three-game sweep at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a big weekend for our whole team,'' said Eddie
Taubensee, who went 3-for-4 with a pair of RBI doubles. ''It's
starting to get exciting for us. The team is starting to gel
together and we're having a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, who were eight games behind when they traded Denny
Neagle to the Yankees on July 12, are the closest they've been to
first place since June 13, when they trailed by 3&AMP;frac12; games.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati has been helped by a recent slump by the Cardinals,
who have struggled with Mark McGwire on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis lost its season-high fourth straight game Sunday, 4-2
to the New York Mets at Shea Stadium, and is 7-13 since McGwire
went on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we're 10 games over (57-47) and we've got to pick it up,''
Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. ''When you're 20 games over
at this time of the year, you can look forward to having some fun
in October, but now we have our work cut out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In other NL games, it was Atlanta 6, Houston 3; Milwaukee 3,
Colorado 2; Philadelphia 3, Los Angeles 2; Chicago 3, San Francisco
1; San Diego 9, Pittsburgh 8; and Florida 4, Arizona 3.
</P>
<P>
   Taubensee, who had 11 hits in the series, hit a run-scoring
double off Dustin Hermanson (8-9) in the second inning and another
in the fourth. Dmitri Young homered for Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Bell (5-6), recalled from Triple-A Louisville on Wednesday,
allowed four runs and eight hits in 7 2-3 innings in his first
start since June 23.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was really nervous my first two innings,'' Bell said. ''You
have to reprove yourself at this level. I feel good with the way I
came back today.''
</P>
<P>
Mets 4, Cardinals 2
</P>
<P>
   Bubba Trammell homered in his first at-bat for New York, just
like Mike Bordick did a day earlier, and Bobby J. Jones (5-5)
pitched a four-hitter for his first complete game in three years as
the Mets won their sixth straight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We kind of just looked at each other,'' Trammell said of his
new teammate. ''We knew what we were thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Benny Agbayani hit a leadoff shot in the first inning and
Trammell had a three-run drive in the second off Garrett Stephenson
(11-7).
</P>
<P>
   Trammell, a 28-year-old outfielder, was acquired by the Mets
from Tampa Bay on Friday along with Rick White, who got the win
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Braves 6, Astros 3
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine became the third active pitcher to win 200 games,
pitching into the ninth inning for host Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (13-5), who won his sixth straight game, allowed three
runs and seven hits in eight-plus innings to join teammate Greg
Maddux and Roger Clemens with 200 wins. He is the 96th pitcher
overall to reach 200.
</P>
<P>
Phillies 3, Dodgers 2
</P>
<P>
   Pat Burrell's bases-loaded walk off Chan Ho Park (11-8) broke a
tie and Randy Wolf (9-5) allowed four hits in seven innings for
host Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   During the game, the Phillies traded outfielder Ron Gant and
cash to Anaheim for pitcher Kent Bottenfield.
</P>
<P>
Padres 9, Pirates 8
</P>
<P>
   Phil Nevin homered on the first pitch from Marc Wilkins (2-1) in
the ninth inning and San Diego rallied from five runs down at
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres trailed 8-3 and had been outscored 34-10 in the
series until Ruben Rivera's second career grand slam highlighted a
five-run seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   John Vander Wal homered and went 4-for-5 to complete a big
weekend against his former club, going 7-for-13 with two homers and
scoring nine runs, three in each game.
</P>
<P>
Brewers 3, Rockies 2
</P>
<P>
   Jeff D'Amico closed a magnificent month by hitting his first
major league home run and allowing seven hits over eight innings as
Milwaukee beat visiting Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico (7-4) went 5-0 in July with an 0.76 ERA. Todd Helton's
fourth-inning homer was the only run he allowed until the ninth,
when Colorado got three straight singles and cut the Brewers' lead
to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Leskanic, in his first appearance since becoming the
Brewers' closer, got his second save.
</P>
<P>
Cubs 3, Giants 1
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa hit his 32nd homer and Jon Lieber (10-5) pitched a
four-hitter to win his fifth straight decision for host Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hit a solo homer with two outs in the seventh off Felix
Rodriguez to lift the Cubs to their 15th win in 19 games. Sosa
raised his NL-leading RBI total to 93.
</P>
<P>
Marlins 4, Diamondbacks 3
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millar's RBI double -- his fourth hit -- capped a two-run
rally in the eighth inning after Randy Johnson left the game, and
Florida won at home.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson departed with a 3-2 lead after seven innings and
throwing 145 pitches. He struck out 11.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Luis Gonzalez homered twice, giving him 22 this year.

<HEADLINE> Canandaigua man charged with death of mother  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CANANDAIGUA, N.Y. (AP) - A 38-year-old man was held without bail
in Ontario County jail for the second-degree murder of his
57-year-old mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ontario County District Attorney R. Michael Tantillo said other
charges against Jerald O. Zimmerman, 38, were likely - such as
those stemming from Jerald's alleged attack on his father at the
home.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, authorities were called Sunday morning
because of a domestic dispute. There, they found Angela Mae
Zimmerman dead on the dining room floor.
</P>
<P>
   Her body was taken to the Monroe County Medical Examiner's
Office for an autopsy. Tantillo said she appears to have died of a
beating.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman's death is the city's first slaying since 1991,
according to Canandaigua police.
</P>
<P>
   No motive has been determined, police said.

<HEADLINE> Town Rallies To Keep House Calls  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER COLEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINTERS, Calif. (AP) -- Dr. Bill Davis has called it quits, but
not from practicing medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The family practitioner left Sutter West Medical Group in June,
saying the managed care system didn't allow him to spend enough
time with his patients.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' neighbors in rural Yolo County apparently approve of his
decision. They are raising money for a clinic for the doctor known
for making house calls on his son's bike if his car isn't
available.
</P>
<P>
   The Winters Healthcare Foundation was formed in June by friends
and neighbors who told the doctor they didn't want to see him leave
the town, where he has spent his entire 14-year career.
</P>
<P>
   The board, still awaiting nonprofit status, plans to open a
840-square-foot clinic Sept. 1. Much of the office and medical
equipment was donated, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 47, one of three doctors in the town of 5,200, about 70
miles northeast of San Francisco, calls himself a ''conscientious
objector'' to the health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was tired of seeing patients have to wait for oxygen or wait
for pain relief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is trying to raise $500,000 through in-kind
donations and community events, said volunteer Theresa Cox. Buckets
for donations sit on the counters of many local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the foundation will employ Davis and hire a
physician's assistant, a receptionist and a nurse. But when the
doors open, the clinic will be run by volunteers -- including Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't anticipate having any income for the rest of the
year,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, his wife Wendy and their two sons, will live on Wendy's
income as chief ombudsman with the state Department of Mental
Health and the couple's savings until the clinic can afford to pay
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a real sense of being someone in the community,
everyone has a role here,'' said Wendy Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that means you go to someone's home to see them, then you
go to someone's home. If it means looking at an arm at a Little
League game, then you look at the arm at the game,'' Bill Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   The community is accustomed to Davis' personalized brand of
medicine, from making house calls to standing by at soccer,
football and baseball games in case of medical emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''One time my son crammed Play-doh into my daughter's ear canal
with a Q-tip, really stuffed it in there. I called Dr. Davis and he
came right down on a Saturday to take the Play-doh out,'' said
Debra Ramos, the editor of the weekly Winters Express and a patient
of Davis' since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   A yearly membership fee of $100 per household will cover a
checkup with Davis, enrollment in any health courses offered and
consultation on how to get the most of a health insurance plan,
said Wendy Davis. The foundation is also considering creating a
co-op, that would charge an upfront fee and cover all routine
health care, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic will take insurance, Medicare ''and chickens,'' Bill
Davis said -- but it won't accept HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   There's no official data on how many doctors leave affiliations
with managed care plans, but health care management consultant
Albert Lowey-Ball said the numbers are relatively minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, there is a great deal of dissatisfaction that
physicians have with respect to health plans and larger medical
groups related to the level of fee-for-service or capitation rates
and over-the-shoulder management,'' Lowey-Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter West President Harris Levin said Davis told him he was
leaving because he was frustrated over the increasing amount of red
tape and paperwork involved in billing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can hardly think of a single doctor who isn't frustrated
with the amount of paperwork that exists,'' Levin said. Plans are
underway to reduce the amount of paperwork by using electronic
records, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The medical group, which includes 48 doctors, prides itself on
being flexible with physician's schedules, allowing them to spend
as much time as they feel is necessary with patients, Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, however, said he felt the group wasn't responsive to his
complaints and didn't fit his view of how medicine should be
practiced, especially in a small town.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt I needed to get out of a bad situation,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   While the move was frightening for financial reasons, Wendy
Davis said she was relieved for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ''The strain of working in a system where you are devalued for
doing the right thing is incredible,'' she said. ''I admire him for
saying 'I'm going to do the right thing.'''

<HEADLINE> Anwar's Trial Drags Malaysia Down  </HEADLINE>
By ALVIN UNG
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- When prosecutors moved against
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim two years ago, they sent
hundreds of police officers, dozens of army rangers and an elite
weapons squad to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   It was the opening of a judicial drama that has shaken the
political hold of long-governing Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Anwar was convicted of corruption and given a
six-year jail sentence. This Friday, he is scheduled to hear the
judge's verdict in a year-old trial on sodomy charges.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar and his supporters say both cases have been nothing but a
conspiracy led by Mahathir because he considered his deputy a
political threat. Both trials opened in the glare of publicity but
domestic and international interest has waned in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Anwar, the jailed politician, has successfully used his
plight to unleash public opinion that has swept through Malaysia
and reached Mahathir, master of the country for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trial has effectively placed the entire Malay society on
trial,'' said Bruce Gale, a political analyst with Singapore-based
Political and Economic Risk Consultancy. ''You either believe Anwar
did it, or you don't. This is one of the great divides in Malay
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Pared to its essence, the sodomy trial is between the word of
the former deputy prime minister and his alleged victim, Azizan Abu
Bakar, an ex-chauffeur for Anwar's family.
</P>
<P>
   A guilty verdict means imprisonment of up to 20 years and
possibly a whipping. Even if Anwar is found innocent, he will be
imprisoned until 2003 and blacklisted from public office for five
more years for last year's corruption conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Both crimes were alleged after Mahathir abruptly fired Anwar in
September 1998 following a year of widening differences over how to
cope with the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Anwar said he had become too ambitious and coveted
the top job. Anwar has claimed that his calls for reforms
threatened Mahathir's cronies and corruption in the system.
</P>
<P>
   For Mahathir, a guilty verdict would provide justification for
why he removed the man he had slated as his heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Firing Anwar incensed much of the country's normally placid
Malay population, the dominant ethnic group and Mahathir's power
base, resulting in thousands taking to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent criminal charges of corruption and sodomy -- plus
a beating Anwar suffered in custody at the hands of the national
police chief -- triggered further outrage and brought protests from
local and international rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The joint trial of Anwar and his adopted brother, Sukma
Darmawan, alleged to have been Anwar's sex accomplice, began in
June 1999. It immediately became mired in controversy when
prosecutors waffled over the date of the alleged offense.
</P>
<P>
   They initially said Anwar attacked Azizan in Sukma's Kuala
Lumpur apartment in May 1994. Then they changed the date to May
1992, citing a typographical error. They changed the date again
after the defense showed that the apartment had not been built
until 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Lead prosecutor Abdul Gani Patail called Azizan ''a victim who
had been under untold suffering'' who could even identify the
queen-sized bed where some of the acts allegedly took place.
</P>
<P>
   The defense called Azizan an avaricious liar willing to concoct
tales fed to him by Mahathir's associates. The defense team
submitted alibis for most of the 90 evenings in question.
</P>
<P>
   The defense also subjected Azizan to a withering
cross-examination, during which he conceded that he was asked by
police to change the date of the alleged sodomy to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The fierce, often personal attacks mounted by both the defense
and the prosecution diminished the respect of the Malaysian public
for their institutions, Gale said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cumulative effect of the Anwar trial is that Malaysians
are more cynical now than ever before,'' Gale said. ''This cynicism
exists whether or not you believe Anwar is guilty. Both sides flung
mud on each other, and neither came out looking particularly
good.''
</P>
<P>
   During last November's elections, the fundamentalist
Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party capitalized on the discontent by
tripling its seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The gains came at the expense of Mahathir's United Malays
National Organization, whose popular vote fell to its lowest in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The reform-touting National Justice Party, led by Anwar's wife,
Azizah Ismail, did not fare particularly well.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been to split ethnic Malay political power
between a party that represents the old guard and one espousing a
brand of religious politics that would be anathema to moderate
Malays and the substantial ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's rhetoric has been filled with attacks on the
Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, following a raid on military armories
by an obscure Muslim cult preaching holy war and who killed two
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir claimed that many of the extremists belong to the party
and threaten the stability of Malaysia. The party denied any link.
</P>
<P>
   Gale said that Anwar's case and the violence weren't directly
related.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it did suggest that there were a number of Malaysians out
there who didn't believe that it was possible to attain power
through peaceful means,'' Gale said. ''They felt that if you wanted
to gain power, you had no other choice but to use violence.''

<HEADLINE> Elderly Drugs Costs To Rise  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the past eight years, Americans age 65 and
older have watched their prescription drug costs double, with
prices expected to more than double again in the next 10 years, a
health care advocacy group said.
</P>
<P>
   Without prescription drug coverage by Medicare, fewer seniors
will be able to afford the dozens of prescriptions they must fill
each year, said Families USA, which lobbies for universal health
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by the group and released Monday said
Americans 65 and older pay an average of $1,205 a year for
prescriptions -- up from $559 in 1992 -- and will shell out $2,810
apiece by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drugs now account for about 10 percent of seniors'
health costs -- and will likely rise to 13.3 percent in 2010, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Older Americans account for only 13 percent of the nation's
population but pay 42 cents of every dollar spent on prescription
drugs, it said. They also pay more per pill because their purchases
account for only 34 percent of total prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they go to the pharmacy, they pay higher prices for their
drugs than anyone, because there's no one bargaining on their
behalf,'' said Ron Pollack, Families USA executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The study said the average senior's cost per prescription has
risen dramatically, from $28.50 in 1992 to $42.30 now, and is
projected to jump to $72.94 in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, Pollack said, seniors also are buying more
prescriptions than ever.
</P>
<P>
   He said the elderly got by on about 20 prescriptions per year in
1992. Now they buy about 29 annually, and are expected to buy about
39 by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on data gathered by Medicare, the federal
health plan for the aged and disabled. Projections for future costs
were developed by the PRIME Institute, a consulting group at the
University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA is urging lawmakers to expand Medicare to cover
prescription drugs. It hopes the move will provide fuller drug
coverage for low-income Americans while giving the government more
bargaining power to force drug manufacturers to lower their prices.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has urged Congress to strengthen and modernize
Medicare with a voluntary prescription drug benefit to all 39
million Medicare beneficiaries regardless of income.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders say the drug coverage should be
reserved for the most financially needy. Their plan calls for
private health plans to offer drug benefits and government
subsidies to pay drug costs for the neediest seniors.
</P>
<P>
   The administration contends that would leave out 6 million
Medicare beneficiaries with incomes above the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, said much of the increase in
seniors' drug spending is driven by advanced drugs that are more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's good news for patients, for whom medicines are the most
cost-effective form of health care,'' he said. ''They keep patients
out of the hospital, off the surgery table, on the job and in the
home.''

   PhRMA spokesman Jeffrey L. Trewhitt said the report's figures
belie the hidden benefits of advanced drugs. New cardiac
medications, for instance, may cost an elderly patient $1,200
annually, but far less than a $42,000 heart operation.
</P>
<P>
   PhRMA supports expansion of drug coverage through private-sector
insurance. Judith H. Bello, the group's executive vice president,
told Congress in June that lawmakers should allow free-market
competition and consumer choice to contain costs.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Drug Costs To Rise  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the past eight years, Americans age 65 and
older have watched their prescription drug costs double, with
prices expected to more than double again in the next 10 years, a
health care advocacy group said.
</P>
<P>
   Without prescription drug coverage by Medicare, fewer seniors
will be able to afford the dozens of prescriptions they must fill
each year, said Families USA, which lobbies for universal health
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by the group and released Monday said
Americans 65 and older pay an average of $1,205 a year for
prescriptions -- up from $559 in 1992 -- and will shell out $2,810
apiece by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drugs now account for about 10 percent of seniors'
health costs -- and will likely rise to 13.3 percent in 2010, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Older Americans account for only 13 percent of the nation's
population but pay 42 cents of every dollar spent on prescription
drugs, it said. They also pay more per pill because their purchases
account for only 34 percent of total prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they go to the pharmacy, they pay higher prices for their
drugs than anyone, because there's no one bargaining on their
behalf,'' said Ron Pollack, Families USA executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The study said the average senior's cost per prescription has
risen dramatically, from $28.50 in 1992 to $42.30 now, and is
projected to jump to $72.94 in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, Pollack said, seniors also are buying more
prescriptions than ever.
</P>
<P>
   He said the elderly got by on about 20 prescriptions per year in
1992. Now they buy about 29 annually, and are expected to buy about
39 by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on data gathered by Medicare, the federal
health plan for the aged and disabled. Projections for future costs
were developed by the PRIME Institute, a consulting group at the
University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA is urging lawmakers to expand Medicare to cover
prescription drugs. It hopes the move will provide fuller drug
coverage for low-income Americans while giving the government more
bargaining power to force drug manufacturers to lower their prices.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has urged Congress to strengthen and modernize
Medicare with a voluntary prescription drug benefit to all 39
million Medicare beneficiaries regardless of income.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders say the drug coverage should be
reserved for the most financially needy. Their plan calls for
private health plans to offer drug benefits and government
subsidies to pay drug costs for the neediest seniors.
</P>
<P>
   The administration contends that would leave out 6 million
Medicare beneficiaries with incomes above the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, said much of the increase in
seniors' drug spending is driven by advanced drugs that are more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's good news for patients, for whom medicines are the most
cost-effective form of health care,'' he said. ''They keep patients
out of the hospital, off the surgery table, on the job and in the
home.''
</P>
<P>
   PhRMA spokesman Jeffrey L. Trewhitt said the report's figures
belie the hidden benefits of advanced drugs. New cardiac
medications, for instance, may cost an elderly patient $1,200
annually, but far less than a $42,000 heart operation.
</P>
<P>
   PhRMA supports expansion of drug coverage through private-sector
insurance. Judith H. Bello, the group's executive vice president,

<HEADLINE> Alan Alda Shows TV Infleunces  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- There's often an air of pomposity whenever
actors from film or theater discuss their craft.
</P>
<P>
   That's usually not the case with television, if they are asked
at all. As an art form, the box in everyone's home doesn't get the
same respect as the big screen or the Broadway boards.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's odd,'' actor Alan Alda said. ''As soon as television was
possible, everyone was watching it, and people would have to be
influenced by it, either positively or negatively.''
</P>
<P>
   Alda narrates an illuminating attempt to tie television's
present to its past, ''Influences,'' which premieres on Bravo on
Sunday at 7:30 p.m. Eastern (Aug. 6). Eight episodes of the
half-hour series, the first produced by the Museum of Television &AMP;
Radio, have been made and more will come if the response is
positive.
</P>
<P>
   The avuncular Alda is an ideal selection because he straddles TV
generations. While he tackles new roles like the
Alzheimer's-afflicted doctor on ''ER'' last season, his work as
Hawkeye Pierce on ''M A S H'' lives on in rerun perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in California, Alda wanted to be a writer. Watching
people like Sid Caesar and Lucille Ball on television helped put
him in front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although they were doing half-hour comedy, they were working
in a style where it was a little play,'' he said. ''They were
acting, they weren't doing standup comedy. It was very instructive
to watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Influences'' lacks the heft of Bravo's film forum, ''Inside
the Actor's Studio,'' but thankfully also lacks the pervasive
self-importance. The breezy conversations with people like Ted
Danson, Ray Romano, Tracey Ullman and John Lithgow are richly
illustrated with clips from the museum's archives.
</P>
<P>
   When Danson reveals that he used Andy Griffith as a role model
for how Sam Malone tolerated the idiosyncracies of everyone at the
bar on ''Cheers,'' Griffith appears on the screen with Don Knotts'
Barney Fife.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not quite Shakespeare for Lithgow, who credits ''The
Three Stooges'' for some of his physical comedy in ''3rd Rock From
the Sun.'' He can take Larry, Moe and Curly, he admits, only ''in
small doses.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best of the series pairs Roseanne with David Chase,
creator of ''The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I lived for television growing up,'' Roseanne explains. ''The
whole world of it just sucked me into another dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father would let Roseanne stay up to watch Johnny Carson's
monologue on the ''Tonight'' show as a reward for doing the dishes.
''I looked at Johnny Carson every night and willed myself to be
sitting there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The show runs tape of a demurely dressed Roseanne making her
''Tonight'' show debut. She made a joke that night about June
Cleaver, leading ''Influences'' to contrast the idyllic 1950s world
of ''Leave it to Beaver'' with the rougher, blue-collar household
on Roseanne's own sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Chase talks about how he and his father used to sit and watch
''The Untouchables'' together. He explains his admiration for
''Twin Peaks,'' showing how a surrealistic dream sequence from that
series was an antecedent to Tony Soprano's talking fish in this
season's finale of ''The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm attracted as a viewer to things that just meander,'' Chase
says.
</P>
<P>
   Alda believes that if ''Influences'' is made 20 years from now
with contemporary TV stars, ''The Sopranos'' will be one of the
shows they cite. He sees the series as a way of keeping
television's creative past alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the museum can give people who currently do television an
opportunity to go back to these high-water marks and draw
inspiration from them, they won't disappear,'' he said. ''They
won't just have been a moment that people enjoyed that passed.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor is a trustee of the Museum of Television &AMP; Radio,
which has branches in New York and Los Angeles. He and Bob Batscha,
the museum's president, also see the series as a way to let people
who can't get to the two facilities use its archives.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, people are coming to realize the importance of
television as a creative art form, Batscha said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is looking for new material, even as it tends to its
collection of material from TV's formative years. Even this
summer's guilty-pleasure hit, ''Survivor,'' has a place.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can see why people are captivated by it,'' Batscha said.
''Is it Shakespeare? No, but who would make that comparison? Will
it be in the museum? Of course, it will be. People will want to
answer the question, why did it connect with people in the summer
of 2000?''

   WHEN ANIMALS TALK: As humans break the species barrier of
communication, they are capable of understanding and talking with
animals. From household pets to wild critters, the range of
communication that is being cultivated is remarkable. Former ABC
News anchor Joan Lunden makes her debut on A&AMP;E with ''When Animals
Talk,'' a two-hour documentary that explores how animals
communicate with each other via body language and vocalizations.
With the help of computer technology and sign language, humans can
understand a fascinating variety of creatures. Animals highlighted
in the show include orangutans, chimps, humpback whales, monkeys
and frogs. ''When Animals Talk'' airs Sunday at 8 p.m. Eastern.

<HEADLINE> Dow Climbs 10; Nasdaq Gains 30  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up ten
points in today's early going. Advancing issues on the New York
Stock Exchange hold a 7-4 lead over decliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead 30 points and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index is up five points.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street appears in the mood to do some early
bargain-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether there's enough interest to sustain the
market's early gains.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say we could see the popular averages suffer
through a few more weeks of declines.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there's little in the way of market-moving news to
help give Wall Street support today.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings news has slowed dramatically from last week, and
there won't be any key economic news until tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   What there is, however, is the realization that the Nasdaq
composite fell more than ten percent last week alone.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose in early trading Monday as investors
gravitated back toward some of the technology shares that were
pummeled last week.
</P>
<P>
   But, the markets remained shaky after some disappointing
earnings reports and signals that the economy is still robust -- a
situation that might cause the Federal Reserve to interest rates
again.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 6.05 at 10,519.41 in the
first half-hour of trading. It lost nearly 75 points Friday and was
down 2 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq was up 32.75 to 3,695.75 Monday after dropping more
than 10 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index was up 6.50 to 1,426.48.
</P>
<P>
   To get a better idea of where the economy and inflation stand,
investors this week will be closely be watching reports on consumer
spending, new home sales, manufacturing and retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a stronger-than-expected report on the second quarter
gross domestic product helped raised fears about a renewal of
inflationary pressures.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 8; Nasdaq Drops 33  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fluctuated Monday as investors remained
uneasy about corporate profits and inflation-- a combination that
led to heavy selling last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 8.24 at 10,503.02 in
the first hour of trading. The Dow lost nearly 75 points Friday and
was down 2 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq was down 32.75 to 3,695.75 Monday after dropping more
than 10 percent last week. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index was off
1.01 at 1,419.48.
</P>
<P>
   The markets were still shaky after Friday's
stronger-than-expected report on the second quarter gross domestic
product raised fears about a renewal of inflationary pressures.
Investors are worried that the inflation-wary Federal Reserve will
raise interest rates again when its policy-writing Open Market
Committee meets later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointing earnings reports also contributed to the market's
depressed mood.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the Dow lower today was Merck, off $1 at $71.25 and J.P.
Morgan, off $1.325 at $129.25.
</P>
<P>
   Internet and consumer stocks also fell, including Kimberly
Clark, off 50 cents at $59.60 and Yahoo!, off $3 at $123.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.24 at 489.88.
</P>
<P>
   To get a better idea of where the economy and inflation stand,
investors will be closely watching reports this week on consumer
spending, new home sales, manufacturing and retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 109.31 million
shares, down from Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.70 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.50 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.61 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
up 0.34 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Worried About China Vote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- President Clinton said on Monday he was
worried that opponents of landmark trade legislation with China
might use procedural delaying tactics to keep the measure from
winning approval this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said it was ''absolutely imperative'' to win Senate
approval quickly after Congress returns in September from its
summer recess. He said he was concerned that delay would allow the
legislation to fall victim to the Senate's arcane rules in the rush
to adjournment in early October.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer it takes ... the more likely the bill will get
caught up in procedural wrangling,'' Clinton told a conference on
China trade opportunities for Florida businesses. ''With all the
work they have to do ... something procedural could happen to delay
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the legislation to give China normal trade
status on a permanent basis in May and last week Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott promised that the measure would be at the top of
the Senate agenda when Congress returns from its August recess.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said if the measure is voted on in September, ''it will
pass big.'' Last week, the Senate voted 86-12 to clear a procedural
hurdle to allow debate to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton told the crowd that in the Senate ''one member can
cause a world of trouble.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Takes Aim at GOP Policies  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- President Clinton ripped a Republican
prescription plan for the elderly Monday as unworkable and aimed
more at benefitting drug manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm president; I'm not supposed to say it's a bunch of
baloney,'' Clinton said of a private insurance plan proposed by
House Republicans. ''But you might be surprised at who agrees, the
insurance companies themselves. ... Insurance companies are
refusing to participate in such a program.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear that this plan is basically designed for the
pharmaceutical companies that make the drugs, not the seniors who
take them,'' Clinton said. ''Charging higher prices for Americans
enables them (the companies) to sell the drugs at much lower prices
in other countries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unbelievable,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive commented a day after a Chicago speech in
which he said backers of Texas Gov. George W. Bush will use smooth
and beguiling speeches at this week's GOP convention in
Philadelphia to mask the realities of harsh Republican policies.
</P>
<P>
   Making no effort to hide his own partisan intent, Clinton said
voters pleased with the economic boom of the last eight years will
vote Democratic this year if they want to ''live like
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Clinton told an audience of some 160 Tampa-area
older and disabled people at the Barksdale Special Programs Center
that a prescription drug benefit based on private insurance is
unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   He released a White House finding that Medicare recipients with
disabilities pay 50 percent more for drugs than do patients with
full insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the report fully backs his position that a
voluntary Medicare prescription drug benefit is needed to provide
affordable medicine for all those eligible.
</P>
<P>
   In a trio of fund-raising events in Tampa and Palm Beach, all
featuring U.S. Senate candidate Bill Nelson,the state insurance
commissioner, Clinton and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign were
set to rack up fund-raising totals of $400,000, $100,000 and
$650,000 respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Clinton took a shot at Republican vice presidential
candidate Dick Cheney's 1986 congressional vote against
recommending freedom for South Africa's Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, all the big publicity is about, in the last few days, an
amazing vote cast by their vice presidential nominee when he was in
Congress against letting Nelson Mandela out of jail,'' Clinton
said. ''That takes your breath away.''
</P>
<P>
   As a House member from Wyoming, Cheney voted against a
nonbinding resolution calling for Mandela's release and for U.S.
recognition of Mandela's African National Congress. Cheney said
Sunday his vote reflected the view then that the ANC was ''a
terrorist organization,'' not that he favored keeping Mandela in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Crediting his administration with policies he said worked like a
charm to turn around a once-stumbling economy, Clinton drew a laugh
when he added: ''I keep saying that if people want to live like
Republicans they should vote Democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a noontime reception that raised $250,000 for
Democrats, Clinton cited Cheney's Mandela vote as a way of moving
to a broader point -- his contention that GOP senators have kept
many of his nominees for the federal bench, especially minorities,
''in political jail because they can't get a hearing from this
Republican Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And their nominee won't say a word about it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   At the lunch and a later address to about 3,000 people at the
Association of Trial Lawyers of America, Clinton held up the 4th
Circuit Court of Appeals as an example.
</P>
<P>
   The court hears appeals from Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia,
North Carolina and South Carolina -- a region with more black
residents than any other federal court jurisdiction. The 4th
Circuit has never had a black judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been trying for seven long years to fix that, and they've
blocked every one,'' of his nominees, Clinton said. ''They're so
determined to keep an African-American off that they have allowed a
25 percent vacancy rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has nominated three blacks to be 4th Circuit
judges, but none has been confirmed. Two nominations are still
pending, but no Senate confirmation hearings are scheduled.

<HEADLINE> India Movie Actor Kidnapped  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGALORE, India (AP) -- A former Indian movie star was kidnapped
with three other men at his home by a well-known criminal gang, the
chief minister of the southern state of Karnataka said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Raj Kumar, in his 70s, gained fame by appearing in more than 200
Kannada-language films over five decades. He is also politically
powerful and is a hero in Karnataka.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar was hosting a housewarming Sunday evening in his home
village of Gajanur, just across the state line in Tamil Nadu, when
a dozen gunmen burst in, kidnapping Kumar, son-in-law S.A.
Govingaraj and two other men, said Karnataka chief minister S.M.
Krishna.
</P>
<P>
   He said the gang was led by the notorious Indian criminal
Veerappan, who uses only one name and has threatened Kumar in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   No clear reason was given for Kumar's kidnapping. Police said
Veerappan is wanted dead or alive.
</P>
<P>
   Stray incidents of stone-throwing and road blockades were
reported in Bangalore, the state capital, and elsewhere in
Karnataka state as news spread of Kumar's kidnapping. Shopkeepers
pulled down metal shutters to protect their windows, bus services
were suspended and schools were closed until Wednesday as a
precaution.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-year-old man was stabbed to death in Bangalore, city police
commissioner T. Madiyal was quoted as saying by Press Trust of
India.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan began as an ivory poacher, and by 1986 he had become a
full-time smuggler of rare sandalwood from the forests where he
lives. Police accuse him and his gang of killing 36 police and
forest service officers since 1989. He has staged several
kidnappings and released the victims, often for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar's wife, Parvathamma, said the gunmen had entered the house
just after dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were taken by surprise,'' she said, adding that her husband
told the gunmen, ''I will come with you and talk.'' He went outside
and then the gang leader came into the house and handed her a
cassette, telling her to take it to the chief minister of Tamil
Nadu state.
</P>
<P>
   The audio cassette said only that a representative should
contact the gang's mediator for its demands, Krishna said. The
Tamil Nadu and Karnataka state leaders agreed Monday to send an
emissary to Veerappan.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Parliament expressed anguish in the capital, New
Delhi, over the kidnapping. Authorities were criticized in speech
after speech for their inability to capture Veerappan, although
journalists have interviewed and filmed him.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Sentenced to Death  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A Beijing court handed down a death sentence
Monday to a former top official accused of taking bribes, a case
designed to assure Chinese the government is acting to stem
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng Kejie, who with his mistress amassed $4.9 million from
graft, would be the highest-level politician executed in a long
campaign aimed at assuaging public disgust over corruption and
abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   The 66-year-old former deputy chairman of the national
legislature was convicted of accepting the bribes while he headed a
poor southern region, the official Xinhua News Agency said in
announcing his sentence by the No. 1 Intermediate People's Court in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng has 10 days to appeal, but Xinhua did not say if he would
do so. Appeals in such cases are rarely successful.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy report on its main evening news broadcast, China
Central Television showed Cheng sitting in front of a microphone in
a packed courtroom while the prosecution presented evidence,
including numerous documents and a gold watch that was allegedly a
bribe.
</P>
<P>
   As the verdict was announced, Cheng was pulled to his feet by
guards and led from the courtroom, his face expressionless.
</P>
<P>
   ''The amount of bribes Cheng took was extremely huge,'' Xinhua
quoted the verdict as saying. ''The crimes he committed in the
capacity of a senior leading official have ... tarnished the clean
and honest image of government functionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheng's open trial demonstrated that ''all are equal before the
law'' and illustrated authorities' determination to punish
corruption, the Xinhua report quoted the presiding judge saying.
</P>
<P>
   Pervasive graft and a string of large corruption and smuggling
scandals involving government, police and army officials have badly
damaged public acceptance of the Communist Party's half-century in
power. To restore their image, Chinese leaders have broken with
customary secrecy to announce a series of punishments against
corrupt senior officials, among them Beijing's former party chief
and a deputy provincial governor executed this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the new openness has yet to be gauged. For some
Chinese, the effort has increased suspicions that the corruption
problem reaches into officialdom's highest ranks, and many Chinese
and party functionaries believe Beijing is really using the
campaign to settle scores with officials now in disfavor.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cheng case, prosecutors said he pressured state banks to
issue loans and took kickbacks to approve a range of projects,
plotting with his mistress to amass a fortune for their future
marriage. The proceeds were allegedly deposited in foreign bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   He was expelled from the party and dismissed from his
legislative post in April. A party spokesman blamed his downfall on
the ''temptations of women and money.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheng's mistress, Li Ping, and those who paid him bribes have
already been prosecuted, or will face prosecution soon, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng was caught in a widening investigation into smuggling,
kickbacks and other corruption in Guangxi, a poor southern region
whose rugged coast is a haven for smugglers. Cheng, a member of
China's Zhuang ethnic minority, headed Guangxi's government from
1990-98 and was its deputy Communist Party secretary.
</P>
<P>
   His deputy, Xu Bingsong -- sentenced last August to life in
prison -- had such a penchant for bribes that he was reportedly
known locally as ''millionaire Xu.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheng's case is said to have tainted Li Peng, the party's No. 2
and the head of the national legislature. It was Li who brought
Cheng to Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Washington Monument Reopens  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The long-running renovation of the Washington
Monument, the capital's 555-foot-high exclamation point, went on
hold Monday so summertime tourists can ride up the newly uncovered
obelisk.
</P>
<P>
   Artistic construction scaffolding was removed from the city's
tallest structure early this year to reveal the monument's gleaming
white surface. But the three-year, $10 million renovation and
restoration remains incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   First in line to ascend Monday, nearly two hours before the
ticket booth opened, were six members of the Dallman family of
Chesterfield, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis. Steve Dallman, vice
president of a chemical company, said the family learned of the
reopening three weeks ago through a school history project of
daughters Natalie, 12, and Katie, 11.
</P>
<P>
   Dallman, who said he last went up the monument 25 years ago,
when he was 13, found the newly cleaned monument ''astounding.''
''The view has always been beautiful,'' he said. ''It just looks
the way it should look.''
</P>
<P>
   A forecast of thunderstorms threatened to close the monument
early on its first day.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the lightning gets too close, we ask people to leave,''
said Vikki Keys, a deputy superintendent of the National Park
Service. ''The monument itself is protected, but we worry about
people waiting down below.''
</P>
<P>
   A line of about 300 snaked around paths leading to the ticket
booth. Among the crowd were about 200 people in black and yellow
costumes adorned with hieroglyphics, members of the Ancient
Egyptian Order led by Dr. Orrin Bright, an Atlanta physician.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's to remind the world that the obelisk is an ancient
African symbol,'' he said. The monument takes the shape of an
Egyptian obelisk, although at 555 feet it rises more than five
times as high as the tallest standing true obelisk, a 97-foot-high
monument to Queen Hatshepsut at fabled Karnak Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new system, the Washington Monument's free tickets must
be used at the day and time designated. A limited number are
available at the ticket booth or in advance from a commercial
agency at $1.50 each, plus 50 cents per order.
</P>
<P>
   The monument, closed since December, will be shuttered again
this December to complete the refurbishing. The National Park
Service hopes for a permanent reopening in February or March,
before the cherry blossoms bloom in a major Washington rite of
spring.
</P>
<P>
   During the closure, the monument's single elevator will get a
new cab with opaque walls that become transparent so passengers can
see some of the 193 memorial stones that line the surrounding
staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors used to be able to take the stairs down from the top,
but they have been closed since 1976 to curb vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have cleaned 94,000 square feet of surface, remortared
11.8 miles of joints and repaired 78 of the monument's 36,000
stones.

<HEADLINE> Germany Pressured To Stop Neo-Nazis  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Even before a pipe bomb explosion at a train
station injured 10 recent immigrants, German officials were
bemoaning a lack of public outrage over the increasing number of
attacks against foreigners in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it a domestic problem, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
said, but the constant reports of violence stained Germany's image
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer complained that people seem to
get more upset about attack dogs than neo-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes me unbelievably angry when I read in the newspaper
that murderous attacks are occurring in our country almost every
day against foreigners, strangers or people with another skin
color,'' he told the Berlin-based Tageszeitung.
</P>
<P>
   Now attempts to jolt ordinary Germans out of complacency are
growing more intense as police in Duesseldorf investigate the train
station bombing last week.
</P>
<P>
   As officers distributed fliers through the neighborhood Monday
seeking leads, they stressed that nothing had been ruled out. Yet,
with all 10 victims from the former Soviet Union, and six of them
Jewish, police say xenophobia was a ''conceivable'' motive.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the injured remained hospitalized, including one man in
critical condition. His wife, who was five months pregnant,
miscarried and nearly lost a leg in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Expressions of shock and outrage filled German newspapers and
airwaves over the weekend. Yet the violence continued.
</P>
<P>
   Two asylum seekers, from Togo and from Sudan, were insulted,
kicked and chased from a train station in the eastern city of
Eisenach by a gang of neo-Nazi youths, police said. The two managed
to escape and later identified their attackers to police.
</P>
<P>
   Three men, ages 18 to 21, were ordered held Monday on charges
including causing serious bodily harm and incitement to racial
hatred. A fourth, 17-year-old suspect was ordered held in a home
for juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Ministry spokesman Rainer Lingenthal said the attack
showed ''that violent right-wing extremism is still virulent in our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Cheap statements against anti-foreigner behavior and
announcements without obligations aren't enough by a long shot
anymore,'' said Fritz Kuhn, chairman of the junior coalition
partner Greens party.
</P>
<P>
   The government currently spends about $193 million on projects
designed to promote tolerance and provide youths with alternatives
to gangs.
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder, noting Germany's ''especially sensitive
situation'' following the Holocaust, said more must be done to
catch and prosecute far-right criminals to the full extent of the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem can't be solved with social work alone,''
Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   A top Interior Ministry official, Cornelie Sonntag-Wollgast,
said she would meet this week with other Cabinet representatives
and state officials to see ''whether federal and state police can
get involved in a stronger way when they see something
suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Neo-Nazi Internet sites would also be targeted more vigorously
for shutdown, she added, and one Greens lawmaker even called on
postal carriers to refuse to deliver racist or far-right
publications.
</P>
<P>
   Yet experts and officials stressed that government can do only
so much without greater public involvement, even if it's just
calling police to report potential trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''People must stop looking away and start seeing what's
happening and getting involved,'' Justice Ministry spokesman Thomas
Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Germany's internal security agency, Heinz Fromm,
said he has observed a ''large tolerance'' for extremist attacks
against foreigners among segments of the population. While not
everyone who looks on approvingly is an extremist, he said, the
generally muted public outcry only emboldens extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ''The perpetrators ... have the feeling they're acting on behalf
of many,'' Fromm said in the weekend edition of the Sueddeutsche
Zeitung, a Munich-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Out of a country of 81 million, Fromm's Office for the
Protection of the Constitution reports a total of about 9,000
potentially violent neo-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   His office reported a 5 percent increase in violent crimes
attributed to neo-Nazis last year, to 746 -- including the first
killing in three years. So far this year, three killings have been
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the neo-Nazi attacks are concentrated in the
economically distressed, former communist east.
</P>
<P>
   But officials noted that three of the youths arrested in the
weekend attack in Eisenach were from the prosperous western state
of Bavaria.

<HEADLINE> Charlton Heston Had Alcohol Rehab  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor and National Rifle Association
President Charlton Heston spent three weeks in an alcohol
rehabilitation program last spring after his social drinking got
out of hand, his publicist said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He thought he needed to take care of something that could
possibly become a huge problem,'' publicist Lisa DeMatteo said.
''He's actually back at work, taking care of himself and feeling
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Heston checked himself into a facility in Utah from late May to
mid-June, DeMatteo said. She said the star of ''The Ten
Commandments,'' ''Ben-Hur'' and ''Planet of the Apes'' had never
been in rehab before.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was overwork. He keeps a horrendous travel schedule
and he's 76 years old,'' DeMatteo said. ''He's speaking, he's
campaigning, he works for the NRA, he's been doing all this stuff,
and you know how it is, you go to these dinners and they give you a
rubber chicken and food that's not really edible and you have a
little bit too much wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Heston declined a request for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Heston is back on a hectic schedule of speaking engagements and
is completing work on a film, ''Town and Country,'' an ensemble
comedy with Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton, DeMatteo said. He's
also finishing work on a nonfiction book about his political views.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 76; Nasdaq Adds 71  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rebounded Monday as bargain hunters
returned to the market following last week's big decline. But
investors remained uneasy about corporate profits and inflation, a
combination that caused stocks to tumble.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
was up 75.77 at 10,585.21. The Dow lost nearly 75 points Friday and
was down 2 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq was up 71.41 at 3,734.89 Monday after dropping more
than 10 percent last week. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index was up
14.25 at 1,434.26
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a reaction to last week's selloff,'' said
Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   He said investors remain nervous about inflation and whether
Federal Reserve policymakers later this month will implement their
seventh interest rate hike since June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Up until last week it was pretty much assumed the Fed would
not do anything. But now that is in question,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   The markets were still already nervous about higher rates before
Friday's stronger-than-expected report on the second-quarter gross
domestic product intensified inflation fears and led to renewed
selling. To get a better idea of where the economy and inflation
stand, investors will be closely be watching reports this week on
consumer spending, new home sales, manufacturing and retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the Dow higher Monday was Hewlett Packard, up $4.125 at
$111 and American Express, up $1.125 at $55.938.
</P>
<P>
   Chip makers and Internet and computer companies were lifting the
Nasdaq. Those included Texas Instruments, up $2 at $59.50, Oracle,
up $2.125 at $74.50 and Yahoo!, up $1.50 at $128.25.
</P>
<P>
   VISX, the laser vision system maker that has used in surgery on
Tiger Woods and other celebrities, rose $3 to $25 after reports
that financier Carl Icahn plans to acquire an 11 percent stake in
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 3.14 at 493.36.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 567.45 million
shares, down from Friday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Sarajevo's Serb Mayor Sets Standard  </HEADLINE>
By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Ordered to leave the
apartment where she has lived since her own home was destroyed,
Muslim refugee Murata Karahodzic told Bosnian television she would
have to give up her children unless she found other housing.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the mayor appeared at her door with keys to a new
apartment. And he is a Serb.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his ethnic origins, Ljubisa Markovic is popular among
his Muslim constituents because he has brought a service-oriented
style of government unheard of in the Balkans, known for sluggish
bureaucracy, corruption and indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Markovic, a member of the multiethnic Social Democratic Party,
was elected in April as mayor of Sarajevo Center, one of four
municipalities which form Greater Sarajevo. About 80 percent of his
70,000 constituents are Muslims -- with bitter memories of Serb
shelling and atrocities from the 1992-1995 ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
   With his yellow notebook of promises, a Web site and liberal
visiting hours, Markovic is winning the Muslims over.
</P>
<P>
   ''The relation of the government to the citizens has changed,''
Markovic told The Associated Press in an interview. ''Before the
municipality received them only on Mondays and Fridays. Now, it's
every day. The whole day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary citizens attend staff meetings where officials plan how
to spend public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Through his Web site, Markovic has invited citizens to send him
e-mails about their problems or to ask about housing, refugee
return or employment.
</P>
<P>
   The municipal administration is setting up a computer system so
residents can obtain birth certificates, permits and other official
documents electronically and by mail within a day.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting problems directly to the mayor in person is no longer
a privilege of business tycoons and the politically well-connected.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has set aside Tuesday afternoons to receive ordinary
citizens who want help with their problems. He keeps the small
yellow notebook to remind him what he has promised.
</P>
<P>
   Another Muslim constituent, Amela Muratovic, needed help
rebuilding her family's home leveled by Serb shellfire during the
war.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, her family had found shelter in an abandoned
Serb apartment, but the Serb owners want their apartment back now
that the war has been over for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went to Markovic last week,'' she said. ''I explained my
problem to him, and he wrote down my name. I didn't think much of
it because I know how many people like me turn to him.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the meeting, a city clerk came calling. '''We
found a donor who will repair your house,''' Muratovic, 37, quoted
the clerk as saying. '''You will move in by the end of this
year.'''
</P>
<P>
   Housing is among the biggest problems facing city officials
throughout Bosnia. In Sarajevo, an estimated 4,000 refugees from
other parts of the country live in other people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   Most squatters cannot return to their own homes because leaders
of rival ethnic groups refuse to let them or because their property
was destroyed during the war and they have no money for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Karahodzic, for whom the apartment was found in a day, fled here
from Srebrenica, the eastern Bosnian enclave where Serbs allegedly
massacred thousands of Bosnian Muslims in the final days of the
war. Facing eviction, she said she would have to put her children
in an orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   ''That moment, by coincidence,'' Markovic said, ''the
municipality obtained a small apartment and we solved her
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He may not be so lucky in the future.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,000 former Sarajevans have asked to return to the city
from areas where they took refuge, but about 65 percent of the
apartments or houses in Sarajevo were damaged during the conflict,
and many others have been taken over by squatters.
</P>
<P>
   Markovic admits he has no easy formula for solving the problem
during his four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll do my best,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 4 Accused of Milosevic Death Plot  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Four Dutch citizens have been
detained in Yugoslavia on suspicion of plotting to assassinate or
abduct President Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav information
minister said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Matic said the four men were arrested sometime in July
when they tried to enter Kosovo from the Yugoslav republic of
Montenegro with plans to ''kill President Slobodan Milosevic or
carry out other terrorist acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Matic, who did not say whether the men had lawyers, showed
footage of the suspects in military uniforms being interrogated by
Yugoslav authorities. One of the men was shown saying he'd plotted
to abduct Milosevic or former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
to ''surrender them to The Hague.''
</P>
<P>
   The footage showed maps, pocket tools, knives and cameras
allegedly used by the Dutch. One of the men was shown saying that
the group intended to abduct Milosevic or Karadzic ''if we come
across them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We would put them in a ski box (on top of a car) and transport
them to the embassy or out of the country,'' the unidentified
suspect said.
</P>
<P>
   Another said on camera that in case the abduction of Milosevic
failed, one of them ''had the idea to kill the president, to
decapitate his head, to put it in the box and to send it home'' to
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Both Milosevic and Karadzic have been indicted by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal in The Hague for atrocities committed by Serb-led
troops in Kosovo and Bosnia, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Matic claimed the arrested men were a part of the ''NATO
military-intelligence community'' who ''used the excuse of being
weekend warriors and adventurers'' when arrested.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the group was trained by special British forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch Foreign Ministry said it was looking into the matter,
while the Dutch defense ministry identified one of the four as
Johannes van Rie, a former army conscript who finished his service
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the prosecutor's office of the war crimes
tribunal could not be reached for immediate comment.

<HEADLINE> Putin Accepts Invite To Visit Libya  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin accepted an
invitation Monday to visit Libya, Putin's foreign policy adviser
said.
</P>
<P>
   Libyan Foreign Minister Abdel Rahman Mohammed Shalgam issued the
invitation during a meeting between the two in Moscow, aide Sergei
Prikhodko said, according to Russian media. No date for the trip
was released.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement follows a flurry of official visits by Putin,
including a high-profile meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong
Il.
</P>
<P>
   Shalgam arrived Sunday for three days of talks, the first visit
by a Libyan foreign minister to Russia. He said Putin had invited
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to visit Russia but did not say
whether the invitation had been accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Shalgam also said he believes Putin ''due to his vigor, youth
and energy, could give Russian foreign policy a fresh impetus that
would allow for the creation of a strong balance of forces in the
world,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic contacts between Russia and Libya were reduced during
the years of international sanctions imposed on Libya in connection
with the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations suspended the sanctions in 1999, and Libya
surrendered the suspects for a trial now under way in the
Netherlands. But the United Nations has not fully lifted the
sanctions, meaning they could be reimposed. Putin called Monday
called for ''a definitive lifting of the sanctions,'' Prikhodko
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, a major supplier of conventional weapons to Libya in
Soviet times, had long pushed for lifting the sanctions, hoping it
would allow Libya to pay off its Soviet-era debt to Russia of about
$2.4 billion.

<HEADLINE> Clan mother's testimony about tribal history ends Cayuga witnesses  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - The Cayuga Indian Nation rested its land
claim case Monday after a clan mother recounted the tribe's oral
history, describing New York's use of liquor and deceit to steal
Cayuga lands two centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been told by the elders that we have never given up in
our fight to get our land back. We are always trying to realize our
dream of returning to our homeland,'' Bernadette Hill told U.S.
District Judge Neal McCurn as testimony moved into a third week in
the second phase of the damages trial.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, state attorneys used their cross-examination of
another Cayuga representative to outline how New York over the last
century negotiated a settlement to compensate the tribe - payments
the Indian nation continues to accept.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys expected to begin calling their witnesses
Tuesday. First, McCurn asked each side to give him a 90-minute oral
summation of the lengthy testimony given last week by Laurence
Hauptman, a Native American history scholar who testified that 18th
century New York officials acquired the Cayugas land in ''bad
faith'' transactions.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn ruled six years ago that New York illegally acquired
64,027 acres of Cayuga land in 1795 and 1807 by purchasing it from
the tribe without the federal government's required approval.
Following a monthlong trial, a federal court jury in February
awarded the Cayugas $36.9 million for their lost ancestral lands.
</P>
<P>
   The judge is now weighing historical and economic factors to
decide whether the jury's award should be increased.
</P>
<P>
   Hill on Monday echoed Hauptman's testimony, telling McCurn that
colonial soldiers first tried to drive the Cayugas out of their
homelands because many Cayugas had fought on the British side
during the war for independence. Later, New York officials resorted
to cheating the Cayugas through bogus treaties, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1789, New York said it brokered an agreement with the Cayugas
to transfer all of its land over to the state except for land
around Cayuga Lake, which eventually shrank to the 64,000-plus acre
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the elders, New York officials knowingly ignored
Iroquois protocol and found dissident Cayugas it could coax into an
agreement, Hill told McCurn.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not a legal treaty to us. They were given Mind
Changer - strong drink - and forced to put an X on something they
did not know they were putting an X on,'' Hill testified. ''They
were not in their right mind. There was bribery. They were
beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said there was never any wampum exchanged to record the
treaty, nor was the action given the approval of the Grand Council,
which represented the Cayugas and other tribes of the Iroquois
Confederacy and would have been required to approve such a serious
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Hill explained for McCurn that under the Iroquois' Great Law, no
individual, or even a tribe, could own land.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't own Mother Earth. We are caretakers responsible for
an assigned area,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill also told McCurn that the disbanded and homeless Cayugas
were stymied in their attempts to regain their lost lands until a
1974 ruling by the United States Supreme Court involving the
Oneidas, another Iroquois tribe. The Cayugas filed their land claim
in 1980 - a delay that the state has made an issue of and a reason
the tribe should not be entitled to any interest.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys also have tried to show the many attempts New
York officials later made to compensate the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Cayuga spokesman Clint Halftown acknowledged under
cross-examination that New York had set up a trust fund and agreed
to annual payments in the early 1900s. Although suspended for a
duration, those payments were resumed and continue to present.
</P>
<P>
   Halftown also said he was aware that New York set aside $75,000
in the 1930s for the Cayugas to purchase land from the Senecas in
western New York but that the Senecas would not sell any of their
land.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Job Count Investigation, 1st Ld-Writethru,0760  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The federal government is investigating New
York state's robust 1999 job-growth numbers following complaints
that the statistics might have been inflated.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the state revised its 1999 job-growth rate from the
original estimate of 1.8 percent to 2.6 percent, an increase that
''looked a little bit unusual,'' said Patricia Getz, division chief
for monthly industrial employment statistics at the federal Bureau
of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The revisions for New York was larger than what we usually
see,'' Getz said Monday. ''We're just trying to make sure there are
not any errors or any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Getz said it appears that a lot of the job growth came from a
sudden spurt in the first quarter of 1999, right at the time when
the state Labor Department was instituting processing changes.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau is examining the labor statistics, particularly the
January-March data, to see if there was any connection between the
figures and the processing changes.
</P>
<P>
   Getz said the bureau expects to conclude its investigation in
the next few weeks and decide then whether to ask the state to
readjust its job-growth figures.
</P>
<P>
   Such a revision could be a black eye for Gov. George Pataki, who
in March trumpeted figures showing the state's 1999 private-sector
job creation rate bettering the national rate. Pataki had said that
just under 200,000 jobs were created in New York last year, the
most in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The overall job gains in 1999 were the first time - except for
two years in the mid-1980s - when the state gained employment at a
rate faster than the national average in the past 42 years,
according to the Pataki administration.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Kagann, Pataki's chief economist, said that the high
growth rate that's under question is a progressive part of several
years of strong private-sector job increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''For upstate New York, in 1997 it was 1.1 percent. In 1998 it
was 1.7 percent. In 1999, 2.5 percent. The job growth didn't start
in 1999, it started in 1997,'' Kagann said. ''It's a perfectly
normal turnaround. There's nothing unusual about the strength of
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials grew suspicious of the state's job figures
when an annual adjustment of the data boosted the state's job
gains. That technical adjustment found an extra 68,450 jobs
statewide, prompting several complaints to the federal agency from
those who doubted the numbers' veracity.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry into the statistics was first reported Sunday by the
Buffalo News.
</P>
<P>
   The state has acknowledged that some jobs were counted twice.
The mistakes came at a time when the method of processing
unemployment insurance forms for employers was changed.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Rodick, director of research and statistics for the
state Department of Labor, said his office found some duplicate
reports from some companies. Other technical errors could have
occurred when data was scanned into the department's computer
system.
</P>
<P>
   Rodick, however, described the problems, on the whole, as
minimal. The department may be off by about 9,000 jobs, or about
''one-tenth of 1 percent'' of the statewide total jobs figure, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very, very certain of our information. We're very
comfortable with it,'' Rodick said. ''They're strong, accurate
reports.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the strong job growth can be expected given a
corresponding decrease in unemployment data - ''Tons of signs that
the economy is doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department has until Sept. 16 to complete all the data
adjustments and submit the final revision to the federal
government. In a statement released Monday, Rodick said he was told
last week by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to submit the numbers
immediately because they were in an ''election cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said the governor is ''confident
with our numbers.'' He said the federal investigation could be a
move by the Democratic Clinton administration to boost the campaign
efforts of Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said that upstate's economy is not what it should be
considering the boom in other regions of the country and in the New
York City area. Other New York Democrats have also charged that New
York's economy is not responding well enough to the generally good
times nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very clear that the Clinton administration is using its
clout to further Hillary's political campaign, and it's just an
outrage,'' McKeon said.

<HEADLINE> Performer Leaves Wagner Festival  </HEADLINE>
By WOLFGANG HUEBNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYREUTH, Germany (AP) -- A second veteran performer announced
her departure from the renowned Richard Wagner music festival
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Soprano Waltraud Meier's decision to leave at the end of the
season came as the festival's embattled director tried to inject a
bit of optimism by announcing that an American arts patron had
pledged financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Vilar, an opera fan who made his fortune from
investments in high-tech companies, will contribute a
''substantial'' sum toward a new version of the opera
''Tannhaeuser'' in 2002, said Wolfgang Wagner, the composer's
80-year-old grandson and the festival's director for nearly 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner declined to name a sum, but said Vilar's contribution is
''an important step toward securing the festival's future.'' He
stressed there were no conditions attached.
</P>
<P>
   Vilar has previously pledged millions of dollars to the
Metropolitan Opera in New York, the Royal Opera in London, La Scala
in Milan, Italy, and the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg,
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The financial boost comes amid growing criticism of the Wagner
family's grip on the festival, in its 89th year, and a debate about
how it can be brought up to date.
</P>
<P>
   A new production of the composer's landmark Ring cycle, which
pitches the opera's mythical German gods into the industrial age,
has been greeted with mixed reviews, and several of its top
performers have deserted the organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Meier, the internationally renowned soprano who sings alongside
superstars Placido Domingo and Alan Titus in this year's
performance of the Ring, on Monday attacked Wolfgang Wagner's
leadership and said she will follow the example of another top
singer, 29-year Bayreuth veteran Hans Sotin, and quit. Sotin quit
the day before the festival opened, citing artistic differences.
</P>
<P>
   Meier told the Nordbayerischen Kurier newspaper that her 17th
year performing at the festival would be her last, after the
leadership refused to allow her to appear at Bayreuth next year
while also performing at a festival in Munich.
</P>
<P>
   ''To rest on the fact that they could sell every ticket 10 times
is the wrong way to look at it. Bayreuth should get down off its
high horse,'' she said, adding that she expected Domingo also will
throw in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner rejected the criticism, without going into details.
</P>
<P>
   Further changes may depend on the outcome of a debate within the
Wagner family about who should be the next director. While Wolfgang
Wagner has been pushing his wife and longtime assistant Gudrun as
his successor, one of the composer's great-grandchildren, Nike
Wagner, says an overhaul is needed, including an expansion of the
repertoire from the 10 mature Wagner works -- and even including
operas by other composers.
</P>
<P>
   Two other great-grandchildren of the composer also are competing
to become director. A vote has been pushed back to October.
</P>
<P>
   The 2002 edition of ''Tannhaeuser'' is to be produced by
France's Philippe Arland and conducted by Christian Thielemann. The
2002 festival also will see Wolfgang Wagner's productions of
''Meistersinger'' and ''Parsifal'' phased out, ending his
participation in the festival as a creative director.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's festival opened July 25 and runs to Aug. 28.

<HEADLINE> Rock climber who fell to death identified as a college student from Ky. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARDWICK, N.J. (AP) - A rock climber who fell to his death
Saturday near the Delaware Water Gap has been identified as a
22-year-old college student from Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Raible, of Louisville, Ky., fell 120 feet down a cliff
face while descending Mount Tammany, a popular rock-climbing spot
in Warren County, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Raible, a student at Haverford College in Haverford, Pa., and
Todd Garcia, 35, of Allentown, Pa., had completed a 200-foot climb
on a route known as Double Overhang, said Doyle Nelson, chief
ranger at the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.
</P>
<P>
   They were rappelling down the cliff face when the accident
occurred about 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Raible had fastened his climbing rope through a
sling left by previous climbers. It slipped and he plummeted to the
base of the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, whom rangers described as an expert rock climber, found
Raible at the base of the cliff, but he was not breathing, Nelson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia then hiked out to Route 80 and flagged down a motorist
who called for help.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 69; Nasdaq Adds 85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rebounded Monday as bargain hunters
returned to the market following last week's big decline.
Technology stocks led the resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   But investors remained uneasy about corporate profits and
inflation, a combination that caused stocks to tumble on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At late afternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 68.59 at 10,580.34. The Dow lost nearly 75 points
Friday and was down 2 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq was up 84.84 at 3,739.49 Monday after dropping more
than 10 percent last week. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index was up
14.27 at 1,434.28
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a reaction to last week's selloff,'' said
Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   He said investors remain nervous about inflation and whether
Federal Reserve policymakers later this month will implement their
seventh interest rate hike since June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Up until last week it was pretty much assumed the Fed would
not do anything. But now that is in question,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   The markets were still already nervous about higher rates before
Friday's stronger-than-expected report on the second-quarter gross
domestic product intensified inflation fears and led to renewed
selling. To get a better idea of where the economy and inflation
stand, investors will be closely be watching reports this week on
consumer spending, new home sales, manufacturing and retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the Dow higher Monday was Hewlett Packard, up $4.50 at
$111.50 and American Express, up $1.312 at $57.125.
</P>
<P>
   Chip makers and Internet and computer companies were lifting the
Nasdaq. Those included Texas Instruments, up $2 at $59.50, Oracle,
up $2.50 at $74.75 and eBay, up $2 at $48.875.
</P>
<P>
   VISX, the laser vision system maker that has used in surgery on
Tiger Woods and other celebrities, rose $2.813 to $24.813 after
reports that financier Carl Icahn plans to acquire an 11 percent
stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 4.30 at 494.52.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 675.54 million
shares, down from Friday's pace.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Job Count Investigation, 2nd Ld-Writethru,0805  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The federal government is investigating New
York state's robust 1999 job-growth numbers following complaints
that the statistics might have been inflated.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the state revised its 1999 job-growth rate from the
original estimate of 1.8 percent to 2.6 percent, an increase that
''looked a little bit unusual,'' said Patricia Getz, division chief
for monthly industrial employment statistics at the federal Bureau
of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The revisions for New York was larger than what we usually
see,'' Getz said Monday. ''We're just trying to make sure there are
not any errors or any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Getz said it appears that a lot of the job growth came from a
sudden spurt in the first quarter of 1999, right at the time when
the state Labor Department was instituting processing changes.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau is examining the labor statistics, particularly the
January-March data, to see if there was any connection between the
figures and the processing changes.
</P>
<P>
   Getz said the bureau expects to conclude its investigation in
the next few weeks and decide then whether to ask the state to
readjust its job-growth figures.
</P>
<P>
   Such a revision could be a black eye for Gov. George Pataki, who
in March trumpeted figures showing the state's 1999 private-sector
job creation rate bettering the national rate. Pataki had said that
just under 200,000 jobs were created in New York last year, the
most in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The overall job gains in 1999 were the first time - except for
two years in the mid-1980s - when the state gained employment at a
rate faster than the national average in the past 42 years,
according to the Pataki administration.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Kagann, Pataki's chief economist, said that the high
growth rate that's under question is a progressive part of several
years of strong private-sector job increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''For upstate New York, in 1997 it was 1.1 percent. In 1998 it
was 1.7 percent. In 1999, 2.5 percent. The job growth didn't start
in 1999, it started in 1997,'' Kagann said. ''It's a perfectly
normal turnaround. There's nothing unusual about the strength of
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials grew suspicious of the state's job figures
when an annual adjustment of the data boosted the state's job
gains. That technical adjustment found an extra 68,450 jobs
statewide, prompting several complaints to the federal agency from
those who doubted the numbers' veracity.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Labor Department relies on monthly and yearly
job-growth data from states for nationwide reports.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry into the statistics was first reported Sunday by the
Buffalo News.
</P>
<P>
   The state has acknowledged that some jobs were counted twice.
The mistakes came at a time when the method of processing
unemployment insurance forms for employers was changed.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Rodick, director of research and statistics for the state
Department of Labor, said his office found some duplicate reports
from some companies. Other technical errors could have occurred
when data was scanned into the department's computer system.
</P>
<P>
   Rodick, however, described the problems, on the whole, as
minimal. The department may be off by about 9,000 jobs, or about
''one-tenth of 1 percent'' of the statewide total jobs figure, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very, very certain of our information. We're very
comfortable with it,'' Rodick said. ''They're strong, accurate
reports.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the strong job growth can be expected given a
corresponding decrease in unemployment data - ''Tons of signs that
the economy is doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department has until Sept. 16 to complete all the data
adjustments and submit the final revision to the federal
government. In a statement released Monday, Rodick said he was told
last week by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to submit the numbers
immediately because they were in an ''election cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said the governor is ''confident
with our numbers.'' He said the federal investigation could be a
move by the Democratic Clinton administration to boost the campaign
efforts of Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said that upstate's economy is not what it should be
considering the boom in other regions of the country and in the New
York City area. Other New York Democrats have also charged that New
York's economy is not responding well enough to the generally good
times nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very clear that the Clinton administration is using its
clout to further Hillary's political campaign, and it's just an
outrage,'' McKeon said.

<HEADLINE> Experts: More Diabetes Tests Needed  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The statistic is dismal: Americans too often
have the most common form of diabetes silently festering for up to
12 years before they're diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   That's 12 years that diabetes quietly eats away your vision,
injures your kidneys and nerves and sets you up for heart disease --
damage that's preventable if only people learned sooner that they
have Type 2 diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, half of diagnosed patients don't have their diabetes
controlled well enough to stop that early damage from worsening.
And experts estimate hundreds of thousands skip a test they're
supposed to take every few months that's crucial for improving
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't your doctor know if you're at risk for diabetes and
test you? If you've got it, shouldn't the doctor automatically
provide the proper exams, including that often-skipped ''A1C''
test, to adjust your therapy? Ideally, yes.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors aren't doing a good enough job, says a new
government call for more aggressive diabetes screening and care -- a
call that urges at-risk Americans to demand their physicians check
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to get the word out so people who are at risk
will ask their doctors,'' says Dr. Judith Fradkin of the National
Diabetes Education Program, a federal initiative to improve the
alarming state of diabetes care and diagnosis. ''There's so much we
can do for you'' if the illness is discovered early.
</P>
<P>
   The NDEP's new call to action, published recently in the Journal
of the American Medical Association, is important because too many
people don't realize how serious diabetes is, says Dr. Robert
Sherwin, president of the American Diabetes Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''A 'touch of diabetes' is what you constantly hear, the
implication being that's not a serious problem,'' when in fact even
borderline diabetes is dangerous, Sherwin says.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics' bodies cannot regulate blood sugar, or glucose.
</P>
<P>
   Some 16 million Americans have the disease, and experts say at
least a third don't know it. It's a leading cause of blindness,
kidney failure, limb amputations. It dramatically increases the
risk of heart attacks, and kills 180,000 Americans each year.
</P>
<P>
   Type 1 diabetes, also called ''juvenile'' diabetes, typically
strikes in childhood. Patients' bodies cannot make insulin, a
hormone crucial to converting glucose into energy. Regular insulin
injections keep them alive.
</P>
<P>
   But the vast majority of diabetics have the Type 2 form -- the
diabetes that sneaks up on you.
</P>
<P>
   These patients' bodies gradually lose the ability to use insulin
properly. Over time, high glucose levels damage their blood
vessels, leading to heart, eye, kidney and nerve injury. Indeed, at
diagnosis some 20 percent of patients have enough eye damage to
calculate they've actually had diabetes for up to 12 years, Fradkin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Type 2 diabetes is most common after age 40; risk rises with
increasing age. Unfortunately, however, overweight children
increasingly are getting Type 2 diabetes, too. Some patients
require insulin injections, but most are prescribed other
medications, diet and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   So who should seek a diabetes test?
</P>
<P>
   Sherwin recommends routine screening at age 45, but says people
with more than one risk factor need testing earlier. Risks include:
</P>
<P>
   -Being overweight.
</P>
<P>
   -Having a close relative who had diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   -For women, having a baby who weighed more than 9 pounds at
birth.
</P>
<P>
   --Being black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sherwin urges anyone with high cholesterol or high
blood pressure to seek a diabetes test -- saying even
borderline-high blood sugar can make your cholesterol problem twice
as bad.
</P>
<P>
   Tightly controlling fluctuating blood sugar protects diabetics
from the disease's deadly complications. Patients check daily
glucose levels with finger-prick blood tests. But about every three
months, they also need an ''A1C'' or ''hemoglobin A1C'' test. This
more intricate blood test measures how well you're doing over time,
so doctors know if you need a medication change.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cheap test, usually $15 to $30. Yet ''people aren't
getting it,'' Fradkin laments. No one knows why; maybe because so
many diabetics get care from doctors who aren't diabetes
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who do get A1C testing, half discover they're not
adequately treated, prompting the federal diabetes program to urge
more aggressive therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwin urges Americans to take an active role. Ask your doctor
about screening if you're at risk, and if you have diabetes: ''Ask
about A1C testing every time you walk into the doctor's office'' to
ensure you get that test on time.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Outraged Over Terrorist Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department expressed outrage Monday
over warnings by the militant Islamic group Hezbollah that American
envoys would be sent home in coffins if the United States were to
move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such violent threats deserve condemnation of the entire
international community,'' spokesman Philip Reeker said. ''This
illustrates once again why that organization is on our list of
terrorist organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said Sunday in Lebanon
that if the embassy were shifted to Jerusalem, ''the honorable
(Arab) people can turn your embassy to rubble and return your
diplomats in coffins.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at a rally in the southern Lebanese village of
Jibsheet.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Friday that the United States was
considering whether to move the embassy from Tel Aviv before the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was reviewing the issue in light of what he regarded
as a greater willingness by the Israelis than the Palestinians to
take risks for peace at the recently concluded summit in Camp
David.

<HEADLINE> Governor, Republicans deny report on party battle  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - New York Republicans, including Gov. George
Pataki, flatly denied a published report that a behind-the-scenes
battle is underway to remove state party chairman William Powers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no truth to it,'' Pataki said Monday. ''Chairman
Powers is a friend of mine and from my standpoint he should be
chairman as long as he wants to be. He's been an outstanding
chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   In its Monday editions, the New York Post said Pataki and his
allies also are looking to strip Powers' control over Victory 2000,
a ''soft money'' fund-raising committee, and give it to Thomas
Doherty, the governor's appointments officer.
</P>
<P>
   Losing control of Victory 2000 would weaken Powers and help
pressure him out of the chairmanship, the Post said in a report
that quoted anonymous sources.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, say New York Republicans asked at their party's national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's totally not true,'' Powers spokesman Dan Allen said.
''It's a fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen pointed out that Pataki and Powers appeared together or
within moments of each other at both New York GOP welcoming parties
in Philadelphia on Sunday. That would not have happened if the two
were feuding, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican commentator Roger Stone said the question is more
about who controls the millions of dollars that will flow through
Victory 2000 more than the chairmanship. But now that a story about
a possible coup has gone public, Powers probably cannot be removed,
Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he survives and his survival is not by a small
margin,'' Stone said. ''The county chairmen love him and he hasn't
made any major enemies throughout the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Powers is credited with building the Republican Party into a
fund-raising machine since taking he chairmanship in the early
1990s. Its resources helped get Pataki elected governor in 1994
against Democratic incumbent Mario Cuomo, but the GOP suffered
setbacks in the 1998 elections when incumbent Republican Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato and Attorney General Dennis Vacco both lost
re-election bids.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City Monday, Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said
he didn't know anything more about an alleged move to remove Powers
than was in the Post.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Bill Powers is an exceptional party chairman. ... He's
been about as successful a party chairman as we've ever had,''
Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He helped elect me mayor, played a big role in helping me get
elected. ... He played a very big role in electing George Pataki
governor in 1994.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who nonetheless angered Powers in 1994 by endorsing
Cuomo for re-election, said he supports the chairman ''very
strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I just have tremendous respect for him as a political
professional,'' the mayor said.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Drug Prices To Rise  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Older Americans are paying twice as much for
their prescription drugs as they did in 1992, and prices are
expected to soar over the next decade, says a group which advocates
drug coverage by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA, in a study released Monday, argued that unless
national policy makers get these costs covered by Medicare,
prescription drugs will be even less affordable for people over 65,
many of whom have to get a dozen prescriptions filled a week.
</P>
<P>
   Said Families USA executive director Ron Pollack: ''When they go
to the pharmacy, they pay higher prices for their drugs than
anyone, because there's no one bargaining on their behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   Families USA released a study saying that Americans 65 and older
pay an average of $1,205 a year for prescriptions -- up from $559 in
1992 -- and will shell out $2,810 apiece by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drugs now account for about 10 percent of seniors'
health costs -- and will probably rise to 13.3 percent in 2010, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   The burden of paying for drugs fall disproportionately on older
people, the group said, noting that Americans 65 and over pay 42
cents of every dollar spent on prescription drugs, even though they
account for only 13 percent of the population. The report said they
also pay more per pill because their purchases account for only 34
percent of total prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The study said the average senior's cost per prescription has
risen dramatically, from $28.50 in 1992 to $42.30 now, and is
projected to jump to $72.94 in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   This is bad news, Pollack said, at a time when seniors also are
buying more prescriptions than ever. The elderly got by on about 20
prescriptions per year in 1992, but now buy about 29 annually, he
said, and are expected to buy about 39 by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on data gathered by Medicare, the federal
health plan for the aged and disabled. Projections for future costs
were developed by the PRIME Institute, a consulting group at the
University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, said much of the increase in
seniors' drug spending is driven by advanced drugs that are more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's good news for patients, for whom medicines are the most
cost-effective form of health care,'' he said. ''They keep patients
out of the hospital, off the surgery table, on the job and in the
home.''
</P>
<P>
   PhRMA spokesman Jeffrey L. Trewhitt said the report's figures
belie the hidden benefits of advanced drugs. New cardiac
medications, for instance, may cost an elderly patient $1,200
annually, but far less than a $42,000 heart operation.
</P>
<P>
   PhRMA supports expansion of drug coverage through private-sector
insurance. Judith H. Bello, the group's executive vice president,
told Congress in June that lawmakers should allow free-market
competition and consumer choice to contain costs.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has urged Congress to strengthen and modernize
Medicare with a voluntary prescription drug benefit to all 39
million Medicare beneficiaries regardless of income. Republican
congressional leaders say the drug coverage should be reserved for
the most financially needy.

<HEADLINE> McGreevey campaign gets boost from Newark mayor, Senate leader  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Democrat Jim McGreevey's campaign for
governor got the backing Monday of about 30 elected officials,
including Newark Mayor Sharpe James and state Senate Minority
Leader Richard J. Codey.
</P>
<P>
   The show of support here for the Woodbridge mayor included seven
of the state's 21 county Democratic chairmen, dealing a blow to
U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli, who announced 12 days ago that he
planned to seek the party's nomination for governor next year.
</P>
<P>
   State party chairman Thomas Giblin did not attend, but said
later, ''I think that Senator Torricelli would also have been a
strong candidate, but I think it's kind of critical now that he
re-examine his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''His original intent was to serve as a unifying force for the
New Jersey Democratic Party, north and south. That goal doesn't
seem to be attainable. There seems to be grass-roots support for
Mayor McGreevey.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli had no immediate response, his office said. He had
said he would run only if he decides the state party will heal its
geographic and personal divisions and unite around him.
</P>
<P>
   James, mayor of the state's largest city and also a state
senator, said a battle leading to the 2001 primary would hurt the
party's efforts to elect Al Gore president and Jon Corzine to the
U.S. Senate this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that McGreevey almost unseated Gov. Christie Whitman in
1997, James said, ''Against all the odds, he's been campaigning to
put a Democrat in the Statehouse. It can be done if we stay the
course.''
</P>
<P>
   James and Codey both said they supported Torricelli for Senate,
but remained committed to McGreevey, whom they backed for governor
before.
</P>
<P>
   Codey described the ''anguish'' of the past two weeks in
considering the candidacies of both men.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want someone to bring home the bacon, it's Bob
Torricelli. If you want someone to fight for you, it's Bob
Torricelli,'' said Codey, who was joined by several ranking Senate
colleagues, including Raymond J. Lesniak of Union County and John
A. Lynch of Middlesex County.
</P>
<P>
   Codey said he spoke earlier in the day to Torricelli: ''He was
extremely gracious and understanding of my own personal
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey, 42, who has run nearly non-stop for governor for six
years, took a swipe at his possible challenger while surrounded by
supporters, including mayors from a half-dozen towns in Essex
County and many officials from his base in Middlesex County, where
he heads the state's fourth-largest municipality.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democratic Party is greater than any individual's
political ambitions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, McGreevey said he had spoken to Torricelli, but said he
had not asked the first-term senator to forgo a statehouse race. He
described the conversation as ''personal'' and declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering demonstrated that McGreevey had support from one
end of the state to another and that he was not intimidated by
Torricelli, whose fund-raising prowess led to his leadership of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The county chairmen attending were from Bergen - Torricelli's
base - as well as Atlantic, Cape May, Middlesex, Ocean, Somerset
and Union counties.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, McGreevey had two events to showcase his support from
labor unions.

<HEADLINE> Group Attacks Indian Army Camp  </HEADLINE>
By QAISER MIRZA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- A Pakistani-based rebel group opposed to
a cease-fire in Kashmir attacked Indian security forces in the
disputed state, killing at least three soldiers, officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The assault on the Indian army camp Sunday night was the first
attack since a three-month cease-fire was announced July 24 between
the Indian army and the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen militant group.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Usama, a spokesman for the Pakistani-based Lashkar-e-Toiba,
called The Associated Press on Monday and said the attack was in
retaliation for the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
   At least three soldiers were killed and five wounded, police
said. The Press Trust of India, however, said six soldiers were
killed. The differing reports could not be reconciled immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Usama said his group killed ''many soldiers'' in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, suspected militants fired at policemen in a crowded
shopping area in the Kashmir capital of Srinagar, seriously
wounding at least two officers, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In another attack, suspected militants threw a hand grenade at a
paramilitary patrol, wounding two soldiers and three civilians in
downtown Srinagar, police said.
</P>
<P>
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Kashmir is controlled by India and the rest by
Pakistan. The two nuclear-armed neighbors have fought two of their
three wars over Kashmir and battled each other with artillery and
mortar fire for 11 weeks last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The violence has killed more than 25,000 people since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Indian leaders have said that no talks can be held on the
separation of Kashmir from India, arguing that according to the
Indian constitution Kashmir is a part of India.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas say they will not talk to the Indian government
if it puts forward any conditions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Archbishop Endorses Evangelicals  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD N. OSTLING
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- The Archbishop of Canterbury,
speaking Monday to an international conference of evangelical
Protestants, endorsed their belief that ''the Christian faith is as
relevant today as it has ever been, and the need for a Savior is as
urgent as ever.''
</P>
<P>
   George Carey, introduced as a fellow evangelical, leads the
world's 77 million Anglicans and Episcopalians, and is the Church
of England's 103rd primate since the year 597. Yet many listeners
were from far younger and much different churches in the developing
world, where Christianity's demographic future lies.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, summoned by an ailing and absent the Rev. Billy
Graham, announced that 10,287 attendees have come from 209 nations
and territories, confirming this as the largest and most diverse
world meeting of the thriving evangelical movement.
</P>
<P>
   Though the United States has the largest delegation, 2,767,
nearly two-thirds are from outside Europe and North America. The
next biggest delegations, in order, are: India, Ghana, Kenya, South
Africa, Australia, Brazil, Canada and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Carey said Anglicanism prizes open thought but ''the truly
worrying aspect today is a radical liberalism, an enemy to us all,
that denies the teaching of the church down the centuries and
denies the authority of the Scriptures, for 2,000 years the base of
historic Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   But he warned his conservative audience against lapsing into
fundamentalism, anti-intellectualism or suppression of honest
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Carey also echoed the evangelicals' insistence that Jesus Christ
was not just a visionary teacher ''but the only Lord and only
Savior.''
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop mentioned obedience to biblical morals but did
not mention the debate among Anglican bishops over homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, England's bishops and the Anglican hierarchy worldwide
voted strongly against homosexual activity. But individual bishops
in America's Episcopal Church and several other nations are free to
follow liberal policies, much to the distress of growing churches
in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Carey spoke, a key evangelical Anglican leader told
a media conference the archbishop has been ''very brave'' in
opposing homosexual relations. ''I am certain he will continue''
said the Rev. John Stott, a former London rector and globe-trotting
Bible teacher the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Carey was picketed when he preached in May at the United
Methodist Church General Conference in Cleveland. Dozens of
demonstrators were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Stott, who had given a major address on the Bible, said the
church must uphold heterosexual monogamy: ''I cannot understand how
anybody who submits to the lordship of Jesus Christ and the
authority of Scripture can come to any other conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker on Scripture was Graham's daughter, Anne Graham
Lotz of Raleigh, N.C., who has traveled as a Bible teacher since
1988 and is holding her own revival meetings for the first time
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, now 81, is undergoing outpatient treatment at the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., after an operation to relieve a
fluid buildup on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Lotz greeted her father, who is monitoring the meeting by
satellite TV, and said, ''You were all invited by Billy Graham and
when you arrived he was not even here. Were you shaken? I was
shaken. When your life is shaken, don't look at what's shaking you.
Look up!'' she said, pointing heavenward.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees were asked to write thousands of personal messages to
Graham that will be shipped Tuesday to Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Bombs Level Colombian Town  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A picturesque mountain town lay in ruins
Monday after rebels detonated explosives in front of a church, a
bank, a clinic and other buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Arboleda, 90 miles northwest of the capital, Bogota, looked as
if it had been hit by a major earthquake. White-walled
colonial-style buildings lay in heaps, with some facades tilting at
crazy angles.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian troops and police searching through the rubble after
the two-day attack by hundreds of rebels found the bodies of at
least eight police officers, part of an estimated 25-member
contingent that tried to fight off the attack for two days. Four
civilians, including the wife of a policeman, were also dead.
</P>
<P>
   At least three survivors were found among the local police
force.
</P>
<P>
   Security forces who arrived in Arboleda on Sunday evening aboard
U.S.-built combat helicopters swept through the green hills outside
town, searching for the rest of the police contingent, believed to
number about 10. The missing officers were feared dead, Colombia's
national police chief, Gen. Ernesto Gilibert, told local radio
stations.
</P>
<P>
   A resident, identified only as Duvan, told Caracol Radio that
hundreds of heavily-armed rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC, arrived in Arboleda on Saturday. They packed
a van and a car with dynamite and planted gas-bombs around the town
and then detonated the bombs, Duvan said.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas then hurled pipe bombs at the local police
barracks to finish off any survivors not killed in the initial
blast which leveled most of the building, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on national television from the wrecked town, police
Col. Norberto Pelaez said 10 police officers were dead, although
officials in Bogota insisted the confirmed number was eight.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll was likely to rise even further, Pelaez said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe there are four, five or six other officers that are
victims of this attack,'' Pelaez said. ''This is a sad, sad
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels abandoned the town, located in a coffee-growing area
in the Andes Mountains, on Sunday and clashed with advancing
government troops. One government soldier was wounded in the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel attacks in the last three weeks have killed more than 30
police officers nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Gloomy weather: Cooler, wetter summer helps some, hurts others  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Tables are in place, red and yellow
flowers in bloom and waiters ready to serve at the patio outside
Hot Tomato's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing missing: the customers.
</P>
<P>
   July's rain has been gloomy - and expensive, manager Lawrence
Popper said Monday. Last week's weather washed out $15,000 in
business for the downtown Hartford eatery, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rain kills us,'' Popper said. ''People do like to sit
outside on the patio.''
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures are cooler and rain more plentiful than usual
throughout southern New England this summer, said Kimberly
McCartney, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in
Taunton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   While the thermometer reached 90 degrees or higher at Bradley
International Airport on 14 days in July 1999, it happened only
once - on July 10 - last month, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Normal precipitation for July is 3.08 inches at Bradley,
McCartney added, but last month saw 5.2 inches of the wet stuff.
</P>
<P>
   And the forecast for the rest of the week is equally grim:
McCartney predicts more clouds, showers and possible thunderstorms
through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure in August we'll rebound,'' she said. ''Summer's not
over. We still have August and September.''
</P>
<P>
   But July is the heart of vacation season and for some, such as
Candace Collins-Boden, executive director of the Provincetown
Chamber of Commerce, the weather is taking a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is down as much 25 percent in Provincetown and
throughout Cape Cod, Collins-Boden said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely a big difference in how many people are here
compared to last July,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins-Boden said local retailers and tourism officials are
growing weary of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's a little bit damp and soggy and moldy at this
point,'' she said. ''We really need some sunshine.''
</P>
<P>
   At Killington Ski Area in Vermont, resort spokesman Steve Wright
said visits to the alpine water slides at Pico mountain have been
fewer this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one has been all that interested in cooling off,'' Wright
said. ''We've been joking around that if it stays cold we might as
well get the snow-guns out.''
</P>
<P>
   The wet weather also has affected the work of Connecticut's
Department of Transportation, particularly paving and linestriping,
said construction administrator Arthur Gruhn. Last week, nearly 30
cars were damaged on Interstate 84 in East Hartford when an asphalt
ramp connecting a section of newly paved highway to the existing
road deteriorated because of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Others are not complaining.
</P>
<P>
   There may be fewer people in New Hampshire's Lakes Region this
year, but the owner of Hart's Turkey Farm Restaurant in Meredith
said her establishment ''is busier because people have to go
somewhere to get out of the rain.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People are going to the beach less but are eating more and
shopping more,'' Dale Hart said. ''So, it's been pretty good for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Business at tanning salons has been bright.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eight straight days with no sun will do it,'' said James
Young, general manager of Sun Capsule tanning salon in South
Windsor, Conn. ''People need their sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lou Long, an employee of Suncenter 2000 tanning salon in
Hyannis, Mass., agreed that cool weather means more customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're probably as a busy now as we are in the beginning of the
fall,'' said Long, who's worked at the salon for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cool temperatures, Fahrenheit Mechanical Services in
Enfield, Conn., has installed a record number of residential air
conditioning units this year, said office manager Debra Barrepski.
She said customers began scheduling appointments as early as May
because of the strong economy and last summer's heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it had been any warmer, we would have been worse off trying
to get the work done,'' Barrepski said.
</P>
<P>
   A group of construction workers spent their lunch break Monday
relaxing on the benches around Bushnell Park in Hartford under
cloudy skies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The weather stinks,'' said George Johnson of Eastford, Conn.
''The job site is awfully wet, damp and muddy.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the less-than-perfect conditions weren't going to
keep the men from dining al fresco.
</P>
<P>
   ''We rough it,'' Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> US: Fujimori Didn't Outline Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The State Department expressed disappointment
on Monday that Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori stopped short of
outlining a comprehensive plan for promoting the country's
democratic development.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Philip Reeker said that Fujimori, in his inaugural
address last Friday initiating his third term, promised to
introduce legislation to reform the intelligence and security
services.
</P>
<P>
   But he regretted that Fujimori did not have more to say on the
reform recommendations made by a high-level Organization of
American States delegation in June.
</P>
<P>
   Those recommendations included reforms in the judicial system,
protection of human rights and freedom of expression and of the
press.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS recommendations were delivered to Fujimori in June
following an election criticized by the United States, other
countries and many Peruvians as falling short of international
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker also expressed regret over the death of six persons
during inaugural day demonstrations protesting Fujimori's continued
rule.

<HEADLINE> Profile of New Israeli President  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Three decades ago, when he was elected mayor of
an impoverished desert town, Moshe Katsav was an angry young man --
one of the Israelis of Middle Eastern background who were
challenging the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he was elected president of Israel, another sign that
those once dismissed as marginal have joined Israel's elite.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian-born Katsav defeated Shimon Peres, a former prime
minister and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who had been considered a
shoo-in for election by the Knesset's 120 legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Peres -- born in Europe, and a government official virtually
since Israel's establishment in 1948 -- once epitomized the
establishment. Katsav denied his was an ''ethnic'' candidacy, but
could not refrain from noting his humble roots.
</P>
<P>
   ''After all, I am the first generation of the original
immigration from Muslim countries to Israel,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled his youth in immigrant tent encampments, and then in
Kiryat Malachi, one of the failed ''development'' towns Israel's
first governments built to populate the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Kiryat Malachi was Katsav's first success: in 1969, aged 24, he
was elected mayor, Israel's youngest ever.
</P>
<P>
   There was a wave of such elections across Israel in the 1960s
and 1970s, an uprising against the dominant Labor party, which
dismissed the series of upstart victories as an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   That was a mistake: the Likud -- until then a one-note
ultranationalist party -- stepped into the breech and cultivated the
angry mayors. Katsav, a university student when he elected, was
especially notable: he led demonstrations outside the Knesset
demanding greater services for towns like his.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, he was inside the Knesset, elected the same year the
Likud came to power, swept in on a wave of nationalism and social
resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Katsav was already an able political player -- ''municipalities
are the best school for politics,'' said Likud colleague Meir
Shetreet.
</P>
<P>
   Katsav was a deputy minister by 1981, and a labor minister by
1984, a year shy of his 40th birthday. He was a tireless
campaigner, making appearances at constituents' weddings and bar
mitzvahs. He was criticized for granting too many favors, at one
point forced by the state comptroller to fire a slew of political
appointments from his transport ministry.
</P>
<P>
   His political savvy proved invaluable this week, when he used
his own religious observance to persuade religious legislators who
had committed to Peres to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning upset. Trashing earlier media predictions of a
65-45 victory for Peres, with 10 abstentions, Katsav secured 63
votes to take the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Katsav said legislators favored his homey approach to the
international statesman Peres has become.
</P>
<P>
   ''The international status of Shimon Peres stood before their
eyes, but it would seem they preferred a different style ...
calmer, quieter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, Katsav has never been consistent. As
transport minister from 1988-92 -- the years of the Palestinian
uprising he sounded a hard anti-Arab line. In 1989, Katsav made
headlines when an aide ordered a journalist off Katsav's bus for
reading an Arabic newspaper, saying the language ''upsets the
minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in 1993 in opposition, he was the first mainstream Likud
figure to call on his colleagues to accept the breakthrough Oslo
accords negotiated by the Labor government.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues said his election was no surprise. Twenty-three
years after the Likud's first revolutionary victory, those in the
margins had joined the power elite.
</P>
<P>
   ''The election of Moshe Katsav shows that anyone can be
president,'' Shetreet told Israel TV. ''Now everyone will be judged
on their ability.''

<HEADLINE> Gubernatorial candidate plans October wedding  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Woodbridge Mayor Jim McGreevey hopes to win
a four-year term as governor in November 2001. But more than a year
before that, he will be getting hitched for a longer term, his
fiancee said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dina Matos said they are planning to marry in October. She was
with McGreevey on Monday as he was endorsed by about 30 Democratic
officials from around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Matos has made appearances with McGreevey in the past. The
engagement had not been widely publicized, however.
</P>
<P>
   She said she is a Newark native who now lives in Elizabeth. She
works in the public relations office of Columbus Hospital in
Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Matos, 33, said she met McGreevey, 42, at a fund-raiser three
years ago - a fitting locale for a man who has been running for
governor nearly non-stop for six years. He narrowly lost to
incumbent Christie Whitman in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey was still married, but separated, during that race.
His then-wife, Kari, and their daughter, Morag, then 4, had already
moved to Vancouver, Canada, where Kari filed for divorce in May
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce was finalized ''several years ago,'' McGreevey
campaign consultant Brad Lawrence said. He did not immediately have
a more specific date.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Regis Philbin may have lost his 15-year co-host
last week, but he got hefty ratings in return.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday's ''Live with Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee'' farewell for

people watching TV tuned in to see Gifford bid goodbye to her fans
and Philbin. That represents an estimated 7 million viewers
overall, compared with a typical audience of 4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The full farewell week scored a 77 percent increase in audience

<HEADLINE> Hijack Passengers Lose Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Five passengers on a hijacked Afghan plane that
landed in Britain earlier this year have lost their appeal against
the government's decision to send them home.
</P>
<P>
   A judge at London's Immigration Appeals Center ruled Monday that
the five, who are seeking asylum in Britain, did not have a
well-founded fear of persecution in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The five men, who were not identified by name, were aboard the
Ariana Airlines plane seized by gunmen during an internal flight in
February. The hijacking ended four days later at Stansted airport
north of London with the surrender of the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   The five are among a group of 31 people appealing a decision by
Britain's top law-enforcement official, Jack Straw, to return them
to Afghanistan. Eleven cases were dismissed last week, while 15
have yet to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 rejected so far are expected to make a further appeal to
the Immigration Appeals Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   One asylum applicant, an 18-year-old student, said he feared
being conscripted into the military by Afghanistan's Taliban
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm 18 years old, I should have an education -- forcing me to
fight is an illegal act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Hubert Dunn dismissed his claim, saying that other men in
Afghanistan were placed in the same situation.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the plane's passengers were granted refugee status in
Britain. The majority of those on board the plane returned home
voluntarily to Afghanistan after the hijacking.

<HEADLINE> Barak Survives No-Confidence Vote  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak survived an attempt
to bring down his government and bought himself time to push the
peace process Monday, but he lost another battle when his party's
candidate for president was defeated in an upset vote.
</P>
<P>
   In an embarrassing day for Barak in parliament, legislators
first voted 63-57 to elect Moshe Katsav, an Iranian-born legislator
from the opposition Likud Party, as Israel's eighth president.
Katsav bested Shimon Peres, a Nobel Peace laureate and former prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Barak survived a no-confidence vote, beating
back a challenge by those opposed to his willingness to concede
land to the Palestinians in exchange for peace. The 120-member
Knesset voted 50-50, with eight abstentions and 12 legislators not
present -- 11 votes short of the outright majority needed to oust
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the blows to his prestige, there was a bright side for
Barak: The vote came two days before the end of the Knesset's
summer session, and legislators won't reconvene until late October.
That gives Barak a three-month respite from parliamentary
challenges to try to conclude a deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have set a deadline of Sept. 13 for a final peace
agreement resolving thorny issues including control of Jerusalem,
the borders of a Palestinian state and the fate of Palestinian
refugees who want to return to their former homes in what is now
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told the legislators that while he could not command a
majority in parliament for a peace accord now, he was confident the
mood would shift once a deal is presented to the Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
   In a voice husky with emotion, Barak accused the opposition and
defectors from his coalition of following their own narrow
interests, rather than the public good.
</P>
<P>
   ''I turn to each and every one of you and say, 'Rise above
small-minded politics in order to bring peace to Israel,''' Barak
told legislators before the no-confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
   Hanan Ashrawi, a legislator in the Palestinian parliament, said
the three-month break gives Barak a chance to move more decisively
in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can rescue peace from the jaws of disaster should they
wish to use this time wisely,'' she told Associated Press
Television News.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Peres, 76 -- a former prime minister who led his
reluctant nation to peace talks with the Palestinians in 1993 --
looked stunned when the result of the presidential vote was
announced. He had been considered a shoo-in.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to maintain his composure, the dapper, silver-haired
Peres, who has lost four of five elections for prime minister,
would only say he wished Katsav well. The humiliating defeat
appeared to spell the end to an often turbulent political career
that has spanned half a century, though Peres still holds a Knesset
seat and has said he will campaign for peace no matter what his
position.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's presidency is largely ceremonial, but the incumbent --
Ezer Weizman, who was forced to resign because of fraud allegations
-- has used the prestige of the post in support of Mideast peace
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Peres had been expected to turn the presidency into a platform
for assisting the peace negotiators. By contrast, Katsav, as a
member of Likud, opposes far-reaching concessions to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The jubilant Katsav, who was born in Iran and immigrated to
Israel at age 6, said he hoped to help heal Israel's many divisions
-- between Sephardi Jews of Middle Eastern and Ashkenazi Jews of
European descent, between secular and religious, between rich and
poor, between new immigrants and veteran residents.
</P>
<P>
   In Katsav's predominantly Sephardi hometown of Kiryat Malachi,
Monday's vote was celebrated as a victory over Israel's
Ashkenazi-dominated elites. However, Peres apparently had been the
preferred choice of a majority of Israelis, according to informal
opinion surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Katsav began his political career at 24 as mayor of Kiryat
Malachi. He has served as a Likud legislator since 1977, always
loyal to the party's leaders, but showing little charisma. Katsav
has held several second-tier Cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox Shas party, which draws its support from
religiously observant Sephardi Jews, voted as a bloc for Katsav
despite expectations that some of the faction's 17 lawmakers would
back Peres.
</P>
<P>
   Shas officials said one of the party's spiritual leaders, Rabbi
Yitzhak Kadouri, who is believed to be around 100 years old, had a
vision Sunday that Katsav was favored by the heavens. As a result,
Kadouri aides mounted a phone campaign, urging legislators of Shas
and other factions to back Katsav.
</P>
<P>
   The Shas vote for Katsav, coupled with its support for the
Likud's no-confidence motion over the peace talks, was seen as a
strong signal that the party will not return to Barak's coalition
in the near future. Shas' support is seen as crucial for Barak to
win a required 61-vote majority in parliament for an eventual peace
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, along with two hawkish factions, left Barak's government
before the summit at Camp David. The three parties said they were
concerned Barak would make too many concessions to the
Palestinians, especially over the future of Jerusalem.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Fifty thousand permanent-resident U.S. visas
will be awarded through a lottery to people wanting to move to this
country or upgrade their immigration status here, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Applications for the visa lottery, which is run by the U.S.
Department of State, will be accepted between Oct. 2 and Nov. 1.
Those selected by the lottery become eligible to apply for a green
card, or permanent-resident visa.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very valuable process,'' Giuliani said. ''I wish
that it were more than 50,000 people and I wish that we would
actually make America more open to immigrants. ... This is the
single most important reason for the success of New York -
immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   The visa lottery is designed to expand the number of countries
from which new immigrants come. It is open to anyone overseas or in
the United States, except for residents of the following countries:
Canada, China (not including Hong Kong), Colombia, the Dominican
Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Pakistan, the
Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom (not including
Northern Ireland) and Vietnam.

York Immigration Hotline at (718) 899-4000.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the visa lottery is free, and warned applicants to
avoid people who ask for money to help with the visa process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anybody asking for money is trying to defraud you,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Military Recruitment Climbing Up  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It looks like the big recruiting push at the
Pentagon is beginning to pay off, with thousands more men and women
reported signing up for military service this year.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1997, all four services are expected to
meet their enlistment goals this year, officials said Monday,
crediting an unprecedented ad campaign, more creative use of the
Internet, more recruiters and a host of incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Incentives offered in the last couple years -- to draw new
recruits or keep those in the service from leaving -- include such
things as better pay, more enlistment bonuses, shorter service time
and computers in barracks for those who want to get an online
education while they serve.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're happy, but ... not celebrating,'' said Air Force
recruiting spokesman Master Sgt. Tom Clements, predicting the
Pentagon will continue to face an uphill battle in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said the slump in recruiting in recent years is
owed partly to higher-paying civilian jobs in the strong U.S.
economy, a higher rate of people going to college and the fact that
fewer young people nowadays know anyone in uniform or think of the
military as a possible career.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we cannot do is ... relax,'' said Army recruiting
director Col. Kevin T. Kelley. ''We have to keep on going because
it's still a very competitive market place.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kelley said, officials are ''very optimistic and
positive'' about the results they've gotten so far from what the
Air Force has called a ''war on recruiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Marines regularly meet their sign-up goals, the Army,
Air Force and Navy have not always been as successful.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy made its goal last year, but in 1998 fell 7,000 short
of the 55,000 recruits it was looking for. The Army failed to get
enough people in the last two years and the Air Force last year
missed its goal for the first time in 20 years as pilots turned
their backs on the military for jobs with commercial airlines.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the Air Force signed up the 34,000 recruits
it was looking for by July 18, with two months left in the fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   And the Army says it expects to sign up 12,000 more people than
last year. In 1999, it recruited only about 68,000 instead of the
74,000 goal. So far this year it has singed 76,000 and expects to
meet the goal of 80,000 before the year ending Sept. 31, said
Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   Clements said officials have not completely studied the reasons
for the improved showing, but think it is due in part to increased
and more strategically placed television advertising, an increase
in the number of recruiters used and an ''attractive, revamped web
page'' which he said was the Air Force's best source for finding
possible recruits this year. He said some of the incentives
included shorter enlistment time for some jobs and more bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley credited the improvement in Army figures with a focus on
recruitment ''from top leadership down'' which came up with new
methods for recruiting such as focusing on college students more
than before. New incentives included a program in which several
corporation have pledged to give preferential hiring treatment to
those who've completed their service. Another allows the enlistee
to attend two years of college before joining the Army, giving a
monthly stipend during those studies.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, the pay increases approved by the government in
recent years have helped.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that has a positive effect, and not only for what
people see who are looking at the Army from the outside,'' said
Kelley. ''Those who are in the Army see that they are being taken
care of and will be positive spokespersons as well.''

<HEADLINE> Killer of gas station attendant gets life sentence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) - A man who robbed and killed a Pequannock
gas station attendant in a shooting captured on videotape was
sentenced Monday to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   John Kenny DiLoreto, 21, was also sentenced to a consecutive
20-year term for robbery, meaning he will have to spend more than
80 years in prison before becoming eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   A Morris County jury could not reach a unanimous verdict earlier
this year on whether DiLoreto should receive a death sentence for
killing Pakistani native Mohammad Anjum on April 8, 1998, during a
robbery at his gas station.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors played a videotape of DiLoreto firing at Anjum after
the attendant handed over $250 in cash. Two surveillance cameras
showed the robber firing at the attendant, leaving, then returning
to shoot the attendant several more times after seeing through the
station's window that the first shot didn't injure him.
</P>
<P>
   DiLoreto answered yes or no questions but made no statement to
Superior Court Judge B. Theodore Bozonelis before his sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   DiLoreto pleaded guilty to all the charges against him,
including felony murder and armed robbery, in March.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial, jurors decided that several mitigating factors
existed that prevented a death sentence, including DiLoreto's age
at the time of the killing - 19 - drug addiction and post-traumatic
stress disorder. A defense psychologist also testified that
DiLoreto was sexually abused as a child.

<HEADLINE> West Nile spraying planned in Staten Island, Rockland and Suffolk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Pesticide spraying was planned for Monday night
and Tuesday in Rockland and Suffolk counties and Wednesday on
Staten Island as part of an ongoing effort to fight the West Nile
virus, health officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Rockland County was to be sprayed for mosquitoes from 10 p.m.
Monday through 5 a.m. Tuesday in the town of Clarkstown, including
the village of Upper Nyack and parts of the villages of Nyack and
Spring Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying was also scheduled for Ramapo starting at 11 p.m
Tuesday through 5 a.m. Wednesday. Affected areas include parts of
Spring Valley, Kaser and New Hempstead and all of New Square.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, Rockland county residents can call (914)
364-8990 or visit www.co.rockland.ny.us on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced plans for more
spraying on Staten Island, where 13 dead birds have tested positive
for the West Nile virus. Giuliani said Staten Island appeared to
have more infected birds and mosquitoes than the city's other four
boroughs, which is why spraying has been focused there.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Cohen, the city's health commissioner, said that 10 to 20
percent of Staten Island's mosquitoes survived two earlier rounds
of spraying, and that they were beginning to breed. Tests of birds
and mosquitoes show the virus is still present in Staten Island, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing a reemergence of mosquitoes,'' he said at a City
Hall news conference. ''There's a significant amount of viral
transmission in the borough.''
</P>
<P>
   Spraying of all areas of Staten Island was scheduled for 10 p.m.
Wednesday through 5 a.m. Thursday, weather permitting. Details are
available at (877) WNV-4NYC or www.nyc.gov/health.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk County canceled aerial spraying scheduled for Monday
night because of rain, but ground spraying was still planned for
parts of Western Oakdale, Eastern Oakdale, Sayville, Bellport
Village and Quogue.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying was planned Tuesday night in Mastic Beach and South
Shirley and late Tuesday afternoon in Point O'Woods and Atlantique
on Fire Island. Details are available at (631) 852-4939 or
www.co.suffolk.ny.us.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials suggest staying indoors during spraying, with
windows shut and air conditioners and fans turned off.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Economy Grows 7 Percent  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's economy grew by more than 7 percent over
the first half of this year, a top Cabinet member said Monday,
playing down fears that economic growth is tapering off.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Premier Viktor Khristenko announced the latest economic
indicators after a weekly Cabinet session Monday headed by
President Vladimir Putin, who is riding high after a string of
political victories last week.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's budget topped the meeting's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's top statistician echoed Khristenko's optimism. ''In the
first half of the year almost all indicators were positive,'' State
Statistics Committee chairman Vladimir Sokolin told a news
conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Khristenko said inflation for July would not exceed 1 percent,
and that the yearly inflation rate would be 18 to 20 percent --
instead of the 35 percent that experts predicted after prices
surged by 2.6 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolin said that industrial production was up 10 percent in the
first six months of 2000, and that investment was up 14.2 percent
from last year. But he projected inflation for June at 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Personal income and spending are also climbing, though most of
Russia's wealth is still concentrated among a small portion of the
population, Sokolin said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the State Statistics Committee, the average monthly
wage in June was 2,290 rubles, or $82. That is up from 1,578 rubles
a year earlier, which at the time was worth about $66.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economy has enjoyed a boost over the past year,
following the 1998 financial collapse and a decade of almost
constant decline. Rising oil prices have helped, since Russia is a
major oil exporter, and a lower ruble has aided domestic producers
by making imports more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruble has been climbing against the dollar, analysts
warn that oil prices are due to fall, and investors say deep
structural changes are needed for the economy to thrive. Economics
and Trade Minister German Gref said in an interview published
Monday that growth in 2001 would be lower than this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economic dynamics of recent months are forcing us to
clarify the parameters of annual inflation, GDP growth (and) the
ruble rate'' for the 2001 budget, he told the newspaper Vedomosti.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's Cabinet meeting also discussed this year's harvest,
Khristenko said, without elaborating. Khristenko is leading the
government while Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov is on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's harvest has been dismal for the past two years and
prompted food aid from the West. This year's harvest is projected
to be better, but still well below average.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's budget discussion came after the upper house of
parliament passed a new tax code last week that Putin says is
necessary to improve the economy. He says the code, which includes
replacing the progressive income tax with a flat, 13 percent tax,
will reduce rampant tax evasion and spur investment.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of the code was seen as a victory for Putin, who is
trying to rein in the often authoritarian regional bosses who make
up the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council.

<HEADLINE> Search on for school bus drivers  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Last year a local school bus company was
so desperate it offered $40,000 to a parent-teacher group if
members could recruit 50 new drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the enticement, the offer netted just nine referrals and
only one permanent driver.
</P>
<P>
   With the start of the new school year just a month away, some
communities are bracing again for a driver shortage. The economy
continues to thrive and bus companies are struggling to attract
people for the part-time driver's jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, we're going to be facing the same situation. I
haven't heard anything that's been done differently,'' said Dudley
Williams Jr., president of the Stamford Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Stamford's bus provider, Laidlaw Transit, has blamed a shortage
of drivers for service problems that have plagued the district for
years. Last year, parents complained frequently about late buses or
no buses at all, especially early in the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're literally stealing instructional time from these kids.
It's ridiculous,'' said Wanda Kowalski, co-president of Stamford's
Parent-Teacher Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's fair to the kids. That's the real issue
here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Middletown the driver shortage forced high school coaches to
obtain commercial drivers licenses so they could take athletes to
games, said David Larson, who recently retired as superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Larson, who is now executive director of the Connecticut
Association of Public School Superintendents, said the shortage is
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Districts are going without drivers,'' Larson said. ''It's
taking longer to get children to and from school.''
</P>
<P>
   Westport's bus provider, Dattco Inc., has openings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could usually use seven or eight (more) bus drivers,'' said
Myles MacVane, the local safety supervisor for Dattco.
</P>
<P>
   MacVane said he believes the booming economy has hurt
recruitment efforts by bus companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of these people are trying to support families on a
part-time job driving a school bus, which is very, very
difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Westport, Dattco's starting pay for drivers is $11.25 per
hour, which increases to $12.45 after a year.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Murphy, spokesman for the state Department of Education,
also said the low unemployment rate has made it difficult to
recruit drivers - and substitute teachers and teacher aides, too,
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''School districts and school bus companies are competing with
other employers for just a limited labor pool,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   David Martinez, district manager for Laidlaw, said the company
has used radio ads and direct-mail campaigns to attract new
Stamford drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the company is looking for more drivers for the
new school year. About 85 percent to 90 percent of the
approximately 140 drivers needed have been hired so far.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy continues to be strong, unemployment in Fairfield
County is virtually zero, so it's very challenging to find someone
who meets all the criteria and who is looking for a job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said Laidlaw requires prospective drivers to take a
drug test, to get a physical examination and to have an excellent
driving record. The company also does criminal background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Some school districts, including Bridgeport, Enfield and
Manchester, say they have not had problems finding enough drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been very fortunate,'' said Manchester School
Superintendent Alan Beitman. ''We have managed to keep the same
drivers employed.''

<HEADLINE> 18 Indicted on Smuggling Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The 18 people arrested on charges of
smuggling cigarettes out of North Carolina to raise money for the
Islamic militant group Hezbollah were indicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury returned the 36-count indictment, which
included 34 counts charging violations of immigration laws and one
count each of conspiracy to traffic in contraband cigarettes and
money laundering conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Not every defendant was charged with every count.
</P>
<P>
   Sentences on each charge range from six months, a $250,000 fine
or both to 20 years, a $500,000 fine or both.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed July 21, officials allege the suspects
used sham marriages to get around immigration laws, then set up a
smuggling business in Charlotte to buy cases of cigarettes in North
Carolina, which has a low cigarette tax, and sell them at a profit
in high-tax Michigan.

<HEADLINE> Judge says Combs' gun and bribery trial late this year or early next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan judge said Monday that Sean
''Puffy'' Combs' trial on gun possession and bribery charges will
start late this year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
   After lawyers for Combs and his two codefendants explained their
commitments for the next several months, State Supreme Court
Justice Charles Solomon told them to return Sept. 13 for a status
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said that if possible he will set a trial date for late
this year, but if necessary he wants to begin as early as possible
next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the judge said, ''If there is any way the case
can be resolved for any of these defendants without a trial, don't
hesitate. I leave that to the lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Combs, 30, his bodyguard Anthony ''Wolf'' Jones, 34, and Jamal
''Shyne'' Barrow, 19, a Combs rap protege, were arrested early Dec.
27 after Barrow allegedly shot three people in Club New York in the
Times Square area.
</P>
<P>
   Combs is charged with two counts of illegal possession of a
weapon stemming from police discovery of a pistol in the Lincoln
Navigator in which Combs and girlfriend Jennifer Lopez fled the
nightclub. The other count arises from a second handgun allegedly
being thrown out of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, who testified before the grand jury that indicted Combs,
is not charged with anything. She reportedly said that she never
saw Combs with a gun. It is possible that she could be called to
testify at Combs' trial.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon also issued a decision Monday in which he denied Jones'
motion to suppress the gun found in Combs' vehicle and a similar
motion by Barrow to bar the gun recovered from his waistband from
being used as evidence at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The judge agreed with Barrow's lawyer Murray Richman that the
defendant had a right to have his lawyer present when police placed
him in a lineup. Solomon said the prosecution can arrange for an
alternative identification procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Combs is charged with bribery for allegedly offering to pay his
driver $50,000 to claim ownership of the gun in the car. Police
said he tried to sweeten the deal by offering the driver a diamond
ring Lopez had given him.

<HEADLINE> Survey of park trees planned after beetle infestation is found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Alarmed by the discovery of the Asian longhorned
beetle in three maple trees, officials on Monday ordered a survey
of the city's third largest park to determine if the infestation is
more widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Parks Commissioner Henry Stern said the two Norway maples and
one red maple in 1,200-acre Flushing Meadows Corona Park were found
last week to have holes bored by the destructive insects, requiring
that the trees be taken down, chipped and burned - the only
solution to heading off the spread of the infestation.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the fourth time in five years that the Asian longhorned
beetle has turned up in the city, but the first time in the Queens
park with its thousands of trees.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said the Chinese insect is believed to have entered the
United States in shipping crates around 1996, and has no natural
enemies here. ''If it goes unchecked, it could threaten the entire
northeastern forest of the United States,'' Stern told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, hundreds of streetside trees were removed in the
Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, and similar action was taken after
beetle-damaged trees were found last year in two other Queens
neighborhoods, Bayside and Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   The beetle attacks various species of trees but especially
maples, horse chestnuts, black locusts, elms, poplars and green
ash.
</P>
<P>
   Parks department spokesman Robert Lawson said some 2,800 trees
had been removed by the city to stop the pest, but 4,300
beetle-resistant trees had been replanted. These include oaks,
lindens, sweet gums, bald cypress and sephora, he said.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Probe Could Take 18 Months  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French and British officials examined ways Monday
to increase Concorde safety in hopes of getting Air France's
grounded fleet airborne again after last week's fatal crash of one
of its supersonic jets.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said it could take 18 months to determine what
caused the Concorde to crash minutes after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are at the beginning of a difficult investigation,'' said
Alain Monnier, head of a special inquiry commission investigating
the crash that killed 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a certain number of elements that are certainties or
quasi-certainties,'' he said. ''But we still don't know how to
construct a scenario that links all the events together.''
</P>
<P>
   These include evidence that one or two of the Concorde's tires
exploded and one of the plane's engines shut down, followed by the
shutdown of another engine.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the plane's undercarriage did not pull up and it
had difficulty climbing into the sky, never achieving a
sufficiently fast speed, said Paul Louis Arslanian, head of the
Accident and Inquiry Office, which is working with the inquiry
commission, along with experts from the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''We also found evidence of fuel leakage. It was this leak that
eventually caught fire. This was the cause of the fire,'' said
Arslanian.
</P>
<P>
   The Accident and Inquiry Office said Sunday the flames spewing
from the side of the aircraft before it crashed had most likely
come from a ''major fuel leak'' and that part of the fuel tank had
been discovered on the runway. The office had said earlier it
believed the fire did not start in the plane's engines.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate meeting Monday in Paris, British and French
aviation officials examined how to improve safety in hopes of
getting France's grounded Concorde fleet airborne again following
the July 25 crash.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the French civil aviation authority, the
General Direction for Civil Aviation, as well as officials from the
British and French engine manufacturers Rolls-Royce and Air France
attended the meeting, which was to continue Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following the crash, Air France grounded its fleet
of five remaining Concordes. British Airways, the only other
airline to operate Concordes, resumed flights on most of its seven
supersonic jets the day after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a British Airways Concorde flying from London to New
York with 57 passengers and nine crew members had to make an
emergency stop in eastern Canada after the plane's captain smelled
gasoline in the cabin, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second problem with one of British Airways'
supersonic luxury jets Sunday and the third in two days. Despite
the weekend's incidents, British Airways said it expected to
continue operating regular service out of London and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wouldn't be flying unless we thought it was safe,'' said
British Airways spokeswoman Jemma Moore in London.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, French prosecutors said the bodies of 113 people --
not 114 as the Transport Ministry reported Friday -- have been
removed from the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   All 109 people on board the plane and four on the ground were
killed in the crash. Most of the passengers were German tourists
headed to New York to join a luxury cruise to the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier Salvat, the prosecutor in charge of the judicial inquiry,
said 90 victims had been autopsied and 21 had been identified. The
bodies will be released to the families upon identification, a
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Four doctors, two radiologists and five dentists were helping
with the identification at France's main forensic institute in
Paris, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have questioned a number of people in connection
with the inquiry and a ''great number'' of pieces of the aircraft
have been recovered, Salvat said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board reported
five ''potentially catastrophic'' incidents resulting from
blown-out tires during Concorde takeoffs between June 1979 and
February 1981.
</P>
<P>
   British Airway's fleet of seven Concorde has suffered about 12
blown tires since 1988, London's Sunday Times quoted an
unidentified executive at the airline as saying.

<HEADLINE> Court overturns judge who disregarded jury verdict in bias case  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A jury was right when it sided with a
veteran teacher who claimed her recurring breast cancer made her a
target of discrimination, a state appeals court said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Denville Township Board of Education must pay the $380,000
in damages a jury awarded and the judge should consider additional
legal fees and interest, the court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Blume accepted a job as a vice principal in the district,
but before signing an employment contract she told a superior of
her recent mastectomy and the need for time off to undergo more
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   A year into her new job, Blume learned the cancer had returned
and that more treatment was needed, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1994, the board voted not to renew Blume's contract. In
her lawsuit, Blume alleged that school official Sandra Dohrenwend
was angered by Blume's needs for treatment and influenced the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors agreed with Blume and ordered the cash award. But the
trial judge dismissed the verdict after a motion from the school's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In a 46-page ruling Monday, the three-judge panel said Blume
presented enough evidence for any reasonable jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''The jury could reasonably have found that Ms. Dohrenwend
reacted with resentment, anger, and hostility to the recurrence of
Ms. Blume's cancer and her need to undergo a second mastectomy,''
the opinion reads.
</P>
<P>
   ''These feelings were not rationally related to Ms. Blume's
performance, either before or after she entered the hospital,'' the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   Now 54, Blume's health is ''generally OK,'' lawyer Arthur L.
Raynes said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''She feels vindicated. She feels a great sense of relief and is
very pleased,'' Raynes said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Glenn R. Moran, who represented the school district and
Dohrenwend, was unavailable for comment Monday, a secretary at his
office said.
</P>
<P>
   In its opinion, the court also said that the mastectomy
qualified as a disability under the state's anti-discrimination
laws. The laws cover anyone suffering from a physical disability,
infirmity or disfigurement that results from an illness.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blume is handicapped within that definition as a result of the
two mastectomies,'' the court said.

<HEADLINE> Six Russian Generals Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin dismissed six generals
from their positions in the Defense Ministry, a Kremlin spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   A defense analyst said the generals controlled logistics and
procurement and were several steps removed from top command
positions but may have been ousted in connection with a feud
between top commanders.
</P>
<P>
   One of the officers dismissed, Gen. Anatoly Sitnov, had recently
criticized the government for spending too little on new weaponry
and said Russia's conventional forces will fall hopelessly behind
other armies within 10 years, the RTR television station reported.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the generals had passed pension age while four others,
including Sitnov, the ministry's acting head of armaments, were
promised new jobs in the Defense Ministry, the spokeswoman said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The six all held their positions on an acting basis and had
offered their resignations when Putin was inaugurated in May, the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare public dispute, Russia's military leadership is split
over whether the country should concentrate its limited resources
on nuclear or conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their dismissal can be seen as an indication of the tensions
and disagreements simmering (in the Defense Ministry),'' said Pavel
Felgenhauer, an independent defense analyst in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Also dismissed Monday were the chief of the Defense Ministry's
press service, Maj. Gen. Anatoly Shatalov; head of the rocket and
artillery directorate, Gen. Nikolai Karaulov; and chief of the
military's foreign economic relations Lt. Gen. Alexander Zobnin.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of biological, chemical and radiation defense, Col.
Gen. Stanislav Petrov and anti-aircraft forces Col. Gen. Boris
Dukhov had both surpassed retirement age, the spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Combs' Trial Put Off Several Months  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge said Monday that Sean ''Puffy'' Combs'
trial on gun possession and bribery charges will start late this
year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
   After lawyers for Combs and his two co-defendants explained
their commitments for the next several months, State Supreme Court
Justice Charles Solomon told them to return Sept. 13 for a status
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said that if possible he will set a trial date for late
this year, but if necessary he wants to begin as early as possible
next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the judge said, ''If there is any way the case
can be resolved for any of these defendants without a trial, don't
hesitate. I leave that to the lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Combs, 30; his bodyguard, Anthony ''Wolf'' Jones, 34; and Jamal
''Shyne'' Barrow, 19, a Combs rap protege; were arrested early Dec.
27 after Barrow allegedly shot three people in Club New York in the
Times Square area.
</P>
<P>
   Combs is charged with two counts of illegal possession of a
weapon stemming from police discovery of a pistol in the Lincoln
Navigator in which Combs and girlfriend Jennifer Lopez fled the
nightclub. The other count arises from a second handgun allegedly
being thrown out of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, who testified before the grand jury that indicted Combs,
is not charged with anything. She reportedly said that she never
saw Combs with a gun. It is possible that she could be called to
testify at Combs' trial.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon also issued a decision Monday in which he denied Jones'
motion to suppress the gun found in Combs' vehicle and a similar
motion by Barrow to bar the gun recovered from his waistband from
being used as evidence at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The judge agreed with Barrow's lawyer Murray Richman that the
defendant had a right to have his lawyer present when police placed
him in a lineup. Solomon said the prosecution can arrange for an
alternative identification procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Combs is charged with bribery for allegedly offering to pay his
driver $50,000 to claim ownership of the gun in the car. Police
said he tried to sweeten the deal by offering the driver a diamond
ring Lopez had given him.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Fight Each Other in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian officials on Monday reported
clashes between rival Chechen rebel groups, who they claim are
weakened by internal friction.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the overnight fighting between members of the
fundamentalist Wahhabi sect of Islam and other rebels was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The clash broke out Sunday night in the town of Shalazhi, an
official in Chechnya's pro-Russian civil administration told The
Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Wahhabism is a strict Islamic movement based in Saudi Arabia
that has made inroads into Chechnya but is distrusted by most
rebels, who predominantly adhere to Sufism, Islam's mystical
movement. The rivalry has helped to fracture rebel forces trying to
drive Russian troops out of the southern republic.
</P>
<P>
   Hit-and-run rebel attacks have caused heavy military losses and
sapped morale in recent months, and the Russians have bogged down
in their efforts to regain control of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Radio transmissions intercepted from the rebels indicated that
four fighters were killed in the internal battle, the Russian
command said.
</P>
<P>
   The military also claimed Monday to have killed a top aide to
Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov. The Interfax news agency said
Russian special forces troops killed Umar Pashayev, who was in
charge of financial affairs for Maskhadov's government, in a
shootout in the southern Kurchaloi region.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Georgy Shpak, chief of Russia's paratroop forces,
claimed Monday that his troops seriously wounded both Maskhadov and
a rebel warlord known as Khattab. The claim could not be verified.
</P>
<P>
   Shpak said Maskhadov was wounded two months ago and Khattab was
wounded less than a month ago. It was unclear whether Shpak was
referring to Russian claims made in June that Maskhadov had been
wounded, which were never confirmed. Maskhadov appeared healthy in
a television interview broadcast in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops boosted security Monday at the scores of
checkpoints dotting Chechnya's roads to keep rebel fighters from
entering Grozny in preparation for possible attacks against federal
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increased security, federal checkpoints came under
fire seven times in Grozny on Sunday, and several Russian soldiers
were wounded, the government official told AP.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Su-25 attack planes and Mi-24 and Mi-6 helicopters flew
46 missions over the past day, the military command said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A paratroop battalion commander suggested the war could drag on
for months, despite the military's claims that victory is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paratroopers will stay in Chechnya until next spring at least,
and will crush the militants by any means,'' Lt. Gen. Alexander
Ustimkin said.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelans Re-Elect Hugo Chavez  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Hugo Chavez won a landslide
re-election, but results indicated Monday that perhaps for the
first time in his presidency he will face a viable opposition to
his reinvention of Venezuela as Latin America's second leftist
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders, long hopelessly fractured, suddenly spoke of
a possible unified front, and Chavez's main opponent in Sunday's
presidential election vowed that his struggle against Chavez's
regime was far from over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel at all that we suffered a defeat,'' said
Francisco Arias Cardenas, who lost the election by 21 percentage
points. ''I now take up a position of struggle to build freedom and
better conditions in the entire country.''
</P>
<P>
   Election results showed that despite a morose economy and
soaring crime, Venezuela's poor majority remains enamored of the
man who has given them hope for a better future. Chavez's victory
celebration early Monday was a raging party, with strangers hugging
one another and dancing in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day I feel more proud and more committed to you, my
brothers and my sisters,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the presidency, Chavez allies captured 60 percent of the
new, unicameral legislature. But that isn't enough for the
two-thirds needed to rubber-stamp the president's choices for posts
such as the Supreme Court, attorney general and election board.
</P>
<P>
   ''He only has a simple majority, so he'll need to conduct a very
open dialogue,'' said Pedro Palma, head of the Venezuelan American
Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than 1,100 businesses.
He also was heartened by Chavez's post-election appeal to business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As results came in from close gubernatorial races, it appeared
the opposition had captured 12 states, compared with 11 for
candidates allied with Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   A close Arias aide, Yoel Acosta, said Arias was prepared to meet
with leaders of Venezuela's more traditional opposition -- which all
but collapsed when Chavez was elected in a December 1998 landslide
-- to form a united front based on their opposition to Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   The largest bloc of opposition votes went to Democratic Action,
which for the last 40 years has dominated Venezuelan politics.
Party leader Timoteo Zambrano said: ''We form part of a new
generation that won't mortgage itself to the government.''
</P>
<P>
   But political analyst Ricardo Sucre said it is doubtful that a
unified opposition could come together, at least in the short term,
because all opposition parties are ''very disoriented.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The opposition parties lack legitimacy, goals and ideological
spaces,'' he said. ''Until they fill those gaps, they won't be a
strong opposition.''

<HEADLINE> State: Landlord's ad offered apartments to ''whites only''  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A Westfield man posted classified
advertisements on the Internet offering apartments for rent to
''whites only,'' the state alleged in a lawsuit Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Matthews posted the ads in January and April on a
personal Web site for three-bedroom apartments in Medford, the
state Divisions of Civil Rights and Consumer Affairs said.
</P>
<P>
   After a black resident saw the ad and reported it to state
officials, Consumer Affairs sent a team of black undercover
investigators to try to rent an apartment from Matthews, state
officials said. Matthews, who is white, told the black
investigators the apartment was unavailable, but later that day
offered to rent the same apartment to a white investigator, the
complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews later pulled the ad, said Mark S. Herr, director of the
state Division of Consumer Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Racism is on the Internet and whenever it violates state law,
we will attempt to stop it in its tracks,'' Herr said.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews' home number is unlisted. His lawyer, Peter Lange Jr.,
said Monday he would have to consult with his client before
offering a comment.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks compensatory damages and an injunction banning
Matthews from housing discrimination.

<HEADLINE> Probe: Citizenship Fast Not Quality  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A crash program to reduce the backlog of
citizenship applications ''compromised the integrity'' of the
process and gave citizenship to tens of thousands of people without
adequate background checks, the Justice Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the review by the department's inspector general found no
evidence that the 1995-1996 program, part of Vice President Gore's
government reinvention effort, was designed to influence the 1996
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.2 million people were given citizenship between October,
1995 and September 1996 under the program which eliminated a
massive backlog of citizenship cases at the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. At the time the waiting period for
citizenship was as much as three years.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complained that the rush program was aimed at producing
hundreds of thousands of new voters in time for the 1996
presidential election -- a move that would have helped President
Clinton's re-election bid because a vast majority of the new
citizens probably would vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   But the 684-page inspector general's report, released by the
Justice Department on Monday, said the investigation found no
evidence that the program, ''Citizenship USA,'' ''was developed or
implemented to further inappropriate political ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the White House nor Gore's National Performance Review --
Gore's government reinvention office -- intervened to lower
standards or change procedures to get applicants naturalized in
time to vote, the IG report said.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigation found that at least one official at the
National Performance Review office ''believed that the
(citizenship) program had a deadline that was directly connected to
the upcoming election,'' according to the IG report.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Douglas Farbrother, in March, 1996 raised his
concerns with Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick and senior INS
officials that the program was lagging behind schedule to the point
where Gorelick threw him out of his office, according to the IG
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Farbrother told investigators that he understood that
citizenship applicants had to be naturalized in time to register to
vote in the November, 1996 election. and that ''this was one motive
for the NPR's involvement'' in the Citizenship USA program,
according to the IG report.
</P>
<P>
   But the IG report concluded that while some may have hoped for
political benefit, ''we did not find evidence that officials of INS
or the (Justice) Department adopted this as a goal'' for the
citizenship program at INS
</P>
<P>
   Still, the IG investigators found that the crash program -- which
intensified even more after the March meeting in Gorelick's office
-- put quantity over quality and ''compromised the naturalization
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, involving 1,800 interviews and review of
80,000 pages of documents, confirmed media reports at the time that
INS had processed applicants so quickly that in many cases
citizenship was granted before the INS received criminal background
checks from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found at least 1,300 such cases in Chicago, 2,500
in Los Angeles and nearly 1,000 in Miami. There probably were tens
of thousands of cases where applications were approved without
complete background checks, according to the investigators. But the
report said there was no way to determine how many unqualified
individuals might have gained citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ''INS made the timely completion of naturalization cases, or
production, the guiding principle and single-mindedly pursued this
principle at the expense of accuracy in the determination of
eligibility for citizenship,'' said Acting Inspector General Robert
L. Ashbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The largest backlog cases were in Los Angeles, New York, San
Francisco, Miami and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   INS dramatically increased its work force in those cities, but
in many cases new workers were superficially trained and had little
supervision, the report said. In the Garden City, N.Y., office 100
new-hire application reviewer had only six experienced employees to
give them guidance.

<HEADLINE> Study: Drinking Protects Diabetics  </HEADLINE>
By TROY GOODMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Two new studies support the idea that diabetics
who make moderate drinking a routine are less likely to suffer from
heart disease, despite fears it can throw off their blood-sugar
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have already shown that having an occasional drink
with dinner is good for the general population; it cuts the risk of
heart disease and stroke by as much as 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In both new studies, which appear in Monday's edition of
Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association,
researchers found that diabetics who consumed more than half a
drink per day cut their heart disease risk in half compared with
those who rarely drank or never consumed alcohol at all.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, researchers who spent 12 years studying 983 diabetics
concluded that those who had one or two drinks daily were up to 80
percent less likely to die of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of one of the new studies, Umed A. Ajani of Brigham
and Women's Hospital in Boston, stressed that it would be unwise
for diabetics who don't drink to suddenly start or for those who
drink small amounts to begin consuming more heavily.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marian Parrott of the American Diabetes Association, who was
not involved in the studies, agreed that diabetics should continue
to control their diet, including limiting alcohol intake.
</P>
<P>
   ''Absolutely, the key word here is moderation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 16 million Americans suffer from diabetes, a disease caused
by the body's inability to produce insulin, which can lead to
kidney failure. Eighty percent of diabetes sufferers die from heart
disease, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol hinders the liver's ability to deliver sugar to the
bloodstream, so doctors have been concerned that drinking might
throw off diabetics' blood sugar-insulin balance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The apparent lack of influence of light to moderate drinking
on the regulation of blood glucose was noteworthy,'' wrote the New
Jersey Medical School's Dr. Timothy J. Regan in an accompanying
editorial in Circulation.
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation: Researchers have attributed alcohol's
benefits to its ability to increase the amount of HDL, or good
cholesterol, in the bloodstream. HDL cholesterol helps keep
arteries clean and could aid in the regulation of blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Ajani and his team collected data from nearly 22,000 men
participating in the Physicians' Health Study, which began in 1982
and studied male doctors between the ages of 40 and 84 for several
years.
</P>
<P>
   The second report, led by a different Brigham and Women's
Hospital team of researchers, drew upon a large-scale study of
nurses.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 104; Dow Gains 11  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rebounded Monday from last week's wave of
selling as buyers returned to the market to pick up blue-chip
technology issues at bargain prices.
</P>
<P>
   But investors remained uneasy about corporate profits and
inflation, a combination that caused stocks to tumble on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 10.81 at 10,521.98. The
Dow lost nearly 75 points Friday and was down 2 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 103.99 to
3,766.99 after dropping more than 10 percent last week. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained 10.94 to 1,430.83.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a reaction to last week's selloff,'' said
Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   He said investors remain nervous about inflation and whether
Federal Reserve policymakers later this month will implement their
seventh interest rate hike since June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Up until last week it was pretty much assumed the Fed would
not do anything. But now that is in question,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's stronger-than-expected report on the second-quarter
gross domestic product intensified inflation fears and led to
renewed selling. To get a clearer idea of where the economy and
inflation stand, investors will be closely watching reports later
this week on consumer spending, new home sales, manufacturing and
retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the Dow higher Monday was Hewlett-Packard, up $2.25 at
$112.438 and Citigroup, up $2.187 at $70.50.
</P>
<P>
   Chip makers and Internet and computer companies lifted the
Nasdaq. Those included Texas Instruments, up $1.688 at $59.188,
Oracle, up $2.813 at $75.188 and eBay, up $3.188 at $50.
</P>
<P>
   VISX, the laser vision system maker, rose $3.125 to $25.188
after reports that financier Carl Icahn plans to acquire an 11
percent stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Airline stocks also advanced, sending shares of Delta up $2.50
to $53.688 and UAL Corp, parent of United Airlines, up $2.125 to
$54.125.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks, which rose last week as investors sought stocks
that appeared to be safer bets than high-tech issues, finished
mostly lower Monday. Merck fell $1.375 to $71.438 and Glaxo
Wellcome slipped $1.375 to $57.125.
</P>
<P>
   The overall market ''wasn't as vibrant as it looked in the tech
sector,'' said Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz
King Nussbaum.
</P>
<P>
   He said the buying was limited to large blue chip tech stocks
that had ''clean'' second-quarter earnings announcements -- in other
words, those that beat forecasts and had no warnings about future
profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 10.42 to 500.64.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.13
billion shares, down from Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.70 percent,
Germany's DAX index was up 0.67 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.47 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1.98 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kin Urges Tough Kosovo Sentence  </HEADLINE>
By FISNIK ABRASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEBELDE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Isuf Shabiu had walked five miles
just to find a newspaper with the news that a U.S. soldier had
pleaded guilty to murdering his little sister.
</P>
<P>
   Too poor to pay the 25 cents, the 16-year-old snuck a look at
the Koha Ditore daily at a shop in nearby Vitina. His Albanian
family was living here in Kosovo in January when 11-year-old Merita
Shabiu was brutally sodomized before her lifeless body was buried
in the snow. Her battered body was found several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I read today in the newspaper that the soldier has admitted to
the act,'' said Shabiu, a tall blond who left school a year ago and
has no job, his hands clasped and head bowed. ''We have no hard
feelings against Americans in general, but that guy should get the
sentence he deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Isuf's family went to Germany to attend the trial of Staff Sgt.
Frank Ronghi, who is accused of killing the girl. The U.S. Army
arranged for his parents and two of their children to attend, but
he was left at home with his grandmother to keep an eye on the
family's one-story house in the wooded hills outside of Vitina.
</P>
<P>
   A small American flag fluttered from the roof of the two-room
shabby house on a hillside in the small village of a Debelde, some
30 miles southeast of the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi pleaded guilty to charges of murder, forcible sodomy and
three counts of indecent acts with a child. Prosecutors dropped two
other charges, one of rape and another of sodomy murder. The trial
will continue Tuesday, and a panel of officers will determine
Ronghi's sentence. He faces a maximum of life in prison without
parole.
</P>
<P>
   In Vitina, people were angry that a peacekeeper had turned into
an aggressor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would sentence him to execution,'' said Ibrahim Hasani, 32,
a local shopkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   But Shabiu said he was simply waiting for more news.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's see how is he going to be sentenced,'' he said softly,
adding that it would be difficult as the family has neither a
telephone or a radio.

<HEADLINE> All New Jersey 4-year colleges plan tuition hikes this fall  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - College students can expect to pay more
this fall at every four-year college and university in New Jersey,
according to figures supplied by the state Commission on Higher
Education.
</P>
<P>
   The tuition hikes will range from about 3 to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton University posted the smallest percentage increase at
3.2 percent, while Rowan University had the highest at 10.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition costs this coming school year will range from $3,375 at
the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey to $25,430 at Princeton.
That doesn't include room and board.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said tuition continues to climb faster than
inflation primarily because of the cost of upgrading technology,
including outfitting schools with Internet-ready computers, and
higher teacher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   They also said the state needs to send more money to four-year
institutions to help keep tuition down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to encourage (schools) to moderate tuition
increases,'' said Jeanne Oswald, deputy director of the New Jersey
Commission on Higher Education. ''But if we want to continue to
keep our colleges competitive, it's going to require that the cost
goes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Goertz, the commission's director of fiscal policy, said
the state is sending about $51.4 million more to New Jersey's 10
public and 14 private institutions for a total of about $1.7
billion. That's about 8 percent more than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''But while state funding is increasing this year in terms of
dollars, it's a lower percentage of actual school budgets than last
year,'' Oswald said.
</P>
<P>
   This year's funding amounts to 2.5 percent of the schools'
operating budgets, compared to 3.5 percent last year, Oswald said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have long suggested that the state should pay a slightly
larger share of the operating costs for state senior public
institutions,'' Oswald said, adding the state should shoulder
two-thirds of the cost, with tuition financing the rest.
</P>
<P>
   But Jayne O'Connor, spokeswoman for Gov. Christie Whitman, said
the state already makes a substantial investment in colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The argument is, the more (colleges) spend, the more they
expect the state to pay,'' O'Connor said. ''While we want to make
college affordable for New Jersey students, if there's no end to
how much the colleges spend, taxpayers can't be expected to
continue to foot the bill. At some point, they need to start
looking within if they want to keep tuition down.''
</P>
<P>
   The College of New Jersey is among the schools posting the
smallest increases. Sue Long, college spokeswoman, credits
frugality.
</P>
<P>
   ''This institution has done a fantastic job of really
scrutinizing every dollar that we spend,'' Long said. ''We're also
taking advantage of a good bond market for our long-term projects.
It's just really tightly controlling our costs.''
</P>
<P>
   At Rowan University, students and faculty decided to raise
tuition at least 10 percent for five years to improve programs and
facilities, said Joe Cardona, university spokesman. This is the
last year for that increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've added 39 faculty positions, six new master's programs,
10 new technology positions and more computer labs on campus,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Montclair University has the second highest hike at 10 percent,
but still offers one of the least expensive educations in the
state, with an annual tuition of $3,470. Only Stockton has a lower
tuition at $3,375.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is not alone in higher tuition costs, according to
Janice Gams, spokeswoman for the College Board.
</P>
<P>
   She said schools across the nation are routinely raising
tuition. But there has been a trend toward lower hikes since the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994-95 school year, tuition increases averaged 6 percent
across the nation. That dropped to 3.4 percent in 1999-2000, she
said. No national figures were yet available for the coming school
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Colleges are possibly trying to hold the line on prices as one
way they can attract students,'' Gams said.

<HEADLINE> Kunitz To Be U.S. Poet Laureate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stanley Kunitz, 95, will become the 10th poet
laureate of the United States in the fall, the Library of Congress
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He published his first book of poetry in 1930 and has since
produced nine more.
</P>
<P>
   Said one of Kunitz's verses in 1958, the year he won the
Pulitzer Prize:
</P>
<P>
   ''I recognize the gods' capricious hand,
</P>
<P>
   ''And write this poem for money, rage and love.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz will succeed Robert Pinsky, who has held the post for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   The new laureate said the appointment came as a great surprise,
and he accepted on the assurance that he would not need to move to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason I decided to accept this honor is that I want to do
something for the young in this country,'' he said in a statement.
''I also want to stress the diversity of poetry in this country, in
this 'nation of nations,' as (Walt) Whitman said.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Worcester, Mass., and a graduate of Harvard University,
Kunitz began as a reporter and feature writer on the Worcester
Telegram. He has taught at Columbia, Rutgers, Princeton and other
colleges and universities and translated the work of recent Russian
poets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly through the years I've tried to simplify the surface
of my poems,'' he told an interviewer for the magazine ''American
Poet ''in 1997. ''I've tried to write more intimately than I did,
in a more conversational tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz lives with his wife, the painter Elise Asher, in New
York's Greenwich Village and in Provincetown, Mass. As poet
laureate for a year, he will have an office in the Library of
Congress and a salary of $35,000.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To eliminate antitrust problems, hair care
companies L'Oreal USA Inc. and Carson Inc. will have to sell off
two brands of hair relaxers, the Justice Department announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   French-owned L'Oreal had declared plans to acquire Carson, based
in Savannah, Ga., for $79 million in cash. Regulators objected that
the deal would leave L'Oreal in control of 50 percent of the
women's hair relaxer market with three of the top five best-selling
brands.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deal as originally proposed would have resulted in higher
prices for consumers,'' said Joel Klein, assistant attorney general
in charge of the department's antitrust division. ''These
divestitures will protect competition in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The two brands are Carson's ''Gentle Treatment'' and ''Ultra
Sheen'' products, sold throughout the United States. Together, they
account for approximately 14 percent of sales of all women's hair
relaxer kits.

<HEADLINE> Albright Stops at Vatican  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stopped
off here on the way home from Asia on Monday for meetings at the
Vatican, hoping to win its help to break the deadlock over
Jerusalem between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has considerable influence with the Palestinians,
who demand sovereignty over east Jerusalem for the capital of their
hoped-for state.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Jerusalem was a chief cause in sinking July's
U.S.-mediated Israeli-Palestinian talks at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who arrived in Italy late Monday, is to talk Tuesday
with the Vatican's Foreign Minister, Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran.
She also is to meet with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Vatican and the Palestinians signed a strongly
worded accord insisting on an ''equitable solution'' for Jerusalem,
based on international resolutions. It called for international
safeguards of freedom of religion.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has long been pushing for a say in the final status
of Jerusalem, home to holy sites of Jews, Christians and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Albright initially had been scheduled to return directly to
Washington, but changed her plans over the weekend in Tokyo to
travel to Rome.

<HEADLINE> Yankees barred from forming new cable company  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Winners on the field, the New York Yankees were
losers in court Monday in their fight with Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series champions were barred from forming a new cable
television company with a division of the International Management
Group to broadcast the team's games starting next season.
</P>
<P>
   New York Supreme Court Justice Barry A. Cozier granted MSG's
request for a preliminary injunction agreeing with MSG's claim that
the Yankees' agreement with IMG's Trans World International
division violated the MSG Network's right of last refusal.
</P>
<P>
   That clause was contained in a $486 million, 12-year contract to
broadcast Yankees games, a deal that expires after this season.
</P>
<P>
   While the team called the right a ''skirmish'' in the overall
fight and said it would proceed with negotiating an new deal, the
Garden was happy with the win.
</P>
<P>
   ''Madison Square Garden is gratified that Justice Cozier has
upheld our position, ensuring that the Yankees Partnership will
fulfill its contractual obligations,'' MSG president Dave Checketts
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed Yankees-TWI deal, the team's television
rights would be held by a new company, 95 percent owned by the team
and 5 percent owned by TWI. It would have paid the Yankees more
than $800 million for TV rights from 2001-2010.
</P>
<P>
   Cozier, who told the sides to keep the status quo until he
formally issued the injunction in writing, said the offer was
presented to MSG in a way that would make it impossible to
calculate its worth, which would make the network's right to match
''a fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is not even about half a loaf,'' Cozier said in a
decision read from the bench following 70 minutes of oral
arguments. ''The Yankees have offered 5 percent and attempted to
disguise that as a full loaf. ... Clearly what we have here is not
a bona fide offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Cozier said the injunction would remain in force until a trial
this fall, but he left the Yankees free to negotiate other
proposals and present them to MSG, which is controlled by
Cablevision Systems Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must offer MSG 100 percent of what we initiate, not 5
percent,'' said Lonn Trost, the Yankees' chief operating officer.
''We certainly are free to launch our own network. ... What the
court basically did was give us a road map.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees said that if they wanted to launch their own
network, they could have their investment bankers place a value on
what the equity and any rights fees the network would pay would be
worth to the team. MSG would then have an opportunity to match that
dollar figure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Throughout the day a number of new opportunities have come
before us from a number of new, interested parties,'' said Harvey
Schiller, the president of YankeeNets, the Yankees' parent company.
''It's clear the rights of the New York Yankees are extremely
valuable in the marketplace today.''
</P>
<P>
   Cozier's ruling almost invites the Yankees to come up with a
proposal that will enable the team's advisers to place a higher
value on it than MSG's advisers, perhaps several billion dollars,
according to one lawyer in the case who spoke on the condition he
not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees do present their next agreement to MSG to match
or pass, the team probably will place a higher evaluation on the
deal than MSG adviser
</P>
<P>
   ''We can do whatever we want with whomever we want, however we
want, as long as we appropriately value it ... and present it to
MSG,'' Trost said.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees lawyers said they may appeal Cozier's ruling, but
preliminary injunctions are rarely overturned.

<HEADLINE> Latest ad from Clinton campaign  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of the newest ad from Hillary Rodham
Clinton's
Senate campaign, criticizing a Republican ad that featured photos
of Rep. Rick Lazio and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan side by side.
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITLE: ''Deception''
</P>
<P>
   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Mandy Grunwald and ''Team Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   AIRING: Upstate.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: Announcer: Have you seen this new Republican ad?
</P>
<P>
   It uses spliced pictures to suggest that Senator Moynihan
supports Rick Lazio... He's (Moynihan) endorsed Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan: I think she's going to go all the way. I mean to go
all the way with her.
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: Senator Moynihan asked Lazio to have the Republican
ad withdrawn. He calls it ''fakery.'' Lazio's response?
</P>
<P>
   Lazio (in news footage): I had nothing to do with it. I haven't
even seen the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: But newspapers tell Lazio they're sick and tired of
those kind of excuses ... stop the deception. Rick Lazio ... be
straight with New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   IMAGES: Footage from the Republican ad is shown picturing Lazio
and Moynihan side by side on a split screen, followed by a clip
from the launch of Clinton's campaign, where she stood beside
Moynihan on his upstate farm. A story from the Albany Times-Union
headlined ''Moynihan wants Lazio ad withdrawn'' is shown, followed
by two clippings of editorials, one from the Syracuse Post-Standard
headlined ''No more deception'' and another from Newsday headlined
''Lazio ad is misleading, Republicans should yank it.''
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: This commercial is a counterpoint to an ad run by the
Republican Leadership Council that features footage of President
Clinton thanking Moynihan, Lazio and others at a ceremony in
Washington for their work on legislation to help disabled
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican ad also uses a split-screen image of a picture of
Lazio next to a picture of Moynihan. The composite prompted
Moynihan to ask Lazio to have the ad withdrawn. ''The ad is
misleading,'' Moynihan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio campaign points out that it is not legally responsible
for the content of RLC ads. The RLC has defended the ad as a
legitimate use of the president's public praise for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton ad seeks not only to rebut the RLC ad, but also to
suggest to voters that deception by the first lady's opponent is
not limited to this ad.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spokesman Bryan Flood responded to the new Clinton ad by
saying: ''The only route her campaign knows how to take is to
attack and distort.''

<HEADLINE> Owner of Destroyed Plant To Sue  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Sudanese owner of a pharmaceutical plant
destroyed by U.S. cruise missiles is seeking $50 million in
compensation on the ground that his Khartoum factory was targeted
because of false charges that it had terrorist links.
</P>
<P>
   Salah Idris, who purchased the al-Shifa plant five months before
the August 1998 bombing, will file a civil action suit in the U.S.
Court of Claims in hopes of obtaining restitution.
</P>
<P>
   He has retained the Washington law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis
and Pogue, which said in a statement that Idris will establish that
al-Shifa was ''engaged only in pharmaceutical processing and
packaging,'' with no connection to international terror.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ordered the attack, alleging that the plant
had links to Osama bin Laden, exiled Saudi-born millionaire
suspected in the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
on Aug. 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The retaliatory attack against the Khartoum facility was two
weeks later, coupled with cruise missile strikes against alleged
terror camps in Afghanistan said to have been under bin Laden's
control.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by the law firm said the U.S. government has
retreated systematically from declarations that high officials made
two years ago to justify the attack on the plant, ''except for the
claim that a chemical component of VX nerve gas known as Empta was
found in a soil sample taken by a foreign agent near the plant.''
</P>
<P>
   It added that a study commissioned by Idris found no trace of
Empta in the ground soil and drainage sludge at al-Shifa but
instead found evidence of common pesticides with ''chemical
similarity'' to Empta.
</P>
<P>
   Idris said he has always opposed terrorism as a tool of
political action, has never met with bin Laden and has not
knowingly done business with him or any of his associates.
</P>
<P>
   In its most recent comment on the issue, State Department
spokesman Philip Reeker said last week the administration stands by
its initial justification for the bombing. He said evidence
suggests that bin Laden was seeking to acquire weapons of mass
destruction, including chemical weapons, for use against American
targets. He said Empta, used to make chemical weapons, was found
outside the al-Shifa facility.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the nearly two years since the attack, the evidence about
the purpose of this chemical plant remains persuasive,'' Reeker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Idris said he understands the need of the U.S. government to
defend itself against acts of terror. ''But a government becomes
what it fears most when it lashes out against the innocent and then
fails to recognize its errors and make full restitution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudanese government backs Idris's claims that the plant was
not carrying out illicit activities and has demanded that a U.N.
fact-finding mission be established to investigate.

<HEADLINE> Patrick McGahn, a founding father of A.C. casinos, dead at 72  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Patrick T. ''Paddy'' McGahn Jr., a
flamboyant, tough-talking lawyer who helped sell New Jersey voters
on casino gambling in 1976, has died. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   McGahn, brother of the late state Sen. Joseph McGahn, suffered a
stroke Thursday and never regained consciousness. He died Sunday at
Shore Memorial Hospital in Somers Point.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an Atlantic City saloonkeeper, McGahn was a decorated
Korean War veteran who went on to become a Democratic Party
operative active in local, state and national campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a larger-than-life character, that's the best way to
describe him,'' said lawyer John Donnelly, a longtime friend. ''He
was constantly on full-tilt boogie, never at a loss for words or an
action plan.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Pleasantville, he graduated from Mount St. Mary's
College and New York Law School before serving in the U.S. Marines
in Korea, where he won the Navy Cross for bravery, a Bronze Star,
three Purple Hearts and numerous citations as a lieutenant with the
1st Marine Division.
</P>
<P>
   He also earned the nickname ''Piano Wire Paddy'' for the silent
weapon he is said to have used to strangle enemies during
hand-to-hand combat.
</P>
<P>
   McGahn served as an advance man during the 1960 presidential
campaign of John F. Kennedy and the 1968 campaign of Robert F.
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, he recruited and fielded Democratic candidates,
including his brother, who defeated state Sen. Frank S. ''Hap''
Farley, a longtime GOP power broker, in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 and 1976, he was a driving force behind the Committee to
Rebuild Atlantic City, a group of local businessmen and political
leaders who helped persuade New Jersey voters to approve casinos
for Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than anything else, he was an Irish chieftain, which
means he was intensely loyal to his friends, but it also means that
he had grudges and sometimes forgot why he had them,'' said
Atlantic City Mayor James Whelan. ''He was a tough guy, the classic
Marine. When you got past the toughness and it came to the things
he cared about - his family, his friends - he had the proverbial
heart of gold underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   McGahn served as counsel to Resorts International, the first
casino to open here. Later, he was co-director of security for the
1984 and 1988 Democratic National Conventions.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he was part of a group of veterans who obtained
land for a Korean War Memorial at Boardwalk and Park Place in
Atlantic City. It is currently under construction.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a real Marine. He just had that Marine attitude and
toughness,'' said Frank J. Siracusa, an insurance broker who worked
with McGahn on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   McGahn, of Margate, is survived by his wife, the former Mercedes
Walsh; daughters Teresa M. Holzman, Catherine McGahn and Patricia
J. McGahn, and son Timothy Patrick McGahn, as well as six
grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral Mass will be held at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Our Lady of
Sorrows Roman Catholic Church in Linwood, with burial Monday at
Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Va.

profiling controversy:
<TEXT>
<P>
   - April 23, 1998: Troopers James Kenna and John Hogan fire on a
Dodge Caravan containing four minority men from New York on the New
Jersey Turnpike in Mercer County. Troopers claim van was backing up
to strike them.

on charges they lied about the race of motorists they pulled over,
falsifying records and conducting illegal searches.
</P>
<P>

says racial profiling is ''real, not imagined.'' The report
acknowledges blacks are not only pulled over more often, they are
far more likely to be searched.
</P>
<P>
   - April 26: Lawyers at the U.S. Justice Department conclude they

   - Sept. 7: State grand jury indicts Hogan and Kenna on charges
of attempted murder and aggravated assault.
</P>

request to postpone civil lawsuit proceedings until Hogan and Kenna
criminal trial is completed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Tours Arab Countries  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SEVAREID
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) -- The U.S. State Department's top Middle
East expert consulted with Egyptian leaders Monday on how to push
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process forward after the failure of
the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary of State Edward Walker, whose stop in Egypt
was the start of a tour of at least a dozen Arab nations, has a
tough task: garnering support for the U.S. argument that the
Palestinians need to make concessions in their talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's very useful that everyone has a chance to think
through what went on at Camp David -- what was accomplished and
those few things that haven't been accomplished yet and how to
approach them,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   But Egypt, which in 1979 became the first country to sign a
peace treaty with Israel and has emerged as a key regional
mediator, appeared reluctant to press the Palestinians over
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Jerusalem was the main issue causing the collapse of
the Palestinian-Israeli summit, mediated by President Clinton, last
week at Camp David, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa was asked Monday whether
Egypt and Jordan -- two of Washington's closest Arab allies -- will
help the United States persuade the rest of the Arabs that there
could be less than full Palestinian sovereignty over east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   He replied, ''I don't think that we can enter into this business
of less than full sovereignty. And for whose sake? For whose
interest? It is not our job to do that. Our job is to save the
peace process, to help the United States apply international
legitimacy and resolutions of the (U.N.) Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker met in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Moussa and other Egyptian officials.
Mubarak later held talks with Jordan's King Abdullah II in
Alexandria, part of a flurry of meetings between Arab leaders in
the wake of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   In Rabat, Morocco, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Monday
that Middle East peace talks had reached a ''dangerous and
difficult phase of the negotiations, not only on Jerusalem but for
the whole Palestinian issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who arrived in Morocco for talks with King Mohammed VI
as part of a tour aimed at drumming up support for Palestinian
stance, said he told the monarch that the ''intransigent position
of Israel on the question of Jerusalem'' led to the collapse of the
Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   Arabs have been angered by recent American comments, including
hints from Clinton that he would reward Israel for offering
concessions at the summit by moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from
Tel Aviv to west Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Camp David talks, Arab leaders made clear that
the fate of Jerusalem is not a Palestinian issue alone. Mubarak was
among several Arab leaders who insisted on Palestinian sovereignty
over east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saudi Arabia renewed its stance for the return of Jerusalem to
Arab sovereignty and its place as the capital of an independent
Palestine,'' said a statement Monday from Saudi Information
Minister Fouad al-Farsi.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the U.S. Embassy would be seen by many Arabs as
acceptance of Israel's claim to Jerusalem. Most countries have
refused to open embassies in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic Jihad, a Palestinian opposition group, said moving
the embassy would be ''a war declaration'' and threatened ''direct
retaliation.'' The militant Hezbollah guerrilla group said Sunday
that a U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem would be attacked and the
Americans sent home ''in coffins.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker's two-week tour will include stops in Morocco, Tunisia,
Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait,
Yemen and perhaps other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has visited France, Saudi Arabia and Yemen to press his
case. After Morocco, he headed Monday to Tunisia and was then
scheduled to visit Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that the consultations are a run-up
to another summit to try to secure a final peace agreement before
Arafat's Sept. 13 deadline for the declaration of an independent
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak, Abdullah and Clinton all have said they would be
willing to help bring the two sides together again.

<HEADLINE> Six more dead crows found to be infected with West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Tests show six more crows found dead in
northern New Jersey had been infected with the West Nile virus,
including the first ones found in Union County.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 15 crows infected with the potentially deadly virus
have been found dead this year, the state Department of Health and
Senior Services said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the birds were found in Bergen County, two each were
found in Middlesex and Union counties, and one was found in Hudson
County.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no humans have been found to be infected with the virus
from the Middle East, which killed seven New Yorkers when it first
surfaced in the region last year.
</P>
<P>
   Along with spraying to control mosquitoes in North Jersey,
health officers in five counties - Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Passaic
and Union - have begun calling their local hospitals to check for
possible cases among the patients.
</P>
<P>
   The virus causes only flulike symptoms in healthy people, but
can be very dangerous for the elderly, children under age 5, and
anyone else with a weak immune system.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the federal Center for Disease Control and Prevention
expects to get test results on 2,000 to 3,000 mosquitoes its
workers collected earlier this month from each New Jersey County.
Results on samples taken from several hundred birds in each county
also are due soon.
</P>
<P>
   To date, samples from 405 mosquito pools and from ''sentinel''
chicken flocks in all 21 counties have not detected the virus this
year. Unlike crows, the chickens are caged, so if any do test
positive, authorities could be sure the virus was present in that
immediate area.

<HEADLINE> Man admits selling large amounts of drug used to make 'meth'  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A New York man admitted Monday he sold large
amounts of a drug used to make methamphetamine to a Passaic County
man.
</P>
<P>
   In pleading guilty to a single conspiracy count, George P.
Clear, of Hudson Falls, N.Y., said he would cooperate with
investigators and testify against his co-defendant, Mahmoud
Attallah, of Clifton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In return, prosecutors agreed to drop the other charge Clear
faced, distributing pseudoephedrine.
</P>
<P>
   Attallah pleaded innocent to those charges. No firm trial date
has been set, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Clear, 43, faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine
when sentenced Nov. 6 by U.S. District Judge William H. Walls.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme appeared lucrative, netting $850,000 and a 2000 Range
Rover in about a year, according to the indictment against Clear
and Attallah, which seeks the money and the vehicle as proceeds of
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were unavailable Monday to discuss the scope of the
case. Buchanan declined to comment and a message seeking comment
from the Drug Enforcement Administration, which investigated, was
not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Clear admitted that from March 1999 to March 2000 he sold large
amounts of pseudoephedrine to Attallah and unnamed others who were
not registered with the DEA to handle the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Clear had such a registration through G.P.C. Distributing, a
company he operated from his home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company, directly or through straw purchasers recruited by
Clear, bought 368,217 bottles of pseudoephedrine - containing over
28 million tablets - from March 15, 1999 to Feb. 25, 2000,
according to court papers filed by the DEA.
</P>
<P>
   Attallah paid cash for the drug, which Clear obtained from
pharmaceutical manufacturers, Clear admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Clear delivered it to a warehouse space that Attallah rented in
Clifton, and Attallah then sold it to others, Clear admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Attallah rented the space using the business name, ''National
Arabic Television,'' which tax returns, bank records and other
documents show is actually a front for distributing
pseudoephedrine, according to court papers filed by the DEA.
</P>
<P>
   DEA documents say methamphetamine, also known as ''meth'' or
''speed,'' is a dangerous, sometimes lethal and unpredictable drug,
and ''represents the fastest growing drug threat in America
today.'' Pseudoephedrine is an ingredient in the production of
methamphetamine.

<HEADLINE> Six-day-old infant disappears from St. Luke's Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A 6-day-old infant was taken from St. Luke's
Hospital on Monday, and police were looking for her mother, who had
been forbidden to take her from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The infant's mother, Carol Codrington, 29, walked into the
hospital shortly after 4 p.m. to feed the baby, said police
spokesman Lt. Sean Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   The baby disappeared shortly afterward, and police believe that
Codrington abducted her, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Agency of Children's Services had said the child was not to
be removed from the hospital. The baby had been remanded to
Children's Services after she tested positive for drugs at birth,
Lt. Sean Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Codrington was allowed to visit the infant and feed
her, she was not allowed to take her out of the hospital, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Details were not immediately clear as to how the baby was taken
out of the hospital without being stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Police were searching the area.

<HEADLINE> Study: Men Have a Biological Clock  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Once a man passes the age of 24, the older he is,
the longer it takes for him to make his partner pregnant,
regardless of her age, a new study suggests.
</P>
<P>
   A decline in male fecundity -- the likelihood of achieving
pregnancy within a certain period of time -- has never before been
confirmed or quantified in the general population, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The research, published Tuesday in the European journal Human
Reproduction, provides the first clear evidence that the age of a
man, as well as that of a woman, could be an important factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It tells us that, to some degree, men as well as women have a
biological clock that starts ticking as they get into their 30s,''
said Dr. Chris Ford of St. Michael's Hospital of Bristol, England,
who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   ''It also indicates that paternal age is another factor to be
taken into account when doctors are looking at the prognosis for
infertile couples,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   The study examined whether men become less fecund as they get
older, as opposed to less fertile.
</P>
<P>
   Fertility refers to the ability to produce a baby, while
fecundity refers to the ability to do it within a certain period of
time. If it takes a man 20 years to make his partner pregnant, he
is fertile but not very fecund.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fecundity is a critical thing because, as the female ages, her
ability to conceive declines dramatically. And if the man is not
fecund, by the time he can impregnate his partner it is too late
because she is too old,'' said Dr. Christopher Barratt, a British
fertility expert who was not connected to the study.
</P>
<P>
   The research involved 8,500 British couples whose pregnancies
were planned and successful.
</P>
<P>
   It found that the probability it would take more than a year to
conceive nearly doubled from about 8 percent when the man was under
25 to about 15 percent when he was over 35.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of a man making a woman pregnant within a year of
trying decreased by 3 percent for every year he was over the age of
24. The chance of impregnating a woman within six months declined
by 2 percent for each year he was over 24.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows what we've suspected for a long time, and it all
makes scientific sense,'' Barratt said. ''The evidence of declining
male fertility has been based on indirect measures -- cutting up the
testes and seeing the number and quality of sperm. This is direct
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But another expert was more cautious about the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Berhard Nieschlang, director of the Institute of
Reproductive Medicine at the University of Muenster in Germany,
said the study may have underestimated the importance of the man's
age because it excluded couples who had miscarriages and those who
failed to conceive at all. Miscarriages are more commonly linked to
older men, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, it may have overestimated the effect
by not accounting well enough for the fact that some men -- usually
younger ones -- have more sex and thus more opportunities to make
their partners pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's on a large scale and ... it's an important
observation,'' Nieschlang said of the study. ''So far, the notion
was only that female fertility declines and there has been no proof
that men's declines too.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts agreed it is difficult to determine the importance of a
man's age because it is hard to disentangle that factor from the
numerous others that influence conception.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved a diverse group of people and the results
were adjusted in an attempt to eliminate the influence of such
factors as alcohol, existing children, contraceptive pill use,
smoking, education and the woman's age.
</P>
<P>
   Barratt said he was convinced the effect was real, even if the
study did not eliminate the influence of frequency of sex.
</P>
<P>
   He said that, in general, having sex more than twice a week does
not increase the chances of conception.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Jewish Immigration Chief Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Uri Gordon, the charismatic Jewish Agency
official who oversaw mass immigrations of Ethiopian and Soviet Jews
to Israel in the 1980s and 1990s, has died, a spokeswoman said
Monday. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon died Sunday after suffering for months from a number of
illnesses, Jewish Agency spokeswoman Deborah Lipson said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, a member of the Labor party, rose to prominence in the
Jewish Agency, a quasi-governmental body that supervises
immigration, in the 1970s, when he won a following during a stint
emissary to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He energetically encouraged young American Jews to immigrate to
Israel, saying the fledgling country needed their education and
skills to go forward -- and arguing that as Jews, there was nowhere
in the world they would feel more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   He founded a U.S. youth movement, Telem, that had as its only
tenet the commitment to immigrate to Israel. Hundreds joined and
arrived here as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ''Uri believed that Zionism was the eternal and sole solution to
the 'Jewish problem','' said Chaim Chesler, the Jewish Agency's
treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon supervised immigration for the Agency in the 1980s and
1990s, taking part in the planning of the dramatic airlifts of tens
of thousands Ethiopian Jews in 1984 and in 1991, and plotting the
absorption of the hundreds of thousands of Jews who arrived here
after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   He was buried in Ramat Hasharon, a Tel Aviv suburb, on Monday.
He is survived by a wife and three daughters.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in Airport Seize  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- A Myanmar man armed with a fake pistol held a
female airport employee hostage aboard a Cathay Pacific Airways jet
for several hours at Hong Kong's airport until surrendering to
police early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The man evaded security guards at the airport cargo handling
area and seized the woman, an airport cleaner, before running on
board the plane late Monday, police commander Mak Man-poon said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a maintenance engineer was inside the plane at the time, he
said. Radio Hong Kong said the engineer locked himself in the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   At one stage, the hostage-taker threatened to kill the woman, a
Nepalese, if police did not withdraw from the area, and expressed a
desire to return to Myanmar, Mak said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was cordoned off by police at Chek Lap Kok airport,
and they negotiated with the man by mobile phone until he
surrendered shortly after midnight in the early hours Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage-taker has worked as a laborer since arriving in Hong
Kong last year from Myanmar, also known as Burma, police said. He
was being questioned by police, who did not release his identity.
The airport worker was released unharmed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 747-400 was empty because it was several hours until
the plane was to depart for Paris, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that police had to deal with a hostage
crisis at the airport, which was opened in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Leader Charged, Probe Goes On  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Rebel leader George Speight has been charged
with crimes related to a wave of civil unrest in Fiji that followed
his coup in May, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The charges -- against Speight and a small group of key advisers
-- did not include treason, although an investigation into that
charge was still underway, assistant Police Commissioner Moses
Driver said.
</P>
<P>
   The charges also fell outside an amnesty period granted between
the time rebel gunmen led by Speight stormed parliament on May 19
and the date that the last of their dozens of hostages were
released on July 13, Driver said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and his advisers, who are being held on a prison island
off Suva, the capital, were charged late Monday with unlawful
assembly, a minor crime which carries a maximum penalty of one year
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came a day after scores of rebel supporters,
many with black eyes and bandaged wounds, were hauled into court as
prosecutors pressed the first charges stemming from the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Army snipers crouched on the roof of Suva's main courthouse and
heavily armed troops cordoned off one entrance to the building as
about 150 Speight backers were brought in.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all were charged with unlawful assembly and pleaded
innocent. They were released on bail, on condition they do not
gather for political purposes and ordered to reappear in four
weeks. All face a maximum year in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   They were among more than 350 coup supporters who were arrested
in a tear gas raid on a rebel stronghold last week in a military
crackdown that also netted Speight and his key advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and his inner circle were not expected to appear in
court immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Speight had earlier threatened a new campaign of civil unrest
unless the new Cabinet was stacked with his supporters. The
military said they are also investigating allegations that he
threatened President Josefa Iloilo, a treasonable offense that
carries a maximum penalty of death.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, a failed businessman, led the armed gang that stormed
Parliament and held dozens of officials for two months until the
military met rebel demands for an amnesty, the scrapping of the
multiracial constitution and the ouster of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Deposed prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry, who was among the
hostages, met Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Monday to
discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   He also sought medical treatment in Sydney for fractured ribs
from a beating early on in his captivity. Chaudhry said U.N.
peacekeepers could be needed for Fiji if authorities there fail to
restore law and order.
</P>
<P>
   Australia and New Zealand led international condemnation of Fiji
for abandoning democracy after the coup, staged by nationalists who
demanded political supremacy for indigenous Fijians over the large
ethnic Indian minority.
</P>
<P>
   The installation of an interim government and the military
crackdown signaled an apparent end to widespread civil unrest,
although isolated attacks continue on Indo-Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claimed that ethnic Indians -- first brought to Fiji in
the 1870s by British colonialists as indentured laborers -- have too
much power and are threatening Fijian culture. Ethnic Indians make
up 44 percent of Fiji's 814,000 population and dominate business
and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The new government is strongly pro-indigenous Fijian, though it
includes no close Speight supporters. Prime Minister Laisenia
Qarase has appointed a commission to rewrite the constitution to
strengthen indigenous Fijians' hold on power before elections are
held, possibly in three years.

<HEADLINE> Germany Imports Tech Workers  </HEADLINE>
By SABINE GOEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) -- As officials handed Indonesian
computer expert Harianto Wijaya the country's first ''green card''
Monday, many expressed concern that anti-foreigner attacks would
undermine the initiative by discouraging highly-trained workers
from moving to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Approved last month, the so-called ''green card'' system -- a
reference to the U.S. work permits -- was envisioned as a way of
pumping fresh blood into Germany's information technology field,
which has an estimated 75,000 unfilled openings for lack of
qualified domestic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Wijaya, the first to get a five-year work permit in the new
program, appears just the sort of candidate Germany is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old graduate of the North Rhine-Westphalia Technical
School finished with a perfect grade point average and has lined up
a job with Aixcom GmbH, a software company in the western town of
Aachen.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a wonderful day for Germany,'' said Bernhard Jagoda,
president of the German Labor Office. ''Germany is an excellent
place for foreign skilled workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wijaya seconded the enthusiasm, saying he was ''totally happy''
to stay on in Germany. But others worried that the green card
system could flop.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a bomb exploded in a Duesseldorf train station,
injuring 10 people, all recent immigrants from the former Soviet
Union, six of them Jewish. Authorities are trying to determine
whether the attack was motivated by anti-Semitism or anti-foreigner
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   But following other recent acts of anti-foreign violence, the
attack on the new immigrants galvanized officials to pledge a
tougher response to an increasingly violent neo-Nazi scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''The meager interest in the green cards is the best indicator
that Germany is not an attractive workplace for foreigners,''
warned Bernhard Rohleder, chairman of Bitcom an industry
association of high-tech companies, in an interview with the
Financial Times Deutschland.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the initial buzz surrounding the proposal, only about
5,400 serious applicants have registered for 20,000 green cards,
and in the heavily industrialized western state of Hesse, there
were only 25 applications for 1,271 openings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little disappointed,'' the state's labor administrator
Wolfgang Forell told the German daily Handelsblatt. ''I expected
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Attracting foreign computer experts to Germany is also difficult
because the country lags behind the United States in incentives
such as stock options, a fringe benefit sought-after technicians
have come to expect. And it has the disadvantage of slapping
professionals with weighty taxes.
</P>
<P>
   There is a worldwide shortage of computer workers, but it is
especially acute in Germany, where immigration laws typically slam
the door on foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   Without access to a vast global labor pool, German companies
feared they would fall behind -- especially compared with their U.S.
competitors, which routinely recruit the best and brightest from
overseas, contributing to a brain drain from developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite successfully pushing the green card program through
parliament, some German companies also are now complaining that the
workers who have already applied for green cards are
underqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom criticized the program for attracting few
acceptable candidates and computer powerhouse IBM has requested
only one green card -- for a Tunisian information technology
specialist, according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, workers who come to Germany will be given a
five-year work permit after they prove they have completed a degree
in a related field or have a guarantee of making at least $48,000
in annual salary. They will be allowed to bring family members who
will also receive work permits.

<HEADLINE> West Nile crows spread dead bird paranoia across Northeast  </HEADLINE>
By LISA LIPMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) - Health officials don't want to minimize the
concern the public has over the spread of the potentially deadly
West Nile virus. But some people are taking it to extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Since two crows tested positive in Massachusetts last week for
the virus, officials have been alerted to hundreds of dead birds
that people fear might have died of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   There was one bird that had been mauled by the family cat. Two
birds that had been shot to death. Even a bat that was found dead
in a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we told that guy to get rid of it or flush it,'' Steve
Crosby, director of Boston's animal control, said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Monday the concern should be more about
controlling mosquitoes, which spread the virus to humans, than
about dead birds.
</P>
<P>
   ''People's risk is very, very low,'' said Valerie Bassett, a
policy writer at the Boston Health Department. ''Certainly people
shouldn't be afraid, but we want to make sure they know the
precautions people could take.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the virus killed seven people and sickened more than
60 in the greater New York City area. So far this year, no human
deaths have been reported. A mosquito carrying the West Nile virus
has been found in Orange County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is fatal in only a few people who contract it. The
West Nile virus can cause encephalitis, a dangerous swelling of the
brain which can be deadly. Most who contract it experience flu-like
symptoms and never realize they have been exposed to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   There has been an extensive effort to combat the virus, which
has also been found in New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts also have raised the concerns of environmentalists
and others who say the pesticide used to control the mosquitoes is
harmful. Orange County, N.Y., plans to drop larvicide to kill
mosquito eggs in all the county's 20,000 municipal storm drains and
to distribute about 30,000 containers of free insect repellent
through local pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, New York City's Central Park was sprayed with
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Public service ads will be airing in 185 movie theaters in 11
at-risk counties in New York to educate people about the virus. The
ads will instruct people how to prevent mosquito bites.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Long Island Sound lobstermen based in Connecticut
contend that pesticide is killing millions of lobsters. So far,
there is no definitive proof of their claim. But the Western Long
Island Sound Lobster Association has hired researchers to
investigate if the pesticides caused the number of lobsters caught
to drop more than 50 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Wildlife in Massachusetts also voiced concerns
that pesticide spraying on a pond could harm the freshwater
three-spine stickleback, one of nine endangered or threatened
species of fish in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials in Massachusetts are attempting to keep
residents calm while advising them to use insect repellent, to wear
socks, shoes and long-sleeved shirts, and to remove sources of
standing water around their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Those precautions don't necessarily include worrying about dead
crows, says Dr. Kevin J. McGowan, curator and senior research
associate in charge of the ornithology and mammalogy collections at
the Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates.
</P>
<P>
   ''You should not worry about having a dead crow in your
backyard. You should be worried about having mosquitos in your
backyard,'' McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that crows don't move around with the virus -
they die from it.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're the victims here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though fear of animals with West Nile virus appears to be on the
rise, most people don't seem to be concerned about the threat to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was driving past marshlands yesterday and it crossed my
mind, but then I didn't think any more about it,'' Jim Mulcahy, of
Boston, said Monday. ''I wouldn't go walking through those
marshlands, though.''

<HEADLINE> Rev. Al Sharpton to appear at GOP convention  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - One of the last people in the world one
might expect to appear at the Republican National Convention will
show up with a written invitation, Al Sharpton. And he won't be
outside protesting.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, an outspoken civil rights activist, will be the guest
of conservative commentator Armstrong Williams on Tuesday inside
the First Union Center where the convention is being held.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton's office confirmed the visit Monday but said his entire
schedule had not been set yet. Williams said Sharpton will spend
most of the day with him, including doing his syndicated radio show
from inside the convention media area.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just trying to show that people of different political
persuasions can try to come together and talk about their
differences,'' Williams said. ''He's a minister, and there are some
issues we have in common.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton is detested by many in the Republican Party, who say
he's a polarizing figure and link him to Senate candidate Hillary
Rodham Clinton. In fact, Sen. John McCain, during his bid for the
GOP presidential nomination, called Sharpton and several others
''agents of intolerance.'' Republican National Committee Chairman
Jim Nicholson called Sharpton a hatemonger, an anti-Semite and a
racist.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Sharpton filed a $30 million libel lawsuit against
the RNC and Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of reaction will Sharpton get at a GOP national
convention?
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll certainly be interesting,'' Williams laughed. ''I think
people will be shocked, but then again, he'll be with me.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for Sharpton's appearance, Armstrong says he'll
attend the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're meeting each other half way, and what if it works?''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Sharpton's first visit to Philadelphia this year. He
attended a church rally in July to condemn the city police for the
videotaped beating of a carjacking suspect.

<HEADLINE> Watermelon linked to E. coli contamination  </HEADLINE>
By CARRIE ANTLFINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) - Contaminated watermelon may have caused some of
the more than 40 cases of food poisoning linked to a local Sizzler
restaurant, the city health commissioner said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant customers who ate watermelon were eight times more
likely to be sick that those who did not, Health Commissioner Seth
L. Foldy said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At least 42 people, some of them children, became ill in July
from E. coli bacteria that health officials have traced to the
Sizzler restaurant on Milwaukee's southside. One child, a
3-year-old girl, died. Another victim has filed a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Foldy said health officials are not blaming the watermelon
itself for making people sick, but rather bacteria that may have
been transferred to the melon.
</P>
<P>
   That means the bacteria on the outside of the melon could have
been transferred to the inside when it was cut, he said. The
bacteria was present for more than a day because people were
contaminated on different days, Foldy said.
</P>
<P>
   Tests of items from the restaurant found a raw beef product that
tested positive for E. coli. The Sizzler has been closed since
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials also are looking into a Pennsylvania packing
company's recall of ground beef that could be contaminated with E.
coli.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agriculture Department said Saturday that Moyer Packing
Co. is recalling 346,700 pounds of beef. The meat was produced July
11 and distributed to wholesalers in Connecticut, Delaware,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York,
Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said the meat may have
been reground and sold to retailers.
</P>
<P>
   No connection between the Milwaukee E. coli outbreak and the
Moyer beef has been found yet, but ''genetic fingerprinting''
should reveal if one exists, Foldy said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 42 Milwaukee cases, 18 are adults and 24 are children
between the ages of 1 and 15. At least nine adults and eight
children have been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, 3-year-old Brianna Kriefall died. The girl suffered
from a complication known as hemolytic uremic syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Three children remained at Children's Hospital Monday, one in
intensive care and two ''doing well,'' said Dr. Michael Chusid,
head of the hospital's infectious disease unit.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle Cetta, a 4-year-old from Long Island, N.Y., who ate at
the Sizzler while visiting her grandparents in Milwaukee, was in
critical but stable condition Monday at Schneider Children's
Hospital in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Foldy also said another child was hospitalized Monday with HUS.
Foldy declined to provide more information, saying only that the
child was at Children's Hospital and was considered stable.
</P>
<P>
   One of the adults who became ill, Jo-Anne Bushberger of New
Berlin, filed a class action lawsuit Monday against Sizzler USA
Franchise, Inc. and E.B. Management Co., said attorney Merton
Rotter.
</P>
<P>
   Bushberger, 58, was hospitalized at St. Luke's Medical Center
after eating watermelon and cantaloupe at Sizzler July 19. She
became ill two days later.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never have been so sick in my life,'' Bushberger said in a
telephone interview Monday from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for medical expenses, pain
and suffering, loss of earnings and other damages resulting from
the illness.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Eschenbacher, co-owner of the Milwaukee Sizzler, did not
immediately return calls to his home or his office Monday. A
message left at Sizzler's corporate headquarters in Culver City,
Calif., also was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1993, E. coli contamination sickened at least 10
patrons at a Sizzler restaurant in Corvallis, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1993, six people were sickened at Sizzlers in Grants
Pass and North Bend in Oregon. Unpasteurized milk contaminated with
E. coli bacteria was blamed for that outbreak.

<HEADLINE> Convicted killer sentenced for stalking co-worker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEDFORD, Pa. (AP) - A man whose plea agreement in a stalking
case fell apart after authorities learned he had been convicted of
stalking and killing a co-worker was sentenced to prison Monday.
</P>
<P>
   John Robert Reed, 44, of Altoona had reached a plea agreement
last spring to serve six months in jail or time served for stalking
and harassing the 22-year-old Bedford County woman when both worked
at the Seton Co. plant in Saxton last year.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, Bedford County Judge Daniel Howsare rejected that
agreement after a pre-sentence investigation revealed his
conviction in the 1995 killing. Reed then changed his plea to
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 1&AMP;frac12; to three
years in a state prison.
</P>
<P>
   At a preliminary hearing last November, the woman testified that
after the two had eaten lunch together for some time, Reed left a
teddy bear and flowers in her truck on separate occasions. She said
she was not interested in pursuing a relationship with Reed.
</P>
<P>
   But in Sept. 1999, Reed allegedly tried to get Acker to meet her
on a mountain top. He also said they need to ''look for a lost
dog'' and, on another occasion, tried to force her truck off a
rural mountain road, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Later that month, the woman noticed something wrong with the
brakes of her truck. An inspection by a mechanic revealed they had
been cut.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Reed allegedly impersonated a private investigator
in a telephone call to Acker's home and told her that people had
been following her, including one wanted for murdering an
18-year-old female about a mile from her home.
</P>
<P>
   Later that month, as she got out of her truck at work, police
said Reed approached Acker, showed her a badge, and warned her that
people were ''making plans to rape and murder her.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers persuaded Acker to call police, who arrested Reed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a New Jersey jury found Reed guilty of first-degree
murder, but in 1995 that state's Supreme Court reversed the
decision and ordered a retrial on the basis that police had
obtained an illegal confession.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were forced to offer Reed a plea agreement to
aggravated manslaughter, which carried a 5-to-10 year prison
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Reed spent eight years in jail before being paroled. Police said
Reed moved to Altoona and began working at Seton Co. about two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The victim in the New Jersey case, 25-year-old Susan Green of
Franklin, resembled Acker.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: GOP Drug Plan Is 'Baloney'  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- As Republicans opened their convention on
Monday in Philadelphia, President Clinton hurled criticism at them
from the warm climes of Florida. He put down their prescription
drug plan as ''a bunch of baloney'' that would help drug companies,
not the elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left Washington's rainy weather to enjoy some Florida
sunshine and do a little fund raising. With state insurance
commissioner and Senate candidate Bill Nelson in tow, Clinton was
attending three events here and in Palm Beach that were to raise
$1.1 million for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether he wins or not -- and I believe he will -- depends in no
small measure on what people believe the election is about,''
Clinton told a luncheon for Nelson. ''The only trouble we've got in
this election right now, anywhere in America, is the confusion that
exists about what the differences are between the candidates for
president, Senate and the two parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Palm Beach, Clinton accused Republicans are trying to
cloak a destructive agenda in ''a real pretty package ... and they
just hope nobody opens the package'' before the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think we're all wet. They think we're wrong,'' Clinton
said. ''You cannot allow your fellow Floridians to ... just
sleepwalk through this election.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton visited the David Barksdale Senior Center to highlight a
study by Families USA which said Americans 65 and older pay an
average of $1,205 a year for prescriptions, an annual price tag
that will rise to $2,810 each by 2010. ''The cost of prescription
drugs is taking too big a bite out of the fixed incomes of too many
seniors and people with disabilities,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Kessler, 81, of Tamarac, Fla., said she spends $2,300 a
year on prescriptions for high blood pressure, high cholesterol and
a heart condition. She works at the board of elections and a local
flea market to pay for those drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Kessler's medical bills went up when she fell and
broke a bone in her nose. In a voice made nasal by the cast across
her face, Kessler said she would like to stop working, but can't.
Of the GOP plan for private coverage, ''I think it's a bunch of
baloney,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that insurance companies consider private coverage
for Medicare recipients unworkable, and said the plan offered by
the House would allow drug makers to charge higher prices to
recover research costs, then sell the drugs in other countries for
a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm president, I'm not supposed to say it's a bunch of baloney
like Sylvia did,'' Clinton said. ''This plan that passed with the
votes of the Republican majority is basically designed for the
pharmaceutical companies who make the drugs, not the seniors who
take them. ... And it's unbelievable to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also cited a new administration report which said that
one in eight Medicare recipients is a disabled person under age 65,
a population that is expected to increase by 38 percent over the
next decade and is less likely to have private insurance coverage.
Disabled Medicare beneficiaries, Clinton said, pay 50 percent more
for drugs than do patients with full insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   While in Tampa, Clinton stopped by a conference on China trade,
and paused to greet a few players from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
football team who were practicing near the senior center.
</P>
<P>
   The president planned to linger in Florida through Tuesday
afternoon to play golf.

<HEADLINE> Sparks 73, Lynx 66  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Lisa Leslie had 14 second half points as the
Los Angeles Sparks overcame a slow start Monday night and pulled
away from the Minnesota Lynx for a 73-66 victory.
</P>
<P>
   DeLisha Milton led the Sparks, who have won nine straight on the
road, with 18 points as Los Angeles (25-3) won its ninth
consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (13-14) got 20 points from Betty Lennox and 16 from
Katie Smith, but the Lynx defenders were unable to stop Leslie's
dominance under the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Milton added career-highs with 14 rebounds and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind early, Minnesota went on a 14-0 tear and
led by as many as 13 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which was held without a field goal for nearly six
minutes, hit just six of its first 25 shots before ending the half
on a 12-4 run.
</P>
<P>
   Mwadi Mabika keyed the run for the Sparks, hitting a pair of
threes and finishing an end-to-end rush with a layup.
</P>
<P>
   Lynx forward Smith, who set a WNBA season record for
three-pointers in her previous outing, was just 3-for-12 in the
first half and missed her first three shots from beyond the arc.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Workers Accuse Army  </HEADLINE>
By TARA BURGHART
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A chemical weapons depot used by the Army
that has weathered bomb threats and false alarms now faces a
lawsuit from workers who claim they were sickened by highly toxic
nerve and mustard agents.
</P>
<P>
   The 18 workers, who are building an incinerator at the Umatilla
Chemical Depot, claim the Army is hiding leaks that occurred on
Sept. 15 -- the day they became sick.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember it hitting so hard it was like being punched in my
chest. Every breath you took, there was searing pain,'' said David
Bosley, 37, a millwright.
</P>
<P>
   ''Men were falling, men were crying, men were retching,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In filing the federal lawsuit Monday seeking compensation and
damages for workers, lawyer James E. McCandlish sought an
injunction to halt construction of the incinerator in eastern
Oregon until certain safety protections are in place. The suit also
names Massachusetts-based Raytheon Co., the company overseeing the
incinerator project.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our position is we are standing behind the many reports
generated by the many investigations into this incident, all of
which without exception have concluded clearly that chemical agents
from the stockpile were not involved in the Sept. 15 incident,''
said Chris Early, a spokesman for Raytheon.
</P>
<P>
   McCandlish said the workers are suffering in large part because
they weren't treated for chemical exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Army would've owned up to what it was immediately, the
workers could have gotten treatment that would have made their
symptoms less intense and less permanent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has been storing chemical agents at the depot since
1962, and says it has never had a chemical release that threatened
the health of employees, the public or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Binder, an Army spokeswoman, said several agencies,
including the Army, the state, and the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, had concluded that chemical agents stored at
the depot did not cause the workers' sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one who has looked at that data, who is trained to
interpret that data, has concluded that the chemical agents stored
at the depot were involved in the Sept. 15 incident,'' Binder said.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials suspect McCandlish is looking at raw data, which
could be misinterpreted without the necessary information about how
the air monitoring machines are calibrated, Binder said.
</P>
<P>
   Built during the Cold War, the Umatilla depot contains more than
3,000 tons of deadly nerve and mustard agents, or about 11 percent
of the nation's chemical-weapons stockpile. They are to be
destroyed after completion of the incinerator, scheduled for
October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The depot has been hit by problems in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 30, 1999, a system built to broadcast warnings of an
emergency at the depot sent out a false alarm. Not only was there
no leak, but the warnings -- blared out through loudspeakers -- told
people in Spanish, but not in English, to get indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there were at least 11 bomb threats called in over two
months earlier this year, temporarily halting work on the
incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   The 18 workers represented by McCandlish were among 34 who were
overcome by fumes on Sept. 15, he said. They work for a company
contracted by the Army to build the incinerator.

   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Helen Darling scored 15 of her
game-high 17 points in the second half Monday night, lifting the
Cleveland Rockers to a 76-65 win over the Detroit Shock.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (12-15) remained a half-game ahead of idle Washington
for fourth place in the Eastern Conference in the chase for playoff
position.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers (15-12), who trailed 35-28 at halftime, took their
first lead of the game, 51-48, on a three-point play by Mery
Andrade with 7:47 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers, who outscored the Shock 34-17 in the final 12
minutes of the game, led by 14 points with 41 seconds to go.
Detroit narrowed the gap with three 3-point baskets in the final 35
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, which lost to the Rockers 80-60 in Cleveland on July
28, scored the first six points of the game and never trailed in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Shock's biggest lead was 27-14 after a pair of free throws
by Barbara Farris with 7:27 remaining in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Palmer led Detroit with 16 points and Elena Tornikidou

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Leader To Visit C. America  </HEADLINE>
By ANNIE HUANG
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- President Chen Shui-bian said Monday he
will visit Taiwan's allies in Central America and Africa next month
in his first diplomatic offensive since taking office -- a trip
certain to annoy China.
</P>
<P>
   ''Diplomacy will symbolize and highlight our sovereignty,'' Chen
told a news conference. ''It will allow us to see the world and let
the world see Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-week trip, beginning Aug. 13, will take Chen to the
Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Gambia, Burkina Faso and
Chad Republic, which are among Taiwan's 29 diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's trip will start with a stop in Los Angeles, likely a
low-key, private visit that won't include meetings with American
officials. Such meetings would enrage Beijing and strain the
U.S.-China relationship.
</P>
<P>
   China considers Taiwan a part of its territory and not entitled
to its own foreign relations. The rival governments have been
involved in a tug of war, using foreign aid and investment to lure
away each other's diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
   While he has tried to improve relations with rival China, Chen
said Taiwan also must continue a campaign to join international
organizations, including the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Because of China's objections, Chen said he could foresee
difficulties involved in Taiwan's bid to rejoin the United Nations.
Taiwan was expelled from the world body in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the common wish of most Taiwanese,'' he said. ''We shall
not give up the campaign, but instead will try harder to push it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his second news conference since taking office in May, Chen
also called on China to honor a 1992 consensus in which the sides
agreed to set aside their dispute about Taiwan's political status.
</P>
<P>
   The sides should stop a recent debate on the definition of ''one
China,'' he said. China says the phrase means Taiwan is part of
Beijing-controlled China; Taipei says it refers to a reunified
China of the future -- one that Taiwan will only join voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ''The game of semantics is insignificant, we can drop it,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Geiberger Leads Wells Fargo Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWCASTLE, Wash. (AP) -- Brent Geiberger wasn't exactly a picture
of health as he teed off Monday at the Wells Fargo Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Geiberger, 32, missed the last three tournaments, including the
British Open, with a pinched nerve in his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night he injured a toe and was walking with a
noticeable limp.
</P>
<P>
   None of that seemed to matter as Geiberger shot a 6-under-par 66
to take a 3-shot lead after the first round of the 36-hole event at
The Golf Club at Newcastle, an east Seattle suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone should have his problems,'' joked tournament host and
Seattle native Fred Couples. ''We're all as healthy as we can be
and he's killing us.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cook, Seattle native Jeff Gove and Mike Weir all had 69s.
Jeff Sluman and Peter Jacobsen both shot 70s. Couples had a 73.
</P>
<P>
   But the day belonged to Geiberger, who said his shoulder seems
to be fully healed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to put twice as much effort into my swing,'' Geiberger
said. ''But I've been doing a lot of stretching. I don't have any
pain right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The toe was noticeably bothering Geiberger's walking, but not
his swing.
</P>
<P>
   He had three birdies on each side and just missed a seventh
birdie when his putt on No. 5 lipped out.
</P>
<P>
   He said the time off gave him a breather.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you take some time off and it helps,'' he said.
''You've got nothing on your mind. You're not fighting anything.''

<HEADLINE> Nurses at Robert Wood Johnson hospital approve contract, averting strike </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Registered nurses at Robert Wood Johnson
University Hospital, working without a contract for 3 1/2 weeks,
voted Monday to accept the hospital's ''final offer,'' averting a
strike set for Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses, represented by Local 300 of the Pace International
Union in Mountainside, voted 418-279 to accept a three-year
contract, according to Barbara Jones, vice president of
communications at the New Brunswick hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The previous contract expired June 30, but was extended by a
week. About 950 registered nurses had been working without a
contract since July 7, and on July 20, they voted 655-6 to reject
the 452-bed hospital's previous offer.
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, the day the hospital's negotiators made their final
contract offer, the union notified hospital administrators of a
possible strike at 11 p.m. Thursday, giving the 10 days' notice
required, Jones said. She said the administration had made ''all
the necessary preparations'' in case a strike occurred but would
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're optimistic that there will be a positive resolution'' to
the standoff, she said Monday afternoon before voting was complete.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials did not return calls seeking comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones would not discuss any provisions of the contract, but The
Home News Tribune reported that it included a 4 percent salary hike
in each year and the same health insurance as under the previous
contract, with no increase in deductibles.
</P>
<P>
   The contract also calls for the hospital to spend $1.7 million
to address concerns about staffing levels and to establish a nurse
practice committee as part of that effort, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wood Johnson, one of the state's premier teaching
hospitals and a major trauma center, is one of a few dozen
hospitals nationwide designated a ''Magnet Hospital'' by the
American Nurses Association for the excellence of its nursing
staff. The hospital is affiliated with the Robert Wood Johnson
Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the last strike by the hospital's nurses occurred in
1978 and lasted nearly a month.

	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Andy Thompson drove in the winning run
with his second double of the game for the Syracuse SkyChiefs in a
2-1 win over the Indianapolis Indians Monday in the International
League.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Mottola singled home Vernon Wells in the first. Mottola
doubled to right to start off the sixth inning. Mottola continued
onto third when Indians' right fielder Brad Tyler couldn't come up
with the ball cleanly in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson ripped a shot down the left field line scoring Mottola.
Thompson was 2-4 while Mottola was 2-3 in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mottola's defense saved a run in the fifth and helped Syracuse
earn the win. Mottola tracked down a long fly ball to the right
field wall off the bat of Jose Fernandez and then gunned the ball
to Kevin Witt at first to double-up Kevin Barker. Barker wandered a
little too far toward second base and could not out run Mottola's
cannon throw back to first.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez spoiled Syracuse's attempt at a second straight
shutout game. Fernandez cracked a solo homer in the eighth off of
Bob File.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians managed only three hits in the game. Two of those
off of winning pitcher Kerry Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse is on a roll winning seven of its last nine.
Indianapolis is sliding, winning only one of its last five and
three of the last 10 games.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Economic Expert Flores Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Jorge Oscar de Mello Flores, a
founder and president of the Getulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil's
most prestigious economics school, died Monday. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Flores died of lung cancer at his home in Rio, the foundation
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a civil engineer, Flores began his career as a civil
servant, eventually administering all personnel and public
buildings for Brazil's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Flores was named president of Chase Manhattan Bank in
Brazil, a position he held for 23 years until 1992, when he left to
become president of the Getulio Vargas Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation serves as a research center for Brazil's top
economists and is well known as a think tank throughout Latin
America for its reports on the Brazilian economy. The foundation
tracks inflation, consumer prices, employment and other economic
indicators.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Flores expanded the foundation's prestige
overseas, seeking international clients for its portfolio of
economic and sociological research.
</P>
<P>
   Flores was an advocate of free market policies and argued that
Brazil had to increase production to compete in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Wanda Dias Flores, a daughter and a
grandson. Burial plans were not immediately known.

<HEADLINE> Power Outage at Sydney Airport  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney Airport's control tower had its
second power outage in less than a month Tuesday, grounding
aircraft for an hour and leaving passengers facing lengthy delays.
</P>
<P>
   The brief power outage again set alarm bells ringing with less
than 50 days to go before the Olympic Games and the airport's
busiest weeks ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics begin Sept. 15 in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity to the control power failed at about 7:50 a.m., and
although a backup system kicked in immediately, no flights left for
an hour, airport spokesman Eric Aubert said. Power was restored at
8:50 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The delay created a backlog of 15 domestic and seven
international flights.
</P>
<P>
   Aubert said passengers had delays of up to an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dudley, a spokesman for Airservices Australia, the
government organization that oversees air traffic control, said
even though the airport had full backup power, takeoffs stopped
until Airservices worked out what caused the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted the outage and the airport's quick response
showed aviation authorities were ready for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were able to spring into action very quickly and ...
minimize delays to both aircraft and passengers as much as
possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All agencies within (the) airport are working very hard to get
any glitches out of the system as quickly as possible. We are very
confident of our role during the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the outage was being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   On July 6, a power blackout at Sydney Airport briefly shut down
radar and cut communications between air traffic controllers and
planes.
</P>
<P>
   A computer glitch caused a 2-minute blackout and computer
systems took another 10 minutes to reboot, forcing pilots into
holding patterns.

<HEADLINE> Cubs 2, Rockies 0  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Kevin Tapani pitched 6 2-3 shutout innings and
Mark Grace homered Monday night as the Chicago Cubs beat the
Colorado Rockies 2-0 for their ninth victory in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Tapani (7-8) allowed four hits to run his career record against
the Rockies to 6-0. He left in the seventh after giving up a single
to Brian Hunter and a walk to Butch Huskey with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Heredia then retired Terry Shumpert on a popup to end the
inning before Steve Rain and Rick Aguilera completed the
four-hitter. Aguilera got his 24th save in 31 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, who have lost 21 of 26 games, have been shut out
eight times this season -- all on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Grace had an RBI single in the fourth off Brian Bohanon (5-8)
and hit his 10th homer leading off the seventh against John Wasdin,
making his Rockies debut after being traded from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies fell a season-low four games under .500 despite a
strong effort from Bohanon, who allowed just five hits in six
innings, including two singles to Tapani.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cubs traded OF Henry Rodriguez and got OF Rondell White.
With neither in town, Gary Matthews Jr. got the start in left and
made two nice catches, one while crashing into the wall along the
left field line and the other while diving for a low liners. ...
Tapani's multi-hit game was the first of his career. After his
second single in the sixth, Bohannon picked him off second. ... The
three-game series marks the Rockies only appearance at Wrigley
Field this season. Colorado is 23-16 at Wrigley, its best road
showing against any team. ... The Cubs called up left-handers
Daniel Garibay and Phil Norton from Triple-A Iowa. ... The last
time the Rockies played at Wrigley on May 5, 1999, they became just
the third team since 1900 to score in every inning of a nine-inning
game.

<HEADLINE> Miller Has Up-and-Down Opening Act  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis Miller didn't quite seem ready for the regular season.
Time will tell if viewers are ready for Dennis Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The comedian gave an unsteady performance in his debut with
ABC's ''Monday Night Football'' during the preseason Hall of Fame
Game between the San Francisco 49ers and New England Patriots,
mixing in some witty remarks with on-the-job training as an
announcer.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was hired in June as part of a nearly complete overhaul
of the show, which has seen its ratings steadily decline each of
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   And he did produce what might have been expected from him and no
other person with a football broadcasting job -- before the end of
the first quarter, Miller's commentary already included references
to the pope, male genitalia, and the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
</P>
<P>
   There were later remarks about the Socratic method, the Rosetta
stone, and Sergio Leone films.
</P>
<P>
   On his first outing, Miller kept his wry rants far shorter than
he has on TV shows like NBC's ''Saturday Night Live'' and his
current ''Dennis Miller Live'' on HBO (which play-by-play man Al
Michaels, the lone on-air holdover from last season, duly plugged
in the second quarter).
</P>
<P>
   Much of what Miller said, in fact, sounded like scripted jokes.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed as if he had carefully studied the team's rosters and
written down riffs on names.
</P>
<P>
   On Patriots Pro Bowl safety Lawyer Milloy playing special teams:
''You know lawyers -- they get paid by the hour.''
</P>
<P>
   On San Francisco's Jeff Garcia: ''He's the Canadian league
import with the Mexican-sounding name. A NAFTA quarterback. And
trust me they'll feel free to trade him if it doesn't pan out this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   On Garcia's backup, Giovanni ''Gio'' Carmazzi: ''I'm surprised
Carmazzi is here. I thought I heard something about a Geo recall
earlier today.''
</P>
<P>
   And when 49ers rookie receiver Eric Chew was involved in a play,
Miller couldn't resist bringing up regurgitation.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, clearly the showpiece of the new ''Monday Night
Football'' crew, didn't appear on-camera until 6 minutes into the
broadcast, as Michaels first introduced viewers to his other new
cohorts -- Eric Dickerson and Melissa Stark on the sidelines for the
fired Lesley Visser, then new Xs-and-Os analyst Dan Fouts for the
fired Boomer Esiason.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, with tie knot loosened, opened by saying, ''You know,
Al, if there's anybody in this stadium more pumped up than me they
wouldn't pass the league's standardized drug test, all right?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a quick analysis of the Patriots -- during which he
appeared to be looking down at notes -- Miller introduced himself:
''As far as my personal approach to the game, well, I know a lot of
you people are thinking that I won't take this seriously. But I
just want you to know it is a game, but I also realize it's a game
many of you take seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the Vatican, but then again the pope doesn't have to
go across the middle on guys like Ronnie Lott very frequently.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles 6, Twins 5  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Albert Belle ended the longest homerless
drought of his career and Sidney Ponson pitched seven strong
innings as the revamped Baltimore Orioles beat the Minnesota Twins
6-5 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Casimiro doubled in two runs in his first major league
at-bat for the Orioles, whose new-look lineup has produced three
straight wins.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Baltimore capped a four-day flurry of trades by
sending left fielder B.J. Surhoff to the Atlanta Braves and dealing
first baseman Will Clark to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Casimiro's hit put Baltimore up 4-1 in the third, and newcomer
Melvin Mora scored two runs and stole a base. But four of the few
remaining Oriole veterans contributed the most to the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's two-run homer in the first inning put Baltimore ahead to
stay. It was his 19th of the season and first since June 29, ending
a string of 27 games and 109 at-bats without a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Delino DeShields had two hits, scored twice and drove in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson (6-7) allowed four runs and seven hits in seven-plus
innings, striking out four and walking one, to snap a three-game
skid. He's 5-0 with a 1.73 ERA lifetime against the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Two Orioles errors enabled Minnesota to close to 6-5 in the
ninth before Mike Trombley got the last three outs for his third
save.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Juan Romero (0-1), making his first major league
start and sixth appearance, allowed five runs and six hits in 4 2-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Coomer homered and David Ortiz had three hits for the Twins,
who are 6-28 against Baltimore over the past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's shot to right after a single by DeShields made it 2-0.
Coomer homered in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Casimiro followed singles by Mora and DeShields with a double
into the gap in right-center in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota got an RBI grounder from Jacque Jones in the fifth,
but Baltimore scored in its half when Mora walked, stole second,
took third on an error and came home on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins closed to 5-3 in the seventh when Ortiz doubled and
scored on a single by Corey Koskie. DeShields hit a sacrifice fly
in the Orioles' half.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer singled in a run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Twins' Matt Lawton left the game early with a sprained
right toe, an injury that occurred while he attempted to catch
Belle's homer. ... Casimiro was recalled from Double-A Bowie before
game. He replaced Jeff Conine, who left the game in the third
inning because of personal reasons. ... Lesli Brea, acquired from
the Mets in the trade for Mike Bordick, allowed two runs and four
hits in six innings in his debut Monday with Bowie. ... 1B Chris
Richard went 1-for-4 in his first game with Baltimore. ... Ortiz is
on a 24-for-45 streak.

<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas State junior tackle Anthony Bates
died Monday after being involved in an automobile accident near
campus, the university said.
</P>
<P>
   Bates was driving southbound just before noon when his pickup
crossed into the northbound lane and struck a car, then continued
on and struck two parked cars before coming to a stop, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, 20, was taken to a hospital, where he died in the
afternoon. No other medical information was available, Kansas State
sports information director Dick Dull said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened on the day newcomers reported to preseason
camp for the Wildcats, who are starting practice early to prepare
for their Aug. 26 opener against Iowa in the Eddie Robinson Classic
at Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, who transferred from Phoenix Junior College and sat out
last season as a redshirt, was to have reported Thursday with other
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   A management information systems major, Bates earned academic
honors on the Big 12 Conference Commissioner's Honor Roll in three
semesters.
</P>
<P>
   He was an all-state player at Mountain Pointe High School in
Phoenix, graduating in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bates was an Eagle Scout and a member of the National Honor
Society and Fellowship of Christian Athletes. He is survived by his
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a memorial service were pending.

<HEADLINE> Court Ruling on Pinochet's Immunity  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chile's Supreme Court will rule Tuesday
whether Gen. Augusto Pinochet should lose his immunity from
prosecution over human rights abuses linked to his 1973-90
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the court lifts Pinochet's immunity, it is still
unclear whether the figure who so dramatically divides Chilean
society will ever face trial.
</P>
<P>
   The court's 20 justices will gather to make their decision on
Pinochet's appeal of a lower tribunal ruling stripping him of his
congressional immunity from prosecution -- though it was not certain
the ruling would be announced immediately.
</P>
<P>
   There is no appeal to the Supreme Court decision.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet faces 153 criminal complaints and judge Juan Guzman is
seeking his trial in one of them, the so-called ''caravan of
death'': a military squad that summarily executed 72 political
prisoners in several cities shortly after Pinochet's bloody 1973
coup.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the court rules against Pinochet, a lawyer for the
plaintiffs, Hugo Gutierrez, said he was not sure if he would
immediately seek an indictment. He said he feels the case might
never come to trial because Pinochet's case is so sensitive and
could drag on in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not decided on a strategy in case he finally loses
immunity,'' Gutierrez told The Associated Press. ''In fact, I am
skeptical of the Chilean courts.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published Monday in the newspaper La Segunda,
Gutierrez hinted that if the court ruled against Pinochet on
Tuesday that might be enough. ''I do not see Pinochet going to
jail. In fact, I would be happy seeing him stripped of his
immunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the immunity is lifted, one factor that could cause long
delays in legal procedings is the issue of Pinochet's medical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pinochet is older than 70, he must be given medical tests
to determine if he is fit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's lawyers and family, who have unsuccessfully sought
those tests in the past, now say they will oppose them if Pinochet
is finally stripped of his immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, they say, is for the sake of Pinochet's dignity. To
be exempted from trial, Pinochet would have to be pronounced
''mad'' or ''demented.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Having Gen. Pinochet exempted from trial for medical reasons
after being stripped of immunity would tarnish his historical
figure,'' said Pablo Rodriguez, an attorney for the 84-year old
former military ruler.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gen. Pinochet is not demented, nor even senile,'' Rodriguez
said. ''He is ill but his problems are organic.''
</P>
<P>
   If Pinochet refuses the test, that would leave Guzman facing the
legal question of whether he can try a defendant without the
required medical examination.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet suffers from diabetes, carries a pacemaker and
sustained three mild strokes during his 16-month house arrest in
London, which ended last March.
</P>
<P>
   He had been arrested on a warrant by a Spanish judge wanting to
try him, but was released after British doctors determined he was
mentally and physically unfit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by the civilian government that succeeded
Pinochet, 3,197 people were killed or vanished during his 17-year
rule.

<HEADLINE> Text of Colin Powell's Speech  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   With character in their hearts, with nurturing adults in their
lives, our youngsters will be ready for the schooling that will
give them the education needed to win those jobs of the future.
</P>
<P>
   There is work for all of us here to do -- parents, aunts, uncles,
teachers, the government at all levels, the private sector, our
great non-profits, our houses of worship, all joining in the
crusade to point kids in the right direction of life.
</P>
<P>
   And tonight, we focus on education, the keystone to it all.
Governor Bush has rightly made children and education the
centerpiece of his campaign for president. You heard him say it
earlier, we can't leave any child behind.
</P>
<P>
   Every child -- every child deserves and must receive a quality
education. Because when you give a quality education to a child who
believes in himself or herself, then even with the bleakest
beginning in life, that child can make it. And once that child
makes it and gets out into the workplace and is earning a decent
living, you have broken the cycle of poverty and failure for that
family forever. Education is the key to breaking that cycle of
poverty and failure.
</P>
<P>
   So many, many of our public schools are doing a fine job
preparing our youngsters. I have been given no greater honor than
to have had four public schools named after me, an honor that is
greater than any medals I have received. In those four schools and
so many others that I visited, you've never seen better facilities,
you've never seen more dedicated teachers, you've never seen more
involved parents. It makes your heart pound with pride to see those
great schools that we have in America.
</P>
<P>
   But I've also seen too many schools that are failing. They are
trapped in fossilized bureaucracies -- bureaucracies that have low
expectations for children and consequently set low standards for
them. These schools are failing our children, and they must be
fixed, and they must be fixed now.
</P>
<P>
   You know, if we truly believe -- if we truly believe they are all
our children, then all of us must be willing to spend more to
repair our schools and spend more to pay our teachers better. But
we must also be open to new ideas. Let's not be afraid of
standardized testing for students. Let's not be afraid of testing
teachers' qualifications. Let's not be afraid of charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not be afraid of using private scholarship money to give
poor parents a choice that wealthy parents have.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not be afraid of home schooling. Let's experiment
prudently with school voucher programs to see if they help.
</P>
<P>
   What are we afraid of?
</P>
<P>
   Let's use innovation and competition, good old American
innovation, good old American competition to help give our children
the best education possible.
</P>
<P>
   Why? You know, we invite skilled workers to come to America from
all over the world to fill the good jobs that are waiting here. I
think that's great. Immigration is part of our life's blood. It's
part of the essence of who we are as Americans.
</P>
<P>
   I am the son of immigrants. But I also want our kids here
educated and trained for those jobs. We owe it to them, and we've
got to get on with the task right now.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush has shown in Texas in just a few short years what
can be done for education. As governor, he ended social promotions
for kids. He increased state funding by $8 billion. He put new
textbooks in every school in the state of Texas. He strengthened
standardized testing in all Texas public schools.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted on teacher competency, and he expanded the charter
school movement. Seventeen thousand Texas kids are now in charter
school. Seventy-eight percent of those kids are minorities. Their
parents had a choice, and they decided what was best for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   And the results -- the results in Texas have been dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The number of students in Texas passing all parts of the
standardized tests since 1994, when Governor Bush came in the
office, the number has increased by 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even -- even more exciting -- even more exciting, the number of
minority students passing the tests has increased by 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's what we can do for our children.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't stopped there. He hasn't stopped there. To ensure a
diverse college population, with the loss of affirmative action,
Governor Bush has guaranteed acceptance at public universities to
the top 10 percent of every high school graduating class in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   And above all -- above all -- he has insisted on accountability
for results that will tell us whether we're getting our money's
worth.
</P>
<P>
   You see, Governor Bush -- Governor Bush has shown us that it
works. It all comes together. Governor Bush doesn't just talk about
reform, he reforms. And he as done it in Texas with education.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush now offers the leadership that he has demonstrated
in Texas to the nation. In pursuing education reform, as well as in
all other parts of his agenda in Texas, Governor Bush has reached
out to all Texans -- white, black, Latino, Asian, Native American.
</P>
<P>
   He has been successful on bringing more and more minorities into
the tent by responding to their deepest needs. Some call it
compassionate conservatism. To me, it's just caring about people.
</P>
<P>
   I believe he can do the same thing as president. I am convinced
he will bring to the White House that same passion for inclusion. I
know that he can help bridge our racial divides. I know that.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Governor Bush addressed the annual meeting of the
NAACP. He spoke to the delegates about his plans for housing and
health and educational programs to help all Americans. He also
spoke the truth to the delegates when he said that the party of
Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of Lincoln. I talked with
him again today and I know that with all his heart, Governor Bush
welcomes the challenge. He wants the Republican Party to wear that
mantle again.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows and I know and all of you must know that it's going
to take hard work.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that that mantle will not simply be handed over, that
it will have to be earned. The party must follow the governor's
lead in reaching out to minority communities and particularly the
African-American community.
</P>
<P>
   And not just during an election year campaign. My friends, if
we're serious about this it has to be a sustained effort, it must
be every day, and it must be for real. The party must listen to and
speak with all leaders of the black community, regardless of
political affiliation or philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   We must understand, my friends, we must understand that there is
a problem for us out there. We must understand the cynicism that
exists in the black community, the kind of cynicism that is created
when, for example, some in our party miss no opportunity to roundly
and loudly condemn affirmative action that helped a few thousand
black kids get an education, but you hardly hear a whimper when
it's affirmative action for lobbyists who load our federal tax code
with preferences for special interests. It doesn't work. It doesn't
work. You can't make that case.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming the cynicism and mistrust that exists, and raising up
that mantle of Lincoln, is about more -- it's much more about than
just winning votes, it is about giving all minorities a competitive
choice.
</P>
<P>
   They deserve that choice. And if we give them that choice, it
will be good for our party. But above all, it will be good for
America, and we need to work to give them that choice.
</P>
<P>
   Good for America -- that must be the measure for all that we do.
I believe that's the measure that Governor Bush will use to guide
his actions as president. Whether it's economic policy or military
strategy or seeing what we can do to make our American family more
inclusive, he will always try to do that which is good and right
for America.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, we stand at an historic turning point in
world history. For the first time in almost a century, America does
not face an enemy fueled by an ideology claiming to be superior to
our beloved system of democracy, free enterprise and the rights of
men and women to pursue their individual destinies.
</P>
<P>
   We defeated communism. We defeated fascism. We defeated them on
the field of battle, and we defeated them on the field of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The sick nations that still pursue the fool's gold of tyranny
and weapons of mass destruction will soon find themselves left
behind in the dust bin of history.
</P>
<P>
   They are investing in their own demise as surely as the Soviet
Union did by investing in the Red Army. They are of the past, and
we are of the future. Count on it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we are the most powerful nation on Earth -- militarily,
economically, by any measure. We are that rarity in history, a
trusted nation whose power is tempered by compassion, whose
leadership is earned by example and whose foreign affairs will be
guided by common interests and common sense.
</P>
<P>
   The world is watching to see if all this power and wealth is
just for the well-to-do, the comfortable, the privileged, or are we
a nation that can make our dream real for all Americans so that all
share in what we have been given by a generous God?
</P>
<P>
   We must show to the rest of the world, the beauty and potential
of democracy. Our greatest strength is the power of our example to
be that shining city on the hill that Ronald Reagan spoke of and
that the whole world looks up to.
</P>
<P>
   To continue to be that place, we must all work together. We must
reach down, back and across. All of us coming together to show the
world what our American family can do. That is the challenge. This
is the time. And in Governor George Bush, we have the leader.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush -- Governor Bush is a man who believes deeply in
this country. He is a man who comes from a family with a
generations-long tradition of public service. He will bring
character and integrity to the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man of principle who will make partners and not enemies.
He will use government to help where it makes sense and get rid of
it where it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   He will win respect on the world stage by exemplifying the best
ideals of America. He will not repeat the mistakes of the past and
let our insurance policy, our armed forces, fall into disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan ... Let me tell you something, Ronald Reagan and
George Bush didn't let that happen, and I know that President
George W. Bush will not let that happen either.
</P>
<P>
   At his side as vice president will be a man I have known and
respected for many years and with whom I shared many difficult days
and nights during Desert Storm and other crises. He was a loyal and
faithful steward of the young GIs entrusted to his care by the
American people. Dick Cheney is one of the most distinguished and
dedicated public servants this nation has ever had. He will be a
superb vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-Cheney team will be a great team for America. They will
put our nation on a course of hope and optimism for this new
century. The century historians will look back on and record not
that it was the American century or the European century or the
Asian century, instead let us pray that when they look back, they
will call it the century of democracy, a time when America led the
world that wants to be free to an era of unprecedented peace and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   For all our children's sake, above all, let us as a party strive
from this moment on to make that century a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Republicans, fellow Americans, let's elect George W. Bush
and Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you very much and God bless America.

<HEADLINE> Powell Chides GOP, Lauds Bush  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Colin Powell, the only black to serve as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, chided Republicans who miss
no opportunity to ''roundly and loudly condemn affirmative
action,'' even as he praised George W. Bush on Monday for bridging
racial divides.
</P>
<P>
   In a prime-time Republican National Convention address designed
to soften the edges of the GOP image, the retired general said,
''In pursuing educational reform, as well as in all other parts of
his agenda for Texas, Governor Bush has reached out to all Texans --
white, black, Latino, Asian, Native American.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell is one of the most prominent blacks on the political
scene with an appeal that crosses racial and economic lines. The
Persian Gulf War commander refused Bush's entreaties for the vice
presidential nomination, but has suggested he would like to be
secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hinted Powell would get a job in his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope his greatest service to America might still lie
ahead,'' the Texas governor said, introducing Powell by satellite
from a campaign stop in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before a GOP delegation that is 83 percent white,
Powell urged the party to follow Bush's lead and reach out to
minorities, particularly blacks, ''and not just during an election
year campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell, whose abortion-rights and pro-affirmative action views
put him to the left of most delegates and in opposition to Bush,
said the Republican Party has far to go to bring minorities into
the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must understand the cynicism that exists in the black
community. The kind of cynicism that is created when, for example,
some in our party miss no opportunity to roundly and loudly condemn
affirmative action that helped a few thousand black kids get an
education, but you hardly heard a whimper from them over
affirmative action for lobbyists who load our federal tax codes
with preferences for special interests,'' Powell said to polite
applause from a convention hall of delegates who overwhelmingly
oppose affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 convention that nominated Bob Dole, Powell heard
scattered boos when he declared, ''I believe in a woman's right to
choose and I strongly support affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention abortion Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Beside race, Powell challenged Republican doctrine on spending
and class economics.
</P>
<P>
   Urging Republicans to help the poorest Americans, he said, ''The
world is watching to see if all this power and wealth is just for
the well to do, the comfortable, the privileged.''
</P>
<P>
   And Powell, chairman of a nationwide volunteer campaign to help
children, said more money is needed to improve schools and raise
teacher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   He was most blunt about race.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue of race still casts a shadow over our society,
despite the impressive progress we have made over the last 40 years
to overcome this legacy of our troubled past that is still with
us,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   In praising Bush, the retired general said, ''He has been
successful in bringing more and more minorities inside the tent by
responding to their deepest needs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He will bring to the White House that same passion for
inclusion. I know that he can help bridge our racial divides,''
Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush disagrees with Powell on abortion and affirmative action,
but that didn't seem to matter to Republicans here.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think General Powell's speech shows that Republicans are
diverse and tolerant -- not just the classic white, rich guys with
an attitude,'' said Jose Alcaraz, 43, an accountant from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican Party has grown up and is willing to hear
provocative messages from people it respects. And the Republican
Party respects Colin Powell,'' said Mike Huckabee, a conservative
governor from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they were unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson said Powell ''gave a
tremendous civil rights address about poverty, schools and drugs,
but the Bush budget of debt elimination and tax relief does not
leave the money'' to deal with those issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush strategist Karl Rove said Powell's appearance spoke loudly
for Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''The signal this sends is that Republicans want to take the
next step in improving the lives of all Americans and it shows what
the governor means by 'compassionate conservatism,''' Rove said.
''It also shows that the governor is strong enough to surround
himself by strong leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   The retired Army general told delegates that education is the
nation's highest priority.
</P>
<P>
   ''So many of our problems we worry about go back to how we raise
our children. The problem is as simple as this: We either build our
children the way we know how or we build more jails,'' Powell said.
''Time to stop building jails.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They are America's promise,'' he said of the nation's
children. ''The problem is us -- if we fail to give them what they
need to be successful in life.''
