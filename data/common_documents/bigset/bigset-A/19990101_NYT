TWENTY SIMPLE STEPS TOWARD PERSONAL UDGET SURPLUS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Every year, millions of Americans pledge to put
their financial house in order. This year, they say to themselves,
it will be different.
</P>
<P>
   They'll save and invest more. They'll even stick to a budget.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the second-most popular New Year's resolution is to
achieve financial goals, according to Citibank. The first? Lose
weight and live more healthfully.
</P>
<P>
   We'll leave the weight loss to Jenny Craig. But it's not that
hard to save.
</P>
<P>
   Before you steel yourself for a dramatic decrease in lifestyle,
don't panic. Many changes can be made without much suffering.
</P>
<P>
   It's just a matter of plugging the money leaks in your life that
won't deflate your (ITAL)joie de vivre(END ITAL). But keep in mind
that saving money is not an end in itself. It's not a race to see
how much one can save, but to provide adequately for the future.
Money gives us freedom to enjoy the more important things in life.
</P>
<P>
   Here are tips from the Sisters of Savings: Mary Hunt, editor of
Cheapskate Monthly, a newsletter based in Paramount, and members of
the Beardstown Ladies investment club, who wrote ``Smart Spending
for Big Savings.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior ladies of Beardstown, Ill., who got into trouble for
miscalculating their published investment club returns,
nevertheless have this wise advice: Pay more attention to things
that will yield greater savings.
</P>
<P>
   Many people spend hours clipping coupons to save on their
grocery bill. But they often don't spend enough time shopping
around for auto or homeowners insurance, which will yield bigger
savings. People may drive an extra mile to get soda a few cents
cheaper, but they think nothing of buying extended warranties that
cost a lot and often are unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   As such, most of this year's tips focus on cutting the big bills
in your life:
</P>
<P>
   1. Make an extra payment a year on your mortgage. On a $50,000
mortgage of 30 years at 8 percent, the monthly payment would be
$366.88. If you increase your monthly payment to $370, just paying
$3.12 extra, it would reduce your loan repayment period by a year.
Paying biweekly is an option too, but some lenders will charge you
for switching schedules.
</P>
<P>
   2. Lower your homeowners insurance premium by buying auto or
life insurance from the same company. By not smoking, installing
smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, fire-resistant doors and a
security alarm system, you could also get a discount. Raising your
deductible also works. Some insurers give breaks to people over 50
or retirees and longtime customers.
</P>
<P>
   3. Consider disability insurance. In a Cheapskate Monthly
survey, 2,000 seriously ill people with medical insurance still
lost everything they owned because of the resulting disability.
Half of mortgage foreclosures are a result of disability, far more
than death.
</P>
<P>
   4. Don't automatically buy a more popular name-brand appliance,
which will cost more. General Electric also makes Gibson,
Kelvinator, Tappan and White Westinghouse. Maytag also makes
Admiral, Hardwick, Magic Chef, Jenn-Air, Montgomery Ward and Norge.
Whirlpool also makes KitchenAid, Roper and Estate. Sears'
appliances are made by GE, Whirlpool and others.
</P>
<P>
   5. Buy energy-efficient appliances. For example, gas ranges with
an automatic spark ignition system are 30 percent more efficient
than ones with pilot lights. But skip the extended warranties.
</P>
<P>
   6. Wash clothes with cold water. It doesn't make a difference
and saves on heating.
</P>
<P>
   7. Lower the temperature on your water heater to 125 degrees
from 140 degrees. The water will still be hot enough and you'll
save up to 10 percent on heating.
</P>
<P>
   8. Insulate your home properly to retain heat. Shade your home
to keep it cool and save on air-conditioning costs.
</P>
<P>
   9. Buy a slightly used car. New cars depreciate 20 percent after
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   10. Drive cars longer. Maintain them well.
</P>
<P>
   11. Don't borrow money to make your life just slightly better,
such as going into debt to buy nice clothes and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   12. Tap your home equity loan. The interest rate will be cheaper
than those offered by your credit cards. You can also deduct the
interest from your taxes.
</P>
<P>
   13. Contribute to a tax-deferred retirement plan such as a
401(k) or IRA.
</P>
<P>
   14. Get a credit card that gives rebates, airline miles or other
perks.
</P>
<P>
   15. Travel in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   16. Instead of eating dinner out with friends, try for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   17. Skip fads and fashions. They usually cost more.
</P>
<P>
   18. Save your coins. After a year, it could add up to hundreds
or thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   19. Go to afternoon movie matinees and save one-third of the
ticket cost.
</P>
<P>
   20. Buy in bulk, especially medicine such as aspirin. Buy
generic brands.

MELSBY GETS OVER BAD MIAMI MEMORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Every fisherman has a story about the one that got
away. UCLA receiver Brad Melsby's is as fresh in his mind as
today's catch.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in a spot once renowned for its Dolphins, he reeled
in a thing of beauty. He had that ornery sucker hook, line and
sinker until it released on him and was swept away by a Hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most such stories, this one had some 47,000 witnesses and
a national television audience to boot. ESPN's ``Fishin' Hole,'' it
was not. Nor, we're happy to report, was Melsby's setback in Miami
a black hole that swallowed him whole after spitting out the
Bruins' 20-game winning streak and their national-title hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The junior split end was bummed for a few days. But he soon
realized that his lost fumble after a marvelous catch late in the
fourth quarter of UCLA's game against Miami wasn't the sole reason
the Bruins were deep-sixed at the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It only seemed that way because that snippet from the game was
what all the sports highlights shows ran with. As excruciating as
it was for Melsby to watch himself lose that football over and over
and over again, it wasn't necessarily a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   The replays clearly showed he was down when the ball squirted
free at the Hurricane 26 with under three minutes to play. Miami
proceeded to drive 74 yards for the winning points.
</P>
<P>
   The more Melsby saw his innocence upheld, the easier it was to
let go of his personal guilt. Twenty-seven days later he's eager to
wade back into the current, bait the Wisconsin secondary and land
the catch of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy to be able to say, `Oh, well, that's the way it
goes,' after the Miami game,'' Melsby said after a recent practice
leading up to today's Rose Bowl date against the No.9 Badgers. ``I
don't think I'll ever be able to say that. I feel partly
responsible for what happened. But that's the chance you take when
you play.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming from Melsby, that answer qualifies as a filibuster. There
are knees and ankles and knuckles in the Bruins' locker room that
are louder than the former Orange County prep standout.
</P>
<P>
   He is the quietest of communications majors, reserving most of
his words for the journals he keeps. His introversion should not be
mistaken for introspection, though it often is by outsiders who
persist in pursing the angle that Melsby is his own worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's been exaggerated a bit,'' said the redshirt
junior, who caught a 61-yard touchdown pass with 21 seconds left to
beat Oregon State in November. ``I'm hard on myself. But so are the
other receivers. (The difference is) I don't hide the way I feel if
I'm disappointed about a practice or a game. I show it. That's just
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is kind of a perfectionist, but not to the point
where it's self-destructive,'' said junior offensive tackle Kris
Farris, who is Melsby's closest friend on the team along with
defensive end Pete Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Farris and Melsby are like Oscar and Felix, with Farris
scattering sentences all over the place and Melsby neatly
compartmentalizing his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Farris is playful, Melsby is pensive. Melsby is laconic, Farris
is loquacious. Farris can tick off the winners of the best-picture
Oscar. Melsby can rattle off Stanley Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   They're so completely different, it's no wonder they get along
so well. They clicked from the start, though Farris couldn't be
sure at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Farris, a very good player at Santa Margarita High, was
in awe of Melsby, who was putting up astonishing numbers at Los
Alamitos High (he would wind up the leading career receiver in
Orange County high-school history).
</P>
<P>
   So shortly after they both committed to UCLA, Farris called
Melsby on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of nervous,'' Farris recalled, ``because Brad was
pretty big-time. I was used to reading the daily report on Brad
Melsby in the papers. I asked him if he wanted to be roommates and
he said OK and the conversation sort of died right there. I wasn't
sure what to make of that. I was like, does he think I'm an idiot
for asking or what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the first day we moved in for our freshman year,'' Farris
continued, warming to his subject, ``I remember he cracked open a
Stephen King novel. All I wanted to do was talk to him, and all he
wanted to do was read. I was, like, what's this guy's story?''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later nothing _ and everything _ has changed. Melsby
can't crack open a book without getting completely sidetracked by
Farris' wisecracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living with Kris, it's been a lot of fun,'' Melsby said.
``He's helped me to see the humor in a lot of situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Melsby, Farris and Holland are so close, a single word that
sounds perfectly innocuous to anyone else who hears it can send the
three of them into hysteria. They have more inside jokes than did
Seinfeld's Jerry, George and Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   Much like that sitcom, their gig may be ending prematurely, in a
few months' time. Today's game could be Farris' last in a UCLA
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of strange,'' Melsby mused. ``Kris is so loose, and
he's the one who's going to have football be a part of his life for
so much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   That's mainly how things have changed between Melsby and Farris.
The way Melsby was celebrated coming out of high school, that's how
Farris is being lionized now. After winning the Outland Trophy,
he's hearing the siren song of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Melsby, meantime, has struggled to regain his freshman form and
promise after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left
knee during spring drills in his sophomore year. The injury
effectively cost him two seasons as his physical and psychological
wounds were painfully slow to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness he always had fishing. If there's anything Melsby
catches better than footballs, it's fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lake by my house that my family had been going to
three times a year since I was seven,'' Farris said. ``I had never
caught any fish there but the first time I took Brad, he got a bass
within five minutes. That was the first time I thought fishing was
a skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Angling for answers, we landed Melsby's secret to fishing and to
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience,'' Melsby said, smiling. ``That's the key.'' &QL;

COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL CONSTRUCTION BOOM PREDICTED FOR L.A. BASIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Before the new year could even begin, an
influential commercial real estate company predicted that 1999 will
kick off a massive construction spurt that will add the equivalent
of Orange County to the five-county Los Angeles Basin by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Growth will be spread throughout the region, with big jumps
expected in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, Ontario and
Orange County, concluded The Seeley Co. in a report released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Already, construction is heating up around the San Fernando and
surrounding valleys. After recession killed commercial and
industrial construction during the middle of the decade, a
construction upturn that began in 1998 is expected to turn into a
construction boom in 1999 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   --A sprawling, 1.3 million-square-foot, campus-style office
complex with up to nine buildings is planned for a 35-acre site in
Warner Center, in suburban Woodland Hills, where Prudential Health
Care has its Western regional headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Lennar Partners, a unit of Miami-based LNR Property Corp.,
recently bought the land at the northeast corner of Canoga Avenue
and Burbank Boulevard and is willing to spend more than $200
million on the development. It will be the most ambitious project
proposed for the Warner Center area during the past decade. Plans
call for buildings to be torn down, so the net amount of expansion
at the site will be about 800,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   --20th Century Industries, one of the largest employers in the
San Fernando Valley area, recently broke ground for a $100 million,
273,000-square-foot office tower next to the company's headquarters
in Woodland Hills. The 11-story building is expected to be
completed in December.
</P>
<P>
   --The largest single development ever proposed for Los Angeles
County -- the massive, 12,000-acre Newhall Ranch in the Santa
Clarita Valley -- won unanimous approval from the Board of
Supervisors in November.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the project involve 21,615 homes, which are
expected to house more than 60,000 people, but it also includes
plans for 5 million square feet of commercial and industrial space.
Construction is expected to start in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, about half of the job growth predicted in the Seeley
report will occur in Los Angeles County, in part because of
residential expansion of the Santa Clarita Valley. The rest will
come in Ventura and Orange counties and the Inland Empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``About two-thirds of the growth will be in areas like the Santa
Clarita Valley, southeast Orange County and the Inland Empire,
areas which are not yet built out,'' said Dennis Macheski, Seeley's
real estate economist.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Los Angeles area -- L.A., Ventura, Riverside, San
Bernardino and Orange counties -- is expected to swell by 3 million
people, or 18 percent, in the next decade. Employment is expected
to grow by more than 1 million jobs, or 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate that growth, the region will have to build enough
industrial buildings and commercial space to equal an area the size
of Orange County: that's 55 million square feet of office space,
200 million square feet of industrial space, about 100 million
square feet of retail space and more than 1 million housing units,
according to Seeley.
</P>
<P>
   Such growth ``is going to tax the infrastructure and it's going
to require more transportation facilities,'' said Ted Gibson, chief
economist for the California Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   But Seeley officials said the region can accommodate the
seemingly overwhelming amount of construction if planners and
developers concentrate on refurbishing older facilities rather than
carving new projects out of undeveloped land.
</P>
<P>
   ``As older properties get to a certain point, they are either
changing their uses or they will be torn down and new buildings
built for higher and better uses,'' said Michael Ross, a senior
vice president and managing director of the company's investment
division. ``And major investors always look at old aerospace
plants. A lot of those plants are starting to be used for different
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said Seeley's forecast of construction growth might be
conservative, considering that it projects an annual rate of just
under 2 percent. Gibson's department is predicting that jobs will
grow slightly faster in the decade between 2000 and 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The service industry is expected to lead the job gains.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment industry jobs will grow at a still rapid 3.2
percent annually, Seeley reports, which is still much less than the
recent 8 percent annual growth.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of the office expansion over the next decade
will be in Los Angeles and Orange counties, with most of Los
Angeles' growth expected on the city's Westside.
</P>
<P>
   But the San Fernando Valley will get its share, too, Seeley
said. There is about 1 million square feet of space now under
construction in the tri-cities area of Burbank, Glendale and
Pasadena, and that should swell to 10 million square feet over the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Valley's commercial space will expand by about
half that rate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, manufacturing jobs will continue to decline slightly,
a trend that dates back to the 1950s, when the local aerospace
industry first started its retraction. Output, however, will
increase because of better worker productivity.

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ No matter how tortured or how beholden it was to
those blasted computers, the Bowl Championship Series did its job.
No. 1 Tennessee will play No. 2 Florida State for the national
championship here on Monday night in the Fiesta Bowl. The other
seven bowl games over the New Year's weekend are simply warm-up
acts, except for one, the Dissent Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if you like, the Sugar Bowl. That's a matchup that dares to
defy the computer age, and can undo the BCS' best-laid plans to
crown an undisputed national champion. It goes like this: If Ohio
State (10-1) rolls over Texas A&AMP;M (11-2) and Florida State squeaks
by Tennessee in an ugly game, then the Associated Press poll could
presumably crown the Buckeyes No. 1 as the best one-loss team. The
coaches poll, however, has promised its national title to the
winner of the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it is a remote possibility, but Ohio State Coach John
Cooper likes the idea enough to keep it floating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ranked third in the country, got a chance to finish
second, maybe first,'' Cooper said. ``It all depends on how well we
play and what happens to Tennessee and Florida State. I think it's
a long shot. We would have to have an exceptional ball game, and
Florida State would have to win a sloppy game.''
</P>
<P>
   The last team that looked beyond the Aggies, however, had its
season ruined. In the Big 12 championship game, Kansas State was
leading by 15 points and was packing its bags for the Fiesta Bowl
when Texas A&AMP;M came back to win, 36-33, in double overtime. Neither
the Aggies' coach, R. C. Slocum, nor his players have said much
about Cooper's campaign to win a split poll. But they do resent the
implication that a team with the 10th-ranked defense led by the
Butkus award winner Dat Nguyen is not worthy of a BCS bowl and its
$11 million payday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat some pretty good teams to get here,'' Slocum said.
``We think we deserve to be here, and now we want to show what we
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The two other BCS bowls _ the Orange and the Rose _ also award
their participants the big-money payout, but will have to settle
for offering fans entertainment value this year while waiting their
turn for the championship game to rotate their way. In the Orange,
the Florida Gators (9-2) will be without their defensive
coordinator, Bob Stoops, who recently took the head coaching job at
Oklahoma, as well as defensive end Tim Beauchamp and cornerback
Dock Pollard. Both were suspended this week for violating team
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Spurrier concedes those are not the ideal conditions
for containing the high-scoring Syracuse Orangemen (8-3) and
quarterback Donovan McNabb, who takes 8,389 passing yards, another
1,561 on the ground and 96 touchdowns into his final game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donovan can avoid people,'' Spurrier said. ``He's a tremendous
passer, too. So it's going to be a big challenge to keep him in the
pocket and try to cover some guys and slow down their offense.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Rose Bowl, it is Cade McNown of UCLA (10-1) and an
offense that averaged 40.5 points and 482 yards a game against a
Wisconsin defense that allowed only 10 points and 270 yards a game.
The Badgers (10-1) have also been maligned for playing a soft
schedule that did not include Ohio State or Michigan, but posted
two shutouts and gave up 7 points or fewer in six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to come out and pull any magic tricks or
bunnies out of the hat,'' said Badger end Tom Burke, who leads the
nation in sacks with 21. ``We are just going to come out and play
fundamentally strong, as we have all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The best of the rest of the opening acts are Notre Dame (9-2)
against Georgia Tech (9-2) in the Gator Bowl, and Penn State (8-3)
and Kentucky (7-4) in the Outback Bowl. Irish quarterback Jarious
Jackson says he is fully recovered from a knee injury that kept him
out of Notre Dame's final game against Southern California and five
weeks of workouts. ``I'll do whatever they call; whatever they
call, I'm going to run,'' he said, though it was unclear if he
would start or how much he would play. ``I'm just looking forward
to playing the game. If I get hit, I get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Nittany Lions, along with the rest of college football,
will see the Heisman finalist Tim Couch for perhaps the final time.
</P>
<P>
   The junior will probably declare for the National Football
League draft and may be its No. 1 choice _ the expansion Cleveland
Browns hold it and are interested in the record-breaking passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think everyone's excited about us,'' Couch said of the
large Kentucky contingent that has descended on the Tampa-St.
Petersburg, Fla., area. ``Usually everyone's wrapped up in
basketball in Kentucky this time of year .'' &QL;

ISLANDERS' OFFENSE ENDS THE YEAR QUIETLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When the Islanders wake up on Friday, it will be a new
year. Too bad they will not wake up to a new season.
</P>
<P>
   They embarked on a three-game trip with high expectations,
having gone 3-1-2 in their previous six games.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents _ Florida, Tampa Bay and Chicago _ were considered
weak, Islanders Coach Mike Milbury said. There was even talk of
climbing back into the playoff chase.
</P>
<P>
   That was five days ago. The Islanders (13-22-2) lost to the
Chicago Blackhawks by 1-0 Thursday night at the United Center. They
have hit rock bottom, done in by a persistent problem: they can't
score.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, who are 1-12-3 in their last 16 games against
Chicago, were shut out for the second straight game, Thursday by
Jocelyn Thibault, extending their scoreless streak to 153 minutes
44 seconds. They lost 3-0 to Tampa Bay on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thibault was spectacular when he needed to be, making 28 saves;
Marcel Cousineau, the Islanders' goalie, was also splendid in
making 20 stops. Thibault's most important save came against six
Islanders skaters in the final minute. He thwarted Robert Reichel
from close range.
</P>
<P>
   With the starter Tommy Salo (broken finger) sidelined and the
backup Wade Flaherty ineffective, Cousineau started his second
straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Cousineau, who was making his 10th start in the National Hockey
League, has played well enough the last two games to perhaps
replace Flaherty as the backup once Salo returns next week.
</P>
<P>
   Cousineau's best save came late in the second period when he
made a sprawling stop of Tony Amonte's rebound shot.
</P>
<P>
   But the Blackhawks finally cracked Cousineau late in the second
when Bob Probert scored from a tight angle, deflecting the puck off
Cousineau, who was scrambling to back into position. Probert's goal
gave the Blackhawks' a 1-0 lead at 17:20.
</P>
<P>
   Thibault matched the Islanders' goalie save for save. He made
several superb stops to deny the Islanders. The best came in the
first period when he slammed the door on Zigmund Palffy's one-timer
from close range.
</P>
<P>
   After getting a goal and two assists in his first two games
back, Palffy has gone pointless in three games since. Playing with
Bryan Smolinski and Claude Lapointe, he was not a factor again
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The injury-plagued Islanders got a scare in the first period
when their captain, Trevor Linden, limped off the ice after Nelson
Emerson's slap shot hit his knee. Linden was in obvious pain, but
was able to return minutes later. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman RICH PILON left the game after the first period with
a back strain. He will be re-evaluated on Friday in New York. &QL;

STREAKING STARS OVERPOWER BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ And what a test it was.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins knew they had their work cut out coming to Dallas to
take on the league-leading and streaking Stars and finish off a
1998-ending road trip. How right they were.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins stayed with the Stars for most of two periods. But
that was it, as Boston absorbed a 6-1 loss at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Sergei Zubov made it 3-1 late in the second period
and Dallas took charge in the third, as Pat Verbeek put his second
goal past Bruin goalie Robbie Tallas for 4-1 at 4:11. The rout was
on.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas took less than two minutes to answer a tying goal by Ray
Bourque early in the second period. And when it was over, the Stars
had scored five straight goals, at one point scoring on four of
five shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a well disciplined, well-oiled team,'' said Bruins
coach Pat Burns. ``They're the best team in the league right now.
With the elements we had on our club tonight, it was tough. The
kids tried but they panic after a while and the puck keeps whizzing
by and whizzing by.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars ran their unbeaten streak to 13 _ 10-0-3 _ to set a
franchise record. They have not lost since Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who had ended a three-game skid and salvaged a
couple of points on this four-game trip with a victory Wednesday
night in Nashville, try to regroup Saturday against the Mighty
Ducks of Anaheim at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   The second Verbeek goal was set up by old friend Dave Reid.
Grant Marshall soon made it 5-1. To add insult to loss, defense-man
Craig Ludwig then scored his first goal of the year _ in fact, his
first goal since Dec. 20, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a team of spurts,'' Tallas said. ``They don't just put
the puck at the net. Every time they put it on the net it's a
scoring chance. I didn't come up with the big save tonight. I think
I came up with the average save and when the team needed a big save
I wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Down, 2-1, early in the second period, the Bruins stayed in the
game with a huge penalty-killing effort against the league's best
power play and then made a couple of good bids to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   Don Sweeney was called for holding behind the net _ a call he
didn't appreciate _ and while the Bruins worked on killing that
one, Darren Van Impe was called for tripping in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Dallas a five-on-three for 41 seconds. The Bruins,
with tight defense limiting the Stars to mostly long shots and
Tallas being stingy with the rebounds, denied Dallas through that
spell and the rest of the Van Impe penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bruins couldn't catch a break at the other end.
Anson Carter and then P.J. Axelsson took turns hitting the post
behind Ed Belfour. Soon after his near-miss, Axelsson went flying
in front of the net and Burns wanted _ but couldn't get _ a
tripping call.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with 2:29 left in the period, Brett Hull fed Zubov coming
down the middle for a blast that beat Tallas to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins used a power play that carried over from the first
period to make it 1-1 at 1:11 of the second. Bourque got the goal,
his fourth of the year and first since Nov. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes later, the Stars were back in front when
Mike Keane backed away from the sideboards and beat Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins more than held their own in the first period, but
still came out of it trailing, 1-0. It's not a good idea to put the
Stars on the power play, and they quickly showed why.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov slid across from right point to left, took a pass from
Darryl Sydor, and ripped a shot that Verbeek tipped past Tallas.
The game was barely five minutes old and the Stars had the
all-important first goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty decent first period and then we let it get
away from us,'' Heinze said. ``Any mistake you make, they're going
to put it on your net, and we made a few. Then we got down and we
didn't respond.''

ISRAELI COURT'S CONVERSION RULING DIVIDES L.A.-AREA JEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- After a landmark ruling in Israel, the question
of who is a Jew was the talk of the day at Bea's Bakery, where no
true consensus emerged but opinions were as varied as the pastries
in the glass displays.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, handed down Wednesday by the chief judge of
Jerusalem, ordered the Israeli government to recognize Jewish
conversions performed by non-Orthodox rabbis and drew instant
criticism and praise over the much-debated issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the ruling is fantastic. I think it's wonderful, but
it's sad that it has to come from the court instead of the Jewish
ecumenical community,'' said suburban Tarzana resident Sandi Herzon
after shopping at the bakery.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we expect the world to get along with us if we can't
get along with each other?'' said Herzon, whose father was an
Orthodox rabbi. Today she is not affiliated with any of the Jewish
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America declined
to comment on the issue Thursday, but other Orthodox leaders
throughout the country have criticized the decision.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Orthodox Jewish politicians also denounced the
decision, vowing to appeal the ruling and introduce a bill next
week in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, that would allow only the
Orthodox rabbinate to perform conversions.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview, Orthodox Rabbi Shmeul Miller said the
ruling is inconsequential because the real problem is that church
and state are not separate entities in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of conversion should be a purely religious
issue,'' said Miller, a rabbi at a Mid-Wilshire synagogue near
downtown. ``The aspect of who decides who is Jewish is not an
aspect that should be ruled on by (the) state.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller also criticized the current focus on the conversion
powers of rabbis, saying the convert's commitment should be the
most important factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put emphasis on the rabbis' qualifications is not the
question,'' he said. ``The question is, who converts, and is the
person ready to accept the commandments fully?''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Orenstein, a conservative Jew who applauded the ruling, said
he was not surprised by the Israeli politicians' decision to
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their lawful right to do so, but I feel good about the
fact that the court did approve the ruling,'' said Orenstein, a
suburban Woodland Hills resident. ``But you have to be realistic
that the Supreme Court can overturn the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles,
response to the ruling was mixed, said John Fishel, executive vice
president of the council, an umbrella organization representing 250
associated bodies covering a wide spectrum of ideologies and
philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very complex situation, but I think for the most part,
most Jewish people here in Los Angeles who are concerned about
Israel . . . want to see this matter resolved so their association
and pride in Israel can continue unhindered,'' Fishel said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Marvin Labinger, executive director of the United
Synagogue of Conservative Judaism in Los Angeles, praised Jerusalem
Judge Vardi Zeiler for having the ``guts and courage to validate''
the non-Orthodox conversions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled to death, but we're also very, very cautious,
because the reaction has already set,'' said Labinger, a member of
the Board of Rabbis of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Many fear that a permanent split between Israeli and American
Jews will occur if Orthodox politicians succeed in legislating a
monopoly over conversions for the Orthodox rabbinate, Labinger
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With what the police described as the biggest but
most orderly crowd in years herded neatly into barricaded
quadrangles, New Year's Eve descended on Times Square on Thursday
night in a carefully controlled explosion of festivity that felt
like both a gala and a warm-up.
</P>
<P>
   An expected crowd of half a million, held in check by more than
5,000 police officers, gathered in midtown to watch the big
aluminum ball make its final trip down the big aluminum pole. The
ball will be replaced by a fancier crystal creation at next year's
millennial extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   There were, as there have been every Dec. 31 for decades, the
crowds of tourists seemingly inured against the cold by the dazzle
and the glitter, and the local folks drawn by the spectacle or
unable to afford the high cover charges of the nightclubs. But
there were also many merely caught in the chaos, struggling to get
to restaurants and theaters as police officers checked ticket stubs
and reservation letters, looking liked armed ushers and maitres
d'hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to crawl under a couple of barricades,'' said Irv
Birnbaum, 47, a medical technician from Baltimore who had come to
see the musical ``Chicago'' at the Shubert Theater on 44th Street.
``We got dirty. My wife is recovering from knee surgery; we knew it
would be bad. But the police were polite. We knew it would be
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was bad for theatergoers, but it was easier for the
average reveler to see and hear what was going on this year than in
recent years, it was only because of the new video screens and
speakers installed as far as eight blocks away from the puppet
shows and fireworks at the heart of the action. They watched as at
11:59 p.m., Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, in his usual spot at the
controls of the celebration, and Sang Lan, the Chinese gymnast
paralyzed in the Goodwill Games last summer, sat on a stage at 45th
Street and Broadway and pushed a button. Sixty seconds later, amid
a blinding flash of pyrotechnics, the ball atop 1 Times Square
completed its slow descent into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Some people said they had come this year because they did not
stand a chance of getting a front-row seat for New Year's Eve 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year it's going to be really insane, so we thought we'd
come this year,'' said Joshua Fifer, 18, an Americorps volunteer
who made the trip from Washington with his girlfriend and staked
out a spot on Broadway at 44th Street at 3 p.m. ``Next year, it's
going to be a tough choice. We're worried about the terrorism. But
I'll probably be stupid enough to come.''
</P>
<P>
   If Thursday night was any indication, insanity will indeed be
the order of the night at the dawn of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the crowds Thursday evening, the police shut down
more than 40 square blocks to car traffic _ from 38th Street north
to Central Park at 59th Street, and from Eighth Avenue east to the
Avenue of the Americas. Blocks were closed to pedestrian traffic as
they filled up, 10,000 people at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Access to subways along the way was limited, if not cut off.
Commuters were able to get into the Port Authority Bus Terminal,
Pennsylvania Station and Grand Central Terminal _ if they could
fight their way through the sea of bodies and confetti.
</P>
<P>
   At all of the access points into the party area, plainclothes
and uniformed police officers searched revelers for alcohol,
confiscated bottles in brown paper bags and wrote dozens of
citations. By 11:45 p.m., however, there had been only three
arrests, two for disorderly conduct and one for urinating in
public.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not to say that there were not more than a couple of
instances of disorderly conduct. With alcohol banned outdoors, bars
in the Times Square area were packed with people intent on taking
part in the ritual of the New Year's Day hangover.
</P>
<P>
   As white-bearded Father Time paraded down the street, followed
by dancers holding the moon and stars, a 19-year-old U.S. Army
infantryman marked the passing of another year by vomiting
discreetly against a corner of the Viacom Building at 45th Street
and Broadway. He explained that he was flying off to Bosnia (by way
of Oklahoma) in the morning and wanted to go out with a bang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaving tomorrow, and I don't know when I'm coming back,''
he said, ``so I might as well do this once.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Others were not in quite as celebratory a mood.
</P>
<P>
   By 9:20 p.m., Raymond Batiste, 44, a paralegal from the Bronx,
was yelling into his cell phone to his fiancee that he had had
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely extremely disappointed,'' Batiste shouted over
the crowd at 47th Street and Eighth Avenue. ``It's a ludicrous
letdown. We're going back home and celebrate with Dick Clark on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Batiste's brother Rod, who had brought his 13-year-old son,
Kalel, up from Washington to watch the proceedings, was doubly
sore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They force you to go every way that you don't want to,'' Rod
Batiste said, ``and now we're lost and confused. How do I get back
to the subway?''
</P>
<P>
   And for those unable to get to the center of the action _
probably a vast majority this year _ the show of police force was
as impressive as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get through because of the barriers, but I'm very
impressed with the police,'' said Gaudin Wilfrid, a school bus
driver in his 20s from Nantes, France, on vacation with his
girlfriend. ``I've only seen this many at a student strike in
Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people in Times Square had actually been drawn there by the
promise of a display of state-of-the-art crowd control, like Damien
Villa, a 15-year-old who said he plans to go into law enforcement
and drove with his father from Gaffney, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife said: `He's only 15; do you want to take him out in an
environment like that?''' the boy's father, Jerry Villa, said. ``I
said: `Look, he's had two years of karate, he's interested in
criminal law, maybe in becoming a police officer and then a lawyer.
This would be a good place to see how they do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As Damien was asking one officer how he kept his cool in the
midst of chaos, the officer demonstrated by politely defusing a
woman who likened the police to Nazis. ``His response was great,''
Damien said. ``He said, `Thank you, I appreciate it, happy New
Year.' And she went off even more, but he didn't lose it for a
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   When disorder broke out, it was quickly quelled. About 7:30
p.m., two vendors illegally selling party favors and plastic hats
had a confrontation at 45th Street and Eighth Avenue. Three seconds
after shouts of ``Yo! yo! yo!'' flew back and forth, four helmeted
police officers at the barricades nearby converged and broke things
up. Most people who were inconvenienced took the gantlet in stride
_ though striding was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Others had not expected it to be quite so jammed.
</P>
<P>
   Maryanne and George Klein and their daughter Alexis, former New
Yorkers transplanted to Greenville, N.C., had tickets to ``Phantom
of the Opera,'' and they had to pick them up at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked our way across 44th Street, but at each block we had
to explain where we were going,'' said an exasperated Mrs. Klein.
``We were frustrated. We just didn't expect this to be that much of
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though they were already in the neighborhood, they said
they had no plans to stick around after the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had enough Times Square already,'' she said. ``This is a
once-in-a-lifetime experience and we're not going to do it next
year.''

1998 WAS YEAR BEST FORGOTTEN FOR SEATTLE SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am thinking of a moment in sports, one that defines 1998, for
you, for me.
</P>
<P>
   And I don't know if I should apologize, but this moment is not
one of grandeur. It is no historic highlight.
</P>
<P>
   It is not John Elway flashing that toothy grin and shaking that
trophy in San Diego on Jan. 25, when Elway won his first Super Bowl
and where he made sentimentalists of all NFL fans, even
Bronco-haters.
</P>
<P>
   It is not Michael Jordan stealing the ball from Karl Malone and
swishing the winning shot in Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals _
sealing Sir Air's greatness with that 45-point exclamation and
perhaps giving us his last tongue-wagging look.
</P>
<P>
   It is not even Mark McGwire, whose biggest muscle was his heart
in a summer of '98 when Big Mac ignited with a homer derby along
with a willing, humble and gracious co-star, Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, memories of '98 begin with Glenallen Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, good ol' Glenallen _ the 7,999th Mariner left fielder since
Ken Griffey Jr. took over in center.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Glenallen was only the 53rd left fielder to play next to
Griffey, but what good is a reflection on the past year in sports
without a smattering of hyperbole?
</P>
<P>
   It does not detract from the fact that Glenallen Hill is the
symbolic person who demonstrated, in the promising baseball days of
March, that the Mariners' hopes in '98 were already dead.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it is sometimes in sports. The little things; the
offbeat, wacky moments; the back room, locker room, press room,
training camp incidents are often just as significant, just as
meaningful as those glorious, historic, cover-of-Sports Illustrated
moments.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, I would have to say that Glenallen, the surfer dude
from Santa Cruz, tried to warn us about a certain air of futility
'98, for the M's and for our other local rooting interests, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics almost lost to the Timberwolves in the first round of
the NBA playoffs, then lost their coach. The Huskies limped through
a disappointing 6-6 season, then lost their coach. The Seahawks ...
yeesh, '98 was a killer, wasn't it?
</P>
<P>
   But the weird start of it all was good ol' Glenallen Hill, who
accomplished the most presageful feat of '98 at Mariner spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   It came the moment Hill attempted to run down a fly ball, but
instead of catching it, twisted, stumbled and fell flat on his
butt.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, I think, finally picked up the ball as it rolled to the
wall. And later, after the disheartening Cactus League game,
skipper Lou Piniella tried to spin it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenallen wasn't brought here for his glove.''
</P>
<P>
   And Randy Johnson wasn't brought here for his good looks. But
the point is, bad stuff happens to teams that fail to patch major
potholes.
</P>
<P>
   Wacky M's, huh? Wacky Lou, too. And what a wacky year, at least
all the places this columnist visited in my sporting travels. More
on the Mariners later, as we take a look at the places and faces
that made 1998 a rollercoaster of results and emotion, and made us
eager to see 1999 get rolling.
</P>
<P>
   THE YEAR IN REAR VIEW
</P>
<P>
   University of Washington campus, Jan. 7: Red-alert news
conference is called by Brock Huard. After a great season and a
high-flying win at the Aloha Bowl, the Husky quarterback says he
will not enter the NFL draft. It is a terrific moment: A young man
with millions guaranteed to him deciding he wants to be a college
kid for another year.
</P>
<P>
   Nagano, Japan, Feb. 5: Innovative chefs in this industrial city
happily supply foreign journalists with braised bees and blowfish.
What a welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Nagano, Feb. 6: Skater Tara Lipinksi makes her entrance during
the Olympic Opening Ceremonies, hacking around with a quarter-ton
sumo wrestler named Akebono. She is enjoying her Olympic
experience, e-mailing friends, wandering around the Olympic
Village. She has the look of a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Nagano, Feb. 9: The mysterious Michelle Kwan makes her grand
entrance, late, to the Winter Games, causing a stir the way Greto
Garbo would. Kwan is rarely seen, except during practice sessions,
and the pressure builds.
</P>
<P>
   Hakuba, a mountain town outside of Nagano, Feb. 10: It is
finally sunny in the Japanese Alps. An American original named
Picabo Street boldly careens down the Super-G course and sets a
blistering pace. Her time holds. Picabo takes the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Canadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati is stripped of
his gold medal, temporarily, for testing positive for marijuana.
The Canadian says it was second-hand smoke from a party back home
in Whistler, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Nagano, Feb. 20: Lipinksi is exuberant, thrilling. The
15-year-old American wins the gold medal in figure skating, while
the silver medal is won by reigning U.S. National champion Kwan,
whose decision to remain in seclusion during the Olympics takes the
emotion from her performance.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks training facility, March 4: Just what the Seahawks
ordered. A dynamic runner, and motor-mouth talker, makes his
pumped-up debut. Ricky Watters says he is excited about playing for
the Hawks. You can't help but believe him.
</P>
<P>
   Hec Edmundson Pavilion, March 8: Lots of hooting and hollering
as CBS televises live the NCAA Tournament draw. The Washington
Huskies get a No. 11 seed in the East. Bob Bender's crew gets a
ticket to the big show ... and nearly cashes it in.
</P>
<P>
   Kingdome, March 31: Johnson gets the start in the Mariner opener
and leaves with a 9-6 lead against Cleveland. But, alas, the
bullpen woes begin on cue. M's lose 10-9 in a shocker that silences
the Kingdome crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Portland, Ore., April 19: Sonics beat Trail Blazers in season
finale, clinching Pacific Division crown with 61-21 record. The
post-game locker room finds Vin Baker and the gang thrilled to
finally get to the postseason. But will George Karl's future depend
on how these Sonics fare in the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   Kingdome, April 28: M's fire Nardi Contreras and bring in
pitching coach Stan Williams, hoping to shake up a bullpen that
could star in ``Backdraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jay Buhner's injured knee will require surgery.
Something says the heart and soul of the Mariners will be sorely
missed through the heat of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics practice facility, May 26: Much to the chagrin of the
Seattle sporting press, Karl, the Sonics' ``Incredible Leaking
Man,'' is fired by team president Wally Walker. Karl never did fit
in with the buttoned-down Walker and that was his charm.
</P>
<P>
   Camden Yards, Baltimore, June 1-2: The Mariners are just about
imploding. Johnson has all but wrecked team chemistry. David Segui
can barely wait to throttle the Unit. Joey Cora looks like he might
cry, but what else is new? And Sweet Lou is ready to kill.
</P>
<P>
   After a Johnson trade to the Dodgers is killed by Mariner
owners, and after the M's blew another game to the Orioles,
Piniella is found in the visiting manager's office. Cigarette smoke
is billowing from Piniella's lungs, nose and ears.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter dares ask Piniella if he was eager to trade
Johnson, Piniella's response makes the softshell crabs in the
Chesapeake Bay scurry for cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious things aren't working around here!'' Piniella
screams loud enough for all of Baltimore to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Paris, June 14: The U.S. World Cup soccer team is soon to flame
out, but that doesn't stop two American tourists from trying to
score tickets for the upcoming United States match against Germany.
Inflation is wicked, though. Scalpers want as much as $1,200 for a
pair of World Cup tickets. Instead, World Cup matches are watched
in Parisian cafes.
</P>
<P>
   Coors Field, Denver, July 6: The word is Hill has been cut by
the Mariners. ``We had to start shoring things up,'' the M's say, a
little late.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire are loving their home
run-king status, Griffey is causing a stir, refusing to participate
in the All-Star Game Home Run Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Junior does the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to be booed. This is not a time to be booed,''
Griffey says, then goes out and wins the darned thing.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, July 20: Warren Moon is a no-show at Seahawks training
camp. The veteran quarterback wants a new deal but the Hawks are
capped out and can't pay what Moon wants. Moon risks smudging his
image for this holdout that backfires.
</P>
<P>
   Kingdome, July 31: Baseball's trading deadline fast approaches.
As the clock ticks closer to 9 p.m., everyone wonders if New York
Yankee starter Hideki Irabu is going to walk across the field into
the Mariner clubhouse, while Johnson goes to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   That deal doesn't go down. Instead, there is shock, and
disappointment. Johnson is traded to the Astros for three minor
leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Three Rivers Stadium, Pittsburgh, Aug. 2: Johnson makes his
debut with the Astros. A cross-country flight lands me in
Pittsburgh just as Johnson is trying on his new uniform. Johnson
jokes that it has not been since Little League that his uniform was
so short.
</P>
<P>
   His good humor carries onto the field. Johnson beats the Pirates
in his return to the National League and his relief is obvious _ on
many fronts. Gushing like Snoqualmie Falls, Johnson raves about
Seattle. His attitude is a complete reversal of the sulking man who
found no motivation to pitch his best during his final games in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone felt sorry for Johnson during his tormented days final
days in Seattle, that sorrow started to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Stadium, Philadelphia, Sept. 5: Seahawks rout Eagles,
but the sporting public's attention is all on Sosa and McGwire.
Baseball's most momentous season is just heating up, drowning out
the start of the NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   Flushing, N.Y., Sept. 13: Patrick Rafter is a cat-quick
Australian who shows his serve-and-volley mastery in a second
straight U.S. Open tennis championship. But again, baseball is all
the world wants to hear about. On this day, Sosa ties McGwire with
62 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Kingdome, Sept. 22: Thankfully for Mariner fans, Griffey and
Alex Rodriguez still call the Pacific Northwest their baseball
home. As the M's swoon, the two superstars maintain and play out
the season with pride _ the only two M's to play all 161 games.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Griffey tags Oakland for two homers (Nos. 54 and
55 on the way to season total of 56) and Rodriguez hits No. 41, on
his way to 42 to become only the third player in history to hit 40
homers and steal 40 bases in a single season. Fireworks go off. For
one moment, it seems good to celebrate these two great players.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield, Mass., Oct. 2: The NBA lockout drags on. Players
and owners squabble over $2 billion in revenues. A major stumbling
block in the negotiations is the ``Larry Bird exemption,'' which
allows teams to pay their own free agents whatever it takes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former Celtic great Larry Bird is inducted into the
Hall of Fame. It's just in time to remind the world that few NBA
stars are worthy of Bird's (or Jordan's or Magic Johnson's)
exceptional status.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Stadium, Oct. 16: The great hitter Tony Gwynn leads his
Padres into the Bronx for a World Series date against the Yankees.
Gwynn shows his class by sharing his impressions of the hallowed
House That Ruth Built and giggles over the looney history in San
Diego. Gallantly, Gwynn tries to pretend the Padres have a chance
against this unbelievable '98 Yankee team.
</P>
<P>
   Hec Edmundson Pavilion, Nov. 17: For the first time since 1984,
the Husky men's basketball team is nationally ranked. Bender's crew
gets the nod at No. 14, up there with Kansas and North Carolina and
Duke ... for awhile anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer Arena, Dec. 22: Shock, sadness, a serious sense of loss _
the pioneer American Basketball League folds. The Seattle Reign is
out of business, despite a loyal fan base in this women's
basketball hotbed. The only hope is that the WNBA expands here, if
that is any consolation to the many women and men who worked so
hard to establish a grass-roots professional women's basketball
league.
</P>
<P>
   Living rooms in Seattle, Dec. 25: The Huskies are embarrassed by
Air Force in the Oahu Bowl. If this is holiday entertainment, no
one around finds much pleasure in the Huskies' scary performance.
</P>
<P>
   Mile High Stadium, Denver, Dec. 27: The Broncos look Super
Bowl-bound again. John Elway slings and Terrell Davis romps and the
Seahawks are trounced. The handwriting is on the wall for coach
Dennis Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks Training Facility, Dec. 28: Seahawk President Bob
Whitsitt holds a news conference to announce the firing of Dennis
Erickson. In a class move, Erickson talks to the media, says he
respects the team's right to make a change and promises he can
leave with his head held high.
</P>
<P>
   Don James Center, Dec. 30: After a month of rotten news, after a
year of rotten sporting events, the final shoe drops. Jim Lambright
is fired, ending a 35-year relationship with Husky football. The
pyrotechnics don't end there. Lambright accuses athletic director
Barbara Hedges of bowing down to angry boosters. Hedges says no
way.
</P>
<P>
   EPITAPH FOR 1998
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Joe DiMaggio: On Dec. 7, doctors in a Florida
hospital reported the Yankee Clipper to be in a deep coma, near
death. For three months, the effects of lung cancer had taken their
toll on the octogenarian who once roamed center field at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a miracle. Or the sheer will of a tenacious fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment was altered, DiMaggio pulled out of his coma and he
then squeezed the hand of his doctor. The next day, the intensely
private DiMaggio commanded his doctor to stop giving the media
updates about his condition.
</P>
<P>
   Joe D. was back to live some more. Amen.

TOLEDO'S PINKEL ON UW'S SHORT LIST FOR COACHING VACANCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Chipping away at her to-do list a day after she
announced the firing of football coach Jim Lambright, University of
Washington athletic director Barbara Hedges took care of an obvious
one.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Hedges called University of Toledo athletic
director Pete Liske, himself a former UW administrator, and asked
for permission to talk to Gary Pinkel about the vacant Husky job.
</P>
<P>
   Hedges spent much of the day interviewing UW assistant coaches,
whose contracts expire June 30. With the holiday weekend, she is
believed to be making some preliminary calls before pursuing the
search in earnest Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkel, 46, has led the Rockets to a 57-31-3 record the past
eight years. Before that, he was a player for former Husky coach
Don James at Kent State, and coached on James' UW staffs for 12
years, the final seven as offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming Hedges' call, Liske left little doubt that Pinkel
would come to Washington quickly if offered the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think that would be one of his dream jobs,'' said
Liske, who said Hedges did not indicate when she would talk to
Pinkel or how quickly she hoped to have a coach named.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkel has not been returning telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Atlanta Falcons assistant Rich Brooks, the former
Oregon head coach, indicated interest in the job but said he has
not talked with any UW officials.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, the Falcons' defensive coordinator in a stunning 14-2
season, has acted as interim head coach through much of December in
place of Dan Reeves, who underwent open-heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, 57, coached at Oregon for 18 years, culminating in a
1994 Rose Bowl season. He headed the St. Louis Rams for two years
before being fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made it clear I'd be interested in a college job if it
were the right situation,'' Brooks said. ``I wouldn't want to go
back and take over a program like Oregon was when I took it over
(1977).''
</P>
<P>
   Washington would likely meet those terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably need to move relatively fast,'' Brooks said,
``so I guess (his involvement) is just a rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   One coach mentioned frequently who doesn't appear to be in the
picture is Virginia Tech's Frank Beamer, 52. Beamer's coaching
roots are in the South, and after he talked with both Clemson and
South Carolina earlier about openings, Virginia Tech, his alma
mater, re-worked his annuity, stipulating that he cannot interview
for another job while at Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Another coach drawing mention, Mike Riley of Oregon State, might
also find it hard to leave his job. With strong Corvallis ties,
Riley might find it difficult to turn his back on those who gave
him his first college head coaching position, and his contract
calls for a $300,000 housing allowance that must be reimbursed if
he leaves before another three years at OSU.
</P>
<P>
   Hedges has said she will have an advisory group interview
candidates she might choose as finalists. James is helping her
compile a working list.
</P>
<P>
   Without setting a timetable, Hedges says she wants to name a
coach as soon as possible to facilitate a quick transition for
interested recruits.
</P>
<P>
   The most high-profile player already committed to Washington,
USA Today second-team All-America kicker John Anderson of Boca
Raton, Fla., said the future of Husky special-teams coach Rick
Mallory would be pivotal in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he stays on the staff, I'm definitely going there,'' said
Anderson. ``If he doesn't stay, I'm going to consider my other
options.''
</P>
<P>
   Another committed recruit, Cody Pickett, illustrated what the UW
program is up against as it tries to stanch damage before the
February date on which binding national letters of intent are
signed. Pickett, a quarterback from Caldwell, Idaho, said Arizona
State, one of his finalists, had already called him after the news
of Lambright's firing, seeking a campus visit.
</P>
<P>
   But Pickett _ whose finalists were Washington, Oregon, ASU and
Purdue _ said he would take no other visits until a UW staff is in
place, and then make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, everything's the same,'' Pickett said. ``I'm just
going to sit back and see what happens.''

NEW YEAR BRINGS NEW BATCH OF RESOLUTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHARLINE CHIANG, ENRIQUE RIVERO, RICK ORLOV and KEITH MARDER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Promises, promises.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like most of us, you'll wake up today and start the
new year by ticking off a list of resolutions -- all holding great
hope for 1999, all made with the sincerest desire to change for the
better.
</P>
<P>
   Take 19-year-old Marcus Medina of suburban Mission Hills, who
with his fiancee, Perla Ramirez, 18, of nearby Pacoima, is
expecting a baby this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be a dad, so I want to better myself spiritually
because of my baby,'' said Medina, a process specialist. ``I'm
going to go to church more.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Fields, 47, president and chief executive officer of Fields
Aircraft Spares Inc. in suburban Simi Valley, said he has a simple
goal for self-improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``To lose some weight -- that really is my New Year's
resolution, to exercise more and lose some weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was the same as last year, he conceded. ``But I
didn't keep it last year,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Right. Who actually keeps resolutions?
</P>
<P>
   Not Aurora Liberato of suburban Granada Hills, who over her 80
years has learned the futility of resolving to undertake great
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never do,'' she said, ``because I don't even go through with
it. So why bother?''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Haglund, the actor who plays Langley, one of the Lone
Gunmen on the Fox TV series ``The X-Files,'' apparently knows the
pitfalls of grandiose resolutions, so his this year is ``to get
over this cold. I like to keep my goals really low so that I can
achieve them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The experts say it is natural to go back on resolutions, but
that shouldn't discourage you from at least trying to improve
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely think it's a healthy thing to do,'' said Drew
Yellen, a clinical and sports psychologist in suburban Northridge
who counsels patients on self-motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing else, it brings these things having to do with
improving ourselves to a conscious level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the start of the last year of the decade and
millennium is provoking people to think harder than usual about how
they want to live out the remaining days of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it does is it forces you to put yourself in the context
of all of humanity,'' Yellen said. ``If you step back and think
1,000 years have gone by, there is a degree of humility.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most popular resolutions year in and year out are to
lose weight, quit smoking and spend less money. Some folks are much
more practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to get a job, for one. I've been unemployed for two
years. And try to get married,'' said John McKeon, 55, of suburban
Northridge, a hospital food server.
</P>
<P>
   For Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, the new year is a new
chance to make the city better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reform, reform, reform,'' Riordan said. ``The last year of the
1900s will be a year of reform for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will spend much of 1999 focused on three issues that will
determine our city's future success -- charter, education and tax
reform. Angelenos must continue to be involved if we are to build
on the greatness we've achieved together.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Board of Education member David Tokofsky said he
will work ``to never allow the board president to have a meeting
past midnight again'' and ``to help curriculum bureaucracy identify
what a book is.''
</P>
<P>
   William Mellick, president and chief executive officer of 20th
Century Insurance, said his professional goal is to sell more
insurance, which may or may not be at odds with his personal goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine is to remember to keep a balance between my work and my
family,'' he said. ``That's not meant to be corny; it's something I
want to put out there as a personal commitment and a personal
resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, as this millennium winds down, many Americans will
continue to grapple with the conflicting demands of job and family.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams, 58, a retired firefighter living in suburban
Canoga Park, would like to go to Ireland with his family, but that
requires financial freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win a lot of money so I can relax, take more
vacations,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Yellen calls this the ``human touch'' phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we're turning the clock back to the '50s, to a time
of `Father Knows Best,' '' Yellen said. ``I call it a human touch;
that includes being kinder, being gentler, doing more things with
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone plans to take it easy, though.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Linda Duarte of suburban Sun Valley plans to heed words
of advice from The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to party more, have fun, meet new people,'' said
Duarte, 18, a student at El Camino High School in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   And there always will be plenty of people like food server Zeke
Ragsdale, 19, of suburban Granada Hills, who is just saying no to
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so pessimistic about everything,'' he said. ``I made a
resolution not to make resolutions.''

   TRAVIATA-OPERA-REVIEW (New York) _ Since Franco Zeffirelli's
elephantine new staging of ``La Traviata'' opened at the
Metropolitan Opera at the end of November, new singers have taken
over all the principal roles. Normally, the assumption is that the
original singers have moved on to other projects, but in this case
it seems likely that some of them were simply lost in the scenery
and may not be heard from again. A singer who wanted to hide out
for a while, in fact, could hardly do better than to get a role in
this staging. By Allan Kozinn. (With photo)
</P>
<P>
   PERMANENT-COLLECTIONS (New York) _ Even at this time of year,

outstanding works of art and related visual phenomena, places
slightly or way off the beaten path _ be they the less popular
galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the Brooklyn Museum
of Art, the city's only indoor Earthwork (Walter De Maria's ``New

ARIZONA GROWERS PROFIT FROM FREEZE IN CALIF. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANE LARSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Citrus prices have been riding a roller coaster since
Christmas, thanks to a freeze that hit central California's lemon
and orange crops, and Arizona growers and packers say the wild ride
is not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   But if California's freeze turns out to be as severe as one
eight years ago, they say, Arizona's citrus industry will reap the
benefits of higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Citrus prices jumped Christmas week as news of the freeze spread
and produce buyers panicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just totally crazy last week. People were calling who
we'd never talked to before,'' said Ed Foster, sales representative
for Empire Fruit Co. in Queen Creek. The company grows tangerines,
oranges and tangelos on 1,800 acres in Maricopa and Pinal counties
and ships them nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is emotion, people saying the whole crop is
ruined. Now the feeling is that the damage is not as bad as
initially thought,'' said James Mast, manager of the Mesa Citrus
Growers Association, which harvests and packs more than 5,000 acres
of citrus for the Sunkist label.
</P>
<P>
   This week's holiday slowdown also helped moderate the market,
industry watchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The freeze has increased demand for Arizona products, said Bill
Spencer, president of Associated Citrus Packers Inc. in Yuma, the
state's largest independent citrus grower and packer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect prices to stay at higher levels than we're used
to in the winter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices are up, and they're going to come up more. It will take
a while for the market to adjust,'' said Dave Crist, owner of Crist
Citrus Care, which manages 500 acres of citrus groves in the Yuma
area.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry in the market started when a pre-Christmas freeze hit
California's San Joaquin Valley, ruining an estimated $591 million
in citrus crops. Two days before Christmas, the California
Department of Food and Agriculture estimated that Fresno County had
lost all of its lemon and half of its navel orange crop, and that
Kern County had lost all of its grapefruit and lemon crop and 70
percent of its navel oranges. Tulare County lost 85 percent of its
citrus, the department estimated.
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Pete Wilson declared the area an economic
disaster Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona growers warn, though, that fruit damage can take 10 to
14 days to show up. When new damage estimates come out, they may
show that the damage is not as bad as first thought.
</P>
<P>
   Because the two states grow so many of the same crops, Arizona
growers keep a close eye on what happens in California. For the
most part, Yuma and Maricopa counties, Arizona's main
citrus-growing areas, escaped the freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Some Arizona growers are comparing the situation to California's
Christmas 1990 freeze, which also decimated that state's citrus
crop and sent prices for Arizona's smaller supply soaring. So badly
were California trees and supplies hit that the price blip lasted
into the next year, growers say.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit by this year's freeze were lemons and oranges, and
growers say prices of those fruits are most likely to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Lemons, which are the citrus most susceptible to freezes, are
about halfway through harvest in Arizona. Both Crist and Spencer
predict prices will go up for the remaining part of the crop.
</P>
<P>
   A 38-pound carton of Arizona lemons that averaged $12.05 last
year was going for $7 to $32 a carton Thursday, depending on size
and quality, according to market reports.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for navel oranges, being harvested now, also have risen.
And if the 1990 freeze pattern repeats itself, ``I would be
expecting to sell our Valencias for a lot of money,'' when they are
harvested in February, Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   A carton of oranges, which averaged $6.55 last year, Thursday
was going for $9 to $30.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer and Crist also see prices of tangerines and tangelos
going up. Grapefruit prices are expected to remain stable, because
much of the California crop is grown outside the freeze area and
because Florida is a big grapefruit producer, too.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is the nation's No. 2 producer of lemons, behind
California; the No. 3 producer of oranges and tangerines, behind
Florida and California; and No. 4 behind those states and Texas for
grapefruit production.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona's citrus production is small compared with
California's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not way we can fill the gap,'' Empire Fruit's Foster
said.
</P>
<P>
   Growers say it's too early to tell whether the California freeze
will have a big or a small effect on Arizona growers' bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer said growers have been battling an oversupply of citrus
on world and national markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when you get into a freeze like this and you've been
pounded season after season, and now you have short-term demand
exceeding supply, it's fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers who can usually name their terms have been having to take
Spencer's offer in recent days. He agreed to ship citrus to a
Boston buyer, for example, if the buyer would also take some
less-popular sizes of fruit off his hands.
</P>
<P>
   If the California damage is bad enough, ``It makes the picture
for the next couple years brighter'' for Arizona growers, Crist
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of damage is not going to come back right away,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   And higher citrus prices would help Arizona agriculture, which
has been struggling with down markets in cotton and wheat, said
Sheldon Jones, director of the Arizona Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   It also could open some international doors. If California can't
meet its export obligations, Arizona growers may be able to get in,
get recognized and receive the higher prices foreign markets pay,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the past week's gyrations are no different than those
of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who know what the reason is'' for rises and falls, Mesa
Citrus' Mast said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the problem of too much of a good thing.
</P>

SINGING PRAISES OF RODGERS &AMP; HART  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, JAN. 3)

<P>
   PHOENIX - Opposites attract.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it explains Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart.
</P>
<P>
   There was Dick. Tall, attractive, with conservative tastes, a
ready confidence and work habits so disciplined that they verged on
the obsessive.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Larry. Barely 5 feet tall, with a face and form
that called to mind one of the guys from ``Snow White,'' an
unreliable alcoholic as self-destructive in his work relationships
as he was in his social life, an insecure genius filled with a
self-loathing he managed to conceal beneath a smart-aleck wit.
</P>
<P>
   Mutt and Jeff, surely, but talent drew them together. Hart was
the greatest lyricist of his day. Rodgers was the only popular
composer of the era to seriously rival George Gershwin as a
musician. Their legacy of song, spanning the years from 1919 to
1943, is one of the great American treasures.
</P>
<P>
   You get all that in the opening segments of ``Rodgers &AMP; Hart
Story: Thou Swell, Thou Witty,'' the latest installment of PBS'
Great Performances, which airs Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And you get plenty more before the show ends. Rodgers and Hart
were yin and yang with a touch of soap opera. Rodgers married
happily, worked productively and when he could take Hart's behavior
no longer, threw up his hands, found a new lyricist in Oscar
Hammerstein II and went on to ``Oklahoma!'' and a second creative
career even more successful than the first.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, a bachelor plagued by ambivalent relationships with women,
drank himself to death.
</P>
<P>
   The man went down rhyming. Late in the television show,
Broadway's Christine Ebersole sings ``To Keep My Love Alive,'' one
of the last songs Rodgers and Hart composed together. It was for
the 1943 revival of ``AConnecticut Yankee,'' and is the
laugh-out-loud saga of a woman who murders her many husbands ``to
keep my love alive.''
</P>
<P>
   It seldom gets better in the world of musical comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by David Thompson, who earlier profiled Busby Berkeley
and Arthur Freed for Great Performances, ``The Rodgers &AMP; Hart
Story'' is a melange of home movies, film clips, still photos and
musical recreations of some of the duo's most famous songs.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, it's on the dull side, with long stretches where the
camera does hardly more than stare at the performers. John
Carrafa's musical staging is a particular disappointment: static to
the point of boring. Only once, during ``You Can't Kick It Around''
from 1940's ``Pal Joey,'' do things get anything like lively.
</P>
<P>
   But the music, performed in period style by Ebersole, Rebecca
Luker, Stanley Mathis, Susan Egan, Brian d'Arcy James, Mary Cleere
Haran, Ron Haines, Debbie Gravitte and Jane Krakowski _ a who's who
of rising stars in musical theater and cabaret _ more than makes up
for the program's cinematic shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   How many times do you get to spend an evening with talented
singers making the most of ``My Funny Valentine''; ``Where or
When''; ``Manhattan''; ``Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered'';
``Mountain Greenery''; ``The Lady Is A Tramp''; ``Falling In Love
With Love ''; and maybe a dozen more?
</P>
<P>
   Among the loveliest moments are those devoted to Rodgers and
Hart tunes that are not as well known but are as contemporary in
mood and meaning as anything sung by Sheryl Crow or Alanis
Morrisette. ``This Funny World,'' written for 1926's ``Betsy,'' is
a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   And has there ever been a more bittersweet lyric than the one
Hart penned for 1938's ``Spring Is Here,'' perfectly matched by
Rodgers' haunting melody:
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Spring is here. Why doesn't my heart go dancing? /
Spring is here. Why isn't the waltz entrancing? / No desire, no
ambition leads me / Maybe it's because nobody needs me . . . /
Spring is here, I hear. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes look at the partnership is equally
fascinating. There are telling comments from Mary Rodgers,
Richard's daughter; Dorothy Hart, Larry's sister-in-law; and Larry
Adler, one of Hart's closest pals. The quotes are unusually honest
for this sort of thing, and lend the proceedings an agreeable bite.
</P>
<P>
   There's also an amusing series of clips from ``Masters of
Melody,'' a 1929 film that featured Rodgers and Hart playing
themselves (with Hart coming across as a morose Marx brother), and
ho me movies that offer glimpses into the Broadway world of the
era.
</P>
<P>
   If for no other reason, the show is worth watching for these.
Other than still photographs, they are our only clues as to what
the actual performances were like of such classic musicals as``
Babes in Arms, Pal Joey'' and ``Jumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think the Broadway tuner has fallen victim to scenic
overkill, you'll be amazed by the clips from 1935's ``Jumbo,''
produced by Billy Rose. Gaudy? It makes ``The Phantom of the
Opera'' look like a community theater production in Paducah. &QL;

THE INS AND OUTS OF 1998 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1999   The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Happy New Year. There are now 364 days to go before the Y2K
computer bug strikes, setting civilization's clock back to the year
1900. The bad news? Global commerce and communication will come to
a screeching halt. The good news? Only 18 more years until the Red
Sox win the World Series!
</P>
<P>
   Was 1998 _ star of the bestseller ``A Year in Full'' _ any less
mind-bending than the looming millennial meltdown? To paraphrase
William Jefferson Clinton, that depends what you mean by ``was.''
We think it ``was'' a year of unrelieved insanity. But then (silly
us) we think oral sex is sex, a cigar is just a cigar, a pretty
girl is like a melody, and Ken Starr is an extraterrestrial.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, based on the DNA stain on 1998's lapel, we are
prepared to state under penalty of perjury that impeachment was in
and censure was out last year, while wagging the dog was in but
wagging your finger at the American public was out.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Monica jokes were in, but dates with Monica were a total
gross-out. Presidential depositions were in, but presidential
kneepads were out. Finally, spiteful interns were out, while
spiritual advisers were in. Which may explain why Clinton _ star of
the bestseller ``A Man in Freefall'' _ is still in office.
</P>
<P>
   What a stupefying 12 months, huh? In came the revamped
Volkswagen Beetle, the redesigned Boston Herald, the Euro currency,
the eBay auction Web site, ESPN magazine, unisex bathrooms, index
funds, Apple's iMac, the Mach3 razor, and a spanking new $20 bill.
Which was fitting, because if 1998 was about anything, it was all
about the benjamins.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Toms, a quick tally: Wolfe in, Jefferson out.
</P>
<P>
   Out too went Welcome Wagons, Beltway blowhards, over-leveraged
hedge funds, fact-fudging columnists, $6 movie tickets, NBA
basketball, theme restaurants, Bill Gates's memory banks, and the
whole whiny ``Seinfeld'' crew, who should have quit while they were
ahead. If 1998 stands trial at the end of the day, let it be for
its overhyped finales and out-of-body-politic experiences.
</P>
<P>
   It was a get-down year for getting jiggy, that much is
indisputable. Flutie Flakes, waitress moms, and electronic books
were all in. Ditto for therapeutic magnets, cosmic magnetars, and
on-line shopping, not to mention buckwheat-hull pillows. Pop a
couple of Viagra, hop on your Money Mill treadmill, and take off
for Hartford _ man, it did not get any in-ner than that. A little
Indian cuisine, some swing dancing afterwards? Babe, you were in
like Jerry Springer in a roomful of brawling in-laws!
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, 1998 might have found you aboard the cruise
ship Ecstasy, putting out flames in the galley. Others who were out
to sea were Universal Pictures executives, designer Isaac Mizrahi,
WAAF DJs Opie and Anthony, talk-show host Magic Johnson, investment
gurus the Beardstown Ladies, miscast thespian Quentin Tarantino,
pseudojournalist Steven Glass, and the head headline writer in
charge at Boston magazine. Mayday! Lower the lifeboats and break
out the oars!
</P>
<P>
   Did it strike anyone else that 1998 seemed to arrive in pairs,
like ark-bound beasts seeking high ground in a storm? Let's see.
There were home-run heroes (Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire) in full
swing. There were literary Wolfe hunters (John Updike and Norman
Mailer) in high dudgeon.
</P>
<P>
   There were epic World War II movies and animated bug movies and
doomsday space-debris movies paired in theaters everywhere. There
were Bush brothers (George and Jeb) and Goldbergs (Lucianne and
that WWF wrestler guy), Olsen twins (Mary-Kate and Ashley), and
House speakers (Newt Gingrich and Bob Livingston) moving in and out
of fashion with dizzying speed. Whew! By year's end, we felt as if
we'd given birth to octuplets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that would be less painful, we suppose, than going out
with 1998 Mom of the Year Mary Kay Letourneau. Who is not to be
confused with ``There's Something About Mary'' cutie Cameron Diaz,
owner of the in hairstyle of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Other notables we have crossed out of our 1998 datebook include
dad-on-the-lam Stephen Fagan, Dr. Jack ``You've Got 60 Minutes
Left'' Kevorkian, human cloner Dr. Richard Seed, ex-Chelsea Clinton
boyfriend Matt Pierce, ex-family values candidate Michael
Huffington, phony war heroes Joe Yandle and Tim Johnson, and the
entire population of Baltimore, the homicide-and-gonorrhea capital
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If the travel itch hits, by the way, Indonesia is out and Nevada
is in.
</P>
<P>
   Did you score high on that pesky MCAS exam last year? You're in,
bro! Join the ranks of other 1998 overachievers: senior
space-shuttler John Glenn, box-office dynamo Adam Sandler, Minn.
governor Jesse ``The Mind'' Ventura, uber-chef Emeril Legasse, smut
mogul Larry Flynt, rap artist Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, the UMass
football team, the Backstreet Boys, Barenaked Ladies,
actress-singer Audra McDonald, chanteuses Lauryn Hill and Lucinda
Williams, author-editor David Remnick, golfers Se Ri Pak and Mark
O'Meara, novelist Ian McEwan, playwright Paula Vogel, and Nantucket
underground resident Thomas Johnson, star of the forthcoming
bestseller ``A Man in Landfill.''
</P>
<P>
   Or did your 1998 test score grade out as unsatisfactory? Then
sign up for our remedial pan-cultural tutorial and say hello to
rookie novelist William Weld, former U.S. News editor James
Fallows, fired Monica Lewinsky attorney William Ginsberg, onetime

Lilies,'' which we're crating up and shipping out as soon as we can
establish proper provenance.

A CURIOUS OUTSIDER CONTEMPLATES THE DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SWEET CHAOS 
The Grateful Dead's American Adventure 
By Carol Brightman 
Clarkson Potter, 356 pp., $27.50 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the many American stories of the past century, the Grateful
Dead remains one of the more epic and enigmatic. Until its demise
as a touring band after the 1995 death of Jerry Garcia, the Dead
led a rare 30-year experiment in communal adventure, mind
expansion, and improvisational rock 'n' roll. It served as Home of
the Last Gasps _ of 1960s idealism, of 1970s bad-drug consumerism,
of timeless cosmic mystery in an MTV-paced world. It kept alive
rituals that reached back to the 1960s acid tests, and it offered
up a few charismatic figures like Garcia and Ken Kesey, antileader
leaders whose influence increased with each step back they took.
And nowadays, with bootleg tapes, official Dead CD releases, and
tours by band members continuing to flood the marketplace, the Dead
flame has continued to burn, if at a second level of intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Countless writers have been stimulated by this intersection of
rock music and religious affectation, pulling out the cultural-crit
lingo in attempts to pinpoint the band's always elusive
significance. The latest ambitious soul to take on the Dead is
Carol Brightman, the author of ``Writing Dangerously: Mary McCarthy
and Her World'' and the sister of Candace Brightman, the Dead's
lighting designer for many years. Brightman is an engaging stylist
who plays the role of a student of American subcultures in ``Sweet
Chaos.'' While she is respectful of her subject, and enthusiastic
about the music, she does not identify herself as a Deadhead, and
she makes a point of distinguishing herself from the band's more
politically reticent devotees. She is a curious outsider with a few
good insider connections.
</P>
<P>
   Brightman is also a savvy reader, and one of the strengths of
``Sweet Chaos'' is her ability to synthesize the previously
published information about the Dead. As she pieces together a
portrait of the phenomenon, she draws not only from her interviews
with Dead family members like Robert Hunter but from books like Tom
Wolfe's ``The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,'' Rock Scully and David
Dalton's ``Livin' with the Dead,'' and Robert Greenfield's ``Dark
Star.'' She spends much of her book recounting what readers of Dead
books already know about the formative years _ the dance halls in
San Francisco, the impact of LSD on the song structures, the
meeting of Garcia and Mountain Girl, whom she quotes at length. And
she jumps ahead to the 1990s intermittently, to deliver the
overtold story of Garcia's drug and performance struggles. But it's
all presented with lots of smart analysis, and Brightman knows how
to put words to some of the more ethereal elements of the Dead
world _ the vibe, the energy, the indescribable acid journey. She
gives an ``I was there'' intimacy to her descriptions, even though
in most cases she wasn't there _ physically or psychically.
</P>
<P>
   The overall goal of the book is less clear than its writing.
``Sweet Chaos'' is a lengthy essay that has a sweetly chaotic gait,
meandering from one aspect of the Dead to another, with no explicit
larger point to make. It rides on what writers have brought to some
of the most exciting essays _ a sense of discovery. But sometimes
the aimlessness is frustrating, and while stock conclusions would
be unwelcome, a sense of order and direction might help. There are
promising ideas wound nicely into the chapters _ the Dead as a
continuation of American movements that precede the 1960s, for
example _ but none of them is teased out, given prominence, made
into a new way to understand the Dead.
</P>
<P>
   Brightman also has a habit of relying too heavily on her own
experience, describing her activism during the 1960s as if ``Sweet
Chaos'' were a memoir. While the Dead and its growing legion of
fans were looking within to explore alternate consciousnesses over
in San Francisco, she notes repeatedly, she was living in a commune
and protesting the system as a Berkeley radical. It's an
interesting contrast that helps to define the Dead, but too often
she leaves the subject of the Dead entirely to tell her own war
stories. She even quotes from her own old journals, and she goes
off on a few distracting tangents, including a recollection of
bohemian life in early 1960s Provincetown that doesn't seem very
instructive. Some of the tangents are provocative, but they read
more like like seeds for other books _ books in which the Dead
might show up, but only as a footnote.

HE WAS ONE CAT I'LL NEVER FORGET  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, JAN. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I have never thought of myself as a sentimental man.
If anything, as a card-carrying journalist, my credentials read:
``cynic.'' And as such, I have had to come to terms with the fact
that one of the most important members of my extended family was my
tabby cat.
</P>
<P>
   I saw him through 15 years of life and his final death. I am
remembering him now because my current cat is getting old and
starting to fail. The two animals were very different, one a giant
bruiser and the other an energetic female. But they have both been
family.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't as though I oozled and wheezed sweet thingie-sweeties
about the beast. No, in fact, it is quite the opposite. But my
broad-faced tom was as good as human in my mind. Perhaps better
than human: He was animal.
</P>
<P>
   He came into my life _ certainly not my possession _ when he was
very young and, as a kitten, he was rather timid, hiding behind the
piano whenever the doorbell rang. But he grew up to become the
neighborhood godfather, the cat to whom others came for favors. He
survived many fights, winning them all, and grew tougher and
brawnier with each.
</P>
<P>
   There was one battle that stands out, a sort of feline battle of
Achilles and Hektor, which my friends still talk about once in a
while over dinner.
</P>
<P>
   My cat and I were sharing quarters with several other cats, one
of which was a great orange tom named Thunderpaws, who had already
lost one eye, a chunk of ear and all of his tail to battles with
neighbor cats. The orange one and my tabby were both huge bruisers
and habituated to kicking cat butt.
</P>
<P>
   They were usually kept apart, but one day the orange cat managed
to sneak into my room while I wasn't there. The two cats fought
like the Act 2 climax of a Verdi opera and when the door was opened
on them, they sat in the middle of the room looking at us, innocent
as babes, an orange cat with a gray mustache and a tabby with an
orange mustache. All around the room, it was snowing hair.
</P>
<P>
   It may have looked like a standoff, but subsequently,
Thunderpaws always ``defurred'' to my cat.
</P>
<P>
   This cat showed all the usual feline behavior that we laugh at
and love them for: chasing phantoms from room to room, staring at
blank spots on the wall as if watching the most fascinating
theater, slurping himself through a handful of catnip and looking
at me all droop-eyed with a sliver of tongue in the cleft of his
upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   It was not unusual for him to scratch at the back door to be let
in, and when I came, he carried the body of a vole or sparrow to
drop at my feet as if it were a present, or perhaps his kitty
version of the rent he owed.
</P>
<P>
   And he had the usual vocabulary of odd catspeak. I rarely heard
the classical ``meow,'' but often heard the ``ack-ack'' when he
spotted a bird out the window, or the ``gmorph'' when he looked up
at me as if to say, ``Ain't life peculiar.''
</P>
<P>
   I often mimicked his talk back at him, but once made the mistake
of saying ``brrrrrttt'' to him, which means god-knows-what in cat
language, but sent him into the air with his claw swiping at my
nose as if I had insulted his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, playing with him, I chased him around the house.
If he got away, he returned to find me again so I would renew the
chase. I finally got him cornered on the second floor _ literally
cornered so that he had nowhere to go. He looked both ways to find
an alternative, then, when none appeared, sprang up in the air at
least double his length with his arms held wide as a crucifix, with
his claws stretched open and a scream in his mouth. But he attacked
straight up, not at me. It so startled me that I first backed off,
then fell backward laughing. I had never seen him so fierce.
</P>
<P>
   I mention these things because I want to talk about how he
became a member of the family. It isn't that I didn't know he was
an animal. I did, but that simply didn't matter: He was the animal
member of the family.
</P>
<P>
   I know it is the same way for many, perhaps most pets. But the
point I want to make is that there is something that transcends the
sentimental attachment we have for ``Little Puss'' or Rover. There
are people who go all soft and goofy over animals; they are not, in
fact, treating them as a member of the family, but as some
idealized object of a rather sappy affection. People don't treat
real family members that way.
</P>
<P>
   But this particular cat was more like an uncle or brother. I
came to know his habits, both good and bad, and accepted them all;
he in turn, forgave me some of my faults.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was a very old cat, I had to care for him like an
aging parent, performing those humiliating services _ humiliating
certainly for a prideful cat and humiliating to me to have to see _
such as cleaning up after him and changing bandages.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually died in the house while I was away at work. When I
came home in the evening, my wife met me at the door and broke it
to me.
</P>
<P>
   I cried over the death of that cat as I have cried few times in
my life. He had been with me for 15 years and had been my most
constant companion. He saw me through two and a half marriages and
residences in three states. Now, I said I am not a sentimental man.
I don't believe in creating sham emotions when they don't exist, or
glorifying trivial ones. Yet, I know that, that cat and I shared
something.
</P>
<P>
   We buried the cat in the woods in his home state of North
Carolina. I came back to the site about a year later and found his
tiny, wasted skeleton under the brush where we left him. It was
bleached and half-buried.
</P>
<P>
   I also have his photograph _ his great, broad Clark Gable face _
as a screen saver on my Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, what I think I mean when I say he was a
family member is that I learned from him. It is one of the prime
functions of family: We model behavior on our parents, learn to be
better men when we marry, learn patience and a sense of the future
with our children. It is an emotional and almost mythical
relationship we have with family, unlike that we have with those we
meet in business or career.
</P>
<P>
   And from my cat, I learned a number of things. I learned how to
concentrate on a task as intensely as if I were defusing a bomb. I
learned how to face experience with a certainty I didn't really
possess. I certainly learned the trick of relaxing; I am now a
master of it.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, I learned, even through his death, how life is
a certainty of loss. And all those we love will die and we cannot
love them any the less because of it. &QL;

 IT'S ONLY ROCK 'N ROLL: THE 1998 awards  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here comes your 19th nervous breakdo _ whoops, sorry, wrong
Rolling Stones song. Here comes the 19th annual It's Only Rock 'n'
Roll Awards, a swipe through the pop music world of 1998 in which
we salute heroes and vilify villains. As always, our motto _ which
we copped from an old Streetwalkers album _ remains: vicious, but
fair.
</P>
<P>
   Bare Nekkid Spiritualist: Alanis Morissette She's over-wrought
and tangled up in words and in the ``Thank U'' video she bares more
than her soul. Message? Um, grrrl power? We're all naked before
God? Sex sells?
</P>
<P>
   Truth in Packaging: The Spice Girls Last year, they won the ``Go
Away Little Girl Award.'' This year, we've turned a &UR;  &LR; corner, sort
of, and say this: Silly, sexy, and light as a feather, the five _
scrap that, four _ exuberant young ladies from England are proudly
prefab, and their calculated pop confections are convincingly
nutrition free. They're a preteen girl's role model and a lecherous
old man's wet dream. Their Great Woods show _ replete &UR;  &LR; with adverts
on the big video screen _ was a hoot. They work hard for the money.
</P>
<P>
   Best Rock Mag: Mojo A repeat winner, the English glossy is hip
but not condescending or knee-jerk nasty like much of the Brit
press. Mojo says ``nay'' to demographic skewering by covering
veterans and newcomers alike. As a reader put it recently, ``Your
writers seem to enjoy music. Odd approach, but I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy O. Williams Memorial: Nashville Pussy Exhibitionistic,
sleazy, in-your-face raunch from Dixie's Motorhead. Just like KISS,
the spontaneity is an illusion _ the show never changes. But, also
like KISS, it's a darn fun show.
</P>
<P>
   You're Never Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll If You're Too Young To
Die: :Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Pete Townshend (tie) Three cheers
for the old guard _ Bob and Van at the Fleet and Pete at
Harborlights _ and for intelligent, passionate reinvention of their
work. Put another way: The exact opposite of Eric Clapton turning
``Layla'' into middle of the road mush.
</P>
<P>
   You're Never Too Young to Sing About Being Old: Pulp Jarvis
Cocker's meditations on aging _ on the ``This Is Hardcore'' CD and
at the Paradise _ made for some of the year's most compelling
music.
</P>
<P>
   Rockin' Mom: Liz Phair Not only did Phair re-merge from long
hiatus as a more confident performer, she's writing sharper
melodies. Strong album, shows at Avalon. Edge intact.
</P>
<P>
   Oh-my-God Moment of the Year: Offspring During WBCN's River Rave
at Great Woods, singer Dexter Holland thought it'd be nice if he
encouraged the fans to whip up a paper-and-plastic storm. One
problem: Paper and plastic don't fly that far so it was mostly a
case of fans pelting each other. It was a total breakdown in order,
and, you know, it was cool.
</P>
<P>
   Best Genre Scramble: Firewater and Morcheeba (tie) Freakwater,
at the Middle East, assembled a tossed salad of sea chanteys,
waltzes, and rock, putting sax and violins to the best use since
early Roxy Music. We missed their local gigs, but Moorcheba's ``Big
Calm'' CD put a sexy, soulful, melancholic spin and a country twang
into trip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   Comeback of the Year: Cheap Trick Technically they never went
away and probably never will. They play 200-plus dates a year in
good times and bad. They played three in a row at the Paradise,
featuring their first three albums (one a night) and brought the
house down.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's of Pop: Garth Brooks Millions and millions served.
It's not the tastiest product, but you know what you're gonna get
time after time.
</P>
<P>
   Kraftwerk of the '90s: Air From the pop vacuum that is France
comes the surprising synth-based duo called Air. More aggressive
live at Karma than on disc, the nearly all-instrumental band
concocted many a percolating soundscape.
</P>
<P>
   Come Back Shane: Shane MacGowan A repeat winner. Yet another
year without a US album release and a scrapped Boston gig because
of . . . oh, health problems. On the plus side, the former Pogue
seems to have Keith Richards's constitution and keeps breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Worst Advertisement for a Tour: The Rolling Stones The world's
oldest rock 'n' roll band released yet another turgid live album _
why couldn't they have stopped with ``Get Your Ya-Ya's Out''? _ to
whip up the frenzy for the upcoming ``small-scale'' hockey barn
tour. Banks are taking loan applications for ticket buyers.
</P>
<P>
   New Wave on the March: Gary Numan, Bow Wow Wow, the Damned (tie)
I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't been there, but all three
of these long-in-the-tooth Brit acts played the Middle East
Downstairs and were the furthest thing from nostalgic. The music
worked on its own, contemporary terms.
</P>
<P>
   Pee-wee Herman Wannabe: George Michael Nabbed in a public men's
room. What a way to be outed . . . but Michael redeemed himself
with his cheeky video and in an interview in Q. ``Two undercover
cops and a randy pop star who'd had a couple of drinks at lunch,''
said Michael. ``I was stupid, I shouldn't have done it, it's
against the law, but what happened that afternoon was totally
unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Punk's Not Dead (Old School Division): The Dictators and X (tie)
The 'tators strutted their cocky, crunching stuff at the Middle
East, reliving teenage wasteland but also claiming a lust for life.
X revisited its early years with original guitarist Billy Zoom back
in the fold, and it was hot and nasty at Avalon.
</P>
<P>
   Over Over Over Over the Top Schlock: Mariah Carey, Celine Dion,
Whitney Houston (tie) More syrup and sugar from our era's three
divas. Lesson: It's not just how well you sing, it's what you sing.
</P>
<P>
   There's Something About a Soundtrack/Ex-local Hero: Jonathan
Richman More people saw the former Modern Lover as the bard-Greek
chorus in ``There's Something About Mary'' than probably ever have
in his musical career. But Jonathan is on the ascent. He played a
series of fine shows at the Middle East and released a winner with
the Ric Ocasek-produced ``I'm Confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Best David Bowie Reinvention of Self: Beastie Boys and Madonna
(tie) The Boys check their misogyny at the door and ditch the
goon-squad raps for something approaching a social conscience _
while still braying up a good storm. More successful on disc than
live _ their Worcester Centrum Centre show had severe clarity
problems. As to the new, spiritual Madonna _ the anti-Courtney _
she came up with one of her best albums.
</P>
<P>
   Best Maintenance of Self: KISS It's always 1975 (or so) in
KISSland. These old stomping hard rock/pop songs are as much dumb
fun as ever and the pyro is unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   Local Heroes: The Mighty Mighty Bosstones Again, the ska-punkers
pay back the locals and salute the hometown with a skein of Middle
East gigs and a live album culled from last year's show there.
</P>
<P>
   Best New Local Band: The Willard Grant Conspiracy Its disc,
``Flying Low,'' featured sad, eloquent, contemplative music that
had deep resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Best Local Production: Boston Rock Opera's ``Preservation'' BRO
kicked up the Kinks's rock opera in grand style, telling the story
of corrupting power, immorality, and idealism gone rotten. Great
cast, great staging, great direction. A timeless work done proud.
</P>
<P>
   Best Mess: Hole ``Celebrity Skin'' is stellar and disciplined,
but the walking time bomb that is Courtney Love was in full view at
the Orpheum during WBCN's Xmas Rave. Drugs or no drugs, the woman
does not go gentle into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive Artist of the Year: Elliot Smith This is not
solipsistic sensitive; this is a perceptive singer-songwriter who's
attunded to life's inherent sadness and the struggles we all face.
A convincing album, ``XO,'' and Paradise set.
</P>
<P>
   Manson of the Year: Shirley Manson Garbage's energetic front gal
edges out Marilyn (still posing) and Charlie (still confined) as
well as the English pop band Mansun.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Down Below: Joey Kramer of Aerosmith. His car went boom and
up in flames while he was gassing up, but the resilient stickman is
back in the saddle. Still, you can't help but recall Spinal Tap and
its mysterious, mishap-prone drummers . . .
</P>
<P>
   Family Affair: The Wainwrights, papa Loudon, son Rufus, daughter
Sloan The family that sings together . . . slings arrows, Top-level
work all around with Rufus becoming one of the year's brightest
emerging talents and Loudon still delightfully prickly. He
serenaded an Indigo Girls audience at the Newport Folk Festival
with ``I Wish I was a Lesbian,'' and did not altogether charm them.
God love him.
</P>
<P>
   Gobbler of the Year: SFX The concert-promoting monster swallowed
up Don Law and everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial Bomb of the Year: Smashing Pumpkins Their ``Adore''
album tanked and they fired their manager. Yes, it was his fault.

IT'S BOUNCE BACK OR BE BOUNCED OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First things first. Can your beloved Future Connecticut Patriots
win this wild-card game in Jacksonville? Sure. Why not? Do the
Jaguars look like the 1985 Bears to you?
</P>
<P>
   Well then, will they defeat the Jacksonville Jaguars and advance
in the tournament? Who am I, Nostradamus? Geez, I'm not even Chris
Mortensen. Or even Ron Borges. They can win; that's all I know.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, after listening to special teamsman
extraordinaire/nickel back Larry Whigham, I came away thinking I
should rifle the savings accounts and the available piggy banks and
put the whole wad down on your beloved Future Connecticut Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter (not yours truly): ``Can you guys bounce back from that
game on Sunday?''
</P>
<P>
   Whiggy: ``Of course. We're a championship football team.''
</P>
<P>
   They're not champions of anything right now, except, possibly,
the Commonwealth. (Not to downgrade our national 1-AA champion
Minutemen, but we'd probably have to take the Pats and the points
in that matchup). They are the once-upon-a-time champions of both
the AFC East and the AFC, period, and that's what Whiggy must have
been alluding to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have veterans here who have been to the Super Bowl,'' he
reminded us. ``We've got guys here who know how to win football
games.''
</P>
<P>
   These same guys also know how to oink-up a meaningful game, too,
and therein lies the problem confronting anyone in the process of
deciding whether they are a reasonable wager in this or any other
game. Consistency, thy name is most assuredly not New England.
</P>
<P>
   Such residual negativism does not fly far in the confines of the
local locker room. To them, there is only one reality: They'll be
playing on Sunday afternoon, and there are 18 other teams whose
players will be golfing, going to the movies or channel surfing.
</P>
<P>
   It is left to the media and fans to rehash and re-rehash the bad
stuff. We look at the Atlanta game, the St. Louis game, the Buffalo
heist (otherwise known as the Zebra Follies), and the reprehensible
second Jets game and we see a glass that has nothing more than a
teeny-weeny drop in the bottom. We can't help it.
</P>
<P>
   The coach and the players, when they think about what's
transpired during the past four months at all, think of the
Tennessee game, the Kansas City game, and the San Francisco game.
The bad stuff? What bad stuff? Anyway, are they playing the Jaguars
in the wild-card game or aren't they? That's all they want to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally,'' said Bruce Armstrong, ``you'd like to be getting
better and better as the season goes along. We've been an
up-and-down team. But this is why you play. We're in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The regular season is over,'' confirmed defensive end Ferric
Collons. ``It's all about getting to The Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   They might have that invitation to The Dance, but they aren't
exactly gonna be dancin' with the one that brung 'em. That Bledsoe
feller has that damaged digit. They may be in, but the star QB is
out. For now.
</P>
<P>
   To which the official party line is, ``So?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Zolak's our guy,'' asserted Collons, a large fellow who has a
rather forceful way with words. ``That's who we're playing with.
And he's gonna take us where we've got to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Down in Jacksonville, the Jaguars are welcoming back their own
starting quarterback. Mark Brunell has been idled by a high ankle
sprain, but the dynamic southpaw is expected back for what will be
the first home playoff game in the franchise's four-year history.
The Jaguars got by Pittsburgh (21-3) in the season's wrapup game
last Monday night with hulking (6-5, 245) rookie QB Jonathan Quinn
completing 10 of 19 for 192 yards and running for his first
professional touchdown. But a throwaway game in Week 16 is not a
playoff game, and thus the Jaguars will be happy to see Brunell
back, even if his ankle renders him less of a sprint-out man and
more of a pocket passer.
</P>
<P>
   The wary Patriots aren't buying into the idea that Brunell will
be anything less than his frisky self.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if he has to stay in the pocket,'' said safety Lawyer
Milloy, a former college teammate, ``he can still get it done. But
we're preparing for a healthy Mark Brunell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll prepare for him as we have in the past,'' agreed
Collons. ``We'll prepare for Mark Brunell and the things he adds to
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Another much-discussed Jaguar is running back Fred Taylor, a
1,233-yard, 17-TD man who began the season as the backup to James
Stewart and finished it as the obvious choice for AFC Offensive
Rookie of the Year. Listen to people rave about the ninth pick in
the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a very, very impacting rookie season,'' declared Pete
Carroll. ``He's powerful. He's real fast. Not just fast, real
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the ability to just break it,'' pointed out Bruell,
``and that's something we haven't had around here for a long time.
He takes the pressure off the passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big back,'' added Collons. ``He has exceptional speed.
He's an exceptional talent.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, sounds like we should just put him down for 175 and a couple
of scores and move on.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a meeting of two teams on the short list of NFL
clubs most affected by injuury this season. The Patriots had 14 of
their original 22 starters out at one time or another, and they
come into this game without their quarterback, their best wide
receiver, and two starting linebackers, to name a few. The Jaguars
lost their starting running back early _ what was his name again? _
and before the year was over they had 35 guys on injured reserve
and actually played three games with five different guys going both
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Hah! I just wanted to see if you were paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Jaguars really have had has as many or more
primary players miss multiple games as anyone in the league. Tom
Coughlin, a k a Tuna Lite, enhanced his reputation by guiding his
squad to an 11-5 record and the AFC Central Division title. They're
notoriously tough at home, but let the record show that last season
the then-maligned Pats strolled into Alltell Stadium and came away
with an impressive 26-20 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It is memories like that one the Future Connecticut players will
carry with them onto the field Sunday. For the closing summary, we
will once again call upon Mr. Larry Whigham.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the end of a 16-game season. That one is over. Now
we're at the beginning of a four-game season.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, rah-rah-sis-boom-bah to you, too, Whiggy!
</P>
<P>

DISHING UP PEACE, LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The contents are partly meant to be enjoyed by the preschool
set, but the marketing pitch is strictly tie-dyed and Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   In an ongoing bid to expand its presence in mainstream
supermarkets and to appeal to young and middle-aged consumers,
Annie's Homegrown of Wakefield, Mass. has just introduced an entree
called ``Peace Pasta &AMP; Parmesan,'' a righteous update to the
old-fashioned boxed mix of macaroni and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we look to the 30th anniversary of Woodstock next year,
it's important to teach our children well: Peace never goes out of
style,'' said company cofounder Andrew Martin when Peace Pasta
debuted this week. ``We hope children of all ages will enjoy this
totally natural reminder to give peace a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The packaging isn't subtle; it's as tie-dyed as Jerry Garcia
neckwear. And the pasta inside is shaped like tiny peace signs.
</P>
<P>
   Company values and a peace-and-love philosophy may also be a
good way to push product on a limited marketing budget, as Ben &AMP;
Jerry's proved with ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Annie's traces its roots to 1989, when cofounder Ann Withey and
a partner sold their Smartfood Popcorn business to PepsiCo, and
Withey decided to make a culinary career move from snack foods to
boxed pasta.
</P>
<P>
   With many health-conscious baby boomers seeking a more healthful
lifestyle, Annie's pasta dishes have been something of a hit at
natural-food stores. But when a company trafficks in macaroni and
cheese, children comprise a market that can't be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Annie's took aim at the children's market with
the introduction of BernieOs, which the company describes as a
``fun-shaped'' alternative to Spaghettios. The entree takes its
name from Withey's pet rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   (Bernie also does double duty as company mascot, and his cartoon
likeness can be found on Annie's packaging.)
</P>
<P>
   Children may indeed like fun-shaped pasta, but underage eaters
have apparently been slow to warm to the subtle flavorings of
Annie's signature cheese sauces.
</P>
<P>
   Sauces for many of Annie's original macaroni dishes draw heavily
on cheddar cheese. While these sauces are pleasing to ``the mature
palate'' of the middle-aged gourmet, Nardone suggested, children
have been underwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   So Withey began experimenting with cheese recipes that would wow
her 18-month-old daughter. After much trial and error, Withey hit
upon Peace Pasta &AMP; Parmesan, which features a boxtop likeness of
Bernie in full Woodstock hippie regalia.
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock notwithstanding, Nardone thinks Peace Pasta can tap
into popular nostalgia for the 1960s and '70s. ``McDonald's is
running ads with a flashback retro theme, and kids are wearing
bell-bottoms again,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Annie's Homegrown recently acquired Tamarind Tree, a line of
ethnic ``heat-and-serve'' foods that bills itself as a ``taste of
India.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Annie's, Tamarind Tree seems to market itself largely
through a company philosophy. A guru's ``14 steps to happiness''
are posted on Tamarind's Web site. The site also features quotes
said to be from Mahatma Gandhi, such as, ``A customer is the most
important visitor on our premises.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamarind Tree gives Annie's something it didn't have before, a
line of entrees that appeal to vegans, a fast-growing subset of
vegetarians who eschew dairy products as well as meat. Tamarind
Tree entrees include alu chole, a curried garbanzo dish, and dal
makhani, described as ``aromatic lentil chili.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, plans call for adding new varieties to both the
Tamarind Tree and Annie's Homegrown lines. The coming year could
also see more acquisitions for a company with projected annual
sales of $7 million, Nardone says.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nardone, nearly all profits have been plowed back
into paying slotting fees, the fees supermarkets charge for putting
products on their store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Annie's began last year with a presence in nearly all the
nation's health food stores, but only about 20 percent of
mainstream supermarkets. Now Annie's is in nearly 30 percent of the
nation's supermarkets, and, with products such as Peace Pasta &AMP;
Parmesan, it hopes to expand that presence even more.

MR. AIRPLANE MAN TAKES A FLIGHT WITH THE BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Howling Wolf and Mississippi Fred McDowell. Not exactly
household names in the '90s, but they are the Delta-blues idols of
two women known as Mr. Airplane Man, a name taken from a Howling
Wolf song. The two women _ guitarist Margaret Garrett and drummer
Tara McManus _ play a raw mix of country blues and stripped-down
rock that is causing a sensation in Boston clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Howling Wolf and Fred McDowell, but we also love Iggy
Pop and the Gun Club,'' says Garrett, who grew up in Boston suburb
Newton and has known McManus since they attended the same summer
camp 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were inseparable from the start and were always getting
into trouble,'' McManus adds.
</P>
<P>
   The two women are now both 28 _ a young age to be so steeped in
Delta blues _ but they've added a droney, psychedelic edge that has
hypnotized a growing legion of fans who have seen them play on the
streets and in the Plough and Stars, Toad, House of Blues (where
they've opened for Koko Taylor and R.L. Burnside), the Brendan
Behan Pub, and the Midway Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be able to support ourselves through this music,
but we're not into it for the money,'' says Garrett, a talented
slide guitarist. That dedication shows, because Mr. Airplane Man
exhibits sincere artistry, not mimicry. The group has released a
self-titled CD that slyly rearranges songs by Wolf (``Moanin' for
My Baby'') and McDowell (``Sun Sinkin' Low''), but also has
original tunes that make this a highly signable band. The CD is
available at shows and through the duo's Web site (at
www.vacant.org/airplaneman/). Parts of it were recorded at the home
studio of Morphine's Mark Sandman in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the music speaks for itself. People feel it,'' says
Garrett, who attended Clark University in Worcester, where she had
a Sonic Youth-style noise band named Blow. But her life forever
changed when she walked into the used-records store Mystery Train
in Cambridge and heard Howling Wolf's ``Wang Dang Doodle'' blasting
from the speakers. ``I became obsessed with Howling Wolf,'' she
says of the pioneering, primal bluesman.

   She and McManus (who is originally from Westborough) moved for a
year to San Francisco, where they hoped to launch their career, but
we ``didn't dig the music scene there, so we came back to Boston,
where people have responded really well,'' says Garrett. She also
has been tutored locally, studying Delta blues guitar with Michael
Tarbox of the Tarbox Ramblers (who play every Friday at the Green
Street Grill in Cambridge) and local legend Paul Rishell, who once
taught Bonnie Raitt. Garrett plays a '50s Kraftsman guitar and a
Gibson ES295 (``my prize gem''), while McManus plays a minimalist
drum kit, upon which she adds rhythms learned from her study of
African and Haitian music.
</P>
<P>
   They've also enlisted the services of first-time managers (and
husband and wife) Ted Drozdowski and Laurie Hoffma, known as
Barking Koala Management. Drozdowski, a former staffer at the
Boston Phoenix, was given a W. C. Handy award for blues journalism
in Memphis this year.
</P>
<P>
   His memory of first meeting Mr. Airplane Man is worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were playing in front of the liquor store in Central
Square. I thought that was the coolest place,'' Drozdowski says of
that springtime meeting. ``Even if they sucked, I was going to give
them a dollar. But when I got up close and they were doing a Jesse
Mae Hemphill song, I was hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Mr. Airplane Man did a rare double by playing
at Toad in early Monday evening, then the Plough and Stars for two
later sets. At the Plough, before a packed house, they even did the
Velvet Underground's ``Mr. Rain,'' Mazzy Star's ``Blue Light,'' the
Gun Club's ``For the Love of Ivy,'' and Iggy Pop's ``I Just Wanna
Be Your Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a connection between Iggy Pop and everything else we
do,'' says Garrett. ``I'd feel it was wrong if we were just pulling
off a Mississippi Delta blues thing.''

   Stone Crazy: Speaking of the blues, there's a veteran unit
around town that's starting to make waves. Stone Crazy includes
bassist Danny Klein (from the J. Geils Band), singer-harmonica
virtuoso Babe Pino, guitarist Ken Pino (who played 10 years with
Johnny Clyde Copeland), and drummer Mark Hyland. Stone Crazy
recently played at Mama Kin and tore the place up with a rockin'
set of blues that encompassed original tunes and scorching covers
of Otis Rush's ``Homework'' (a staple of the Geils Band) and
Freddie King's ``Goin' Down.'' Klein was outstanding, playing a
five-string Steinberger bass with all the relish that he's known
for.

   Hollywood Goes Wild: Brad Pitt, Jeff Goldblum, Johnny Depp,
Bruce Willis, Juliette Lewis, Will Smith, Billy Bob Thornton, Kim
Basinger, and Keanu Reeves are among the film stars contributing
songs to the all-star album, ``Hollywood Goes Wild.'' Due out in
the first quarter of the year, the album will benefit Wildlife
Waystation, a sanctuary for wild and exotic animals in a national
forest in California. The executive producer is Ron Lovely, a
Boston resident who launched the idea after meeting Pitt at Les
Paul's birthday party in New York last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brad got there a half-hour early just so he could hang out
with Les Paul. Brad is a huge music fan,'' says Lovely, who then
solicited Reeves's participation after the latter's group Dogstar
played at Boston's Avalon club. Pitt's song on the disc is
``Midtown'' (from the film ``Johnny Suede''), while Dogstar's is an
original modern rocker, ``Your World.''
</P>
<P>
   An early listen to the album suggests that one of the most
talented stars is Goldblum, who does an original song with a bebop
jazz edge. Lovely, who has worked with Smokey Robinson and Eric
Clapton, says the album will come out on Hammer &AMP; Lace Records,
which released ``Women for Women,'' a disc whose proceeds supported
breast cancer research.

MORE BELIEVERS THAN EVER ARE TOUCHED BY ANGELS  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, JAN. 3) 
</HEADLINE>

   PHOENIX - Are angels among us, or do we create them?
</P>
<P>
   We know for certain that angels have appeared in art and
scripture since 3000 B.C. Angelology, the study of angels, was
developed in ancient Persia and absorbed into Judaism and
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are perhaps more reported angel contacts than ever
before. The angel phenomenon has deeply permeated our culture.
Besides its presence in religion, angels also have been prominent
of late in the secular quadrants of our culture. It's not unusual
for movies, books and TV shows to contain angel elements in story
lines.
</P>
<P>
   But are they (begin ital) real? (end ital) Are we experiencing
worldwide angel contact or worldwide angel hysteria?
</P>
<P>
   Mental illness aside, clinicians are reluctant to empirically
dissect matters of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Bowers, a Scottsdale clinical psychologist who also has a
degree in theology, believes wish fulfillment may account for angel
contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be some crossover at times between our imagination
and our desire to experience something,'' Bowers said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical psychologist Larry Sidener of Phoenix said people often
develop a reality based on what they want to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, when people lose significant others in their
life, they talk about the idea that this person is still with
them,'' Sidener said. ``Well, is this true or is it wish
fulfillment?''
</P>
<P>
   We do know that our concept of angels is changing.
</P>
<P>
   They've gone from androgynous cupids of early Christian art to
winged heads of the Middle Ages. In the Renaissance, angels
appeared with complete bodies again, plus a halo and a second pair
of wings.
</P>
<P>
   If you've seen the film ``City of Angels,'' you know that people
today might think they look a lot like Nicolas Cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every hundred years, concepts of angels change because no one
can pin them down,'' said Linda Neff, angelologist and member of
Chandler Christian Church. ``They aren't corporal beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Neff believes she had an angel encounter when
she lived in Texas during a period of devastating brush fires. She
said the angel filled the sky, outshining the stars and the city
lights. The being had golden hair and wings but no discernible
facial features.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of peace and security that enfolded me was
mesmerizing,'' Neff said.
</P>
<P>
   The brush fires abated shortly after the encounter, and Neff
turned to Bible studies to find out more about angels. She
discovered that along with their visual changes, some believe their
purpose has changed, too, evolving from Old Testament messengers of
God to the more secular concept of angels as pals or personal
bodyguards to serve man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angels serve God, not man,'' Neff said. ``They answer to God,
not man. They follow the instructions of God, not man. Too often,
the New Age concept of guardian angels is that of a supernatural
being provided for our benefit and pleasure. I think that is
entirely a misinterpreted view of angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Michael Diskin, assistant chancellor at the Phoenix
Catholic Diocese, agrees that it would be inappropriate to say that
angels serve the needs of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in accord with God's will, the role of angels may be for
the benefit of human beings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diskin said he's not particularly bothered by the way angels are
culturally perceived as long as it doesn't take away from the
individual's relationship with God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, some people have deified angels,'' Diskin said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most prominent angelologist today is Doreen Virtue
of the Los Angeles area, a former clinical psychologist turned
angel medium. Her own encounters with angels led her to national TV
appearances. She has also written a dozen books, including ``Angel
Therapy'' (Hay House).
</P>
<P>
   Virtue defines angels as ``thought forms'' from the Creator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time God thinks about love, he creates these thought
forms, which are an extension of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission of angels, according to Virtue, is to raise our
consciousness, prompt our spiritual evolution and let us know that
all ends well.
</P>
<P>
   She said angels (begin ital) can (end ital) take on any form.
Even Nicolas Cage.
</P>
<P>
   Virtue also believes angel popularity has never been greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at the world,'' Virtue said. ``We're asking for
their help more. In my opinion, there are more angels on Earth than
ever. In my seminars, it's not unusual for one-third of the
audience to have had an angel encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves two-thirds who may be asking the question: Are these
people losing it?
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix psychiatrist John Scialli said that in most cases where
people see angels or ghosts or have other experiences that science
can't explain, mental illness is not an issue if these are isolated
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would other symptoms and a history of disordered
thinking if it was a mental illness,'' Scialli said. ``And since an
angel vision is usually comforting rather than disturbing, I don't
focus on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scialli said he's not so sure there are more angel contacts now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the media is just making this topic more acceptable to
talk about out loud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A point not lost on angel entrepreneurs who are turning out a
glut of angel merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Neff said angel commercialism disturbs her. But Father Diskin
reserves judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercialization to the extent that it reminds people that
there's a spiritual dimension to life doesn't bother me,'' Diskin
said.
</P>
<P>
   He himself received an angel golf pin with the premise that the
pin would improve his game.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should wear it more,'' Diskin said. &QL;

EDWARDS-TAYLOR: A CARRYOVER EFFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY AND MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are friends, so you never know in which direction their
conversations might go. But you don't need a transcript of their
chats to understand where they won't be going. Here's a hint: Nov.
1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Edwards and Fred Taylor have worked out together. They
have shared Southeastern Conference fields together. They have done
photo shoots in Florida together. They have run for pro football
scouts in Indiana together. They have both seen their names posted
on first-round draft boards. A few times this year, Edwards has
dialed Taylor in Jacksonville and Taylor has dialed Edwards in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   That may be a lot of talking and socializing, but there is
always one element missing from their conversations: Nov. 1, 1997.
That was the last time Edwards and Taylor played a game in the same
stadium. It was in Jacksonville's Alltel Stadium, also known as the
Gator Bowl. It is the same venue in which the Patriots and Jaguars
will play their AFC wild-card game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, now a Patriot, was a Georgia Bulldog back then. Taylor,
now a Jaguar, was a Florida Gator. But, hey, you didn't have to
bring that up, did you?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not something we talk about,'' Edwards said Thursday.
``We usually don't talk about stuff that happened on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   At least not with each other. But you know how friends are.
Sometimes no one has to say a word, but you still know that an
event has never really faded from memory.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, sizable underdogs to Florida, went into
Jacksonville and beat Florida by 20 points, 37-17. Everyone knew
about Taylor, who rushed for 85 yards in the loss. Not many knew
about a kid named Edwards, who rushed for 124 yards and had four
touchdowns that day. He scored in every quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that being a real good win for us,'' Edwards said.
``We were underdogs, as usual, and had never beaten a Steve
Spurrier team as long as I had been there. He had something like
seven consecutive wins against us. It was good to finally beat one
of his teams.''
</P>
<P>
   For three days, Taylor has given the stock answer _ the one he
knows the media in Jacksonville, a Gator-loving section of Florida,
want to hear _ when the name of Robert Edwards is brought up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got to hope Robert doesn't do what he did to us last
year,'' said Taylor. ``Robert beat us singlehandedly.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Taylor is away from the media throngs and is asked
about Edwards, he chuckles. Then a small smile crosses his face.
And then Taylor chuckles again. A wider smile. And again a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew him a bit from playing against him in the
Florida-Georgia game,'' said Taylor with a chuckle. ``I also met
him down at the Senior Bowl. We were playing in the same backfield
and we ran together for a whole week. So we were messing around
with each other the entire week.''
</P>
<P>
   A bigger chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert likes to mess around,'' said Taylor. ``Robert's a funny
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we were in that combine together and . . .''
</P>
<P>
   An even bigger chuckle at that memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two or three days that we were out in the combine, like,
Robert was playing around with my stuff,'' said Taylor. ``He was
just messing around and we were using each other's cell phone, and
fooling around. He'd be teasing me and I'd be teasing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Each Monday morning this season, Taylor has checked the
statistics from the New England games and compared them with his.
Taylor could see that Edwards was doing well, but, even if he won't
say it himself, Taylor was doing much better.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a case could be made that it is Taylor and not
Minnesota's Randy Moss who should be NFL Rookie of the Year. Moss
has two other outstanding receivers on his team to deflect
defensive schemes away from him, but Taylor has been the entire
Jacksonville running game since James Stewart suffered a
season-ending knee injury in the third game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart sank when I heard that James would be out for the
season,'' said Taylor. ``It happened real fast. I looked over at
the sidelines when he was down and it didn't look very good. I
didn't know if he was going to return or not. So I just did the
most I can while I was in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Which has been much.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics are statistics, so it must be noted that Taylor has
gained 1,223 yards on 264 carries this season for a 4.6-yard
average. More significant, though, is that Taylor has scored 17
touchdowns, the third-most by a rookie in NFL history. His 14
rushing touchdowns also are the third-most by an NFL rookie and he
already has the three longest runs in Jacksonville history (77, 70,
and 52 yards). The 77-yarder, it should be noted, came on Taylor's
first play in a Monday night game, against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did what I visualized: Monday night football, first play
of the game, (the Dolphins) are trying to kill somebody,'' said
Taylor. ``It was a predetermined cutback.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so good about Fred,'' said Tony Boselli, the Jaguars'
star tackle, ``is that he can break it anytime. Just give Fred a
crease and you know he can be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Leon Searcy, the Jaguars' other tackle, put it, ``When
he's running those long ones, I just sit back and enjoy it. It's
like being at a track meet, watching those 4x100s.''
</P>
<P>
   In last Monday night's game against Pittsburgh, Taylor displayed
his other side, his fierceness as well as his flash. On a pass
reception for a TD, Taylor ran over two Steelers to get into the
end zone, and on a 12-yard TD run straight up the middle, he bowled
over three Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think I'm strong, too,'' said Taylor. ``I just try
to have a winning attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Patriots are sizable underdogs to the Jaguars, just
as Georgia was a sizable underdog to Florida. The SEC is certainly
not the NFL. And Steve Spurrier doesn't have much in common with
Jaguars head coach Tom Coughlin. But one truth remains from the
college days of Edwards and Taylor. The team that runs best on
Sunday will most likely win.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will be playing with backup quarterback Scott
Zolak. The Jaguars' starter, Mark Brunell, probably won't be his
usually elusive self. He has a badly sprained ankle. So, once
again, the focus is on the friends. The runners, Edwards and
Taylor. They already don't talk about Nov. 1. Is there a chance
that they won't talk about Jan. 3, either?
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, I hope Robert does some good things _ just some _
and maybe have a flash or two,'' said Taylor. ``I don't want him to
do anything like the last time. This time I want us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards knows he will need some help from the Patriots' defense.
One Patriot was asked what he thought of Taylor. His answer was a
very revealing, ``Oh my God.'' He is not the player you want to
face when your starting middle linebacker is out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor, the ninth player taken in last spring's draft, is
not the only runner who likes to punish people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to hit guys before they hit me,'' said Edwards, the
18th player taken. ``I want them to take the worst of the hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Running with power has not been a problem in Edwards's rookie
season. No one has questioned his heart. His speed? That's a
different story. He is constantly reminded that he was caught from
behind _ twice _ during the loss in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I believe I have the speed, there's no doubt about that,''
he said. ``That was just a matter of endurance, and it's something
I need to work on in the offseason. The pro season is longer than
the college season. But I wasn't trying to get caught on those
runs. It's just something that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday will be like a trip home for Edwards. His parents,
brother, and sister will be at the game. He has a few other
relatives in Florida, too.
</P>
<P>
   Once he arrives, he plans to call Taylor. He will not mention
Nov. 1 or Jan. 3. But by about 4 o'clock Sunday, there is a good
chance you will know who won simply by asking which rookie
1,000-yard rusher had the better game. If it makes the friends more
comfortable, they will not have to mention any dates over the
course of their friendship. The results, though, will always be in
the books.
</P>
<P>

and Michael Madden in Jacksonville, Fla.)

DOLPHINS DEFENSE SETS ITS SIGHTS ON FLUTIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ The climate inside the Miami Dolphins' locker room
at the practice facility at Nova Southeastern University was hot
and steamy. It was even hotter at Sam Madison's stall, where the
cornerback sat amid a clutch of reporters, responding to questions
about the incendiary remarks Buffalo Bills quarterback Doug Flutie
had made earlier in the week about Miami's secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it would be a bit of an understatement to say that
Madison merely ``responded'' to Flutie's bulletin-board comments
about how ``it will be important for the officials to pull their
flags out if (Miami's cornerbacks) start tugging and pulling as
usual,'' and how ``you can't cover Eric Moulds one-on-one; you
can't cover Andre Reed one-on-one.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison, a second-year pro out of Louisville, has never been
understated about anything in his brief NFL career. So he returned
fire with a jet stream of invective aimed at his intended target in
Saturday's AFC wild-card game between the Bills and Dolphins at Pro
Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Though Madison turned up the heat on the trash talk, Flutie was
unaware of the chain reaction his comments had caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did it make a firestorm?'' Flutie asked. ``Oh, good. They get
excited about little things. What are they going to do _ play
harder now?''
</P>
<P>
   What Flutie did, actually, was fire up Madison's competitive
blast furnace, and Dolphin fans hope the quarterback's words have
the same effect on the rest of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Although Flutie is listed in the Bills media guide as being 5
feet 10 inches, Madison cut him down to size _ by 5 inches or so _
belittling a man who has ascended from underpaid backup to Pro Bowl
selection by leading Buffalo to victories in 10 of its last 13
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 5-5 and can't really see over the line and all he does is
scramble, so it really does (upset me) when somebody comes out and
says something like that,'' Madison seethed. ``That motivates me,
and their receivers are going to have to be ready to play Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the way they move the ball, they have to get him out of
the pocket because he's too short to see over the D-line.''
</P>
<P>
   Badda bing. So, Sam, what about Flutie's arm?
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been just Doug Flutie _ I mean, he's only 5-5 and he
just throws the ball up there and lets Moulds go up there and get
it,'' Madison said, firing another zing. ``But Moulds and Reed have
been doing a great job for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Badda bing bang. So, Sam, exactly how tall is Flutie?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's about 5-5,'' he said. ``Man, if I had Eric Moulds
and Andre Reed, I could get back there and play quarterback and let
those guys go up there and get it. I mean, he's not doing anything
spectacular. He's just forcing balls _ and what he does is force
balls _ and they've been making plays for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The camera lights went off, and the reporters dispersed to
cooler corners of the locker room. But Madison still smoldered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's strong words to say we go out there and hold,'' said
Madison, who has been called for six holding penalties this season,
compared with 10 for his colleague, Terrell Buckley. ``Of course,
when you're playing press coverage, you're going to get a holding
call here and there. I've had six, and Terrell's had 10, but we've
played 1,000 snaps. That's great for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just go out there and play football. (Receivers) get away
with pushing every now and then and we get away with holding, so it
evens out. But we usually get the short end of the stick with the
holding penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Buckley stood in front of his stall, unmoved by
Flutie's words. As a veteran, he knew they were basically a ploy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a wrassling fan, and it's just like when those wrasslers
get to talking,'' Buckley sniffed. ``(Madison) probably looks at it
as an insult or something like that. But, being a vet, I'm going to
wait until I get out there on Saturday. You don't want to spend any
energy getting mad now, you might be tired by the time the game
rolls around.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley started for the locker room door, then turned and called
out to Madison, who was still holding forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, 2-9,'' Buckley said. ``We'll let him know on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' Madison replied, ``but I just had to let the short
man know he shouldn't be talking that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's defensive linemen, meahwhile, wasted little breath on
Flutie's comments. With defensive end Jason Taylor out for the
season with a fractured clavicle, Shane Burton knows the Dolphins
must conserve every ounce of energy so they can contain Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a good offensive team and a good scheme, but a lot
of it is him,'' Burton said. ``He makes a lot of plays and he keeps
the guys going in the right direction. He's going to be a big
factor. If we let him run around and make plays, it's going to be a
tough day. But if we stop the run and get after him and hit him a
little bit, get him on the ground, we'll keep him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's first impressions of Flutie from a 30-24 loss at
Buffalo Nov. 1 were predictable: ``For a guy as tall as I am,''
said the 6-6 defensive tackle, ``my first impression was, `Wow,
this guy is really tiny.' I mean, he's even shorter than Zach
(Thomas, Miami's 5-11 linebacker) _ and that's short.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, that was Thomas's first impression of Flutie,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really know he was that short,'' said Thomas.
``That's what they say about me, too, but I'm impressed with him.
That's why he's going to the Pro Bowl. I just hope he doesn't have
a Pro Bowl day against us, but he's a great quarterback and he's
had all those great years up in the Canadian League, so he knows
what (the playoffs) are all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just hoping we can go out there and rattle him a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rated the fifth-best passer in the AFC after completing 202 of
354 attempts for 2,711 yards and 20 touchdowns, Flutie proved
unflappable in that Nov. 1 victory. Against Miami, he passed for
206 yards and three touchdowns, rallying the Bills from a 24-14
deficit with 16 unanswered points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got special talents, obviously,'' said Miami coach Jimmy
Johnson. ``He's got a knack for making plays and he makes great
decisions. On top of that, I think sometimes when people look at a
player like Doug Flutie, or a Zach Thomas, someone who may not fit
the scouting combine dimensions, you kind of look at them as an
overachiever. I don't think people realize the talent that these
individuals have, and Doug Flutie is a talented player.''

DEADLY STORM LEAVES CLOUD OVER SYDNEY-HOBART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Christmas eve, two days before the start of the annual
Sydney-Hobart yacht race at the celebratory height of the
Australian summer, the weather forecast was ominous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere is in a chaotic state,'' warned the official
race meteorologist, Kenn Batt. ``I am concerned. It is shaping up
to be quite complex. It could turn into a rough ride for the first
few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Batt's words now seem both understated and prescient. The race
started last Saturday with 115 sailboats off on a 630-mile course
to the island state of Tasmania, but within 24 hours had been
devastated by a howling storm of hurricane strength that left six
sailors dead or missing, and dozens of wrecked or badly damaged
boats foundering in the Tasman Sea. Seventy of the starters were
forced to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, as the largest maritime search-and-rescue
operation in Australia's history continues, questions are mounting
amid claims that race organizers and participants knew of the
potential danger at least 24 hours before the storm tore the fleet
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from Batt's Christmas Eve forecast, the danger was
certainly not unknown. Winds gusting to 90 miles per hour and
churning up 35-foot seas that snapped masts, rolled and pitchpoled
hulls, could well have been avoided, says a rising chorus of race
critics, had only officials stepped in and abandoned the race as
the storm approached.
</P>
<P>
   The government of New South Wales has ordered a coroner's
inquiry, and the race's authority _ Cruising Yacht Club of
Australia _ has also begun to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney-Hobart, which started in 1945, is one of the three most
prestigious blue-water races in the world, alongside Britain's
Fastnet and the biennial Newport-Bermuda race off the US East
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``Hell on High Water,'' the Sydney-Hobart is known for
its boisterous conditions, a race course for only the most
experienced sailors and well-tested blue-water boats. But even so,
storms have exploded on this race before, though only one death had
been recorded in its 52 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, 75-knot southerlies whipped the seas up to 35 feet,
snapping masts and smashing hulls. Two boats sank and 66 of the
starters were forced to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that five-year-old experience fresh in their minds,
and with Batt's weather predictions leaving little hope for
reprieve, the fleet and race officials pressed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two Sydney-Hobart races saw southerly busters early
in the race, and this year is no different,'' Batt warned the
skippers. The fleet, he said, would run into a brick wall southerly
early in the race.
</P>
<P>
   But some boats in the fleet were looking forward to the
boisterous conditions, remembering that similar southerlies helped
the German Maxi Morning Glory set a record in 1996 of 2 days, 14
hours, 7 minutes, and 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   As the race began, the US entry Sayonara, an 80-foot Maxi owned
and raced by billionaire Larry Ellison, was an odds-on favorite
because of her upwind potential.
</P>
<P>
   But three days later, after indeed winning this year's race,
Ellison was anything but the picture of the victorious yachtsman.
In fact, said the despondent skipper, blue-water racing may be over
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may reassess my attitude,'' he said. ``It will take a little
time to place this in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sailor, Richard Winning, owner and skipper of the yacht
Winston Churchill, which was sunk by the storm, has vowed never to
race again. Winning acknowledged that he had been given ``adequate
weather information'' but pressed on. Three of his crew members
were among those killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally won't race again,'' said Winning the day after he
was rescued. ``My decision is pretty well made up.''
</P>
<P>
   Two questions sure to get close scrutiny: Did the sailing crews
have adequate weather information both before the start and as the
race progressed, and more importantly, who is responsible for the
decision to continue or abandon a race?
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the spectrum is the view of Hugo van Kretschmar,
head of the Cruising Yacht Club, who believes the responsibility is
entirely with the skippers, that under international rules it was
not up to the club to abandon the race.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Peter Bush, who will lead the club's inquiry,
said that while safety is the primary concern of any governing
body, the call to abandon the race would have been a difficult one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we called the race off when we were aware of the strength
of those conditions,'' said Bush, ``little else could have happened
other than what happened because these guys were already on the
race course.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, vowing an impartial inquiry, ``The single most
important aspect all the way along in this process, in the history
of this race, is that we make the event and all our yacht racing as
safe as humanly possible.''

TIME FOR CONFERENCE CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a new year upon us, it is time for college basketball teams
to forget about non-conference opponents and tournament formats and
get down to the nitty-gritty of conference play.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick look at the emerging teams in the major
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   --Big East _ The University of Connecticut was the preseason
pick and the Huskies, who are No. 1 in the Associated Press poll,
have done nothing seriously wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Calhoun's team has beaten good and bad teams with
regularity.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a surprise _ and it's a minor one _ it's the
emergence of St. John's as a threat. The Johnnies have been a force
throughout November and December. Circle Jan. 30 on your calendar.
UConn at St. John's at Madison Square Garden. Tim Welsh has done an
outstanding job in turning Providence into a competitive team _
proof of which is the Friars' recent win over Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   --Big Ten _ Michigan State may not be as good as we first
thought and Ohio State may be better. Minnesota and Wisconsin and
Indiana all are emerging as solid contenders as well. Purdue has
been the most solid team in the conference for the past several
years. The Badgers have done a nice job under Dick Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, the Big Ten could be on its way to another
seven-berth NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   --Atlantic Coast Conference _ Duke is no surprise and North
Carolina has again showed it belongs in the Top 10. Maryland has
emerged as the most serious threat to the Blue Devils' quest for an
ACC title. Georgia Tech remains an enigma: capable of getting
destroyed by Kentucky, upsetting North Carolina, and getting
stunned by Hofstra.
</P>
<P>
   --Southeastern Conference _ Kentucky has been unpredicatable.
The Wildcats, like Georgia Tech, can beat anyone and lose to
anyone. Losing to Louisville was not a stunner, but a surprise
victory over Maryland was. It looks like it's going to be that way
around the league.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is a threat and so is Arkansas, but when it's showtime,
look for the Wildcats to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   --Big 12 _ Surprise, surprise, Kansas is not a mortal lock for
anything this season. The Jayhawks have proven they are very
beatable, even at historic Allen Field House. The problem is that
no one else has really emerged. Missouri and Oklahoma State could
step forward. But with the pressure off, the Jayhawks might
actually advance for more than a few rounds in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   --Pacific-10 _ Stanford is still the solid choice. Washington
has been a disappointment. Arizona and UCLA remain darkhorse
threats and watch out for California, which knocked off North
Carolina earlier this week. Ben Braun has done a nice job of
bringing the Bears along after probation.
</P>
<P>
   -- Western Athletic Conference _ Utah, as coach Rick Majerus
noted, was ranked too high in preseason. New Mexico will be solid,
but the team we like is Texas Christian. Billy Tubbs's teams always
are entertaining and this year's version just might surprise some
players.
</P>
<P>
   --Atlantic 10 _ Total chaos. Take your pick. Rhode Island.
University of Massachusetts. Temple. Xavier. None has lived up to
expectations. Maybe with conference play order will be restored,
meaning Xavier and Temple will emerge as the front-runners. But
then again maybe it's one of those years. Can anyone say George
Washington?
</P>
<P>
   --Conference USA _ Cincinnati has stepped forward as one of the
elite teams in the country. Not a surprise. Not many people do a
better job of rebuilding and retooling than Bob Huggins. St.Louis
and Louisville have already pulled off huge upsets.
</P>
<P>
   --America East _ Delaware has been solid, but Hofstra, winner of
a watered-down Holiday Festival, has emerged. So has Maine. Boston
University and Northeastern have been up and down. Maine could be
the sleeper if Boston College transfer Andy Bedard continues to
play the way he has the first two months. After beating Georgia
Tech and Pennsylvania for the Holiday crown, Hofstra coach Jay
Wright said, ``It isn't the NCAA championship. But the Holiday
festival, to Hofstra is as big as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   --Ivy League _ Instead of Princeton, we have Penn. The Quakers
had some nice wins early in the season and nearly beat Kansas.
Princeton can't be taken lightly, as several teams have learned
this week in the Rainbow Classic. Harvard could play for a
runner-up position, which would be a solid accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   --Mid-America Conference _ Miami of Ohio is Top-20 caliber.
Toledo has already beaten Ohio State in getting off to its best
start in 32 years. Akron is off to its best start in a dozen
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lafayette has returned
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lafayette, under former Penn assistant Fran O'Hanlon, is off to
its best start since 1979-80 and has to be considered the favorite
to win the Patriot League. O'Hanlon has done a nice job of
rebuilding the Leopards from a 7-20 record three years ago to 19-9
last season . . . Tuesday night was college basketball's version of
the East Coast-West Coast challenge. Stanford beat Temple,
California beat North Carolina, Pepperdine beat Rhode Island, and
Portland State beat New Hampshire. Saving face for the Easterners
were Harvard, a winner over Santa Clara, and St. Joseph's, which
edged San Francisco . . . How bad is it getting for the Alantic 10?
This week Rhode Island lost to Pepperdine and UMass was beaten by
Davidson at home. It's getting so tough that when Dayton almost
beat Cincinnati it was cause for some relief. Near-wins now seem to
count for something . . . The hot games this weekend are Arizona
vs. UCLA and Duke vs. Maryland. The latter game is such a hot
ticket that some scalpers are asking _ and getting _ a $1,000 per
ticket. When Georgetown comes to UConn's Gampel Pavillion Saturday,
it will mark Hoya coach John Thompson's first visit ever to Storrs.
Which led long-time Big East watchers to remember when Syracuse
coach Jim Boeheim made his first visit to Gampel a few years ago.
After the Orangemen lost to the Huskies, Boeheim circled the
building's corridors in search of an exit, prompting him to mutter
to the writers: ``I never wanted to come into this place and now I
can't find my way out.'' Auburn is still unbeaten and off to its
best start in 30 seasons but the Tigers have yet to play a quality
oppoonent . . . Things are tough at Iona, which is 4-7 after losing
two game in the Holiday Festival. After a loss to Georgia Tech
Sunday, some Gael fans started a ``We want Tim Welsh'' chant,
begging the former Gael coach to return.

<P>
   Twenty years! One thousand forty Sundays. Not quite 1,040 Sunday
columns but a lot more than 1,040 cars. And a whole lot of Saturday
efforts, too. Not bad for a temporary assignment _ ``Try it for a
while and see how it works out'' is about how I remember the
authorizing words of then Sunday editor Tim Leland passing along
the decision of then Globe editor Tom Winship. Transportation
editor Abe Plotkin, who for years had written the centerpiece of
the Sunday Automotive section, was retiring, to be succeeded at the
typewriter by the middle-aged guy who edited the section.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years have flashed by as the temporary assignment gelled
into a career, hardened into the persona that is the Globe's auto
columnist. Twenty damn good years.
</P>
<P>
   There have been astounding changes in that two decades. The
technology of the automobile has changed radically, the players in
the world automotive game have changed just as dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, cars were basically rear-drive, big, made of steel,
and propelled by carbureted engines. Tires were bias ply, fuel
mileage was between 12 and 14 miles per gallon average, breaker
points were still the heart of most distributors _ and who ever
heard of a microprocessor under the hood?
</P>
<P>
   Today, cars are smaller, mostly front drive, contain a lot of
plastic parts and pieces, and the engines are fuel injected _
carburetors have gone the way of the buggy whip. Today, tires are
radial construction, fuel mileage is around 27 m.p.g., distributors
are passe _ what's a breaker point? _ and motors are micromanaged
by microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Chrysler Corp. was dying, American Motors was fading,
General Motors still dominated the market and was about to change
to front-drive cars on a wholesale basis, while Ford was resisting
front drive. The Volkswagen Beetle was the best-selling car of all
time and still going, but the Japanese were a growing market force.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Chrysler has survived, suffered another near-death
experience; AMC collapsed into the corporate bosom of Renault,
which regurgitated the remnants to Chrysler _ which is now merged
into DaimlerChrysler after having reinvented the car business by
inventing the front-drive minivan. General Motors cars are
virtually all front-drive, and the General has spawned a new
division, Saturn, while losing about half its market share. Ford is
the king of the hill, and the Japanese are still a force to be
reckoned with, but the Koreans are the price leaders. The old
Beetle is long gone, and a new Beetle is the darling of the youth
market.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, construction workers and farmers owned trucks, and a
sport/utility was a Jeep _ the sport/utility moniker hadn't been
invented yet.
</P>
<P>
   Today everybody owns a truck or a truck-based sport/utility _ or
so it seems.
</P>
<P>
   One thing remains the same: Back then, the electric car was
``just around the corner.'' Today, the electric car is ``just
around the corner'' _ and the corner is still moving.
</P>
<P>
   One thing changed that I had expected to remain constant: Volvo
still makes cars as solid as a brick but has ceased making cars
that look like a brick. It was enough of a shock for most Volvo
owners when that conservative Swedish automaker began making
front-drive automobiles _ and then all-wheel-drive automobiles. But
even with the new drivetrains and even with a certain softening
around the edges, the Volvos were still bricks. Rectangular,
angular, righteously angular in a world of jelly-bean cars.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the new S80 isn't a jelly bean, but it's no brick. There
it sat in the driveway, the only recognizably Volvo attribute its
distinctive grille with the diagonal slash proclaiming it a Volvo _
while the rest of the car sat there in rebuke, veritably screaming
out: ``The grille is lying.''
</P>
<P>
   It is stylish, this S80 sedan, graceful, un-Volvolike . . . but
wait. Once there was a stylish Volvo, the P1800, a gorgeous car
that came as notchback or squareback, a beautiful, graceful alien
automobile set down in a land of square, bechromed behemoths some
three decades _ or was it three aeons _ ago. Then, Volvo couldn't
give them away, forced reluctant employees to take them as company
cars. Now, they are collector cars, sought after, treasured _ but I
digress.
</P>
<P>
   The S80 is a beautiful car in the eyes of this beholder. It is
also a technical achievement; Volvo, which has been talking safety
for so long some people think Volvo invented it, has taken the S80
a step ahead in injury protection. The Volvo WHIP system turns a
passive headrest into an active preventer of whiplash injury for
front passengers in an S80, and the side curtain that deploys in a
collision is aboard to prevent head injury _ plus the usual front
air bags, antilock brakes, and traction control, a full package in
a front-drive car.
</P>
<P>
   The good looks compromise no interior room on the S80; the rear
seat offers plenty of legroom and lots of headroom, even with a
sunroof. Interior storage is a mixed bag. The glove box is nothing
to brag about, and the door bins aren't all that large _ but there
are four of them. A large covered bin between the front seats
offers two-stage storage, a top level suitable for envelopes, and a
deeper compartment that contains a coin holder and offers useful
room for larger objects _ a camera, for example. Seatback pockets
round out the storage package. The trunk is cavernous, although the
opening to the storage cave is a bit on the shallow side.
</P>
<P>
   Controls are generally neat, convenient, suitable for gloved
hands, but occasionally dip into needless complexity. Large buttons
on the radio, for example, testify to convenience, but one is
marked ``source'' and selects tape, CD, AM, or FM _ one twiddles
until one arrives where one wants to be. Heat/AC, on the other
hand, is a model of convenience and the dual controls do offer dual
zones and consistent temperatures. Radio controls are duplicated in
part on the steering wheel, and the cruise control is located
there, too.
</P>
<P>
   The tested model S80 is the base model, with normally aspirated
201-horserpower, 24-valve, 2.92-liter, 6-cylinder engine mated with
a 4-speed, automatic overdrive. A 268-h.p., tubocharged, 2.78-liter
engine is also available, but after driving the base engine, I'm
convinced you don't really need it (although I'm equally certain
it's even more fun to drive). The tested, normally aspirated combo
offered plenty of passing punch, very good acceleration; it is a
quiet, smooth mill that is very responsive, very satisfying. The
handling is typical modern Volvo, which is to say, precise, quick,
downright fun to drive. The ride is firm, the suspension soaked up
the washboard dirt roads very nicely. And the traction control came
into play now and then on ice and a wild evening of snow in the
north country.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel mileage is pretty good, too; over 945 miles charted, the
S80 delivered 22.8 miles per gallon. Price? That's the bad news;
this is a luxury sedan, base price $35,820 very well equipped, plus
$575 delivery. The tested model had a few options _ $450 cold
weather package (heated seats, headlight wiper/washer), $1,200
sunroof, and $1,595 worth of leather upholstery. The twin turbo
(T-6) S80 is $40,385 plus delivery. That's another big change in 20
years; somehow I find it hard to view $40,000 for this sort of car
as outrageous. The money's changed, actually; the dollar has fallen
in value vs. the commodities it prices.
</P>
<P>
   More changes are coming; Ford, owner and savior of Jaguar, is
courting Volvo. The other Swedish car maker, Saab, is already 50
percent owned by GM.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long bumpy road, these past 20 years _ and I
wouldn't want to have missed a single bump. Happy New Year. Bring
on the bumps!

ONCE MORE, INTO THAT GRUNGY TUB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 03, 1999)   By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I saw in your column recently a formula to use to clean a
tub, which you said works wonders. Wouldn't you know it, I mislaid
the column and have to ask what that formula is.
</P>
<P>
   ANNA PETRILLO, Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. That is the story of the handyman's life, it seems, but here
it is, and I know it works because I used it years ago to clean a
``hopeless'' tub, and it has been pristine ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Wet the surface with hydrogen peroxide, then sprinkle a lot of
cream of tartar (a baking product, sold in supermarkets) on the wet
surface. Let it be for an hour or so, then scrub and rinse. This
will not restore the shine to the porcelain enamel; nothing will,
but the tub will be clean and bright.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm looking for inside storm windows made of glass. I do not
want acrylic or any other kind of plastic. Where can I get them?
</P>
<P>
   SHEILA CHERKAS, Chelsea, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are two outfits that I know of: Panel Air Corp. in
Brockton, Mass. (781-588-8900); and Innerglass of Simsbury, Conn.
(800-743-6207, 860-651-3951).
</P>
<P>
   Your preference for glass is well understood. In my opinion,
plastic does not stand up well either in place on the inside of a
window or in storage; it can scratch, discolor, and get foggy, and
does not clean well. Glass will stand up to anything except a hard
blow, will virtually never scratch, and will look sparkling and new
every time it is washed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Recently Debbie Onie of Brookline, Mass. called to ask about a
sporadic leak that was plaguing her condo; water was leaking from a
shower stall from a unit above her, but it happened only four or so
times a year.
</P>
<P>
   We replied that it could be a leaking shower pan, a leaking
drain, or something ``mysterious.'' The infrequency of the leak was
the confusing part of it all.
</P>
<P>
   M.A.G. of Littleton, Mass. called to tell us of her problem,
which was similar to Debbie's and equally sporadic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plumber put a block of wood 2 x 4 under the drain pipe
when he installed the shower pan to try to support it so it would
not move when when the shower was being used. As a result, the
shower pan moved but the drain did not, causing the leak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We broke through the ceiling, kicked out the 2 x 4, and it
never leaked again.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, M.A.G. Your solution is another one in the great and
mysterious realm of plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am covering the screens in my back porch with plywood for
the winter. Can I store wicker on the porch all winter long?
</P>
<P>
   ARTHUR, Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You sure can. The only place wicker should not be used or
stored is outdoors. It is porch furniture, not lawn furniture, and
should not be exposed to rain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have some old furniture that I want to clean up but not
restore or refinish. How can I clean it? Do you have any formulas
for cleaning and polishing? One of the pieces is an old wagon, with
big wheels with wooden spokes, designed to carry luggage at train
stations.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN MAY, Boxford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If some of the furniture is antique (that wagon sounds like
one, or at least a collectible), then they should not be refinished
or ``restored.'' Such treatment may reduce their value.
</P>
<P>
   To clean these items (varnished, shellacked, lacquered, stained,
painted, or left bare), wipe with a cloth wet with paint thinner.
Apply the paint thinner, let it sit on the finish for 30 seconds,
wipe moderately, then dry with a dry cloth.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of formulas for cleaning and polishing. Again
with antiques, be wary of applying anything but a cleaning agent
such as paint thinner. Is the handyman hipped on this subject?
Perhaps, but if I don't issue the warning, the antiques people will
get on me lik ugly on an ape.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the formulas: A polish: 1 1/3 pints olive oil,
2/3 pint alcohol, 1 teaspoon vinegar. Best results from more
rubbing with less polish.
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon turpentine, 3 tablespoons boiled linseed oil, 1
guart hot water. Keep hot in double boiler and rub with cloth wet
with solution; polish with dry cloth.
</P>
<P>
   4 oz. paint thinner, 4 oz. vinegar, 1 oz. alcohol, 4 oz. boiled
linseed oil. Apply with fine steel wool.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am building a house in Maine. A builder told me that OSB is
good for sheathing. Is it?
</P>
<P>
   MIKE DiGREGORIO, Wilmington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. OSB (oriented strand board) is good for sheathing, far better
than particleboard, which in my opinion shoud not be used for
sheathing anywhere. OSB has a rating very close to plywood of the
same the thickness, and has been used successfully in prefab
houses. Use 1/2-inch for walls, and 5/8-inch for roofs. For floors,
I suggest using plywood, whether you put down one layer or two.
</P>

REAL ESTATE IS GOOD, BUT CHECK OUT MUTUAL FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 03, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am wondering whether my rented real estate is a good
investment for me. It is a two- family building which is taken care
of by property managers, and I am comfortable with the risks
involved -- possibilities of bad tenants, vacancies, and so forth.
It is in a good location and it is worth about $255,000 now. My
current cash flow from the property is $660 a month. If I keep the
property, I expect to see increases in both the rent and property
value, perhaps in the 1 percent to 5 percent annual range. I do not
pay taxes in the income from the property, because of depreciation.
The outstanding mortgage on the property is $113,000. I don't
expect much of a tax bite if I sell the property either now or
later. Is this a sound investment, or should I sell it and invest
in a mutual fund portfolio, from which I would expect annual
returns in the area of 7 1/5 percent after taxes?
</P>
<P>
   H.S., Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The way I'd approach the problem is this way: First add
together the expected annual income stream from the rental
property, plus the increase in your equity in the property which
you would achieve by making your mortgage payments. My guess is
that the resulting figure would be in the area of $15,000 -- $7,920
from rental income and the balance representing your increase in
equity. As you noted, that's far from a certainty; vacancies or
unexpected maintenance resulting from problem tenants could reduce
that figure, perhaps significantly. But on the other hand, if you
don't encounter those problems, you can expect the annual benefit
of owning the property to increase, through rental increases,
increases in the property value, and through a larger percentage of
your mortgage payments going against the principal in future years.
</P>
<P>
   Next let's consider the mutual fund alternative. If you were to
sell at this point, you would realize about $142,000. Depending on
your tax bracket, you would need to achieve pretax returns in the
area of 10 percent to 12 percent (and probably more) to deliver an
after-tax income stream of $10,650, representing your 7.5 percent
after-tax target. If you confine your view of mutual fund investing
to the last two or three years, that may seem like an easy target.
But we have been in a quite vigorous bull market, and you can't
expect the bully fund returns of the past three years (16.87
percent for the average domestic stock fund, according to
Morningstar Mutual Funds) to continue. In fact, you should expect
nothing much in excess of 10 percent average annual returns from a
stock fund portfolio, and that only over the long haul. In the
short haul, it seems to me reasonable to expect the returns of
funds to dip significantly, adjusting some of the excesses of the
recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if what you're looking for is an income stream, you
probably shouldn't be in stock funds in the first place. The yields
of stock funds are only token at this point, and if you combined a
$660 monthly sequence of withdrawals from a fund portfolio with
three or four years of poor market performance, you would see some
fairly significant depletion of your capital.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it seems to me that you understand the plusses and
minuses of real estate investment, and that your current situation
puts you in a better long-term position than you should
realistically expect from a mutual fund portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are in our mid-thirties and like many other
couples we did not begin thinking about retirement until recently.
At this point, we have $33,000 invested in IRAs, with $18,000 in
Fidelity Dividend Growth, $9,000 in Fidelity Equity Income II,
$3,000 in Janus Blue Chip Growth, and $3,000 in Janus fund. We
would like to retire in 20 years with at least $500,000 saved.
Would you diversify, and if so, how? How much should we save each
year to attain our goal?
</P>
<P>
   E.D., Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The answer you want is $4,652, or $387.73 a month. That
presumes you achieve average annual portfolio growth of 10 percent
over the 20 year period.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it also assumes that there is no inflation. So if the
question you meant to ask was how much would you need to save if
you wanted to have the equivalent of $500,000 in today's money at
the time you retire, the unfortunate answer is -- you probably
should double it.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation runs at 3 percent, you would need $903,055 in the
year 2019 to buy the same goods and services that $500,000 buys
today; if inflation were 4 percent, the unhappy figure would swell
to $1,095,561. At the 3.5 percent midpoint, the number comes out at
$994,894, which is where I got my suggestion of doubling that
$387-a-month figure.
</P>
<P>
   The attractive thing about the first answer is that you would be
able to achieve savings at the $387 monthly level entirely within
the limit of IRAs -- preferably Roth IRAs. But if you're going try
to go significantly beyond that level, you'll bump into the
$2,000-a-year- per-person maximum for IRAs, and you will have to
cast about for additional tax-deferred savings vehicles. The first
place is to look is with to your employers, who may have 401(k)
plans or similar tax-deferred savings vehicles. If such are not
available, ask for literature from the fund families that you are
now using about their variable annuity plans; these are retirement
savings vehicles that operate largely as mutual funds, but which
also carry a small element of insurance. The effect of the
insurance is two-fold -- it tends to cut the returns from these
investments by about 1/2 of 1 percent when compared to similar
mutual fund accounts, and second, the insurance is adequate to
allow the accounts to build on a tax-deferred basis. From my point
of view, the small reduction in investment performance is more than
worth the tax deferral. When you withdraw money in retirement, the
portion of the investment which represents portfolio growth will be
taxable, much as a withdrawal of funds from an IRA is; the amount
of the withdrawal representing your initial investment is not
taxable.
</P>
<P>
   As for your portfolio -- yes, I think it needs some work.
Although you are using four different funds, since all of them
concentrate their portfolios upon large-cap stocks, you haven't
achieved any significant level of diversification. I think over
time that what you'll see is that the four funds will tend to move
more or less in lockstep, reflecting the fact that they are all
drawing upon the same market sector for their investments.
</P>
<P>
   What you need is to move beyond the large-cap stocks entirely.
Yes, they've been golden in the past few years, but eventually the
other sectors will have their day, and while you want to retain
dominant positions in the large cap, you need exposure to other
parts of the market as well.
</P>
<P>
   You could treat any one or two of the funds you're now using as
your core holdings, but they should be limited to 50 percent or 60
percent of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be to hold 50 percent of your retirement
savings in the core holdings, and then add positions representing
12 1/2 percent of then portfolio in these four sectors: mid-cap
stocks, small-cap stocks, international stocks, and a health care
sector fund. Staying within the fund families you are now using, my
choices would be Fidelity Mid-Cap Value, Janus Venture (a small-cap
fund), T. Rowe Price International Stock, and Fidelity Select

<P>
   A. I guess the first column of the new year is a good time to go
back over some of the basics, which seem to frustrate a number of
correspondents from time to time. The only advice I supply is that
which appears in the newspaper. I do not supply individual advice
to individuals who do not want their letters published, nor do I
supply answers to people whose letters are not selected for
publication. (Yes, it's fun, but it's also a lot of work.) In
addition, since I am a journalist and not a financial advisor, I
cannot advise individuals on a fee basis. Finally, I recognize the
frustration of many of my correspondents whose questions do not
appear in the paper; the number of letters received is many times
the number which can be answered in the paper. I seek to select
questions that are representative of many correspondents, although
sometimes questions which are simply too intriguing to bypass are
selected as well.

1998 IPOS: OFF TO A GOOD START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of them as a very small graduating class that turned out
to do suprisingly well in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about Massachusetts companies that took the plunge
and went public in 1998. There were only 19 local initial public
stock offerings, in line with the previous year's meager production
and far behind the IPO glory days of 1995-1996.
</P>
<P>
   But most of them made money for investors and only one turned
out to be a disaster. Technology companies and small banks
dominated the list, which also included a home electronics
retailer, a brokerage, consultants and a dental practice management
company.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an easy year for small stocks to gain much ground.
Most of them were hammered over the summer and only began to stage
a comeback in October.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern virtually killed the IPO market through the summer
and into the fall. Nationwide, IPOs only started reappearing in the
last months of 1998, when Internet stocks soared and sparked a
demand for any investment connected to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks like Earthweb and theglobe.com just revitalized the
market,'' said David Menlow, editor of the IPO Financial Reporter,
which tracks new offerings.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one, small Massachusetts IPO that tried to take
advantage of the Internet stock mania, with modest success. A $13
million IPO by Artifical Life Inc. of Cambridge, a small Internet
software company, hit the market in December with an offering price
of 8 1/2, soared to 23 1/2 in its first day of trading and has
since settled back to 13 3/4. That still represents a gain of 59.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   That was hardly the experience of the state's most successful
IPO of 1998. Mercury Computer Systems Inc. hit the market with a
weak start in January, to eventually become the state's most
successful IPO of 1998. But Mercury, which makes high-performance
computer systems, suffered its ups and downs along the way, like
most other small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury shares, which hit a record high of 28 1/8 Thursday,
gained 167.9 percent for the year. Exchange Applications Inc. of
Boston, which makes software to analyze marketing databases, was
second with a gain of 78.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tweeter Home Entertainment Group Inc. of Canton, the audio and
video retailer, was the best-performing, non-technology stock. It
advanced 69.1 percent during 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the smaller banks that went public during the year saw
their stocks appreciate within a narrow band, from the teens to low
20 percent range.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury may have ended 1998 with the best performance of the
group, but the IPO nearly failed to get off the ground in January.
</P>
<P>
   A weak market for new issues at the time lowered the offering
price for Mercury shares below its estimated range of $11 to $13
per share. Underwriters made an offer of $10.50 and Mercury's board
thought it over hard before accepting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very bad month,'' recalled chief executive Jay
Bertelli. ``We had put so much energy into (the offering) we
decided that even though we may be leaving some money on the table,
it wasn't worth going back and doing this again some months
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercury was no young startup burning through cash. The company
had been operating for 15 years and turned profits through its last
eight.
</P>
<P>
   Executives had decided to go public to give Mercury a higher
profile and to create a stock-swap option if it decided to buy
other, smaller companies. They also wanted to give long-time
financial backers, including Memorial Drive Trust and MassMutual
Life Insurance Co., a financial exit strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury specializes in the design of high-performance computer
systems that process digital signals and transform data from
sensors. Its products are being used to upgrade submarine sonar
systems and are being built into some aircraft radar equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury is the rare technology company that still counts on
defense work for the lion's share of its revenue. Defense peaked in
recent years at about 80 percent of revenues, but has been giving
way to medical and other businesses since.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials anticipate medical revenues will grow faster
in the next few years on the strength of new products like digital
X-ray equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli thinks Mercury will have a strong second act for
shareholders in 1999. Besides specific new products, the company is
preparing to market a new generation of existing products in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are bigger, faster and better products at approximately
the same price points. Typically whenever we come out with a new
product line it stimulates more activity for us,'' says Bertelli.
</P>
<P>
   So what does happen to IPOs after they've been public for two
years? The answer, based on Massachusetts companies that went
public in 1997, often isn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1998, nine of 18 companies we tracked were trading
lower than their IPO price, and the other half were valued higher.
But many of the stocks that lost ground were investment horror
stories. Three lost at least 95 percent of their value and eight of
the nine losers were down at least 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the two-year winners from 1997, the big winner was Concord
Communications Inc. of Marlborough, up 305 percent.

SWAGGER GONE, CABLETRON SETS FORTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.H. _ It was once known as a ``wild, wild West
company,'' with unusually aggressive sales tactics that helped it
climb to the top tier of computer-networking companies.
</P>
<P>
   But now the gunslinging swagger is gone from Cabletron Systems
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Net losses in three of the last four quarters, along with a host
of product transition issues, personnel changes, disappointments
internationally, and delays entering new markets, have raised
questions about the number three computer-networking firm's
long-term future as an independent company.
</P>
<P>
   Cabletron's two biggest rivals, Cisco Systems Inc. and Nortel's
Bay Networks unit, are seeking to provide corporate customers with
one-stop shopping for all their voice- and data-networking needs.
Cabletron has taken a narrower approach, with a product line
focused heavily on the data side.
</P>
<P>
   The narrower focus raises questions about whether the company,
based in Rochester, N.H., will be swept up in consolidation of the
computer-networking industry, and become part of a bigger, broader
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networking industry is going through a sea change, a rapid
transformation, and Cabletron could be an attractive candidate to a
major player,'' said William R. Becklean, managing director at the
securities firm of Tucker Anthony Co., who predicts that Cabletron
will be snapped up within five years.
</P>
<P>
   With a reputation for well-designed, well-built products and
fierce customer loyalty, Cabletron has long been seen as a
``Mercedes-Benz of the computer-networking business,'' said
Becklean.
</P>
<P>
   But even that reputation may not protect it from takeover, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with $400 million in cash, no debt, and a stock price in
the $8 range _ down sharply from $24 a share 13 months ago _
Cabletron could be an especially tempting takeover target. It
closed at 8 3/8 Thursday, down 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   But Craig Benson, the company's cofounder and chief executive,
maintains that the 15-year-old firm is not for sale. Benson insists
that recent problems in moving from an old to a new product line
are behind the company now and that Cabletron will rebound this
year.
</P>
<P>
   He also points to a major new contract to supply Compaq Computer
Corp. with computer-networking products. Last year, Cabletron
acquired Digital Equipment Corp.'s networking business, with
expectations that Digital would purchase a sizable portion of the
networking unit's output.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after the deal was signed, however, Compaq acquired
Digital, and the division's sales slowed to a trickle. Cabletron's
Compaq deal, Benson maintains, holds more promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked through the hard parts of turning the company
around in the past 2 1/2 years,'' says Benson. ``I think Wall
Street senses that we can succeed and be different from our
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   His optimism is based, in part, on the firm's recent acquisition
of Yago Systems Inc., a small Sunnyvale, Calif., developer of
high-speed switching equipment for computer networks. Yago products
are the cornerstone of Cabletron's attempted comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Cabletron also is banking on a payoff from its acquisition of
NetVantage, a developer of low-cost switches for small-firm
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can provide customers more fully developed high-speed
switching systems than our competitors,'' said Plyush Patel, Yago
cofounder and senior vice president of Cabletron's West Coast
division, which employs 100 members of the company's 6,200-person
work force.
</P>
<P>
   With Patel, Benson has brought in new management in the past
year to improve marketing and sales. Cabletron also has spent $40
million for internal computer and software systems, as well as
staffing to handle the company's far-flung operations.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes are the legacy of Donald Reed, the former NYNEX
Corp. executive whom Benson recruited to Cabletron with much
fanfare in August 1997. Reed joined as Cabletron president and
chief executive, with the goal of moving the company in a new
direction, selling products to phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed, whose NYNEX career was mostly in regulatory and public
affairs rather than in technology, had a difficult transition in
the fast-moving world of computer networking. He resigned after
seven months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Reed gave us the systems and strategies that we lacked,''
said Benson, who remained chairman during Reed's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Also gone from Cabletron is its other cofounder, the colorful,
hard-driving Robert Levine, who was the company's chief salesman.
Levine, who was known for his body-building regimen, right-wing
politics, and a survivalist mentality, retired when Reed joined the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Under Benson and Levine, who formed the company in Levine's
Ashland garage, Cabletron had prospered for more than 10 years. It
earned a reputation as a creative computer-networking company that
built a strong relationship with customers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of its aggressive image came from Levine, whose antics
included crashing his tank into a tree and brandishing a hunting
knife at Cabletron sales meetings to pump staffers up about killing
the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say such eccentricities are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we were once known as the `wild, wild West company,' ''
Benson said with a shrug, ``but it's an image that no longer
exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, a more buttoned-down Cabletron is trying to carve out a
more limited role for itself as a provider of data-networking
equipment for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   That's in sharp contrast to Cisco and Bay Networks, which want
to sell to both telephone carriers and corporations a one-stop
communications and networking solution for voice, data, and video.
By offering an array of products and services from a single
supplier, Cisco and Bay Networks hope to retain customers who are
finding the complexities of telecommunications too difficult to
manage on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Cabletron early on bucked the trend of its West Coast
competitors, who bought their way into new markets. Instead, it
stuck to its engineering strength and developed nearly everything
internally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabletron repeatedly failed to look at how markets were
changing and react to them,'' said Glenn Gabriel Ben-Yosef,
president of Clear Thinking Research Inc., a telecom consulting
firm. ``Their competitors changed and adapted much faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitors like Cisco, Bay Networks, and 3Com Corp. spent
heavily to acquire young companies that could develop a new
generation of networking products faster than the big companies
could design them internally.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Cabletron is now far behind in the second tier of
computer-networking companies, with annual revenues that have been
stuck between $1 billion and $1.5 billion for more than three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Benson acknowledged the industry changes, but stressed that
Cabletron will not follow them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there are plenty of opportunities in the
data-networking side, and there are significant numbers of
customers who don't want to get locked into a single supplier,''
said Benson. ``Our challenge is to deliver in 1999 what we have
been preparing for in the past two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street analysts are optimistic about Cabletron's
more focused strategy. ``Cabletron can turn around, but it will
take a lot of time to rebuid the momentum, so right now it is still
too early to call them out,'' says Timothy Luke, telecommunications
analyst for Lehman Bros.

FLAMES FANNED BY FIRING STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ A story about the possible ouster of
Patriots coach Pete Carroll was strategically placed in the media
this week. The story is true. Carroll does face a realistic
possibility of not returning next season, according to sources, if
he loses badly to Jacksonville in Sunday's wild-card game or there
are signs of more chaos and unrest on the team.
</P>
<P>
   While it was evident that Carroll has a great deal of support
among the majority of his players, he may not have it among a few
veterans who have owner Robert Kraft's ear.
</P>
<P>
   Such players have spoken this week in anonymity about a lack of
organization, game plans that don't exploit the players' talents
against the other teams' weaknesses, and the fact that too many
younger players on the roster have not been able to adequately fill
in for injured players.
</P>
<P>
   That last complaint may point more toward Bobby Grier than
Carroll, as it is Grier who has been ``shopping for the groceries''
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Those who speak favorably about the coach talk of his hard work,
motivational skills, and great knowledge of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Others say he's a work in progress who will only get better if
he gets the time and backing of ownership, and that he has had to
deal with many injuries to key players this season.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has not addressed the comments about his future, as he
prepares for a playoff game under some pretty tough conditions: (1)
Both Drew Bledsoe and Terry Glenn are missing from his offense; and
(2) he's coming off the sin of all sins, losing to Bill Parcells
and the Jets in a terrible way.
</P>
<P>
   An upset Kraft went right to the coach's office following the
Jets game, then disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, a report surfaced in the Herald's Inside Track
column saying that Carroll's job was in jeopardy and that there
already was a short list of candidates being considered as a
replacement. Atop that list was Bill Belichick, the Jets' assistant
head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is Parcells's heir apparent in New York _ and that is
in writing. That doesn't mean Kraft couldn't lure him away with a
huge offer, but it seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's hiring would appease some of New England's veteran
defensive players who feel he is the best defensive mind in the
game and someone they respect. But it seems unlikely that Belichick
would leave the Jets and come back to New England, even though he
and Kraft always seemed to get along.
</P>
<P>
   A more realistic candidate is Chris Palmer, the offensive
coordinator of the Jaguars and Drew Bledsoe's former quarterback
coach here. Palmer would be familiar with most of the Patriots'
offensive personnel.
</P>
<P>
   If Kraft does make a change, he would have some serious
perception problems. Many would criticize him for firing a coach
who made the playoffs two years in a row. He would be called by
some a knee-jerk, meddling owner, and that could hurt his chances
of attracting top coaching candidates in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move also would run counter to the philosophy Kraft
espoused when he chose to let Parcells leave. He hired a man with
one year of head coaching experience and asked him to get into the
playoffs and be successful, and to do it by developing younger
players.
</P>
<P>
   Firing Carroll would invite charges of being impatient and
succumbing to the pressure of some fans and media. Kraft may be
accused of firing Carroll only because he couldn't beat Parcells.
While it's true that the Patriots face the Jets twice a year, the
reality is that Parcells won't be coaching forever. In fact,
stories already are surfacing that he would call it quits and let
Belichick take over if the Jets get to the Super Bowl this year.
</P>
<P>
   A firing would invite all of that criticism, in addition to the
heat Kraft already is taking for the Hartford move.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Belichick was hugely unpopular in Cleveland as a
head coach, a big target of fan abuse. He also has a poor track
record of handling the media, which has to be taken into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it makes more sense to think that if Kraft were to
replace Carroll, he would try to get an established, big name coach
like a George Seifert (who wouldn't take the job because he's a
friend of Carroll's).
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Carroll may have to change some of his
coaching staff _ again. One would think that Ernie Zampese would be
allowed to continue to work with the offense so Bledsoe won't have
to adjust to another coordinator. But Carroll may have to look at
some of his positional coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll may indeed save himself Sunday because he has a team
that seems to flourish in times of adversity. There aren't enough
detractors in the locker room to make the team quit on him in a big
game; but there are enough supporters who want him to be the coach
next year and beyond.

VOLS' DEFENSE NEVER RESTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Leave it up to Florida State coach Bobby Bowden
to best describe the job that the University of Tennessee's defense
has done this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like . . . cockroaches,'' said Bowden at Thursday's
Fiesta Bowl media day, an event which brought preparations for
Monday's national championship game betwen the No. 1 ranked
Volunteers and No. 2 Seminoles into its final stages. ``They don't
eat things. But they sure do mess things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mess things up? Indeed they do. Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer says
his defensive unit, like the rest of the team, is a blue collar
unit, one devoid of big egos and big stars for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Tennessee defense that came up with big plays in the
Vols' 220-17 overtime win over Florida in September, a victory that
jump started the Vols towards the SEC East title and subsuequently
to the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Tennessee defense which completely shut down Georgia
when it looked like the Dawgs' were growling about being a player
in the SEC East race.
</P>
<P>
   All of this came as surprise to lots of people outside the
Tennessee family.
</P>
<P>
   Who could blame them when you looked at a defensive line in
which three players, Shaun Ellis, Billy Ratliff and Ron Green, all
who were coming off career-threatening injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Or when you saw a secondary that had to replace three starters
from last year's team.
</P>
<P>
   Or when the leader of the defense was a linebacker, Al Wilson,
who didn't know from play to play, much less game to game if he
could perform at anything close to the All America level he had
shown in previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
   And who could blame those skeptics since a recurring shoulder
injury has forced the 6-0, 226 pound senior linebacker to miss
three games this season and come in and out of most of the other
games he has played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody on the team has respect for him because he plays the
game the way it should be played,'' said linebacker Eric
Westmoreland, part of a linebacking corp that has gotten
progressively better since the opening game of the season, a 34-33
shootout victory over Syracuse, including not allowing a touchdown
in the last two games. ``When he comes on the field everyone knows
he's on the field. He's so intense. And that brings out the
inteneseness on the whole defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson says he likes the fact that the Vols, despite being
unbeaten and ranked No. 1 are underdogs to Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been underdogs all year,'' he says. ``That's kind of the
motto for this team. Tennessee's not going to get the job done;
they're not a good football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one more challenge to us, to prove to everybody that
we can be one of the elite teams in college football.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is not afraid to take a role that is somewhere between
captain and coach. ``My personsality is to be a leader and at the
same time the leadershp role was given to me (captain),'' he said.
``I try to set an example for the young guys down the road, when
it's their turn to be leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who was an amateur boxer growing up in Jackson,
Mississippi, says that his boxing career forged his personality.
``I think the aggressiveness was there,'' he said, ``but boxing
really brought it out a little more. Being in teh ring and being
able to fight really helped out a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson knew coming into the season the Vols would have to fill
some holes, pick up the pace on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Now he and the Vols are one game away from a goal that was only
a dream back in August and a dream that even the Vols didn't think
was really possible of being fulfilled.

<P>
   Twenty years! One thousand forty Sundays. Not quite 1,040 Sunday
columns but a lot more than 1,040 cars. And a whole lot of Saturday
efforts, too. Not bad for a temporary assignment _ ``Try it for a
while and see how it works out'' is about how I remember the
authorizing words of then Sunday editor Tim Leland passing along
the decision of then Globe editor Tom Winship. Transportation
editor Abe Plotkin, who for years had written the centerpiece of
the Sunday Automotive section, was retiring, to be succeeded at the
typewriter by the middle-aged guy who edited the section.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years have flashed by as the temporary assignment gelled
into a career, hardened into the persona that is the Globe's auto
columnist. Twenty damn good years.
</P>
<P>
   There have been astounding changes in that two decades. The
technology of the automobile has changed radically, the players in
the world automotive game have changed just as dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, cars were basically rear-drive, big, made of steel,
and propelled by carbureted engines. Tires were bias ply, fuel
mileage was between 12 and 14 miles per gallon average, breaker
points were still the heart of most distributors _ and who ever
heard of a microprocessor under the hood?
</P>
<P>
   Today, cars are smaller, mostly front drive, contain a lot of
plastic parts and pieces, and the engines are fuel injected _
carburetors have gone the way of the buggy whip. Today, tires are
radial construction, fuel mileage is around 27 m.p.g., distributors
are passe _ what's a breaker point? _ and motors are micromanaged
by microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Chrysler Corp. was dying, American Motors was fading,
General Motors still dominated the market and was about to change
to front-drive cars on a wholesale basis, while Ford was resisting
front drive. The Volkswagen Beetle was the best-selling car of all
time and still going, but the Japanese were a growing market force.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Chrysler has survived, suffered another near-death
experience; AMC collapsed into the corporate bosom of Renault,
which regurgitated the remnants to Chrysler _ which is now merged
into DaimlerChrysler after having reinvented the car business by
inventing the front-drive minivan. General Motors cars are
virtually all front-drive, and the General has spawned a new
division, Saturn, while losing about half its market share. Ford is
the king of the hill, and the Japanese are still a force to be
reckoned with, but the Koreans are the price leaders. The old
Beetle is long gone, and a new Beetle is the darling of the youth
market.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, construction workers and farmers owned trucks, and a
sport/utility was a Jeep _ the sport/utility moniker hadn't been
invented yet.
</P>
<P>
   Today everybody owns a truck or a truck-based sport/utility _ or
so it seems.
</P>
<P>
   One thing remains the same: Back then, the electric car was
``just around the corner.'' Today, the electric car is ``just
around the corner'' _ and the corner is still moving.
</P>
<P>
   One thing changed that I had expected to remain constant: Volvo
still makes cars as solid as a brick but has ceased making cars
that look like a brick. It was enough of a shock for most Volvo
owners when that conservative Swedish automaker began making
front-drive automobiles _ and then all-wheel-drive automobiles. But
even with the new drivetrains and even with a certain softening
around the edges, the Volvos were still bricks. Rectangular,
angular, righteously angular in a world of jelly-bean cars.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the new S80 isn't a jelly bean, but it's no brick. There
it sat in the driveway, the only recognizably Volvo attribute its
distinctive grille with the diagonal slash proclaiming it a Volvo _
while the rest of the car sat there in rebuke, veritably screaming
out: ``The grille is lying.''
</P>
<P>
   It is stylish, this S80 sedan, graceful, un-Volvolike . . . but
wait. Once there was a stylish Volvo, the P1800, a gorgeous car
that came as notchback or squareback, a beautiful, graceful alien
automobile set down in a land of square, bechromed behemoths some
three decades _ or was it three aeons _ ago. Then, Volvo couldn't
give them away, forced reluctant employees to take them as company
cars. Now, they are collector cars, sought after, treasured _ but I
digress.
</P>
<P>
   The S80 is a beautiful car in the eyes of this beholder. It is
also a technical achievement; Volvo, which has been talking safety
for so long some people think Volvo invented it, has taken the S80
a step ahead in injury protection. The Volvo WHIP system turns a
passive headrest into an active preventer of whiplash injury for
front passengers in an S80, and the side curtain that deploys in a
collision is aboard to prevent head injury _ plus the usual front
air bags, antilock brakes, and traction control, a full package in
a front-drive car.
</P>
<P>
   The good looks compromise no interior room on the S80; the rear
seat offers plenty of legroom and lots of headroom, even with a
sunroof. Interior storage is a mixed bag. The glove box is nothing
to brag about, and the door bins aren't all that large _ but there
are four of them. A large covered bin between the front seats
offers two-stage storage, a top level suitable for envelopes, and a
deeper compartment that contains a coin holder and offers useful
room for larger objects _ a camera, for example. Seatback pockets
round out the storage package. The trunk is cavernous, although the
opening to the storage cave is a bit on the shallow side.
</P>
<P>
   Controls are generally neat, convenient, suitable for gloved
hands, but occasionally dip into needless complexity. Large buttons
on the radio, for example, testify to convenience, but one is
marked ``source'' and selects tape, CD, AM, or FM _ one twiddles
until one arrives where one wants to be. Heat/AC, on the other
hand, is a model of convenience and the dual controls do offer dual
zones and consistent temperatures. Radio controls are duplicated in
part on the steering wheel, and the cruise control is located
there, too.
</P>
<P>
   The tested model S80 is the base model, with normally aspirated
201-horserpower, 24-valve, 2.92-liter, 6-cylinder engine mated with
a 4-speed, automatic overdrive. A 268-h.p., tubocharged, 2.78-liter
engine is also available, but after driving the base engine, I'm
convinced you don't really need it (although I'm equally certain
it's even more fun to drive). The tested, normally aspirated combo
offered plenty of passing punch, very good acceleration; it is a
quiet, smooth mill that is very responsive, very satisfying. The
handling is typical modern Volvo, which is to say, precise, quick,
downright fun to drive. The ride is firm, the suspension soaked up
the washboard dirt roads very nicely. And the traction control came
into play now and then on ice and a wild evening of snow in the
north country.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel mileage is pretty good, too; over 945 miles charted, the
S80 delivered 22.8 miles per gallon. Price? That's the bad news;
this is a luxury sedan, base price $35,820 very well equipped, plus
$575 delivery. The tested model had a few options _ $450 cold
weather package (heated seats, headlight wiper/washer), $1,200
sunroof, and $1,595 worth of leather upholstery. The twin turbo
(T-6) S80 is $40,385 plus delivery. That's another big change in 20
years; somehow I find it hard to view $40,000 for this sort of car
as outrageous. The money's changed, actually; the dollar has fallen
in value vs. the commodities it prices.
</P>
<P>
   More changes are coming; Ford, owner and savior of Jaguar, is
courting Volvo. The other Swedish car maker, Saab, is already 50
percent owned by GM.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long bumpy road, these past 20 years _ and I
wouldn't want to have missed a single bump. Happy New Year. Bring
on the bumps!

ROLLER DERBY GETS NEW WHEELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the day, before professional football, basketball,
baseball, and hockey dominated televised sports, there was Roller
Derby, one of those loosely defined activities that blended
entertainment with athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   It started in 1935, and exploded in the '40s, becoming the
highest-rated programming on television in 1950. By 1963, Roller
Derby was shown on more than 100 stations across the country, and
in San Francisco, the Bay Area Bombers were second only to the San
Francisco Giants at the box office. Seven years later, with stars
nicknamed Toughie and Thumper, Roller Derby attracted a record
crowd of 19,500 at Madison Square Garden; later that summer, that
was broken when more than 28,000 fans came to the Oakland Coliseum.
By then, 15 million viewers were tuning in every week to watch what
amounted to pro wrestling on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   It was fun, often scripted, and filled with the bluster now
considered normal in professional sports. The attendance figures
and ratings numbers don't sound like much compared with today's
standards, but Roller Derby earned a solid place in sports lore.
People such as Joanie Weston, The Blonde Amazon, and Ralph
Valladeres, the Guatemalan speedster, made the game personable,
much the way Hulk Hogan and Jesse Ventura did for pro wrestling.
But Roller Derby ended in 1973, a lack of money and dwindling fan
interest prompting founder Leo Seltzer to pull the plug.
</P>
<P>
   But it's back now, armed with a multimillion-dollar cable
television contract with The Nashville Network. The debut is set
for Jan. 15. The game will basically be the same, just faster, with
in-line skates replacing the old four-wheelers. Seltzer's son Jerry
is commissioner of the newly named RollerJam, and he is ecstatic
about the return of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be able to survive just with nostalgia,''
Seltzer said. ``We just want a small piece of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Roller Derby is clearly alternative sports programming but has
the potential to capture X Games fans, largely because the athletes
understand the value of braggadoccio and buffed bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bone-jarring, in-your-face, muscle-in-motion excitement,''
reads a RollerJam news release. ``Where winning is survival.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   The league will have six teams. Eighty men and women (Roller
Derby was the first equal opportunity sport) trained for six months
down in Florida, eight hours a day, and learned about whips, jams,
and blocks. The object is for a ``jammer'' to lap the four-person
pack. Basically, everything is legal, including elbows to the head,
hair-pulling, and all-out assault. Violence, well, let's just say
it looks damn real.
</P>
<P>
   Several American Gladiators are in the mix, as well as former
dancer sometimes employed by Madonna. Sean Atkinson, a.k.a. Atk
Attack and a former Golden Gloves light heavyweight champion, will
skate for the California Quakes. Executive producer Stephen Land
told Sports Illustrated that Atkinson was ``frighteningly
violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Pasi Schalin, who once played for the NHL's Edmonton Oilers,
will skate for the Florida Sundogs. His wife, Susanne, is also on
the team. She is a model. Another Sundog, David Gletty, a.k.a.
Gator, is a tree surgeon, mountain climber, and alligator wrestler.
The New York Enforcers have Tim Washington, a.k.a. Titan, a cousin
of Marvin Hagler. Teammate Brain Gamble holds two black belts, and
Jannet Abraham is one of the female stars. She is an ordained
minister, thus her nickname, ``Minister of Pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer said the uninitiated will be a little confused because
Roller Derby doesn't have a ball or a puck to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams can score and be scored upon at the same time,''
Seltzer said. ``It resembles a mad scramble.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's a good thing in today's age of sports entertainment.

`BEST OF TIMES . . . WORST OF TIMES' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 03, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This final, fearful, look-over-the-shoulder at the kind of year
1998 amounted to is persuasive proof that Charles Dickens is still
always right (``best of times . . . worst of times''), that
unprecedented prosperity in economic terms can coincide with
predictable mendacity and persistent personal immorality, and that
John Donne also hit the proverbial nail on the figurative head:
``No man is an island . . . every man's death diminishes me.''
</P>
<P>
   That goes for every man's and woman's hunger, despair,
homelessness, and uninsured childhood illness, if I may extrapolate
on behalf of Brother Donne. Lamentations on behalf of the departed,
and sonorous bromides upon the inevitabilities of life and death
abound this time of year, and I will do my part. But it's
ever-more-difficult to remain unconvinced that it is human nature
to turn a tin ear to the bleats of the impoverished. There is a
media-magnified surfeit of heartstring-tugging photos, direct
mailers, TV spots, and Net gigabytes in honor of the poor, the
downtrodden, the left-behind.
</P>
<P>
   So I'll try something different this year: My glance back at '98
will come through a cursory review of the lives, and inevitable
deaths, of some of the luckiest folk on earth: i.e., those that
went to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   The January-February issue of Harvard magazine fell my way, and
it was more than morbid curiosity that took me through the graceful
and understated obituaries edited by Deborah Smullyan '72,
identified as are all members of their
Harvard-Radcliffe-graduate-school cohort by year of graduation.
</P>
<P>
   From Donald Chisholm Hagar '22, the deceased president of Rapid
Service Press of Boston, to Edward Teed Wilcox '49, a longtime
Harvard administrator who'd been shot down from his B-24 in 1944
and smuggled US prisoners out of Germany through Switzerland to
France, Smullyan summarizes in one pithy paragraph what one can
summarize out of a person's life.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard obits recount the successes of individuals who were,
mostly, smart and lucky, in the sense that their education and
accomplishments gave them the sort of lives most Americans would
envy from the outside. One gent took and passed the Maryland bar
exam at age 75, apparently just for the hell of it; he didn't seem
to need the money. One had been named head of the New York state
commission on horseracing by Nelson Rockefeller, which conjures up
the image of endless summer afternoons at the track, and mint
juleps at Churchill Downs in the company of stylish women.
</P>
<P>
   One Oklahoma banker had written jokes for The Harvard Lampoon,
and wound up winning a Planned Parenthood award. Two women were
stout opponents of abortion. There were surgeons, bankers, lawyers,
diplomats, and academics. Many loved nature, and put in a lot of
time or money rescuing the environment that obviously nourished and
sustained their spirits.
</P>
<P>
   One had been a Naval aviator in his 20s who still flew at 81.
John Henry Cutler '32, who got his PhD in '36, in the pit of the
Depression, was editor of The Duxbury Clipper. He wrote two books
about editing a weekly (``Put It on the Front Page, Please!'' and
``Cancel My Subscription, Please!''), which sentiments I can relate
to. He was also ghostwriter for James Michael Curley's
autobiography, ``I'd Do It Again,'' a title that sums up my views
on newspapering for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Joseph Halle Jr. '32 wrote 23 books. Ruth Glover Monsees
'33 ran the Girl Scouts in Portland, Maine, and was a licensed ham
radio operator. One man had been with the Seabees on Guadalcanal;
another, of Turkish extraction, analyzed aerial photos during that
war. Miriam Littlefield Brooks '36 was a 60-year member of the
Weston-Wayland Shakespeare Club. Former US Senator Floyd Haskell
'37 left the GOP over Nixon's invasion of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of these people were active on boards, committees, and
civic enterprises. You'll recognize Cleveland Amory '39, the
animal-rights activist. John P. Nevins '39, who died in Vermont,
led a motorized artillery unit from the Normandy beaches into the
heart of France. Dr. Parker Wheat '39 was the fourth generation of
his family to practice medicine in Manchester, N.H., and served in
both World War II and Korea. One member of the Class of '40 died on
vacation in Paris; there are not many better ways to go.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Whitmore Woodward '40 won the Silver and Bronze stars,
the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism at Omaha Beach on
D-Day, and the Croix de Guerre; this lifelong resident of Rockland
did his bit and more. One doctor advised President Kennedy on
mental retardation. Another discovered how bovine cartilage could
help cancer patients. Frederic Cole Talbot '43 of Weston flew more
than 50 dive-bomber missions off the USS Essex during the war and
won the Navy Cross for helping sink a Japanese battleship in Leyte
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Eaton Pentlarge '45 was a wartime welder at Bath Iron
Works, bore four children, and later co-founded Parents and Friends
of Lesbians and Gays in Maine. Basil M. Carlos Mavroleon '82, a
onetime Wall Street trader who chucked finance for journalism and
joined Afghan mujahideen in attacking Russian convoys, ``was found
dead in his hotel room in Peshawar, Pakistan, on Aug. 27,'' where
he was on assignment for CBS's ``60 Minutes'' for a piece on
terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Basil was unlucky. The luckiest chronicled in this batch?
Perhaps Thomas Anderson Fennell Jr. '48, ``an internationally known
orchid grower,'' who, after his Orchid Jungle in Florida was
clobbered by Hurricane Andrew, won $6.7 million in the Florida
state lottery and closed the business.
</P>
<P>
   Amen to Mr. Fennell, and to all the other Harvardians. In the
long run, we're all dead, no matter how smart, accomplished, or
lucky. Maybe God's a Yale man after all. Happy New Year.
</P>

1999: C'EST FACILE! 
</HEADLINE>

   Markets for the euro will open Monday for the first time. Eleven
currencies now locked into fixed exchange rates, trading as one,
against the dollar mainly. How these two currencies will fare
against one another is, for the moment, anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists think the new European Central Bank will keep
interest rates high to fight inflation and attract funds while
European finance ministries ease taxes to promote growth. Does that
sound familiar? It's the same recipe of tight money and easy fiscal
policy that sent the dollar soaring during Ronald Reagan's first
term.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Starting Monday morning, markets will do the
reconciling. It is all bookkeeping for now; new coins and banknotes
are still three years away. Meanwhile, comic books are promoting
the new currency to European consumers under the slogan ``C'est
facile'' _ it's easy.
</P>

   Fourteen new Internet companies have registered offerings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to Securities
Data Co. These initial public offerings are likely to go forward
during January and February, so long as listed shares like
Amazon.com, America Online, and Yahoo! stay high.
</P>
<P>
   What's keeping the Internet stocks at their stratospheric
levels? Perhaps you noticed that Charles Schwab's market value last
week surpassed that of Merrill Lynch. At around $25 billion, the
biggest on-line brokerage firm was worth slightly more than the
biggest brokerage on Wall Street _ at least briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the customers in this new be-your-own-broker world? My
newsroom friend Frank Hertz offers the following anecdote: ``I was
listening to the radio and scanning the wires when the business
report came on the radio:
</P>
<P>
   ``Skymail stock going berserk. . .opened up 10 points. . .now up
to 14 and rising (Buy it, Frank!). . .up now 18 points (It's only
9:45 _ BUY IT, FRANK!!!). . . it was rock-bottom at 2 in October. .
. (Okay I'll log on to Schwab and buy it). . .now it's at 32. .
.Ahhhhh
</P>
<P>
   ``So I log on. It's at 28. I put in an order at 29. By the time
I click my mouse, it's at 31. I say screw it, put in a market order
instead. By the time I click my mouse again, I've bought it at
$34.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock rose almost 25 percent in three minutes, but here's
the clincher -- I was still glad I bought it at that price! The
rush of it all. I felt like I was doubling-down in Vegas _ nothing
was going to stop me. I wanted it to go up to $50 and then I'd
sell.''
</P>
<P>
   The price reached $48, Hertz reported. Two days later Skymail
had dropped to $20. Next week? He may yet be rich.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   Those following the breathless press coverage of how Hughes
Electronics and Loral Corp. aided China's satellite launching
agency after it blew to bits one of Loral's expensive satellites _
and several dozen people _ rejoiced last week when The Washington
Post put the story of Vector Microwave Research on its front page.
</P>
<P>
   The incredible story of the black-budget firm _ founded in 1984
by Donald Mayes _ may not resolve the issue of whether Loral
committed treason when it gave the Chinese guidance technology that
could just as easily enable them to take out New Delhi with a
ballistic missile as hoist another communication satellite into
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the story illuminated just how bizarre, complex,
and widespread is the international market for advanced weapons
technology. Vector is one of a few specialists in ``foreign
materiel acquisition'' _ meaning the delivery to the Pentagon by
hook or by crook of the latest Russian, Chinese, and North Korean
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that technology often flows both ways, and Vector
has been under investigation since last year for a variety of
practices, including the possibility that it traded to the Chinese
the technical specifications for US Stinger missiles for some
Chinese missiles it wanted. Stingers are hand-held rockets very
useful for bringing down planes _ including, potentially,
commercial jet-liners.
</P>
<P>
   The theft of US high-tech military secrets over a 20-year period
also was the subject of a mostly secret report last week by a
select committee of the House of Representatives. Another flourish
of anti-Clinton rhetoric designed to pave the way to try the
president for treason? Or a dispassionate survey of security
problems?
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some harm in some of the (Loral) transfers of
technology that occurred,'' Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington, the
ranking Democrat on the committee, told a press conference, ``But
it's also fair to say that this is not the only problem we
uncovered.'' His counterpart Christopher Cox (R-Calif) concurred:
``We were rapidly led to considerably more serious national
security problems than the Hughes-Loral cases.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the Y2K problem turns out to be no problem at all for the
world's biggest corporations, you can thank the Germans. The giant
software firm SAP AG has skyrocketed to global prominence by
selling complicated software programs to corporations designed to
link their manufacturing, purchasing, finance, and payroll
functions. Now SAP is even advertising on National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Its vast system known as R/3 amounts to a whole new layer of
extremely robust code on top of whatever older bug-prone systems
these companies still have in place. As one hard-working
bug-spotter put it, for much of the manufacturing world, SAP is the
solution to the millennium bomb _ and the chief beneficiary of it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So 1999 dawns rich in possibilities. Even the impeachment crisis
seems headed for a swift resolution. There are many theories about
what caused it _ a great religious re-awakening; the reversion to a
form of Dixie; neo-conservatives of whom it has been said they
``wouldn't take yes for an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   However much they might disagree on the means to achieve it,
however, there was one goal for 1999 upon which all Americans could
agree: that there should be better men and better women. Happy new
year!

DEER HUNTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it works, don't fix it'' is a common business axiom that's
been modified by the software industry: ``If it works, make a lot
more of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a personal-computer game called Deer Hunter became a
smash hit. And an unlikely one at that.
</P>
<P>
   WizardWorks, the publisher, didn't flood the media with press
releases and demo copies. It's appeal seemed to be a limited
audience.
</P>
<P>
   And hunters couldn't do much. They basically waited in one spot,
looking through binoculars at graphics that were ho-hum.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other games, Deer Hunter was not universally available.
For months, its only distribution point was Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, sales took off, and by the spring of 1998, Deer Hunter
was at the top of the sales charts. (A demo of the game can be
downloaded from:
www.pcgameworld.com/gamedemos/d/deerhunter/index.htm. That last
period is the end of a sentence, so don't include it on the Web
address. Be aware the demo file is about 7 megabytes and takes a
long time to download, even with a fast connection.)
</P>
<P>
   Or if you'd rather spend the money to get the program instead of
the time, it should be available for less than the $20 price when
it was popular.
</P>
<P>
   The price is also lower because Deer Hunter II was recently
released. Hunters can now move about (they were pretty much
confined to blinds and tree stands with the first version), and a
crude map used in the first version has been replaced by a
global-positioning system in this one.
</P>
<P>
   There are also more weapons, more places to hunt and improved
graphics, although they still fall somewhat short in detail
compared to other outdoor games. This version carries a street
price of about $20, the same as the previous version when it was
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   There's also another game with a different twist on the Deer
Hunter theme: Deer Avenger, developed by Cendant Software and
published by Simon &AMP; Schuster Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   The reverse action, where hunters become the hunted, takes place
in the deer-friendly states of West Virginia, Connecticut and
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Bambi has to attract his prey, so the game includes some traps,
including a ``Free Beer Here'' sign to use for a lure.
</P>
<P>
   The program was written by Brian McCann, staff writer for ``Late
Night with Conan O'Brien.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a cute parody, with unsuspecting hunters ranging from
inbred good-ol' boys to L.L. Bean-equipped yuppies.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there are variations on the original.
</P>
<P>
   The one closest to the original concept is African Safari Trophy
Hunter 3D from the same company that brought out the Deer Hunter
title. It was developed in cooperation with Lee Pivar, a safari
hunter for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters can track down elephants, zebras, kudas and elands in
two Zimbabwe hunting areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to build on the success of our Deer Hunter
franchise by publishing titles that expand the genre even
further,'' said Paul Rinde, senior vice president of product
acquisition and development for WizardWorks.
</P>
<P>
   There are a choice of weapons, including bolt-action rifle and
double-barrel rifle, or those who don't want to hunt can pick the
observer mode to watch 3-D animals.
</P>
<P>
   Another game from WizardWorks combines the Deer Hunter concept
with the get-even theme of Deer Avenger: Carnivores has a
dinosaur-fantasy theme. Players can go on a prehistoric hunt for a
Tyrannosaurus, Triceratop, Stegosaurus or other dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike deer, however, dinosaurs tend to get even when they're
winged or missed by a hunter.
</P>
<P>
   If a hunter's shot isn't on target, said Rinde, he or she ``will
become potential prey in a dinosaur attack.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 10 dinosaurs to hunt, each with different
characteristics to keep the game fresh.
</P>
<P>
   There are six different environments and a choice of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   If you really don't want to kill them and risk making them
extinct again, tranquilizers can be used instead of weapons, and
you can haul them back to Jurassic Park. A trophy room, where
specimens are displayed in 3D, can also be used.

ONLY CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday Jan. 7)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was in first grade, my best friend ran away. She came to
my house, carrying her sleeping bag, extra clothes and some
favorite books.
</P>
<P>
   As one of six children, she wanted to escape the noisy chaos,
the shared bedroom, the scramble for the last of the food at the
dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   Her plan was to live at my house forever. After all, there was
just me and my parents. I had a whole room _ indeed, an entire
double-bed _ to myself, plenty of toys, and if I wanted seconds, on
anything, from meatballs to fruit cocktail, all I had to do was
ask.
</P>
<P>
   To Christine, it seemed like paradise.
</P>
<P>
   What she didn't know is that I would have traded with her in a
second. I longed for the easy camaraderie she had with her
siblings, the secrets she gleaned from her older sister, the cool
basement studio that held her older brother's surrealistic
paintings and interesting record collection, where records like
``In the Year 2525'' and ``American Pie'' were always on the
turntable.
</P>
<P>
   Her house buzzed with laughter and fights and games. Her mother
was always tending to the younger ones, so Chris got away with lots
of stuff my mom would have stopped in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   But it was more than that. It was being a part of something
larger. At my house, things tended to revolve around me: my
bedtime, my piano lesson, my Brownie meeting, my homework.
</P>
<P>
   How I longed to move through a family that surrounded me, not
one that existed because of me.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't spoiled or sheltered, not in the way that dampens one's
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   But an only child is just that ... the only child. The tip of
the triangle. And not only that: I was the only child of an only
child of an only child. My family tree led straight to ... me.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the late 1960s, I was a rarity. The kids on my street
came in packs of two to six.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, only children are back in vogue. The most recent
census statistics, from 1995, show that 18 percent of women who say
they have completed child bearing have only one child _ a 50
percent increase from 1985.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it's a biological reality.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, decide on a one-child family. They like the
idea of more time, money and attention lavished on one child,
rather than spread among several. They cite studies that show only
children to be more articulate and better students.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, they say, only children fit more easily into a
dual-career, fast-paced lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Cousins and close friends, they claim, can fill the void left by
no brothers or sisters.
</P>
<P>
   True, onlies do benefit from the extra resources, says Susan
Newman, a social psychologist who wrote the book, ``Parenting an
Only Child.'' But friends don't share your family history, saying
things such as, ``Remember the time we did this ... and didn't you
just love that trip we took?''
</P>
<P>
   Sibling relationships endure over time, and grow especially
valuable when pitching in to care caring for aging parents, and to
have family left after parents die.
</P>
<P>
   For some, though, being an only child is a rich and rewarding
experience. They grew up extremely close to their parents, and
grandparents, willing to share whatever they have with others, not
knowing the mechanics of selfishness or competition.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my childhood longings, who knows if I really would have
liked having brothers or sisters? I'm sure there would have been
times where I, like Christine, would have ditched them all for a
bit of peace and seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   So, because I couldn't convince my parents to have another or
adopt, (my sole request for five straight Christmases), I did the
only thing I could: grew up, got married, and had more than one
baby.
</P>
<P>
   And does my oldest, the beneficiary of this gift of a younger
sister, appreciate the enormity of what I have given him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez,'' he grumbled, one evening a while back. ``Now we have a
baby who cries and messes up everything and bites. What could be
worser?''
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe it takes a few decades to appreciate the finer points
of having a sibling.
</P>

MAKING WORK PART OF RETIREMENT
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an elder-law attorney in the resort town of Truth or
Consequences, N.M., John Wheeler can't help but spend most of his
time thinking about retirement. Retirees come from all over the
Southwest to have him draw up wills and estate plans, so they can
feel secure about spending decades doing little but soaking in the
hot springs of T. or C., as it's known; boating in nearby Elephant
Butte Lake, or roaming the country in recreational vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least half the people I see do the conventional thing'' in
retirement, Wheeler said. ``They play golf _ at least the men do _
they travel, and they work in the yard.'' Others see retirement as
an opportunity to nurture a hobby _ the most popular seems to be
restoring and showing off old cars.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one person who stands out in Wheeler's mind as
epitomizing a healthy, productive retirement: himself.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler, 65, had been living and practicing law in Albuquerque.
But, disenchanted with the city as it was transformed by growth, he
found himself spending more and more time at his mobile home on the
Elephant Butte lakefront. ``I began to like it so much that I said,
``I've got a license to practice law all over the state, I've got a
clientele that comes back to me repeatedly, I have a kind of
perpetual-motion practice at this point and I really don't have to
go out and hustle work.'''
</P>
<P>
   So he made a change: ``I have an Albuquerque telephone number
that call-forwards to T. or C., and I'm leading the kind of life I
want to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler has cut back his workweek to 30 hours, from 60. ``I work
when I want to,'' he said. ``And that's my retirement, or my
semiretirement. I don't think I'll ever fully quit.'' When he isn't
working, he spends much of his time four-wheeling into the hills
around town until he reaches the ends of the old mining roads; then
he gets out and hikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exploring is what I personally like to do,'' Wheeler said.
``There's a lot of mountains that haven't been climbed yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that observation is taken literally or figuratively, a
growing number of retirees clearly agree with it. Retirement today
does not necessarily mean disappearing into an endless sunset of
golf, fishing or bridge, or sinking into a recliner, never to be
creative again. Nor does it mean working until a formal retirement
age and then stopping abruptly. Rather, among the growing numbers
of older people healthy enough to have choices, the dividing line
between the working years and the retirement years is growing
fuzzier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retirement age, which once stood at 65, is being
dismantled brick by brick,'' said John Challenger, chief executive
of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an outplacement firm in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The explosion of jobs and ways of working that are other than
full-time, 9-to-5 kinds of arrangements,'' he said, has ``allowed
many people to achieve a balance in their lives that is so much
more healthy and beneficial spiritually and emotionally and
physically than just hitting the wall at a certain age and going
from being a hard-working, very involved worker to not doing
anything, which was just devastating to many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's new breed of retiree never really retires _ and the
choice to remain active is made out of passion, more than the need
to pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics only hint at the change, which has been difficult to
document with evidence other than the anecdotal. In 1987, 11.1
percent of Americans age 65 or older were in the work force,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A decade later, that
number had grown to 12.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But if baby boomers' expectations are to be believed, the life
of leisure will hold ever less appeal for retirees. In a Roper
survey in 1998 for the American Association of Retired Persons, 80
percent of 2,001 boomers ages 33 to 52 said they planned to
continue working during retirement, whether for fun or out of a
feeling of necessity or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this business of retiring at a certain age and sitting
around the house is never going to happen again,'' said Joan Kelly,
manager of business partnerships in the AARP's economic security
and work issues department. Calling that phenomenon ``a freak
thing,'' she attributed it to changing life expectancies since an
official retirement age of 65 was set when Social Security was
created in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Based on how many retirement years could be expected for the
average person, retiring at 65 then was the equivalent of retiring
at 79 today.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Who represents this new face of retirement? Following are
profiles of Americans who, like Wheeler, are in the vanguard of a
generation revitalized, both emotionally and professionally, after
being liberated from the obligations of a life organized around
work.
</P>
<P>
   Some are alumni of New Directions, a Wilton, Conn., consulting
firm that, for $15,000 and up, helps clients _ mainly high-ranking
corporate officers _ find what it calls a ``portfolio of
opportunity'' to fill the years after full-time employment. Others
have figured out for themselves that the end of a job doesn't mean
the end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   But all would probably endorse an observation made by Wheeler _
a perspective gleaned from years of counseling retirees. ``I'm more
than ever convinced,'' he said, ``that people who only relax and do
not continue to engage the mind start losing it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   From Executive to Angel
</P>
<P>
   So close, yet so far. Robert Ray found himself in that position
after 27 years at Gillette Corp. He had risen steadily at the
company and wanted to go all the way to the top. But at 54, he saw
that there were four people ahead of him in the race to become
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   He interviewed for chief-executive jobs elsewhere but didn't
connect with one, so he took early retirement in 1990, planning to
play more tennis and do more skiing and mountain biking. But he
found that having fun full-time was boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm doing now is not precisely what I'd envisioned eight
years ago,'' said Ray, now 62. ``I have kind of a three-part
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Those parts, in addition to sports, are charity work and playing
business angel, by investing in fledgling companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's story offers evidence that leaving a full-time job can pay
off financially as well as emotionally. His investments in
companies in their beginning stages bring in about as much money as
he made at Gillette. There were early stakes, for example, in
Duracraft, a maker of small space heaters, humidifiers, fans and
vaporizers in Southborough, Mass., that is now a part of Honeywell
Inc., and in Microfridge, a Sharon, Mass., marketer of South
Korean-made refrigerator-microwave oven units that is now part of
the Mac-Gray Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Ray also helped found a homeless shelter in Boston and is now
its chairman. He works on two other programs for the homeless and
consults without pay for other nonprofit groups. And he still has
plenty of time left for his beloved tennis tournaments and other
outdoor activities; he and his wife, Sandra, recently returned from
a visit to the national parks of southern Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``This works out to be a nice kind of balanced life,'' Ray said.
``I don't sit down each day and say, `One and a half days I'm going
to do this.' It kinds of unfolds. Last Thursday, for example, I
played tennis in the morning, then met in the afternoon with a
company I'm thinking of investing in. Then the next day I went
hiking with a buddy of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Dividing his time and energy this way provides ``a good, broad
exposure to the world,'' Ray said. ``The variety makes it not
boring at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Joy of Three-Day Weeks
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, in his early 30s, Bill Price seemed on the cusp of fame
and fortune when his novel, ``The Potlatch Run,'' was published.
``It did moderately well, and the movies were interested in it _
for 10 or 15 minutes,'' Price explained.
</P>
<P>
   He scraped by for a few years as a freelance editor, but by
1980, he said, ``I decided to go back to work _ or, to go to work _
and make a living.'' He joined McKinsey &AMP; Co., the consulting firm,
as a secretary, and moved up the administrative side of the company
to become a communications manager, editing and writing for the
company's in-house magazine and occasionally traveling to research
articles.
</P>
<P>
   A taste of freedom can be hard to forget, though, and by the
summer of 1997, Price was chafing. ``I was on an interview trip in
Spain,'' he recalled. ``I sat down at one of the sidewalk cafes and
said, `What do I want to do with the rest of my life?' I was
approaching 59. That's when I said, `I'd like to have more time for
myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   He asked to work three days a week instead of five. At many
companies, that might have seemed an extraordinary accommodation,
but it was viewed favorably at McKinsey, where part-time
arrangements are common among the company's consultants as they
approach retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Price switched to the schedule last January and quickly
discovered an unexpected benefit: Taking a mere three days of
vacation time now meant having 11 consecutive days off.
</P>
<P>
   ``My income dropped 40 percent, but my stress level dropped
more,'' he said. ``I no longer have the sense that my
responsibilities are crucial to the success of the communications
department. Important, yes; crucial, no. One of the tricks to
making this kind of decision is not to be confused about those two
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Price's wife had died of breast cancer two years earlier, and
though he said the loss did not influence his career decision, it
is clear that the thought of leaving the world without spending as
much time as possible with family weighed heavily on him. He shares
his house in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, with a divorced daughter, his
8-year-old granddaughter, the daughter's fiance and the fiance's
9-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Having the kids around is ``delightful,'' Price said. ``I just
taught my granddaughter how to play chess,'' he said, ``and I'm
teaching them how to lose at poker.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the children figure prominently in a poetic goal that
Price has set for himself. He has a country house in the Berkshires
and recently bought an antique Flexible Flyer sled that seats
three. ``I intend,'' he said, ``to wear it out in my lifetime.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Private Sector to Public
</P>
<P>
   David Kearns came to know a lot of executives in a decades-long
career, first in sales and marketing at IBM and then as a leader
for nearly 20 years at Xerox, and he was befuddled by what some of
them did the moment they went off the payroll. ``By golly, when
they retired, they retired _ completely,'' he said. ``They play
golf and travel and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearns knew he would be retiring as chairman and chief executive
of Xerox in 1990, at age 60, because a succession plan said so. For
him, however, retirement has proved to be an opportunity to delve
ever deeper into education issues, which had become important to
him as a result of two dozen business trips to Japan in the days
when Japanese schools were first being seen as better than their
American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   After Kearns stepped down at Xerox, he received an invitation
from Education Secretary Lamar Alexander to become a deputy
secretary. ``A lot of my friends couldn't figure out why I was
going, but I liked it,'' Kearns said. He added that he would have
stayed on if President George Bush had been re-elected in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   This time, by the will of the people, rather than by design,
Kearns found himself out of office for the second time in two
years. He was also rapidly losing his eyesight because of a tumor
behind his eyes. Yet he went to Harvard University to teach at the
school of education for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Now nearly completely blind, Kearns can read his own writing
only if he uses a big crayon. But with the help of a personal
assistant, he is still working. Based in an office that Xerox
provides for him in Stamford, Conn., he is chairman of a nonprofit
organization called the New American Schools Development Corp.,
which seeks changes in education, and he is working on his second
book about education. He and his wife, Shirley, spend some time in
Florida, but have no plans to live there year-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fill up my time pretty well,'' Kearns said.
</P>
<P>
   Busy on a Modest Budget
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Gladys Stewart shows that being of modest
means does not have to crush a desire to live fully in old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I retired, I said I was going to sleep all day,'' said
Mrs. Stewart, 77, who lives in the Bronx. Who could blame her,
after she had worked three decades as a practical nurse? But doing
nothing turned out to be the one thing she couldn't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I retired, what have I done? Oh, boy!'' Mrs. Stewart
said, before launching into a laundry list of activities.
</P>
<P>
   She is the guardian for one sister, who lives with her, and
visits another sister in a nursing home several times a month. She
takes a 90-year-old neighbor shopping and a 99-year-old neighbor to
the doctor. She attends AARP and NAACP meetings, exercises at the
local senior center and is a member of the women's guild at her
church. Her 31-year-old son, a stockbroker, is separated from his
wife and has moved back in _ and guess who ends up cleaning his
room?
</P>
<P>
   After retiring in 1976, Mrs. Stewart worked part-time to save
for some home improvements and was almost too successful. She
started with private-duty nursing _ caring for a single patient in
the patient's home _ but the client died after a few months. Then
she worked part-time in a nursing home. ``I did that about six
months,'' she recalled. ``Then finally the supervisor said to me,
`Stewart, if I live to be your age and look as well as you look, I
would not stop working.' She asked me to join the staff full time.
I said: `That's your cup of tea, not mine. Retirement means
retirement.' ``
</P>
<P>
   She was serious about it this time and has not done any paid
work since. Mrs. Stewart and her husband, James, a World War II
munitions worker turned maintenance man, both collect city pensions
and Social Security _ ``which keeps you two cents from begging,''
she said. Stewart, 76, puts his handyman skills to use volunteering
at their church and working part-time at Macy's; he cleans rugs on
the side.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this the first time that Mrs. Stewart has rejected a life
of leisure. When the Stewarts married, in 1944, he was making
enough money building bombs in Connecticut that she could afford to
be _ indeed, was expected to be _ a lady of leisure. ``After we got
married,'' she said, ``I went to every theater there was at that
time _ the Strand, the Roxy _ I just had a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   But she soon made a choice that continues to define her life to
this day: ``I said, `This is not for me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to Change the World
</P>
<P>
   Many people take advantage of retirement to increase their
commitment to charitable projects in their communities. For Richard
Stegeman, a retired contract engineer for NASA, that community is
the planet Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Stegeman, a mechanical engineer, observed that most
solar power-generation equipment was too complex to be maintained
where it was needed most, in developing countries. For 15 years, he
dreamed of making a solar engine so low-tech that it could be built
and maintained at remote sites.
</P>
<P>
   His work on the engine remained a mad-scientist hobby until one
day last year, when he was at the Goddard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md., watching live televised pictures of Africa from a
shuttle mission, and had a sudden realization. ``It was time for me
to act,'' he said. ``I was definitely on the wrong side of the
clouds.''
</P>
<P>
   Stegeman, now 65, had remained single until he was 56 and had
never bothered saving much money. He and his wife, Linda Frazee
Stegeman, a psychotherapist, took a hard look at their finances and
concluded that he really should not leave his job.
</P>
<P>
   He did anyway, and they moved from Maryland to Arizona, in part
to be near Mrs. Stegeman's daughter and in part for the sunny skies
he needed for his experiments. ``The worst-case scenario is, we
won't go to jail and we won't starve to death,'' Stegeman said,
recalling their deliberations. ``So we said, `OK, let's do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   His retirement account is fast losing altitude, but Stegeman
nonetheless is forming a nonprofit corporation to manufacture and
market his engine. He hopes to soon be able to pay himself a
salary.
</P>
<P>
   A prototype of the engine _ dubbed Water Heart by a physician
friend because of its resemblance to a human heart _ sits in the
third bay of the couple's three-car garage. It is an adaptation of
the atmosphere engine, a predecessor to the steam engine that was
abandoned because of its inefficiency, but which is viable,
Stegeman believes, with the sun as its energy source.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of boiling large quantities of water, the engine heats
just enough to create a pressure differential that moves a piston.
It only puts out 1.5 horsepower, but that is enough to irrigate a
field. The only byproduct is distilled water.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the Water Heart could help provide nourishing
food and clean water to people who could otherwise die for lack of
them. But the project is already saving one spirit: Stegeman's. It
has also attracted like-minded engineers and humanitarians
interested in working with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't cloister myself in front of the computer or in
the shop for very long'' without going ``nuts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he would love to extend the same rescue line to others.
``The ideal for me,'' he said, ``would be to bump into some retired
guy who has a lot of time on his hands and would get all turned on
by this and just want to help me.''

<P>
   Jay Gatsby was a bond guy in F. Scott Fitzgerald's yarn of the
Roaring Twenties. The bond market was also the playground for John
Meriwether's 1990s band of Nobel laureate-speculators who made
eight-figure fortunes for Long-Term Capital Management before its
recent meteoric fall.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, though, bonds have been seen as boring, arcane
investments suitable only for the aged, the already rich, the
unimaginative and the hopelessly conservative. Not all that long
ago, bond yields were lower than those on stocks on the grounds
that it was stocks _ can you believe it? _ that people thought
might carry some risk.
</P>
<P>
   The truth about bonds is that they can be arcane, and they can
be risky _ but that they have a place in almost every portfolio.
And that is the case despite four consecutive years of supercharged
gains in stocks, and despite the fact that the interest being paid
on quality bonds, once collar-sized and then hat-sized, is as
slender these days as a woman's ring size.
</P>
<P>
   A generation has grown up believing that there is no growth in
just lending money to a company or government. No, the smart thing
is to become an owner, to get a piece of the action _ in other
words, to be in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But life is more complex than that. Markets change _ consider
the gyrations of the last year alone. People budget for college,
face job losses, approach retirement or just plain get nervous when
some stocks sell at multiples of revenue that at one time would
have been thought ridiculous multiples of profit.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may know that through history, stocks have
outperformed bonds by handsome margins _ but they worry nonetheless
that form won't hold indefinitely. In fact, not only did bonds beat
stocks during the first nine months of 1998 _ long-term Treasuries
returned 20 percent, three times as much as the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index _ there have been periods as long as two decades
when bonds were the better investment.
</P>
<P>
   So investment astuteness is not properly gauged by how
thoroughly one shuns the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relatively few people should be 100 percent in stocks,'' said
Scott Lummer, chief investment officer at 401(k) Forum, an advisory
firm in San Francisco. ``Savviness does not mean, `I take all the
risks I want.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best way for most people to think about bonds is as
ballast for their portfolios. Higher-quality bonds can usually be
counted on to do well when the economy stumbles; their promised
flow of interest payments gets even more attractive as interest
rates decline, pushing the price of existing bonds higher. That
stability also gives investors psychological ``staying power'' when
confronted with the inevitable swoons in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Held for the long haul, bonds are also good for anticipating
large specific expenses, such as college. With good fortune, some
can even use bonds to make capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are often advised to shift into bonds as they age, the
very rough rule of thumb being 1 percentage point of a portfolio
for each birthday. (The rule is usually expressed in terms of
stocks _ subtract your age from 100 to figure the equity portion of
your portfolio, assigning the rest mostly to bonds.)
</P>
<P>
   Tolerance for risk is another crucial factor, though investors
don't really know in the abstract how much they can stand. Here,
the rule in tough markets is to sell until you can sleep again.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bond market is a huge place, forbidding to most
amateurs and sometimes impenetrable even to professionals. There
are many traps for the unwary _ even in bond mutual funds, by far
the most popular vehicle for individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, belying their staid reputation, bonds are far from the
haven many assume them to be, as anybody with a stake in Far East
debt learned last year. Financial planners report a dismaying
number of clients who assume that nothing can go wrong with a bond
purchase _ especially if the bond receives a coveted triple-A
rating.
</P>
<P>
   But interest rates can rise, depressing the value of all
previously issued bonds. Or the issuer's fortunes could reverse,
jeopardizing its ability to pay you back. Prices for bonds are
often hard to obtain, and you may not find much of a market if you
decide to sell before a bond comes due. You can wind up owing taxes
on interest you have not yet collected. And if your bond is paid
off early, your choices for reinvesting the money may be
unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   And those are just the dangers of individual bonds. As for bond
funds, their names are sometimes misleading, fees are often high
and investors are at the mercy of a manager who may have little
concern about the tax implications, for the fund's holders, of all
his trading.
</P>
<P>
   Following are some of the considerations that can help bond
investors size up these markets, instead of just assuming that one
bond is pretty much like another.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds, or Bond Funds?
</P>
<P>
   The typical do-it-yourself bond buyer _ someone with, say, less
than $100,000 to invest _ is decidedly handicapped in two respects.
</P>
<P>
   One hurdle is getting enough diversification in a bond
portfolio, given that the smallest municipal bond you can buy
generally costs $5,000, and corporate and Treasury bonds are rarely
bought in smaller units.
</P>
<P>
   The other hurdle is the transactions themselves. It is a
challenge to get timely quotations on bond prices. In the municipal
market alone, there are 1.4 million issues outstanding, counting
each annual maturity separately. And while there are more corporate
bonds than stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, virtually
all the trading takes place off the exchange, in the
over-the-counter market.
</P>
<P>
   So your broker must either shop for you or deal with you from
his own firm's inventory, leaving investors somewhat in the dark
about prices, markups and commissions. And if you need to sell
before a bond comes due, most issues are so thinly traded that you
may take a beating.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All this explains why individual investors increasingly are
buying bonds through mutual funds or brokerage firms' investment
trusts. Besides the benefits of diversification and professional
management _ arguably even more important for bonds than for stocks
_ bond funds are inexpensive to get into and make it easy to
reinvest interest payments, reducing the chance that an investor
will fritter away that income.
</P>
<P>
   Yet bond funds can also be hazardous to your financial health.
Portfolios can harbor bonds that investors would never expect _ and
sometimes even contain stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not make any assumption that the name tells you
anything,'' advised Jack Burks, a bond specialist at Offitbank, a
money management firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And because annual fees take a greater proportion of the return
than for many stock funds, it is especially important to shop
around. For example, the Scudder Income fund has an expense ratio
of 1.18 percent, while fees for the Dodge &AMP; Cox Income fund,
similar in size but with a better five-year record, run less than
half as much _ 0.49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, bond fund managers labor under the assumption that
investors want them to husband principal above all. If portfolio
managers then find themselves underperforming peers, they may be
tempted to take more risk than is prudent _ perhaps by buying bonds
with more distant maturities _ to try to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Such sensitivity is aggravated by the daily publication of bond
funds' net asset value, which exposes the bond-market volatility
that is so well cloaked for individual bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in bond funds also need to bury the widespread
assumption that a high return makes a fund a good buy. They need to
be especially wary of a common bond-fund gambit of inflating
current yield _ at the expense of total return _ by paying premium
prices for high-coupon bonds that are likely to be paid off early
or will certainly depreciate back to face value as they approach
maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look at top performance and assume it's going to
continue,'' cautioned David F. Hill, president of Safeco Mutual
Funds. ``Timing the bond market can be at least as hard as timing
the stock market'' _ which to most professionals means impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring Risk
</P>
<P>
   One hazard for bond investors is a general rise in interest
rates, which raises market yields on new bonds while depressing the
value of existing, lower-yielding ones. This market risk does not
matter if you hold until maturity. But if you need to sell before
then, you face a hefty loss of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Credit risk, sometimes called event risk, is more specific: Will
the issuer be solvent when the time comes to pay back your
principal? If this begins to look doubtful _ a development that
probably would be reflected in a downgrading by rating agencies _
the price of the bonds will sink, independent of the general trend
in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   There can always be surprises, but the rating agencies are quite
good at categorizing bonds. Default rates run highest on the
worst-rated bonds, lowest on the best-rated. Moody's Investors
Service, one of the prominent rating services, ranks bonds from Aaa
(prime) down to C (for those in default). Standard &AMP; Poor's and
Fitch IBCA have similar systems, ranging from AAA to D.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, as corporate mergers boomed again,
specialists pointed to the danger that the company whose bonds you
bought may combine with a weaker company, jeopardizing its ability
to service their joint debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some potholes out there'' for bond buyers in such
situations, said Gregory Lobo, senior fixed-income portfolio
manager at HGK Asset Management in Jersey City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Gauging Price Volatility
</P>
<P>
   In general, the longer until a bond comes due, the more it will
fluctuate in value _ and thus the greater the risk of it being
significantly depressed when you need to sell. The unwary, however,
will typically fail to take account of a crucial distinction
between a bond's maturity date and what is known as its duration,
which is a far better gauge of price volatility.
</P>
<P>
   A bond's duration reflects the weighted stream of payments,
usually semiannual, through the life of the bond, while maturity
merely considers when the principal is to be repaid. So bonds with
the same maturity can have different durations _ and thus different
levels of exposure to market risk.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the differences between two 30-year bonds. The
Treasury's 5\ percent bond due in November 2028 has a duration of
about 15 years, meaning that its price will move up or down about
15 percent for each percentage-point move in interest rates. But a
Treasury zero-coupon strip maturing at the same time _ a bond that
pays no interest over its life but is bought at a steep discount to
its face value _ has a duration of 29 years, which means that a
percentage-point change in rates will move its price by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Factoring in Prepayment
</P>
<P>
   A persistent worry with bonds, including even some of the
Treasury's, is that the issuers can pay them off ahead of schedule
if rates fall. In other words, they can refinance, as homeowners do
with their mortgages, and borrow anew from somebody else at a lower
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, bonds backed by mortgages are particularly susceptible
to early redemption. So their yields, which tend to be seductively
higher than on other debt, may prove fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mortgages I've always viewed as toxic waste,'' said Lincoln
Anderson, a bond strategist in Boston who formerly was chief
economist at Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   While there is often the solace of getting somewhat more than
face value when a bond is called _ typically an extra year's worth
of interest _ this premium may well be already reflected in the
price of the bond. That means investors must know the yield to call
date of a bond, as well as the yield to maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Some bonds have sinking-fund provisions, under which the
borrower intends to redeem a specified part of an issue each year.
The bondholders to be affected are chosen by lottery.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However it happens, early repayment almost by definition means
an investor will find it hard to buy another bond promptly on
equally favorable terms _ a situation called reinvestment risk.
Where, for example, will holders of Amoco bonds due in 2016, which
the company recently called at face value, match their 8| percent
yield without accepting a lower-quality issue?
</P>
<P>
   Making Room for Junk
</P>
<P>
   Infamous for their aggressive use in corporate takeovers during
the 1980s, junk bonds can be respectably employed, even in
conservative portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Only the hardiest small investor will buy individual junk, or
high-yield bonds, since by definition they are less than investment
grade.
</P>
<P>
   For wealthier investors, however, some strategists contend that
a combination of essentially risk-free Treasuries and carefully
selected junk will often produce superior risk-adjusted returns
than a portfolio of average-quality bonds. That is particularly
true in good economic times like these, when default rates on junk
bonds stand far below their peaks.
</P>
<P>
   For most investors, junk-bond funds are an appealing choice;
even the most venturesome is less risky than the most conservative
stock fund. In one sense, the typical high-yield bond fund actually
poses less risk than funds composed of high-grade corporate bonds _
or Treasuries themselves _ because it is less vulnerable to a rise
in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Watch out, however, for closed-end bond funds whose quoted
yields may be exaggerated because _ unlike the more common open-end
funds _ they are not required to use a government-approved
calculation method.
</P>
<P>
   Coming Up With Zeros
</P>
<P>
   ``Zeros,'' issued by the Treasury, by corporations and by
municipalities, are ideal for many small investors. They let the
purchaser determine exactly how much a modest amount of money
invested today will grow to by a specified date _ perhaps the month
that Junior is due to start college.
</P>
<P>
   The entire return is paid at maturity; the zero represents the
amount of interest paid over the life of the bond. Investors lock
in a rate at the outset and avoid the risk of having to reinvest
periodic interest payments at lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   But with the payout coming at maturity, appraising the risk of
default is crucial. And with the long durations of zeros, the price
fluctuations can be up to three times as great as on an
interest-paying bond.
</P>
<P>
   There is a further caveat: Except with tax-exempt municipal
zeros, income tax is due each year on the accrued interest, even
though the interest is not actually paid until the bond comes due.
</P>
<P>
   A cousin of the zero is a bond indexed to inflation, like those
now issued from time to time by the Treasury. These provide
guaranteed purchasing power at maturity, rather than a guaranteed
sum, by adjusting the principal in line with the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   A Place for Hybrids
</P>
<P>
   Convertibles _ corporate securities that can be exchanged, under
specified conditions, for stock _ are in theory a way to combine
bond-like income with stock-like growth. The interest income, now
averaging about 5{ percent, cushions the impact if the company
fails to thrive and the stock declines.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a decade ago, most convertibles were issued for
15 or 20 years. Now they are more investor-friendly, with five-year
maturities, according to John P. Calamos, president of Calamos
Asset Management in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But they are still tricky to analyze, involving both bond-market
math and the ability to pick stocks. Although blue-chip companies
like IBM and, more recently, Monsanto, have sold these hybrids,
many issuers are fledgling companies whose survival is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complex security,'' said Calamos, who specializes in
convertibles, noting that institutions remain the chief buyers.
``The ordinary investor needs to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Hard Part
</P>
<P>
   If you conclude that it is time to add bonds to your portfolio,
remember that bonds can be as different as chalk and cheese and
that disinterested professional advice is hard to find. Most
brokers tend to shun bonds, both because commissions are relatively
low and because the investment is usually locked up for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not were the money is,'' said Richard Ganz, president
of Fixed Income Management Group, a Garden City, N.Y., bond
specialist. So read up to avoid the pitfalls and be sure to shop
around.
</P>
<P>
   But while bonds remain what Ganz calls an ``information
deprived'' subject, technology is starting to pierce the curtain
long drawn over prices. The Bond Market Association, for example,
recently added preceding-day transactions in the most active
municipals to its Web site and hopes to start a similar listing for
corporate bonds in the spring. And bonds are beginning to be sold
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important advice, professionals say, is to
avoid the crowd's fixation on high rates to the exclusion of other
considerations _ especially risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous hunger for yield _ and Wall Street is so
good at feeding that hunger,'' said Mark Lapman, executive vice
president of Independence Investment Associates, a money manager in
Boston. ``That worries me.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   THE ALLOCATOR
</P>
<P>
   William Paton
</P>
<P>
   New Vernon, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Still working and with a portfolio permanently focused on a mix
of 40 percent bonds and 60 percent stocks, William Paton, a
real-estate broker, buys bonds when his formula tells him to _ and
not, for example, when he might have a hunch about the economy
slipping into recession.
</P>
<P>
   The latest such move came in December, when he picked up some
West Windsor, N.J., tax-exempt school district issues, paying 4.60
percent and due in September 2003, to rebalance holdings distorted
by swollen stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I get up to 62 or 63 percent'' equities, Paton
said, ``we sell something and buy another municipal bond.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the sale was of Colgate-Palmolive shares on which
he had a modest loss, thereby also establishing a tax deduction for
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Paton, 66, holds taxable issues in tax-sheltered accounts and
mostly municipals in the bond portion of his regular portfolio.
Generally, he keeps bonds until they come due, disregarding the odd
occasion when his formula suggests buying stocks to rebalance.
</P>
<P>
   Their role? ``Insurance,'' he says succinctly, for his nest egg.
</P>
<P>
   THE GROWTH INVESTOR
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Perry
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   For years after her divorce in 1988, Elaine Perry was too
uninformed about finance to tamper much with the way her large
settlement had been invested, mainly in municipal bonds. But the
one-time teacher and marketer for various nonprofit groups insisted
on educating herself, gradually becoming confident enough to take
control of her money _ ``to venture out,'' as she puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Perry, now in her 50s, became fond of a strategy suggested
by her broker, Richard Ganz, president of Fixed Income Management
Group in Garden City, N.Y. Its principle, Ganz said, is that
``bonds can be used for growth,'' not just as a source of income.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, she had a portfolio of municipals _ tailored to reach
maturity on a regular schedule. Now, she puts significant amounts
in long-term Treasuries and municipals that pay relatively low
interest but grow sharply in market value when rates fall, as they
did in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a guess'' on rates, she acknowledged. But it is a play
that is conservative enough _ no leverage, no derivatives, no junk
_ to square with her goal of safety. A wrong guess often means only
that Mrs. Perry holds on to a bond indefinitely, perhaps to
maturity _ the consolation, she said, being that ``I'll always get
my money back.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE MARKET TIMER
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ippolito
</P>
<P>
   Malvern, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Joseph Ippolito bought Chrysler Corp. debt and
made a small killing over the course of the automaker's brush with
oblivion. Emboldened by that triumph, he thought it would be smart
to buy shares in a bond mutual fund when the business cycle turned
downward in mid-1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy was starting to go south, and this would pressure
the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates,'' recalled Ippolito,
61, a tax accountant turned investment adviser.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy backfired when rates climbed instead. Ippolito,
relying on a computer model as well his reading of the Fed's
intentions, saw a $5,000 stake shrivel to $3,500 in a matter of
months by trying to be ``too cute'' in an investment that is often
portrayed as practically risk-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very good lesson,'' said Ippolito, who is now
semi-retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't try to outguess Alan Greenspan,'' he added, ``and don't
put complete faith in your technical analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Though 20 percent of Ippolito's portfolio is still invested in
bonds, that is a sharp reduction from last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If Microsoft Corp. is the predatory monopolist that the
government claims it is, why isn't the price of its monopoly
product _ its industry-standard Windows operating system _ higher?
</P>
<P>
   That question is a central focus of a new study of Microsoft and
the government's antitrust suit against the company by Robert E.
Hall, an economist at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.
Hall helped draw up the Justice Department's 1995 consent decree
with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-page paper, ``National Policy on Microsoft: A Neutral
Perspective,'' written with Hall's son, Chris Hall, an independent
software developer, is being published this week and will be
available on the Internet at www.netecon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The paper says the government's evidence puts it on solid ground
in challenging some of Microsoft's contracts as violations of
Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which condemns contracts that
restrain trade.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Hall pointed in particular to Microsoft's pacts
with America Online and other Internet service providers. These
contracts require the service providers to guarantee that 75
percent or more of their customers use Microsoft's browser
software, crimping the opportunity for its main rival in the
browser market, Netscape Communications. For a company with so much
market power, a clause like that ``shows that Microsoft really does
push the limits,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   On the pro-Microsoft side of the ledger, the Halls find little
merit in the march of government witnesses confidently proclaiming
that operating systems and browsers are distinct products, and that
Microsoft fused them only to squelch competition. ``Given the
complete malleability of software,'' the authors wrote, ``this is a
debate at about the intellectual level of trying to decide if the
Gulf of Mexico is part of the Atlantic Ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   The Halls' paper focuses most sharply on the contentious subject
of Windows pricing. They say ``the low price of Windows looks
nothing like a monopoly price,'' amounting as it does to less than
5 percent of the total price of a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   The ``low'' price of Windows is a theme that will be forcefully
presented by Richard Schmalensee, an economist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, when he takes the stand as a witness for
Microsoft. Schmalensee has been making the argument since the early
1990s, when he prepared a paper expounding the low-price thesis for
the Federal Trade Commission, which investigated Microsoft before
the Justice Department did.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows-pricing issue is crucial to the outcome of the case
and, if the government wins, to the remedies it can seek from the
court. A narrow victory under Section 1 of the Sherman Act would
probably yield merely a court order that Microsoft must make its
contracts less restrictive. The Justice Department did not sue
Microsoft to accomplish so little.
</P>
<P>
   But to win a broader, Section 2 victory, the government must
prove, among other things, that Microsoft has a monopoly, that its
exclusionary conduct against potential rivals like Netscape has a
``dangerous probability'' of preventing a challenge to its monopoly
and that its conduct has caused substantial harm to consumers. Only
then will stronger remedies _ including, perhaps, breaking up
Microsoft _ move onto the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   To try to show gouging of consumers, the government produced in
court an internal Microsoft document showing that from 1990 to 1996
the average price it charged personal-computer makers for licensing
Windows rose to $49.40 from $19.03. Its share of the PCs total
price grew fivefold, to 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also produced an e-mail written on Dec.
16, 1997, by Joachim Kempin, a senior Microsoft executive, to
chairman Bill Gates and other company executives on the subject of
Windows prices charged to PC makers. ``While we have increased our
prices over the last 10 years,'' Kempin wrote, ``other component
prices have come down and continue to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department says Microsoft's ability to raise Windows
prices is strong evidence that the company is overcharging. The
Halls are not convinced. Given Windows' 250 million users and
market share of more than 90 percent, the authors wrote, PC makers
would want it even if it cost ``twice or even 10 times as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft contends that the Windows price is restrained by a
sense that some competitive threat, though not yet in sight, is
behind the next corner _ a fearful perspective that is all over
parts of the December 1997 memo. In it, Kempin wrote that a big
manufacturer like Compaq Computer, or a coalition of PC makers,
could finance development of a competing operating system. Or, he
wrote, if the chip maker Intel enters ``our business, it will get
ugly.'' (Compaq, incidentally, is sending an executive to testify
in Microsoft's defense.)
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hall does not believe that the seemingly low price
of Windows is explained by competition, real or feared. Instead, he
suggests that the Windows price is part of Microsoft's broader
strategy of making Windows PC's as cheap as possible, hooking new
users and making them steady repeat buyers, not only of future
generations of Windows but also of higher-priced Microsoft products
like its Office suite of word processing, spreadsheet and data base
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has to make an argument as to why Microsoft
keeps the price of Windows low as part of its monopoly strategy,
which harms consumers over all,'' Hall said. ``It's possible, but
the government hasn't done it yet.''

MARKET WATCH: TIME FOR SOME PLAIN TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 3)  
 (bl)

<P>
   The tornados that hurtled through world markets in 1998 varied
in nature, scope and power. But they all had something in common:
Their risk to investors was hidden.
</P>
<P>
   That was true for the shock of Russia's defaulting on its debt
last August and the ensuing whirlwinds that swept the United States
bond market. It was true in the near-collapse of the giant hedge
fund Long-Term Capital Management and in the accounting
irregularities that hammered shareholders in Cendant, Sunbeam and
Livent.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the problem is known as a lack of transparency _
the ability of investors to see through an investment, to make an
informed decision to buy, sell or do nothing. True transparency is
crucial to investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all investors bother to investigate before they
invest. Many plunge first and ponder later. But for those who
perform due diligence on their investments, it is alarming, indeed,
that wide swaths of markets remain opaque. Many are found overseas,
though there are dark corners, too, in U.S. markets, where
securities laws have demanded full disclosure for more than 60
years.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors are getting less information today than they were
a few years ago. Consider, for example, the recent decision by
Fidelity Investments to stop sending shareholder reports and fund
prospectuses automatically to many participants in 401(k) plans it
manages. Now, shareholders get this information _ on fund holdings,
fees and a description of a fund's investment policy _ only if they
ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that most people don't read the shareholder reports,''
said Debra McConnell, a spokeswoman for Fidelity. ``This was a
decision based on our broader initiative to communicate more
effectively with plan participants. It reduces clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's move is a straw in the wind. There are other, far
more troubling transparency issues in U.S. markets today. Though
the bond market is far bigger than the stock market, for instance,
no electronic pricing system for all types of bonds is available to
individual investors. This makes it almost impossible to see
problems like the flight to Treasury bonds that froze the rest of
the bond market in September.
</P>
<P>
   A second problem area is accounting. As companies find it
imperative not to disappoint Wall Street with bad earnings reports,
aggressive accounting tactics become more common. (As the
accompanying chart shows, tens of billions in earnings are
disappearing into a variety of one-time charges _ some taken by
companies that have made these once-rare events into regular
occurrences.) This makes companies' books more difficult to
penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is a practice that the Securities and Exchange
Commission calls selective disclosure, in which public companies
divulge information first to favored Wall Street analysts and later
to the public. Some companies deny the press access to conference
calls or meetings with analysts. This puts small investors at a
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   All these areas are of concern to the SEC. Last September, for
example, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. asked the National
Association of Securities Dealers to develop a system for tracking
bond trades and a program to detect fraud in bond markets. Levitt
has also been trying to crack down on accounting fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Transparency issues rarely get attention when stock prices are
rising. But as Levitt seems to realize, that is exactly when they
should be tackled, before disaster strikes. In the meantime,
investors should demand all the information they can get.
</P>

<P>
   OAK PARK, Mich. _ A year ago, when the Rev. Jesse Jackson
organized a Wall Street conference on race, Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin rose to speak and then asked for questions. One came
from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   `` Rubin,'' a man piped up, ``why not take money
African-Americans are investing in pension funds and invest it into
their community?''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin looked puzzled, and then joked, ``Jesse, you must have
planted that question.'' Jackson rose. ``No. That's Mel Farr,''
came the response. ``He's the biggest African-American auto dealer
in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Mel Farr's first taste of Wall Street, and now he's
going back in search of something he says black America _ no less
than his own bustling company _ is very much in need of: financial
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Farr, a former professional football player who operates 15 auto
dealerships out of the Detroit area, is trying to raise $45 million
in a private placement of asset-backed securities that would help
take his business into the most blighted areas of the nation. Some,
like Jackson, see his effort as a test case of whether Wall Street
will do more than pay lip service to the cause of black
entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, Farr was driving a black Lincoln Navigator
around his complex of Lincoln-Mercury and Ford dealerships here,
talking about how he's managing a talent pool that comes from the
``bottom of the barrel,'' selling to the urban underclass and still
making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auto manufacturers have abandoned urban areas,'' he said. ``I
met a Ford dealer once and he said, `That dog won't hunt.' And I
said: `You got the wrong dog. You got a Labrador retriever; you
need a hound dog.' And I am that hound dog.''
</P>
<P>
   On this morning, just after 8, Farr is headed to a meeting with
the mostly black sales force at one of his dealerships. He is a
ruggedly handsome 54-year-old, and the only hint of his former
career is a small scar above his right eye, a result of a tackle.
As he works the small crowd, his tone changes from folksy to
inspirational.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning,'' the group of about 25 calls back in unison.
</P>
<P>
   Farr talks about setting goals, and like a church congregation,
the listeners respond with nods and shouts of ``yes.'' At one
point, he singles out a man named Gary who used to work as a
hospital orderly. ``How much did you make this year?'' Farr asks.
``One hundred thousand dollars,'' Gary replies, to much applause.
</P>
<P>
   Set goals, Farr repeats. ``If it is to be, it is . . .'' he
says, allowing his voice to trail off. ``Up to me,'' the sales
force chimes in, completing his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Farr sells mostly to black Americans he calls ``financially
challenged'' _ those with virtually no credit _ and finances their
purchases at interest rates of up to 25 percent. And he is quick to
repossess cars whose owners fall behind on payments. ``I'm giving
them an opportunity nobody else would give them,'' he says
unapologetically. ``Traditionally, that market would not be able to
pay, so you have to price for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He got into the car business after retiring in 1974 from the
Detroit Lions (where he was an All-Pro running back). Since then,
he has acquired mostly small, bankrupt showrooms to create the
nation's largest chain of black-owned dealerships, with 817
employees and more than $600 million in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is flying around the country, sometimes in his personal
turboprop, trying to raise money for expansion to cities like
Atlanta and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Jackson, he obtained an audience last year with
James Dimon, then co-chief executive of Salomon Smith Barney. But
Dimon told him the financing deal was too small.
</P>
<P>
   So Farr went to a smaller investment bank, Quadrant Financial,
prepared the private-placement papers and began meeting with
pension fund managers and other institutional investors to make the
case for Triple M, his financing outfit that makes loans to people
with bad credit. So far, he says, he has raised $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it's a hard sell. A few meetings, he said, went
something like this: ``Well, what are you going to do with the
funds?'' To which he answered, ``I'm going to loan this to
African-Americans with bad credit.'' They said, he recalled with a
chuckle, ``Isn't there an easier deal than this?''
</P>
<P>
   There may be, but Farr says he has worked out a formula that
insures a nice profit, especially given the absence of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Farr knows what it is like to overcome long odds. Growing up in
segregated Beaumont, Texas, he had to drink from separate water
fountains for blacks, eat standing up at separate restaurant
counters and ride in the back of the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know a single white person until I went to UCLA,'' he
said. At the University of California at Los Angeles, he was an
All-America running back; he was drafted in the first round by the
Detroit Lions and won Rookie of the Year honors.
</P>
<P>
   After injuries cut his professional football career short, he
fell back on a childhood passion: cars. His father had sold used
cars out of the family's front yard, and Farr began roaming the car
lots of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Today, his base of operations is the Mel Farr Automotive Group
here, which he publicized a few years back by appearing in
commercials as ``Superstar Mel Farr,'' wearing a red cape. He has
found jobs at the dealership for his sons, Mel Jr. and Mike (also
former pro football players); his daughter, Monet, and his brother,
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the template,'' he says, strolling the corridors. ``I
want to do this all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in his office just after 3 p.m., Farr takes a call from
Jackson. They make small talk about football, then turn to the
topic of Wall Street and Jackson's follow-up conference on race
later this month. In the days leading up to that, he says, he
expects to get the $45 million he is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a real partnership,'' he says, speaking into the
phone. ``All I want you to do is set 'em up. I'll do the rest.''
Reinforcing the point with a football metaphor for Jackson, a
former college quarterback, he adds, ``If you throw it up, I'll
catch it.''

SITTING PRETTY WITH ZERO DOWN: IN SOME MORTGAGES, STOCK IS
COLLATERAL

<P>
   Last summer, Robert Cramer asked his financial adviser to sell
about $250,000 in stock so he could make a down payment on a
million-dollar triplex in Malibu, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer, a lawyer, was no stranger to the mortgage process; at
the time, he owned five properties. But this time, his adviser
talked him into taking out an innovative mortgage that allowed him
to use stock as collateral without putting a penny down on the
house. For the deal to pay off financially, the stock's return
would have to match or exceed the 7[ percent interest he would have
paid on a down payment. But it was a gamble he was willing to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been highly favorable in my situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage, offered by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, goes by the
name of Flex Source. Other firms offer this type of stock-backed
mortgage, but it isn't for everybody, assuredly not the faint of
heart. With a Flex Source mortgage, home buyers must place
securities equal to 39 percent of the purchase price or appraised
value in a brokerage account; if the market plunges, they must add
to the portfolio so its value never dips below 33 percent of the
purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has advantages: Because they are not selling shares to
raise a down payment, buyers avoid paying capital-gains taxes, and
they can hope for big gains if the bull market continues.
``Historically the stock market makes you money,'' noted Margaret
Klein, a Morgan Stanley associate vice president and Cramer's
financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Dow bobs up and down, a homeowner's fortunes can bob
with it. Cramer paid $965,000 for his oceanfront home, so he had to
put up stock valued at $377,000, Ms. Klein said. To play it safe,
he placed $400,000 worth in the account.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't safe enough. In the 60 days running up to his Sept. 30
closing, the market fell sharply and he had to add $89,000. Since
then, stocks have surged, and he has made up that amount _ plus
$68,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``How attracted you are to this kind of deal is going to depend
on what you want to get from your investment, and on the economy on
down the road,'' said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH
Associates, a financial publisher in Butler, N.J. ``If you think
we're going into a period of slow growth and poor profits, this may
not be the time to get into this.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say people nearing retirement or those who prefer
traditional mortgages _ in order to build equity in their homes _
should probably stay away from stock-backed mortgages, while
aggressive investors might want to consider them.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch is credited with developing this form of 100
percent home financing. About seven years ago, it introduced Parent
Power, a program that allowed parents, grandparents or other
sponsors to pledge securities in lieu of a down payment to help
first-time home buyers. Parent Power became so popular that Merrill
created an offshoot, called Mortgage 100, that enabled individuals
to buy their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   In many traditional mortgages, home buyers pay 20 percent down
to avoid buying personal mortgage insurance. On a $300,000 house,
this would be $60,000. While a down payment helps reduce the
monthly payment, financial advisers recommend looking at how much
that money would earn if it was invested. The nothing-down loan is
a wash if the money grows at the same rate as the interest rate on
the mortgage. Using the above example, with a fixed 7 percent
interest rate, Merrill Lynch calculates the break-even point over
seven years to be $89,400. If the money returned 10 percent, it
would grow to $120,500, leaving the homeowners $31,100 richer than
if they made a down payment. But if the money returned 5 percent,
it would grow to just $85,100, $4,300 short.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Schatsky, a fee-only financial adviser and lawyer in New
York, cautions against rushing into 100 percent financing. ``The
reasonable argument for why to do this is you can't afford the tax
bite,'' he said. But other options might accomplish the same goal,
he said, such as simply borrowing against your stock account and
using the proceeds as a down payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caution, caution, caution,'' he said. ``It sounds convenient,
but the cost might well be too expensive for many.''
</P>
<P>
   Gumbinger said this sort of financing has grown as the stock
market has surged but has remained ``a specialty niche.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' he said, ``is if you don't think you can
afford to lose, then you probably shouldn't gamble.''

THE CULTURE OF MONEY: DISCLAIMERS ARE HAZARDOUS TO OUR HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 3)   Daniel Akst is a novelist and financial journalist. His column on
the cultural dimensions of money and business appears the first
Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney(AT)nytimes.com.  
 (bl)

<P>
   An invitation came to spend the weekend at a vacation home in
the mountains. There would be hiking, gourmet meals and
companionable guests, all friends and significant others. But when
I arrived, my hosts had left a request: that I read the disclaimer
they provided and sign where it said I wouldn't sue.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were friends of my wife-to-be, I supplied my
signature to avoid making a scene. And, anyway, isn't that how we
get through the rest of our lives?
</P>
<P>
   Disclaimers are everywhere. Join a gym, visit a hospital or park
a car, and you are likely to have one shoved under your nose. The
flip side of ``go for it!,'' disclaimers are among the defining
tropes of fin de siecle America, figuring as prominently in the
culture of money as yellow cabs in the iconography of New York.
They give the same queasy color to our discourse, too. A symptom of
fear and a sign of collective distrust, they suggest that we are
ruled by literal-minded finger-pointers who make it too risky to
take responsibility for anything.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents, for example, are increasingly printing
disclaimers on tickets and itineraries. One popular version ducks
responsibility for ``terrorist activities, social or labor unrest,
mechanical or construction failures or difficulties, diseases,
local laws, climatic conditions, abnormal conditions or
developments'' or anything else said to be outside the travel
agent's control.
</P>
<P>
   The tautological ``void where prohibited'' is heard daily in
advertising, as are fast-talking announcers who, at the end of
radio commercials about car leases and the like, squeeze in all the
required legalese with the speed and intelligibility of an
auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
   It is now standard practice for many publishers to slap a
disclaimer on each work of fiction (you know: ``any resemblance to
blah, blah, blah is purely coincidental''), even though the book is
clearly labeled a novel. One movie even used a disclaimer as its
title _ ``Batteries Not Included.''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that disclaimers are a form of disclosure, they
are difficult to criticize. After all, openness is practically
sacred nowadays as a cultural attribute _ witness all the talk
shows with dysfunctional families. In business, disclosure has been
the sensible basis of securities regulation since the days of
Franklin D. Roosevelt, giving investors the facts to fairly
evaluate risks.
</P>
<P>
   But the very pervasiveness of disclaimers is inverting their
intended effect, by burying truly relevant information in an
avalanche of boilerplate warnings and denials that any rational
person must train himself to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   See how this syndrome plays out on Wall Street. Prospectuses for
new stock offerings constantly warn investors that there can be no
assurance of practically anything, including the sun's rise on the
morrow. Yet all those investors keep bidding up the price of new
Internet stocks into the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet itself offers vast new opportunities for the
repudiation of responsibility. Web pages often carry disclaimers,
and weirdly, so do people's postings in discussion groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of Usenet, the vast bulletin-board-like
network of public sites where online denizens do their opining,
many people's postings included a warning that ``the opinions
expressed are the writer's alone and not those of his employer,''
whose identity was obvious in the poster's Net address. It's common
now to see strident posted or e-mail opinions softened with
``YMMV'' _ your mileage may vary.
</P>
<P>
   In this unheroic age, when we all try to reduce our comments to
what lawyers call obiter dictum (things said in passing), it's
tempting to lump the spread of disclaimers with other cultural
phenomena, like the tendency of some young people, particularly
women, to inflect declarative sentences upward at the end? In a
kind of grammatical disclaimer? (I'll stop now.)
</P>
<P>
   These developments are in keeping with the assault by literary
critics on the authority in ``authorship,'' so that even financial
journalists are joining novelists in embracing disclaimers. For
example, James J. Cramer's stock-market investing column on
Thestreet.com, has the following disavowal attached: ``Under no
circumstances does the information in this column represent a
recommendation to buy or sell stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Maybe he's actually discussing horoscopes in some kind of
code. Or maybe he's just been talking to his lawyers.

ECONOMIC VIEW: THE JOINT IS STILL JUMPING, BUT THE FLOOR IS
SHAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 3)  
 (bl)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These feel like such good times. People have jobs. Their pay is
rising in many cases. The stock they own is gaining in value, and
so are their homes. They spend rather freely, and as the weeks pass
they feel less threatened by the economic turmoil elsewhere in the
world. So it is hard to get people to focus on the precarious
underpinnings, right here at home, of these boom times.
</P>
<P>
   One of the shaky supports is business debt. Everyone knows that
consumers have borrowed up to their chins, a worry in its own
right. But now comes word from the Federal Reserve, which tabulates
this sort of data, that companies have also been piling up debt,
though with less fanfare. Just as consumers have done, business
borrowers have bet on a strong economy to give them enough income
to make their monthly installment payments. Lately, however,
business debt has grown faster than profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all getting caught up in euphoria, and a lot of good
things are happening in this economy,'' said James Glassman, a
senior economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. ``But you are never far
from vulnerability, and business debt is now one of the vulnerable
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Business debt, which includes the obligations of all types of
business except banks, brokerage firms and other financial
institutions, stood at $5.13 trillion Sept. 30. That is a big
number even for the big U.S. economy. And it keeps rising. While
profit growth was weakening in the third quarter, business debt was
rising at a 10.4 percent annual rate, the fastest since the start
of the economic expansion nearly eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market makes all this debt seem unalarming. That's
because stock prices are rising even faster than debt, so a
company's borrowings do not look high relative to its total market
value. Such illusions help to explain how Amazon.com, its stock
price soaring, had little trouble borrowing $275 million last
spring through a junk-bond offering, even though Amazon's earnings
_ the wherewithal to repay this debt _ were zero. For similar
reasons, millions of Americans who own stock feel comfortable
borrowing faster than their incomes rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate balance sheets look fine,'' said William Dudley,
chief economist at Goldman, Sachs, ``as long as you focus your eye
on debt as a ratio of the market value of a company's stock. But
when you look at debt as a percentage of book value _ the actual
value of a company's equipment, buildings and other assets _ it
makes you sort of nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   There does not seem much danger of widespread defaults today, a
contrast to the late 1980s, when shaky real-estate lending
accounted for much of the run-up in business debt. Interest rates
are considerably lower now, making the repayment of loans less
burdensome. And if defaults come, the nation's lenders,
particularly banks, are in better financial shape to weather
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But not since the 1920s has the stock market played so big a
role in a U.S. economic boom. And that is what makes rising
business debt so worrisome, though the public is paying little heed
to the connection.
</P>
<P>
   The economic expansion of the 1990s is largely built on borrowed
money, as Wynne Godley, an economist at the Jerome Levy Institute,
has argued in various studies. Just as huge deficit spending by
government financed the expansion in the 1980s, deficit spending by
consumers and, especially, businesses has carried the economy in
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have borrowed to pay for capital investment, a big
source of economic growth. They have borrowed to stockpile
merchandise awaiting sale. They have borrowed to finance mergers.
And companies have gone hundreds of millions of dollars into debt
to buy back their own stocks and give share prices a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who think the boom can continue, you really have to
postulate that these borrowing flows will continue to rise at the
old pace,'' Godley said.
</P>
<P>
   But how can they? Business has gone from repaying debt at an
annual rate of $150 billion in 1991, as the last recession ended,
to borrowing at an annual rate of $522 billion in this year's third
quarter _ a swing of nearly $700 billion. Profits are no longer
sufficient to keep adding to debt at that rate. And as business
cuts back, the economy will inevitably slow.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the stock market complicates matters. The slowing
economy will eventually bring down stock prices; as they fall, the
ratio of business debt to equity will rise, alarming borrowers and
lenders, who will then cut back debt even more.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers will probably go through a similar process: If their
stock-market wealth evaporates, they, too, will become more
reluctant borrowers _ and an orderly slowdown in the national
economy could turn into a rout.
</P>
<P>
   It may never happen that way. The U.S. economy is amazingly
resilient, and some wonderful event, or series of events, may save
the day. But it's a realistic scenario, one that ought to dampen
the current euphoria, and in doing so make the future less
dangerous.

INTERNET COMPANIES: THE SMALL GET BIG, THE BIG GET BIGGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Jan. 4)  
(mk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, the choice for Lycos, then a struggling Internet
search engine, was to make acquisitions or become irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reached 14 percent of the Internet users,'' recalled Robert
Davis, chief executive of Lycos Inc. Yahoo Inc. was at 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never going to grow into a powerhouse,'' he said. ``We
had to buy our way to being a powerhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly what Lycos has done. It has bought five
companies, for more than $300 million in stock, in the last year,
increasing its audience to 38 percent of Internet users and giving
itself a somewhat better chance of staving off irrelevancy.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Internet executives and investment bankers agree, the
pace of deal-making by Internet publishing and retailing companies
is likely to accelerate as more and more of the concerns that have
started in recent years realize that they need to grow in order to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Internet you have to get bigger fast,'' said Mark
Shafir, head of Merrill Lynch's technology merger practice in San
Francisco. ``It's going to be the land of the titans pretty
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward consolidation began last year, when many deals
were driven by the desire of smaller companies to end grueling
battles for market supremacy. Most notably, CD Now and N2K, the two
leading online music stores, agreed to merge in order to fight off
impending competition from Amazon.com. And Media Metrix, a
privately held company that measures the audience of Internet
sites, bought its archrival Relevant Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The existing titans, meanwhile, moved to extend their dominance.
America Online Inc., the biggest Internet company, used
acquisitions to reach new audience groups in addition to its core
of chatty teen-agers and their technology-challenged parents. It
bought Mirabilis, the Israeli creator of the chat service called
ICQ that appeals to an international audience. And America Online
plans to acquire Netscape Communications Corp. to get Netscape's
World Wide Web site, which appeals to business users, as well as
its online server software.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Microsoft Corp. bought Hotmail, a free e-mail
service, to funnel users to its own revamped MSN portal service.
And Amazon.com bought Junglee, a service that searches for products
for sale around the Internet, as a way to transform itself from a
book and music store to a vast electronic mall.
</P>
<P>
   The surging prices of Internet stocks will help create a handful
of new Internet titans as both big traditional companies and
smaller start-ups struggle to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Take Yahoo, rated at the top among search engines, or portal
services, as they are now called because of the role they try to
play as the front doors to people's Internet journeys. Yahoo now
has a market value of $23 billion, about as big as that of CBS Inc.
That makes Yahoo simply too expensive for any company (save perhaps
Microsoft) to buy. But it's easy for Yahoo to use its highly valued
shares as currency to make acquisitions of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to use your paper while you have it,'' said David
Braunschvig, a managing director at Lazard Freres. ``It costs you
nothing to get big.''
</P>
<P>
   While Yahoo and Amazon have, so far, made relatively small
acquisitions, their market values will give them the opportunity to
make even bigger deals this year, investment bankers contend.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rise in Internet stock values creates nothing but
headaches for traditional retailers competing with companies like
Amazon and for big media companies competing with Yahoo. These
companies cannot pay as high a price for acquisitions, nor can they
offer their employees high-flying stock bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a big company, you won't be able to keep your
engineers for a long time if they see all their buddies at small
public companies become very rich from the stock options,''
Braunschvig said.
</P>
<P>
   The solution for an existing company is to take a part-interest
in a publicly traded Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   The prototype of his arrangement is Walt Disney Co.'s purchase
of 43 percent of Infoseek, another struggling search-engine
company. But rather than paying cash, Disney exchanged Starwave, an
Internet production company it owned, and only $90 million in cash
for Infoseek stock worth $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing financial benefits, such deals help the
bigger companies keep up with the frantic pace of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Merger experts predict that media companies will make alliances
this year with the remaining independent portal companies,
including Lycos, Excite, Alta Vista and maybe even Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, for all the appeal and wealth of the publicly traded
Internet startup company, and all the high-profile initial public
offerings last year, statistics show that small technology
companies are less likely to go public than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   There certainly will be more public offerings this year, like
those last year of Ebay and Broadcast.com. Coming up early this
year is the offering for Ivillage, a woman's interest Internet
service. Later, most likely, will be an offering for Buy.com, an
ambitious online store that has grown rapidly by selling computer
products at cost in hopes of making money on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Yet statistics compiled by Broadview, an investment bank, show
that last year, for the first time, there were fewer initial public
offerings of small technology companies than there were
acquisitions of them by bigger companies.
</P>
<P>
   Stock can be sold more easily and with less notice when it's in
a larger company than when a founder bails out of his own company's
stock. Holding onto stock in one's own company after going public,
however, has not proved to be prudent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the companies that have gone public since 1991 are
trading below their IPO value,'' said Alec Ellison, a managing
director of Broadview.
</P>
<P>
   So for those companies that don't see their way to being titans,
a quick sale to a more established operation may be both easier and
more lucrative than going it alone and risking irrelevancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``By going public,'' Ellison said, ``they may not get the
strategic resources that a sale to Big Brother would provide.''

FUND INDUSTRY COUNTING ON ANOTHER GREAT JANUARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Jan. 4)  
(ART ADV: Graphic on asset allocations at mutual fund companies is
being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)

 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even the stock market's wild gyrations in August and October
were not enough to shake the faith of steadfast mutual fund
investors who switched gears through the turmoil, but stayed in the
race. That means the fund industry is likely to record another
stellar January of heavy cash flows into stock, bond and money
market funds this month, traditionally one of its strongest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   During the period of market turmoil that stretched from August
through October, mutual fund investors channeled more of their new
investments toward the safety of money market funds and bonds than
into stocks. But as December neared, new sales of stock funds
picked up again.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a third quarter in which the average equity fund
lost 15 percent, mutual fund shareholders approached the end of the
year with a near-record portion of their assets invested in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   According to Investment Company Institute, a trade group, mutual
funds that invest primarily in American stocks took in $155.58
billion in net new cash through November. Therefore, total new
flows for 1998 are likely to be less than in each of the two
previous years, but more than in any year before 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the diminished cash flows can be traced to the
August turmoil, which led equity fund investors to make $11 billion
of net withdrawals from stock funds _ the first such withdrawals
since September 1990. That was when the stock market suffered its
last decline of more than 20 percent following Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   During the subsequent eight years, the assets in stock funds
ballooned tenfold, to $2.809 trillion. More than two-fifths of that
growth came from new investments, while the remaining three-fifths
came from gains in the value of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Investors did not panic during the August downturn, nor in the
following months. Instead, they returned to making new investments
in equity funds in each of the following three months. Funds
investing primarily in American stocks fared the best, with nearly
four times as much flowing into those funds from September through
November as went out in August.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund companies are likely to draw comfort, as well, from
the fact that $9 billion of the $11 billion that flowed out of
stock funds in August was placed in bond or money market funds
operated by the same fund company, rather than being withdrawn
altogether from the fund company's coffers, according to Investment
Company Institute. That means the fund companies continue to earn
at least some management fees from the money, which they would not
do if investors had cashed out completely.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming appetite for equities among fund investors
since the beginning of the decade has resulted in a big shift in
asset allocations within the fund industry. At the end of 1990, a
mere 25 percent of the fund industry's total assets were invested
in stocks, with about 28 percent in bonds and 47 percent in money
market accounts.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of November, the stock and money market allocations
had changed places. Now, approximately 56 percent of total mutual
fund assets of $5.369 trillion are invested in stocks, with 26
percent in money markets and 18 percent in bonds. (The allocations
split the assets of hybrid funds among stock, bond and money market
funds.)
</P>
<P>
   The latest stock allocation is not far from the high of 58
percent of total fund assets reached in April of last year. That
month marked the peak of the Russell 2,000 index, a benchmark of
smaller-company stocks, and many equity mutual funds, which
generally invest in smaller stocks than those in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index and other large-cap market yardsticks.
</P>
<P>
   All of which demonstrates that even severe market turmoil does
little to change the investment patterns of mutual fund investors.
It remains to be seen, however, whether that will hold true in a
prolonged market downturn _ one in which stock prices fall over
several quarters rather than over just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   What is likely is that investors will funnel large amounts of
new cash into stock, bond and money market funds this month. In
three of the last five years, January has been the biggest month
for cash flows into equity funds, as investors turned their
year-end bonuses and payments into profit-sharing and other
retirement programs into mutual fund shares.
</P>
<P>
   Fund flows from 401(k) and other types of retirement programs
are likely to be one of the fund industry's sources of strength
this year, said A. Michael Lipper, chairman of Lipper Inc., a
division of Reuters Group PLC that tracks fund performance.

   Lipper, however, said he expected ``a definite slowdown'' in
money into equity funds for the remainder of 1999. Part of that, he
said, was a residual effect from last year when investors were
shaken up by the market swings. ``A lot of fund performance numbers
are going to be quite good on an absolute basis but people are
uneasy about the direction of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if January is not the single biggest month, January through
April is the industry's busiest season as investors make deposits
prior to the April 15 tax deadline. With baby boomers edging toward
retirement age, their children approaching college age, and stocks
providing the best outlook for long-term investment returns, those
trends are likely to continue. It is the rest of the year, however,
that the fund industry may have to watch out for.

THE STOICS HAVE A STAND ON EVERYTHING, EVEN ON DINNER PARTIES AND
SEX  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After being off the best-seller list for nearly 2,000 years, the
Stoic philosopher Epictetus has been revived, thanks to Tom Wolfe's
new novel, ``A Man in Full'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux).
</P>
<P>
   In prison, Conrad Hensley, one of Wolfe's main characters,
requests ``The Stoics' Game,'' a new spy thriller, but receives a
copy of Epictetus' ``The Stoics'' by accident.
</P>
<P>
   When Conrad discovers that Epictetus spent time in prison as a
young man, he can't stop reading. He begins to identify with
Epictetus, who was tortured, enslaved and threatened with death.
Conrad finds profound meaning in the philosopher's teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Epictetus was born a Roman slave in about A.D. 50. He was given
his freedom around 68, but later was exiled to Nicopolis in Greece,
where he taught logic, physics and the ethics of Stoicism.
Epictetus wanted each man to see that he alone was responsible for
his deeds because he had acquiesced to the circumstances that
produced them. The capacity to choose and refuse was of immense
importance in his philosophy. Epictetus wrote nothing, but his
teachings were set down by his disciple Flavius Arrian in the
``Discourses'' and the ``Encheiridion'' (``Manual'').
</P>
<P>
   Now you can see how your own New Year's resolutions stack up to
Epictetus' principles for living. Joyce Jensen compiled these
excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that you ought to behave in life as you would at a
banquet. As something is being passed around, it comes to you;
stretch out your hand and take a portion of it politely. It passes
on; do not detain it. Or it has not come to you yet; do not project
your desire to meet it, but wait until it comes in front of you.
</P>
<P>
   Be not elated at any excellence that is not your own. If the
horse in his elation were to say, ``I am beautiful,'' it could be
endured; but when you say in your elation, ``I have a beautiful
horse,'' rest assured that you are elated at something good that
belongs to a horse.
</P>
<P>
   Has someone been honored above you at a dinner-party or in
salutation or in being called in to give advice? Now if these
matters are good, you ought to be happy that he got them; but if
evil, be not distressed because you did not get them. Now it is the
same way also in life. You have not been invited to somebody's
dinner party? Of course not; for you didn't give the host the price
at which he sells his dinner. He sells it for praise; he sells it
for personal attention. Give him the price, then, for which it is
sold, if it is to your interest. But if you wish both not to give
up the one and yet to get the other, you are insatiable and a
simpleton.
</P>
<P>
   Some things are under our control, while others are not under
our control. Under our control are conception, choice, desire,
aversion and, in a word, everything that is our own doing; not
under our control are our body, our property, reputation, office
and, in a word, everything that is not our own doing.
</P>
<P>
   Do not seek to have everything that happens happen as you wish,
but wish for everything to happen as it actually does happen, and
your life will be serene.
</P>
<P>
   You can be invincible if you never enter a contest in which
victory is not under your control.
</P>
<P>
   Lay down for yourself, at the outset, a certain stamp and type
of character for yourself, which you are to maintain whether you
are by yourself or are meeting with people:
</P>
<P>
   Do not laugh much nor at many things nor boisterously.
</P>
<P>
   Refuse, if you can, to take an oath at all, but if that is
impossible, refuse as far as circumstances allow.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid entertainments given by outsiders and by persons ignorant
of philosophy. For you may rest assured that if a man's companion
be dirty, the person who keeps close company with him must of
necessity get a share of his dirt, even though he himself happens
to be clean.
</P>
<P>
   In things that pertain to the body, take only as much as your
bare need requires. I mean such things as food, drink, clothing,
shelter and household slaves; but cut down everything that is for
outward show or luxury.
</P>
<P>
   In your sex life preserve purity as far as you can before
marriage, and if you indulge, take only those privileges that are
lawful. However, do not make yourself offensive or censorious to
those who do indulge, and do not make frequent mention of the fact
that you do not yourself indulge.
</P>
<P>
   When you do a thing that you have made up your mind ought to be
done, never try not to be seen doing it, even though most people
are likely to think unfavorably about it. If, however, what you are
doing is not right, avoid the deed itself altogether; but if it is
right, why fear those who are going to rebuke you wrongly?
</P>
<P>
   Everything has two handles, by one of which it ought to be
carried and by the other not. If your brother wrongs you, do not
lay hold of the matter by the handle of the wrong that he is doing,
because this is the handle by which the matter ought not to be
carried; but rather by the other handle _ that he is your brother,
that you were brought up together, and then you will be laying hold
of the matter by the handle by which it ought to be carried.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of one who is making progress are: He censures no one,
praises no one, blames no one, finds fault with no one, says
nothing about himself as though he were somebody or knew something.
When he is hampered or prevented, he blames himself. And if anyone
compliments him, he smiles to himself at the person complimenting;
while if anyone censures him, he makes no defense. He has put away
from himself his every desire, and has transferred his aversion to
those things only, of what is under our control, which are contrary
to nature. In a word, he keeps guard against himself as though he
were his own enemy lying in wait.

COMIC MINDS MEET WITHOUT BAM! ZAP! OR SPLAT! 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A middle-aged guy with long, dirty hair and a sweatshirt was
weighing his options. ``Girls?'' he said, raising one hand like a
dish on a balance scale. ``Or comics?'' He raised the other.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, a younger man with red eyes, a turquoise mohawk
and eyebrows scarred from having too many rings drilled into them
pondered the comic book thoughts he has whenever he walks through a
door. ``The thing I find myself thinking is, `Now I'm going to go
through that door.' Is that the Captain America in me speaking or
my own comic brain?''
</P>
<P>
   It was just another academic gathering, a recent conference at
the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, to celebrate the 20th
anniversary of the first graphic novel. At the opening reception
the comics groupies were out in force. There was a buffet with two
kinds of fried chicken, warmed-over spanakopita, raw vegetables
with onion-soup dip and fluorescent lights.
</P>
<P>
   The guest of honor had no body piercings and no sweatshirt. He
was Will Eisner, the 82-year-old creator of the comic book hero
``The Spirit'' and the author of ``A Contract With God,'' the first
graphic novel, written in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who does not know, a graphic novel is a serious
literary work in comic book form, like Art Spiegelman's ``Maus'' or
Jules Feiffer's ``Tantrum.''
</P>
<P>
   If comics are ``those bright, colorful magazines filled with bad
art, stupid stories and guys in tights,'' as Scott McCloud jokingly
put it in his book ``Understanding Comics'' (Kitchen Sink Press,
1993), then graphic novels are their earnest offspring. The tights
are gone, the stories are often grim, and the drawing isn't exactly
comic.
</P>
<P>
   During the conference Eisner traced his own path through comics,
from strips to books to underground comics to graphic novels. In
the depths of the Great Depression, he said, newspaper comic strips
were so popular that pulp publishers started selling comics in
magazine form, as comic books. Soon there wasn't enough material to
fill them. Eisner started a company with his friend Jerry Iger to
produce new material. He worked with Bob Kane, the creator of
Batman, before Batman was born. Eisner created his own hero, the
Spirit, a masked, gloved dead man with no special powers. But
Eisner's heart was in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, it was censorship that opened the door to
literary comic books. In 1954 ``The Seduction of the Innocent,''
Frederic Wertham's book about the nasty effects that violent,
gruesome comics have on children, moved comic book publishers to
abide by a ``comics code,'' a self-imposed decency standard. Some
comic book artists cleaned up their act. The rest went underground.
The world of comics split into the cute and fantastical mainstream
and the down and gritty underground.
</P>
<P>
   Graphic novels grew from the second strain. In 1978 Eisner
created ``A Contract With God,'' a comic book story about Frimme
Hersh, a Jewish immigrant who becomes a slumlord when he discovers
that God has broken his sacred contract (if you are good, good
things will happen to you). The story was set on a street of
tenements in the Bronx. Eisner drew on life experience. He used
rain to connote emotion, which came to be called ``Eisner spritz.''
</P>
<P>
   Grim realism had come to the world of comics. A bond was forged
between American comics and the social realism of artists like Ben
Shahn and Kathe Kollwitz. (The imagery of many graphic novels seems
to be stuck in the 1930s.)
</P>
<P>
   There was something earnest and something hideous about them.
The playwright Tony Kushner once described the experience of
reading a book-length comic as ``thrilling, alarming, faintly
nauseating.'' He was describing a cartoon history of the Soviet
Union, it turns out, but he hit upon a truth about graphic novels:
``The flat black called to mind mud, excrement, and the burnt bones
that are the source of a carbon soot pure enough for India ink.''
</P>
<P>
   Graphic novels are anti-escape literature.
</P>
<P>
   Some artists didn't like it one bit. As Eisner recalled, Rube
Goldberg, the inventor of comic contraptions, scolded him for his
pretensions: ``We're vaudevillians. Never forget that. We tell
jokes!'' Eisner ignored him. And he even called his comic book a
graphic novel to get the attention of serious publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner's graphic novel has inspired others. Professors teach
courses on comic books and graphic novels in departments of
comparative literature, English and Judaic studies. (The creators
of Superman, Batman, Sandman, Mad magazine, ``Maus,'' ``Tantrum,''
and ``Julius Knipl: Real Estate Photographer'' were all Jewish.) A
course on Surrealism includes ``Gasoline Alley,'' ``Jingle Jangle
Tales'' and ``Krazy Kat'' as required reading.
</P>
<P>
   There are academic conferences. At this one, Samuel R. Delany, a
professor of comparative literature at the University of
Massachusetts, invoked Charles Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe and
Walter Benjamin to analyze Eddie Campbell's ``From Hell,'' a
16-part comic about Jack the Ripper. James Reibman, a Samuel
Johnson scholar, discussed the Gothic revival in ``The Crow,''
James O'Barr's ``saga of love and violent retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   A panel of scholars and cartoonists addressed the issue of black
superheroes. As William Foster, an English professor at Naugatuck
Valley Community Technical College in Waterbury, Conn., put it:
It's all fine and good to have comics with black schoolteachers
fighting drugs in the city, ``but who is standing toe to toe with
Superman?''
</P>
<P>
   Do comic books really deserve such sober treatment?
</P>
<P>
   At least some do, says James Young, the author of ``The Texture
of Memory'' and a professor at the University of Massachusetts,
Amherst, who spoke on behalf of Art Spiegelman's ``Maus.'' He
argued that this comic isn't just a shocking presentation of a
Holocaust story; it is the perfect form for it.
</P>
<P>
   The generation born just after World War II, he explained, does
not really have memories of the Holocaust. ``They remember what the
survivors passed down to them in diaries, stories, videos. What
distinguishes them is their sense of vicariousness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maus,'' he said, expresses that vicariousness better than any
other form could.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, ``the son, Artie, recalls what happened at the hand
of the father as the father recalls what happened at the hands of
the Nazis,'' Young said. The reader sees competing stories: what
the father says and what the son hears. The mixture of words and
images allows for that kind of layering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you read it is the way you make sense of things,
letting the eye do what it has got to do to get through a page.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, as McCloud argues in ``Understanding Comics,''
the real drama happens between the panels as readers are forced to
fill in the missing information.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why one of the tenser moments of the conference
happened between the panels: not during a lecture but at a lunch,
when some cartoonists and scholars turned to the question of the
proper way to read a comic book. Text first? Pictures first? Or
both together?
</P>
<P>
   One man said: ``I read the story first, then go back and look at
the pictures. It sets me up emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Cruse disagreed. ``It will diminish your enjoyment of the
story if you peek ahead,'' said Cruse, author of ``Stuck Rubber
Baby,'' a comic about a gay man coming out in the Bible Belt. The
pictures, after all, are ``about subtext,'' he said; they
``illuminate what's not being said, what's being avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Delany said he distrusted people who read comics without looking
at the drawings. ``It's like people who go to  &UR; see &LR;  the opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Inge, a humanities professor at Randolph-Macon Women's
College in Lynchburg, Va., said, ``For me an opera is to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Delany smiled, ``You're not a purist.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a purist? That hurts! Somebody call Superman!

for Sunday, Jan. 3, will move Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `a' category.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ECON-REVIEW (Washington) _ Impeachment vs. the economy.
Somewhere between Washington's certainty that the impeachment
controversy matters to the the nation and its economy, and the
markets' view that the such political wars and moral arguments are
irrelevant, lies a dynamic that seems bound to define 1999. By
David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   CRIME-REVIEW (Undated) _ Earlier this decade, some
criminologists and politicians predicted that a crime wave teeming
with a new breed of adolescent superpredators would emerge in the
late '90s. But it isn't happening. A look at possible reasons why
the predictions are wrong. By Jacques Steinberg. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ A real debate is emerging over
whether HMOs and other managed-care businesses can wring more
efficiencies out of the health-care system and therefore make money
over the long haul. While they prospered by taking advantage of
easy one-time savings, like the use of their clout to get doctors
and hospitals to accept less to provide care, their fat profits
could prove ephemeral in the face of medical costs that they, too,
cannot control. By Reed Abelson.
</P>
<P>
   NOSE-JOBS-REVIEW (New York) _ Amid an explosion in cosmetic
surgery, the number of nose jobs has dropped significantly. The
reasons are partly cultural and partly economic, according to
plastic surgeons who have watched the evolution of a procedure that
was once a benchmark in a young girl's life, especially among
Jewish teen-agers. By Jane Gross.
</P>
<P>
   CHARTER-SCHOOLS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Test-tube babies: private
public schools. A look at the growing focus on proposals for
charter schools. By Anemone Hartcullis.
</P>
<P>
   JOB-OPENINGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at some interesting and
unusual employment want-ads.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' catgeory:
</P>
<P>
   HITECH-WAR-REVIEW (Undated) _ Putting a high a premium on
bloodless combat and faith in high technology raises some troubling
questions. One is whether the electronic razzle-dazzle creates the
expectation, some would say illusion, in the American public that
the new weapons can accomplish every military mission, and
therefore that the loss of any GIs in a future operation is
tantamount to failure. By Serge Schmemann.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-HOMELANDS-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ Old scars on the new
South Africa: the homelands, which were designed in the apartheid
era to segregate blacks, were legally abolished in 1994, but many
blacks remain in these economically-depressed areas because of
family ties. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-REVIEW (Sihanoukville) _ Cambodia's choice: neither
truth nor reconciliation. In freeing Khmer Rouge leaders, Cambodia
is bucking a worldwide trend toward accountability. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   CASPIAN-U.S.-REVIEW (Almaty, Kazakhstan) _ As it helps funnel in
billions of dollars for oil development, the U.S. has wanted to
transform the Capsian nations into democratic and economically
transparent meritocracies. But as the Caspian leaders see it, they
have been willing to sign almost any agreement and have handed over
their oil fields, so why does Washington makes a fuss about their
corrupt and repressive politics? By Steve LeVine.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-SANCTIONS-REVIEW (Baghdad) _ The sanctions on Iraq do not
appear to be having the desired effect. What they are doing,

A MARRIAGE MAELSTROM INDUSTRYWIDE, AS THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY PLOT
THICKENS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Monday Jan. 4)

<P>
   After a year of page-turner mergers and major deals with
unexpected plot twists, the book industry is preparing for still
more radical changes that could come with further consolidation,
expanded online sales and increased clout for the nation's leading
bookseller, Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that we probably have experienced as an
industry more change in the last 12 months than in any period in
the history of the business,'' said Jack Romanos, president of
Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changed in every respect, from the mergers and
acquisitions activities on the publishing and distribution side to
the creation of the behemoth publishing company,'' added Romanos,
whose own company was recently split up by its parent, Viacom Inc.,
and its educational division sold to the British media conglomerate
Pearson PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the season for whale watching, with behemoths
swallowing behemoths: the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG
announced in March that it would buy Random House; then in October
it formed a partnership with Barnes &AMP; Noble in its online venture,
Barnesandnoble.com. A few weeks later, the bookstore chain
announced that it had agreed to buy the leading book wholesaler,
Ingram Book Group, a deal that seemed to roil the book industry in
the United States more than any other deal.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Brodwin, an associate partner at Andersen Consulting,
the management consulting firm, said that behind the scenes it was
apparent that some of the major publishers were starting to explore
counter moves.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the possibility, he said, that one of the major
Internet portal _ or Web gateway _ companies will use its
overvalued stock to invest in or buy a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that there are conversations taking place to put
together a consortium of some sort to counter the concentration of
power that the Ingram and Barnes &AMP; Noble combination represents,''
Brodwin said. Although he declined to name the companies, he did
say they might be considering a purchase of the second-largest
wholesaler, Baker &AMP; Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The publishers have lost power over recent years as retailing
has consolidated,'' Brodwin added. ``And to the extent that the
consolidation continues, the publishers will lose or are threatened
with further erosion of their market power, which could be
reflected in further price increases and pressures on terms of
trade such as credit.''
</P>
<P>
   The urge to consolidate has hit the entire book market _ from
regional distributors that are buying smaller independent
publishers to foreign media conglomerates that are forming
alliances across borders, including German acquisitions in the
United States or moves by the largest French publisher, the
Hachette Livre unit of Lagardere Groupe, to acquire a majority
stake in a British consumer book company, Orion Publishing Group.
</P>
<P>
   The unglamorous side of the business _ distribution _ has become
critical for publishing companies trying to deliver double-digit
profits for their corporate owners in a sluggish market for popular
books.
</P>
<P>
   From 1996 to 1997, consumer book purchases grew by less than 1
percent, failing to keep pace with population growth, according to
the Book Industry Study Group, a nonprofit research organization
based in New York, in its most recent report on purchase patterns.
</P>
<P>
   With sales growing slowly, distribution has become a critical
element for publishers and booksellers. It is particularly
important in the book fight that has gripped the leading online
booksellers, Amazon.com Inc. and Barnes &AMP; Noble, which are trying
to cut costs and speed delivery to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Middelhoff, the chief executive of Bertelsmann who
personally negotiated the deal to buy a 50 percent stake in Barnes
&AMP; Noble's online site, said he had set a goal of overtaking the
market-leading Amazon.com by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Most publishers and analysts expect online sales to increase
this year. Such competition is causing some trepidation among
independent booksellers, a group whose share of the market amounts
to 17 percent. Large chains make up 25 percent, but today most
books are sold outside traditional outlets, in discount stores,
warehouse clubs and book clubs, and through online retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet book-selling will grow significantly,'' said Albert
N. Greco, an associate professor of business at Fordham University,
who tracks the publishing industry. ``The speed, convenience and
availability of online retailing will overshadow traditional
bookstores and cut into their margins.''
</P>
<P>
   The electronic retail war has helped to push some of the bigger
alliances that have taken place, including the
Bertelsmann-Barnesandnoble.com-Ingram linkage. Such alliances are
raising broader questions about what the ultimate impact will be on
the diversity of literature in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overriding issue is increasing concentration,'' said
William Petrocelli, co-owner of Book Passage, an independent
bookstore in Corte Madera, Calif. ``I view it as a major threat to
writers and readers, as well as to independent booksellers. It
seems to me that as fewer and fewer people are making critical
decisions along the chain of distribution for books, the more
likely it is that diversity, quality and innovation will suffer.''

INVESTORS DEBATE THE PLUSES AND MINUSES OF DIVERSIFICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Jan. 4)  
(mk) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What good is diversification, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   After years of injury, watching the nation's stocks handily
outperform foreign stocks, owners of globally diversified equity
portfolios last year suffered the insult of seeing the value of
nearly all their investments decline during the summer downturn.
When the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 12 percent in the
third quarter, stocks in places like Japan, Switzerland and Mexico
also fell, offering investors little, if any, downside protection.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was not the only year in which diversification seemed
to provide little value. Over the last three years, investors whose
portfolios contained only U.S. stocks would have had better returns
with less volatility, according to Frank Russell Co., a Tacoma,
Wash., money-management and investment-advisory concern. Those
investors would have seen average annual returns of 27 percent
through November, compared with gains of 21 percent for people who
put a third of their money in a mix of foreign stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that a lot of people are questioning the
notion of diversification. Many individual investors are already
shunning overseas stocks, putting the bulk of their retirement
funds in domestic stocks. Even some professional investors are
throwing in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial advisers seem to be abandoning this idea as fast as
clients,'' said Paul Solli, managing director of Financial Design
Associates, an investment advisory firm in Larkspur, Calif. And
some institutional investors, like pension funds, have been slow to
rebalance their portfolios by taking money away from the booming
domestic market and moving it overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The events of the last year have clearly underscored the limits
of diversification. With the domestic markets soaring, despite a
few drops along the way, any foreign exposure has tended to reduce
the overall returns. ``It's the ugly side of diversification,''
said George Sauter, a managing director for Vanguard Group, the
giant mutual fund company. And when a global shock like Russia's
bond default occurred, the tremors were felt everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of diversification say that the last few years
have been atypical. ``It's been an exceptionally unusual run in
U.S. equities,'' said Ernest Ankrim, director of portfolio research
for the investment management business at Frank Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most troubling aspect of the last few years _ world
markets that moved together, defeating the whole purpose of
diversification _ may be a short-lived phenomenon, according to
David Harding, director of global investments for
Nicholas-Applegate, an investment firm based in San Diego. ``You
have had these periods where there is higher correlation, and they
have not lasted,'' he said. For example, correlations between
domestic stocks and their foreign counterparts rose for a while,
and then dropped in 1987 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the United States, few need convincing that
diversification still makes sense. Asian investors who put some of
their money in the U.S. market or some of the European markets
clearly benefited.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask an investor in Singapore, he would reply that it
worked,'' Harding said.
</P>
<P>
   Diversification also makes sense because no one anywhere knows
what the future will bring. While the U.S. market has lately been
the best performer, it is unlikely to keep beating other markets,
analysts say. During other periods, foreign stocks have performed
better than domestic stocks: Over the 10 years ended Dec. 31, 1992,
for instance, Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe,
Australasia, Far East index, or EAFE, gained an average of 17.1
percent a year, versus 15.4 percent annual returns for the Wilshire
5000 index, a broad index of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back in history, there is no one asset that
dominates consistently,'' said Arthur Micheletti, chief economic
and investment strategist for Bailard, Biehl &AMP; Kaiser, a
money-management firm in San Mateo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   When will diversification become popular again among American
investors? The probable answer is only after they have watched
their solidly domestic portfolios trail foreign stocks _ which
strategists say could be sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``To abandon diversification in this environment,'' said Ankrim
of Frank Russell, ``would be the poorest decision.''

 &QL; 
ROGERS&AMP;HART (Phoenix) - Before Rodgers and Hammerstein there was
Rodgers and Hart. Richard Rodgers and Larry (or Lorenz, to be
formal) Hart. The songs of Rodgers and Hart have a much different
sound, and in some ways, a more contemporary sound, than those of
the Rodgers and Hammerstein canon. Perhaps that's because few
lyricsts of any era, and hardly any of his, could match the
troubled Hart for wit and sophistication. A new PBS documentary:
``The Rodgers &AMP; Hart Story: Thou Swell, Thou Witty,'' airs Jan. 6.

CAT (Phoenix) - I have never thought of myself as a sentimental
man. If anything, as a card-carrying journalist, my credentials
read: ``cynic.'' And as such, I have had to come to terms with the
fact that one of the most important members of my extended family
was my tabby cat. My broad-faced tom was as good as human in my
mind. Perhaps better than human: He was animal. By RICHARD NILSEN.

ANGELS (Phoenix) - Are angels among us, or do we create them? We
know for certain that angels have appeared in art and scripture
since 3000 B.C. Angelology, the study of angels, was developed in
ancient Persia and absorbed into Judaism and Christianity. We also
know our concept of angels is changing. If you've seen ``City of
Angels,'' you know that people today might think they look a lot
like Nicolas Cage. And you may be asking a question: Are we
experiencing worldwide angel contact or worldwide angel hysteria?

TRAVEL PRICE RISES AHEAD FOR ROAD WARRIORS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Monday, Jan. 4)  
(DW) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time business travelers fly to their destinations, hop
into rental cars, check into hotels and sit down for meals, it will
most likely cost their employers 5 percent to 7 percent more than
it did last year. That is, if they are among the lucky ones who get
to travel at all.
</P>
<P>
   While even 5 percent would be almost double the 2.8 percent
inflation rate forecast for this year by PricewaterhouseCoopers,
corporate travel managers do not seem overly concerned, probably
because anywhere within that range would be an improvement over
last year's 8 percent rise over 1997 travel costs. If costs do
exceed expectations, corporations are not helpless to rein them in.
</P>
<P>
   For example, until the stock market started declining last
summer, corporate America had been content to impose travel
policies on employees at a measured pace. But by the fall that
gradual approach had become a gallop.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 450 major companies in October by the National
Business Travel Association found that 56 percent had cut back on
the number of employees who travel and 53 percent had replaced some
travel with videoconferencing and teleconferencing. In the wake of
big cutbacks recently announced by manufacturing companies and
financial institutions alike, there is every reason to assume that
travel costs will not escape corporate belt-tightening.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a preliminary projection of 1999 business travel
costs by American Express expects them to rise an average of 5
percent to 6 percent _ not much higher than the 4.8 percent rise
forecast by Runzheimer International, the management consulting
firm in Rochester, Wisc., and not much lower than the 7 percent
increase forecast by Travel One, the management company based in
Mount Laurel, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But the forecasters agree that all bets are off if, as American
Express put it, ``current economic turmoil overseas and stock
market instability in the United States translates into lower
demand for business travel.''
</P>
<P>
   A good many road warriors expect to see that lower demand. In a
recent survey of 1,348 frequent corporate travelers, compiled for
Business Travel News magazine by Plog Research Inc. of Reseda,
Calif., 49 percent said that they expected a decrease in company
travel this year and 56 percent expected a decrease in the number
of travelers.
</P>
<P>
   That survey did not pinpoint where the travelers expect the
decreases to come from, although the source of any substantial
savings is fairly obvious. Air travel accounts for 42 percent of
companies' travel and entertainment budget, according to American
Express, while meals and entertainment account for 22 percent,
lodging 21 percent and car rentals 8 percent. Communication and
miscellaneous items make up the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Since corporate travel managers know that, in the words of the
old adage, the place to go duck hunting is where the ducks are, the
most likely target for cutting costs _ on paper, at least _ is air
fares. Yet corporate travel managers do not expect air fares to
fall this year, although they disagree about how much they are
likely to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Runzheimer, for example, expects overall fares to rise an
average of 5.1 percent, but about 10 percent on the hundreds of
routes without nonstop competition. American Express has forecast
an average fare increase of 4 percent to 5 percent, while Travel
One expects domestic fares to jump a whopping 9 percent. It reasons
that airlines are in no big hurry to expand capacity even though
the number of passengers remains at record high levels, and that
except for Southwest Airlines and Pro Air in Detroit, low-cost
competitors have had little impact on business fares.
</P>
<P>
   If the forecasters are right, business fares to Europe will
increase about 6 percent, while fares to Asia and the Pacific
region may rise as much as 5 percent. While 5 percent is not out of
line with historic trans-Pacific fare increases, travel management
companies say any such rise this year will seem much higher in view
of the fact that just a few months ago some struggling Asian
airlines were practically giving away trans-Pacific tickets (many
of which were bought by American companies with business in Asia).
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the major airlines in the Asia-Pacific region survived
the 1998 economic crisis by restructuring routes and re-examining
capital expenditures to decrease operating expenses,'' said Clint
Cable, general manager of that region for Rosenbluth International,
the Philadelphia travel management company.
</P>
<P>
   The forecasters expect car rental prices to rise between 5
percent and 8 percent, the result of a combination of higher rates,
insurance, airport fees and surtaxes imposed by cities; for
example, Houston's average surcharge for midsized car rentals has
risen 24 percent since 1997, according to American Express.
According to Michael Boult, director of supplier relations for
Rosenbluth, ``Car rental is also a convenient target for higher
Federal, state and local taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The only break business travelers can count on are in restaurant
prices, which none of the forecasters expect to rise more than
about 2.5 percent. But given the large percentage of travel budgets
spent on meals and entertainment, corporations are still paying
close attention. Most of this scrutiny is in the form of spending
limits, but some companies are going beyond that. One major
midwestern company, for example, not only scrutinizes the
entertainment portion of expense accounts, but occasionally
contacts guests whose names appear on expense accounts _ ostensibly
to inquire if they found the food and service satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel rates have been climbing for several years and show no
signs of stopping or even slowing down. PricewaterhouseCoopers
projects a 3.9 percent increase, to $81.77 a night, an average that
includes budget and economy motels. For business travelers, though,
American Express forecasts a jump of 7 percent to 10 percent in the
top 25 business cities, while Runzheimer expects rates in downtown
hotels will rise about 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, New York's room rate has averaged $245 for several
months, 15 percent higher than in 1997, according to
PricewaterhouseCoopers, while a standard room at a luxury New York
hotel has ranged between $350 and $700 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Sky-high room rates and sky-high occupancies are also pretty
much the outlook for 1999 in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Washington, and other major cities _ depending, of
course, on the stock market's gyrations and the global economic
health.

COMPARING NEW YORK, LONDON AND PARIS: A SIMPLE TEST

<P>
   It was the year of the library. Last summer, London inaugurated
the new British Library; in October, Paris witnessed the grand
opening of the new National Library of France; the next month the
New York Public Library unveiled its renovation of the Main Reading
Room at its flagship 42nd Street branch.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent as the years went by.
So, now that their doors are open, which is the best?
</P>
<P>
   With help from Alan Riding in Paris, Sarah Lyall in London and
Joyce Jensen in New York, The New York Times undertook a completely
unscientific and unofficial comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation of the New York Public Library's 85-year-old
reading room was by far the most modest of the endeavors, and the
only one that was privately financed: the real estate developer
Frederick Rose and his wife, Sylvia, paid for the make-over. It
took 16 months and cost $15 million. Richly colored murals,
sculptured ceilings dripping with gold leaf and big windows
prompted one veteran user to call it ``the Versailles of New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Library at King's Cross, which took 36 years and
$843 million to complete, threatened to become one of the biggest
white elephants London had ever seen. But it opened to rave
reviews, winning praise for its imagination and detail, from its
soaring airy spaces to its automatically adjusting lighting.
</P>
<P>
   The National Library of France, which took 10 years and cost
$1.5 billion, was promoted as ``the first library of the third
millennium.'' Almost immediately after its October opening, a major
breakdown of the computer controlling the delivery of books to
researchers was followed by a strike of 800 members of the
library's 2,800-member staff. The strike was settled after 17 days,
but the research area will be closed on Sundays and Mondays through
Jan. 31 and on Sunday and Monday mornings through June 30 while the
library further tests its computers and trains its staff.
Researchers are not happy, but prefer this to a complete shutdown
of the research area. (The public area is working well and is open
daily except on Mondays.) And because of the computer problems, the
automatic delivery of books within 20 minutes has been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The National Library of France was the snootiest (no place to
even ask a research question) and also served the worst food
(although the New York Public Library avoided this question
altogether by not serving any food inside the building).
</P>
<P>
   For the key comparison _ waiting time for books _ the libraries
were asked to produce a classic work of fiction, ``I Promessi
Sposi,'' by Alessandro Manzoni, and one of nonfiction,
``Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy,'' by Jacob Burckhardt.
(The Manzoni was written in Italian, the Burckhardt in German, so
there would be no hometown language advantage.)
</P>
<P>
   The race opened with New York and London neck and neck:
Burckhardt made it out of the stacks a bit more quickly in London
than in New York, but the British Library suffered a heartbreaking
setback when an unusual glitch delayed the arrival of the Manzoni
for hours. Alas, Paris, because of its human and mechanical woes,
was left at the starter's gate.

than 1998, which, to borrow Queen Elizabeth's mournful phrase, was
an annus horribilis for some of the United States' biggest
insurance, hospital and physician practice companies.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of mediocre earnings, and only small
increases in profits last year, many big health-maintenance
organizations have raised premiums 8 percent to 20 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The managed-care companies are racing to push their revenue
ahead of the growing cost of care, especially for heavily
advertised prescription drugs, as well as new surgical equipment
and more consultations, tests and referrals to specialists by
physicians. Incomes of many types of doctors continued to rise last
year, and hospitals, with notable exceptions, thrived.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs generally set their monthly premium charges based on
estimates extrapolated from past experience. Seriously misjudging
costs, as several big companies did last year, invites financial
trouble _ premiums typically cannot be raised again until the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the managed-care industry's losses in 1998 are worse than
expected, 1999 is unlikely to be a stellar year _ the early 1999
pricing is already locked in,'' said Arun Kumar, a director of
Standard &AMP; Poor's. ``It will probably be a break-even year, with
small profits, if any at all.''
</P>
<P>
   And Robert Reischauer, former director of the Congressional
Budget Office and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution,
said employers might resist HMO price increases now that growth in
corporate profits is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   The difficult conditions are likely to be reflected in another
round of health-care mergers and acquisitions. Aetna Inc. agreed
last month to buy the Prudential Health Care unit of Prudential
Insurance Co. of America, making Aetna the nation's biggest
managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some recognizable players won't be here in a year _ they will
be absorbed by other companies,'' said Dr. Peter Kongstvedt, a
partner in the Washington office of Ernst &AMP; Young.
</P>
<P>
   Several of last year's big losers are still not out of the
woods. ``There are alarming signs of fragility in the corporate
health-care sector in an otherwise strong economy,'' said Jeff
Goldsmith, an independent consultant based in Charlottesville, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente, the nation's biggest HMO, with 9 million
members, reported big financial losses for the second consecutive
year. (It is, however, projecting a tiny profit in 1999.) Oxford
Health Plans, one of the largest HMOs in the New York region, was
also struggling with red ink. And state regulators in New Jersey
recently took control of the 194,000-member HIP Health Plan of New
Jersey, the troubled unit of Health Insurance Plan of Greater New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, too, have had some rough times. Columbia/HCA
Healthcare Corp., the nation's biggest for-profit hospital chain,
was still struggling to shed unprofitable units, regain the
confidence of customers and investors, and settle government
charges that fraudulently inflated expenses were charged to
Medicare and other government programs.
</P>
<P>
   The government also joined a lawsuit last year based on similar
charges against Quorum Health Group Inc., another hospital company.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, the 13-hospital nonprofit Allegheny Health,
Education and Research Foundation system filed for bankruptcy
protection in July. Tenet Healthcare Corp., a for-profit hospital
chain, agreed to buy eight Allegheny hospitals in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   There was also trouble for companies that bought the practices
of physicians. Medpartners Inc., once a high-flying player in
physician practice management, left that business, casting doubt on
the ability of physician groups to meet Wall Street demands for
quarterly earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance premiums are again rising more rapidly. And that means
employers will be paying more for care, adding to pressure on
profits and, potentially, prices.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who pay for their own care faced especially steep
increases in monthly premiums. The alternative was to pray for good
health and go without insurance. The pool of uninsured people
continued to rise by more than 1 million annually, to 43.1 million
in 1997, the latest information available from the Census Bureau.
The increase also reflected overall population growth and welfare
policies that forced millions of low-income people off state
Medicaid rosters.
</P>
<P>
   Economists, while admitting that they often misjudged the
strength of the economy, said a general slowdown would swell the
ranks of the uninsured and add to pressures on Medicaid, which is a
major, if not the largest, item in most state budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in federal payments for Medicare has also slowed, cutting
into a formerly lucrative business for many managed-care companies.
Last year, HMOs in 30 states announced they were leaving
unprofitable Medicare markets, forcing more than 440,000 elderly
Americans to scramble to replace their coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar of Standard &AMP; Poor's said a ``legislative backlash'' might
try to restrain managed-care companies from exiting certain markets
by threatening to blackball them statewide.
</P>
<P>
   On another cost-sensitive front, recent federal laws are
straining the computerized information systems of health plans just
as computer problems related to the year 2000 are casting a broad
shadow, Kongstvedt of Ernst &AMP; Young said. The HMOs must computerize
their Medicare systems and must also track measures intended to
show the quality of care they provide.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We will know in 1999 whether the health plans and Blue Cross
plans will be able to make it past the year 2000 problems,''
Kongstvedt said. If their computer systems cannot distinguish
between the new year and 00, meaning 1900, they may have to go to
outside contractors for information services.
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs would also be vulnerable to computer glitches at the
federal Medicare financing agency, state Medicaid programs and
managed-care drug companies, and in the records and billing systems
of hospitals and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Adding yet another big uncertainty for managed-care companies,
lobbyists for doctors and consumers have pushed through
patient-protection laws and regulations in most states that the
health-maintenance organizations say will raise their costs.
Similar proposals are likely to be revived in Congress, where they
were blocked last year by insurance and employer lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs were manipulated ``into doing the job that most other
companies have to do for themselves'' _ squeezing down expensive
services, said Ian Morrison, a health-care consultant and senior
fellow at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are going to regulate them and prevent them from doing
the things they were supposed to be doing in the first place.''

   New Money, New Sign. But How to Type It?
</P>
<P>
   With the birth of the new multinational European currency, the
euro, comes the necessity of referring to it somehow in documents
and messages. This week many a busily keyboarding finger will
encounter its first euro figure and stop in midair: Which key to
hit?
</P>
<P>
   Most world currencies are signified by ordinary letters, like
the German mark (DM), but dollars and pounds have familiar, easily
typed symbols of their own ($ and the British pound sign.) Desiring
the same cachet, the European Union created a euro ``glyph'' and
asked the computer and software worlds to accommodate it somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it's a case of one currency, many approaches.
For instance, Microsoft decided that the symbol should take on the
look of whichever type font is in use when it is typed, but Apple
Computer thinks its look should never vary.
</P>
<P>
   On new Windows keyboards sold in Europe, the right-hand ``alt''
key and the ``e'' key struck together will make the euro symbol; in
America, at least for now, users will have to depress the alt key
and type 0128 on the numeric keypad. And that's only if the
computer's type fonts are of recent-enough vintage _ the last few
months or so _ to include the symbol.
</P>
<P>
   In new Macintosh fonts, the euro symbol replaces a little-used
international currency symbol, a circle with four spokes, usually
obtained by striking option-shift-2.
</P>
<P>
   Typewriter users (remember typewriters?) will have to fake it.
One euro-symbol Web site recommends a capital C overstruck with an
equal sign.
</P>
<P>
   Valiant Efforts
</P>
<P>
   Yoshiko Masuda has a plan to save the Tomihisa neighborhood of
Tokyo from obliteration by encroaching development. Ms. Masuda, an
architect, wants to tear the neighborhood down and rebuild it,
small wooden houses, narrow back alleys, tree-studded parks, shrine
and all, on top of a new seven-story building. City planners think
the idea has promise.

IRS ANTICIPATES YEAR 2000 PROBLEMS THIS SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Jan. 4)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For taxpayers, the pesky software flaw known as the Year 2000
problem could cause lots of trouble _ not in the year 2000, but
this spring, when the IRS processes 1998 income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   The problem will be felt a year early at the IRS because the
service must, early this year, reprogram all its computers to be
ready for next year. Some of these still use technology developed
when Dwight D. Eisenhower was in the White House. The IRS must also
process 124 million individual tax returns and millions of
corporate and other returns so that it will be ready for the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, IRS executives are trying to reorganize a
bureaucracy with 110,000 employees and change its culture from one
of deep suspicion of taxpayers to one dedicated to helping them
comply with increasingly complex tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   If things go badly, Americans can expect all sorts of foul-ups,
like lost tax returns or an occasional anticipated refund check
emerging from IRS computers as a demand for millions in additional
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a bad filing season, it will be the upcoming one,
because this is the period when the service has to test whether
they are going to be Y2K-compliant,'' said Michael Murphy, a former
senior IRS official who is executive director of the Tax Executives
Institute, a Washington organization for corporate tax officials.
``If they can't demonstrate it in this filing season, they are
going to have difficulties in the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Rossotti, commissioner of internal revenue, said, ``Our
task is like changing the engines in the plane while you are still
flying.''
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, such a situation would virtually assure a
disastrous crash. But Rossotti said that while he anticipated there
would be some unusual and unexpected problems for taxpayers, there
should not be many, and only a few people should be affected. ``It
shouldn't be too bad,'' he said, ``but people need to understand
that 1999 really is going to be the risky year for us, not the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Among government agencies that could experience disasters
because of Year 2000 problems, none faces a bigger challenge than
the IRS, which still uses huge reels of magnetic tape, rather than
modern disk systems, to store and process data.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti likens the main IRS data center in Martinsburg, W.Va.,
to a living museum of early computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Martinsburg center's relics of data-processing past
operate in a tenuous electronic marriage with highly complex
databases that are supposed to link each section of the tax code,
each regulation, and each schedule of taxes, penalties and interest
to the appropriate lines on thousands of different tax forms _
those completed by taxpayers and those used by the IRS to generate
notices.
</P>
<P>
   A big concern is that with the complications introduced by
reprogramming, this marriage might become a communications problem
that would thrust taxpayers into a nightmare of bizarre notices and
demands or into a void where their information would vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Groups like the National Association of Enrolled Agents have
alerted their members to be on the watch for bogus notices and to
send them on to its national headquarters in Washington. Joseph
Lane, an enrolled agent in Bellevue, Wash., who serves on a
national advisory panel for the IRS, said, ``Tax practitioners are
all geared to watch for indications of programming glitches, such
as oddball notices saying, `You owe $35 million,' and we have an
early warning identification system.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane said he expected few problems, however. ``So far as I know,
they have done enough systems-acceptability testing.''
</P>
<P>
   To process the torrent of tax returns each spring, the IRS
operates 10 paper-pushing factories around the country, commonly
known as the Pipeline. In these sprawling complexes, clerks open
letters, sort the returns, assign numbers to track the documents,
enter most of the data from the returns into computers and then
review the results for accuracy before deciding which returns need
immediate attention and which can be boxed for storage.
</P>
<P>
   The Pipeline is from an era when department stores had wooden
floors and charge slips were rolled up and put in metal canisters
that were moved by wire-and-pulley systems to clerks on other
floors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, part of the Pipeline, the IRS Philadelphia Service
Center, suffered a breakdown, brought on in part by inadequate
computer systems. Some employees ended up shredding some tax
returns and putting others in the trash so that they could appear
to be meeting work quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., has been holding hearings on the
administration's progress in dealing with Year 2000 issues. He gave
the Treasury Department, of which the IRS is part, a grade of C in
November, up from D-plus 90 days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS was not among 25 individual departments and agencies
given report cards, but Horn singled out the service for praise in
its efforts to deal with the problem, saying that Rossotti, a
former computer systems executive, was ``an outstanding
commissioner who understands this problem better than others in the
administration'' and was moving the service to ``the cutting edge
of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti also said that the complex changes Congress had made to
the tax code were creating new difficulties for the service's aging
computers. He cited new protections for ``innocent spouses'' as a
prime example. ``Innocent-spouse relief requires separating the tax
liability of spouses,'' he said, ``but our computers are not
equipped to deal with proportionate liability.''

TO THE BEAT OF THE BLEAT, RANCHERS AIM TO SATISFY THE DEMAND FOR
GOAT
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas, Calif., Okla., N.J.) (For release Sunday, Jan. 3) 
(bl) 
By KATE MURPHY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Like many other families across America, Salvador
Ortega's sat down on Christmas Day to a dinner featuring big,
savory helpings of the traditional holiday entree: roast goat.
</P>
<P>
   Goat, not turkey or ham or roast beef, is the meat of choice for
festive occasions in Ortega's native Mexico. ``We cook it on the
barbecue with garlic, hot peppers and spices,'' said Ortega, who
owns La Michoacana, a small chain of grocery stores in Houston that
caters to Hispanic consumers and sells more goat than beef.
Mexican-Americans are among a number of growing ethnic populations
with a taste for goat meat _ when they can find it in stores.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of short supplies, however, is not going unnoticed
by ranchers. Some of them, seeing the booming demand for goat meat
and the availability of improved breeding stock, are starting to
trade in their dogies for billies.
</P>
<P>
   Meat goats are still a niche business. There are one million to
two million meat goats in the country, according to Frank Craddock,
a goat specialist at Texas A&AMP;M University _ too few for the
Agriculture Department to bother keeping detailed statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pinkerton, a retired professor of animal science at
Langston University in Langston, Okla., who has studied the
industry, estimated that consumers bought about $50 million of goat
meat last year, a figure dwarfed even by the $653 million spent on
lamb and mutton _ never mind beef, chicken or pork.
</P>
<P>
   Though the goat herd has doubled in the last two years, Craddock
estimated, ranchers still cannot keep up with demand from meat
packers and retailers serving Hispanic, Asian, Muslim, Greek
Orthodox and other ethnic communities in the United States and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Batca, who owns one of the biggest goat-meat packers, Halal
Meat U.S.A. of Paterson, N.J., said his company could slaughter and
sell far more goats to Muslim groceries and restaurants in the New
York area, but is held to 1,500 to 2,000 a week by tight supplies.
``I can't get any more than that,'' Batca said.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1993, goat ranching in the United States mostly involved
breeds like angora that are raised primarily for wool. But the
repeal of the Wool Act in 1993 ended generous subsidies to angora
ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys had to find a way to stay afloat,'' Craddock said,
so they crossed their angora and Spanish farm goats with South
African Boer goats, which are more muscular. ``They get to salable
weight in a third of the time as other breeds,'' said Rebecca R.
Harris, executive secretary of the International Boer Goat
Association, a breeders' group based in Bonham, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The transition wasn't cheap. Purebred Boer breeding stock was
suddenly in such demand that it sometimes fetched $40,000 a head.
As the domestic population has grown, though, prices have pulled
back to $1,500 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of the nation's meat goats are raised in Texas;
they can live on land there where sheep or beef cattle struggle or
need supplemental feed. ``Texas is an ideal environment, because
we've got a lot of woody brush that goats thrive on,'' Craddock
said, whereas cattle and sheep need grassy pastures. Indeed,
meat-goat producers even lease out their animals to clear overgrown
land at $100 an acre. ``The place will look like a park when
they're done,'' Pinkerton said. Also, meat goats need no milking or
shearing and rarely require medication, so they are much less work
for ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   Those advantages and the steady growth in demand for goat meat
have attracted converts from beef-cattle ranching, including
William Banker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boer really helped us out,'' said Banker, whose JABB Goat
Co., with 5,000 head on 10,000 acres in Orange Grove, Texas, near
Corpus Christi, is now one of the nation's largest producers.
</P>
<P>
   Boer and hybrid Boer nannies, as female goats are known, give
birth twice a year. The kids reach 60 to 80 pounds and are ready
for slaughter after 3 to 6 months. Ranchers get 80 cents to $2 a
pound for the goats; the meat will eventually sell at retail for
$2.50 to $6 or so a pound. Prices are highest when demand peaks
around the Christmas and Easter holidays and certain Muslim
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Most goat ranchers have a few hundred head, but new operations
with more than 5,000 head are proliferating. In Roxton, Texas, the
year-old Continental Chevon Co. has 6,000 head of its own and an
additional 5,000 under contract from smaller ranchers. ``We aim to
be the Tyson of goats,'' said Stuart Weiss, a co-owner.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss' ambitions extend beyond the Caribbean countries and
ethnic groceries in the United States where Continental has made
sales so far. He said he was trying to develop a ``high end''
market, by encouraging fine restaurants to put goat on their menus
and asking gourmet markets to place it next to quail and venison in
their meat cases.
</P>
<P>
   Goat-meat fajitas can already be ordered at trendy restaurants
in Dallas and Houston, and roast goat shoulder is served at Chez
Panisse in Berkeley, Calif. Goat meat may also have a future in
health food stores, because it is organic, free-range and lean,
with only three-fifths the saturated fat of skinless chicken, Weiss
said.
</P>
<P>
   The taste of goat meat is sometimes described as a cross between
venison and mutton or lamb. Because it is so lean, it can be chewy
and tough if not marinated a long time before cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Olsen, a livestock and meat marketing specialist for the
Agriculture Department, said the agency is working on a goat-meat
quality grading system much like those for other meats; the
proposed standards are to be released for public comment by the end
of January, with a final version to be adopted in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do this right,'' Olsen said, ``they might just start
serving goat burgers at McDonald's.''

CHINA THRIVES, BUT CRITICAL YEAR LIES AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Jan. 4)  
(lb) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ While much of Asia stagnates, China is still
growing at a relatively healthy rate.
</P>
<P>
   Economists had predicted throughout last year that China would
eventually follow its neighbors on a downward spiral, but it has
stubbornly refused to slow down. Its economy grew nearly 8 percent
last year and is expected to grow more than 7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main reasons: an ambitious spending program by the
government and an unrelenting appetite among consumers. Falling
exports have devastated other Asian economies, but in China the
domestic market is so large and so hungry for consumer goods that
it almost does not matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though exports are pretty flat, the growth rate is
steady,'' said Andy Xie, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter in Hong Kong. ``We expect that to continue in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   This year will be critical for China. As the country's leaders
proceed with a painful program of weaning state-owned industry from
endless government hand-outs, raising the specter of huge layoffs,
they are eager to spur other forms of employment.
</P>
<P>
   The omnipresent danger is that if the economy slows suddenly,
millions of newly unemployed urban workers could cause unrest. But
if the economy continues to grow steadily, small companies are
expected to absorb the vast majority of those workers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, leaders decided last year to start a New Deal-type
spending program on infrastructure projects. State investment in
fixed assets, the best measure of China's government spending,
totaled about $190 billion in 1998, up 22 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike that of many of its neighbors, China's government has the
resources to keep spending heavily. Largely because there are few
investment choices available in China, ordinary citizens have
deposited $600 billion in state-run banks, giving the government a
deep well to tap for its spending.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, some of the building projects that started last
year were financed with a special $12 billion bond sold by Beijing
to its banks, which were forced to buy it with customer deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The country's $130 billion foreign debt is relatively well
managed, mostly in medium-term and long-term debt. It is also
backed by $144 billion in foreign-exchange reserves, making the
risk of an external debt crisis minimal, in contrast with those
that caused collapses elsewhere in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is a developing country that must strengthen development
of its railway, highway, higher education and medical-care
sectors,'' said Hu Angang, a senior government economist in
Beijing. ``China's accelerated urbanization, environmental
protection and ecological projects offer vast opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Overcapacity in a wide array of sectors, however, has led to a
sharp decline in prices. While inflation was a top concern a few
years ago _ it peaked at 24 percent in 1994 _ the main retail price
index actually fell 3 percent in 1998. Inflation is expected to be
about zero this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased market competition has forced many companies to
adopt a strategy of less spending for product upgrades,'' said a
recent economic analysis by the official New China News Agency.
``China's ongoing reform of the housing and medical-care sectors
have led to a retrenchment in spending, and massive layoffs have
sharpened the public's awareness of the possibility of financial
instability.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chinese authorities announced that monthly measurements of
prices fell again in November _ by 2.8 percent _ it marked the 14th
consecutive monthly decline in the retail price index. Retail
prices fell 2.9 percent in October and 3.3 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
   The government has responded by trying to halt deflation with
new rules on minimum prices and by cracking down on smuggling,
which has become a serious problem recently.
</P>
<P>
   At an economic conference in Beijing last month, the country's
top leaders set their priorities for 1999. The priorities include
shoring up domestic demand, halting the slide in exports, reforming
state-owned companies and increasing wages for urban and rural
workers. That is a tall order, yet the overall outlook remains
promising.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders also promised not to devalue their currency, the
yuan, this year. Rumors that China would be forced to devalue
echoed around Asia throughout 1998. Yet it fed on an analysis of
statistical figures that fundamentally misunderstood political and
economic reality in China today.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there are some reasons for Beijing to devalue, like
the need to spur exports at a time when the economy is weakening,
when foreign investment is falling and when millions of urban
workers are facing unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are deeper reasons for Beijing not to devalue. China
is in the middle of a wrenching shift from a state-run to a
market-oriented economy, trying to sell the bulk of its
government-owned industries, and probably the last thing leaders in
Beijing want is a further cause of disruption.
</P>
<P>
   Making China's exports cheaper, many economists argue, is an
inefficient way to strengthen its economy. In the long run, they
say, maintaining the currency makes economic sense by providing a
stable environment for investment, foreign and domestic.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, one of the causes of China's current stability is
that its economy is not yet fully integrated with the rest of the
world. China's currency is not freely convertible, so there is
little immediate market pressure on the yuan.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Beijing's decision-making process is weighted
heavily toward political concerns, not market sensitivity. Although
China's leaders face internal lobbying from exporters, they seem to
stake far greater political capital on their promise not to
devalue.

WORLD ECONOMIES ON A TIGHTROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Jan. 4)  
(rl) 
 By SYLVIA NASAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last fall, with global financial markets imploding and recession
fears rampant, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve,
told a group of business forecasters that he had been ``looking at
the American economy on a day-by-day basis for almost half a
century'' but had ``never seen anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even Greenspan could have foreseen the chain reaction that
began with a currency crisis in tiny Thailand. Who would have
thought that stock markets as distant as Moscow, Rio de Janeiro and
New York would tumble like dominoes? Or that an avalanche of
bankruptcies and the near collapse of the high-flying hedge fund
Long-Term Capital Management would follow and credit markets around
the world would virtually freeze up? Or that a series of three
modest interest-rate reductions by the Fed _ and similar actions by
its counterparts abroad _ would restore calm and confidence in a
matter of weeks?
</P>
<P>
   Predicting the economy's ups and downs has always been tricky.
</P>
<P>
   History is full of famously wrong forecasts, from the economist
Irving Fisher's assertions throughout the Depression that recovery
was imminent, to Greenspan's statements two months after the 1990
recession began that chances of a downturn were minimal.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-year study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a
private group in Cambridge, Mass., concludes that growth estimates
for the year ahead typically err by 100 percent or more and that,
computer age or no, they have become no more accurate over time.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when economists were sure a slowdown was in the
works, proved a case in point: growth was much faster and inflation
and unemployment stayed much lower than predicted.
</P>
<P>
   What now? The economic expansion that began in 1991 is about to
become the second-longest since America entered the industrial age
in the late 19th century. This alone suggests that the likelihood
of recession is rising, but almost no one is predicting one in the
foreseeable future. And even economists at J.P. Morgan, one of the
few bears, say such a downturn will be ``the shortest and mildest
recession we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most economists say that this year is going to look the
way they thought 1998 would look. Growth is supposed to slow
sharply, profits to shrink, inflation to creep up, unemployment to
edge up a bit. The Blue Chip consensus of 50 forecasters expects
growth to slow to 2.2 percent, compared with 3.7 percent last year,
and inflation to accelerate to 2.2 percent from 1.6 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they may be wrong. But that is exactly the kind of soft
landing that Greenspan and other central bankers have been hoping
for.
</P>
<P>
   Three forces, economists say, may bring it about: a sluggish
world economy, a growing profit squeeze and a less than ebullient
stock market. The unsettled global economy should continue to drag
down growth in the United States. Merrill Lynch expects growth in
the 45 biggest economies to slow to just over 1.25 percent, from
3.5 percent in 1997 and 1.75 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's economies, which absorb a third of American exports, are
likely to keep shrinking, though not as fast as last year _
assuming that Japan will hit bottom. South America, which accounts
for one-tenth of American exports, will merely stagnate as long as
Brazil doesn't collapse; growth for the continent should be around
1 percent. Mexico, as big a trading partner as South America and
struggling with the effects of plunging oil prices, is already
slowing. As monetary union begins, Europe will be growing about 2
percent, down from nearly 3 percent last year. Some of the biggest
risks from abroad continue to be financial.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly aggressive easing by the Federal Reserve and
foreign central banks has reduced but not eliminated the global
liquidity squeeze. Even now, AAA-rated corporate bonds are still
more than 2 percentage points over Treasury bonds, only slightly
below the recent peak spread of 2.25 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``While equity markets are roaring ahead, credit markets are
still depressed,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill
Lynch. ``That will slow growth because the marginal borrower is not
able to get credit.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing pinch on corporate profits, already under way in the
last six months, is also likely to retard growth. Per-share
operating profits for the companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index are down 3 percent from a year ago. Total corporate
profits reported by the Commerce Department are also lower than a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Profit margins are beginning to erode, and there is no relief in
sight. The problem is that incredibly tight labor markets _
unemployment is now 4.4 percent and job growth remains solid _ have
been pushing wages up faster than robust productivity gains. Thus,
labor costs per unit of output have been rising inexorably. With
lots of excess capacity at home and abroad, a result of the 1990s
investment boom, most companies are finding it impossible to pass
along higher costs to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pricing power out there in corporate America right
now,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the stock market is not likely to give the economy much
extra kick, the way it has in recent years. Although stock prices
no longer look as outrageously high as they did a year ago,
somewhat lowering the risk of a plunge, few forecasters expect
American households to keep reaping the huge capital gains that
have propelled spending faster than income.
</P>
<P>
   Economists expect these forces to affect individual parts of the
economy in various ways. The trade deficit will continue to widen,
but, barring another international crisis like last summer's, the
deterioration is not likely to be as sharp as it was in the last
year, when it shaved 1.5 percentage points from growth. This is in
part because slower growth in business and consumer spending means
less of a surge in imports.
</P>
<P>
   Capital spending, booming in the first half of last year, has
already flattened. Most economists are predicting sluggish growth,
but not outright cuts in spending, in the 12 months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that may cause spending to keep rising is that
capital is a bargain right now. ``I can buy more,'' said Ken
Matheny, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Government has not contributed much to spending in the last few
years, and 1999 will be no exception, despite a small lift from the
$500-per-child tax credit and the emergency spending measure passed
in October to skirt the spending caps.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, who have been spending all their income and more, are
due to behave in a more restrained manner. They have been on a
tear, with car sales stronger last year than at any other time in
the last decade. Most economists expect consumer spending to grow
about 2.5 percent this year, about half of last year's pace and
roughly in line with income growth. One reason is that job growth
is apt to slow as the profit picture continues to darken.
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board, one of
the most bullish forecasting groups last year, says consumers will
surprise forecasters once more. He says last fall's rash of layoff
announcements by Fortune 500 companies has led to an exaggerated
sense of how fast the labor market is weakening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hullabaloo about layoffs is ridiculous,'' Goldstein said.
Most job cuts since 1991 have been by attrition, he added. And
first-time claims for unemployment insurance were no higher in
December than they were a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The red-hot housing market is also set to cool. It is still in
great shape, with new construction of single-family homes running
at its most rapid pace in 20 years. But few people expect mortgage
rates, already the lowest in a generation, to keep falling, so
fewer families will be refinancing. And fewer families will be
cashing in stock market gains to renovate or trade up. Besides,
housing starts have been outpacing family formation for several
years.
</P>
<P>
   With all the uncertainties, the only sure thing is that things
will not turn out precisely as predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Arrow, a Nobel laureate in economic science, likes to
tell his students the story of a group of statisticians (of which
he was one) in the Pentagon during World War II who were
responsible for forecasting the number of rainy days in Europe a
month ahead of time. At some point, the statisticians concluded
that the forecasts were worthless and asked Gen. Henry H. ``Hap''
Arnold, chief of the Army Air Forces, for permission to stop making
them. After a few weeks the following reply came from Arnold: ``The
commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good.
However, he has to have them for planning purposes.''

STRATEGIES: TO FORECAST 1999, DON'T DWELL ON '98

<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm going to break with the tradition of most year-end market
retrospectives, which tend to highlight a few of last year's events
and pontificate on their grand significance for the new year.
Instead, I will argue that most of what shook the markets in 1998
has little or no significance for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the stock market suffered its most severe
correction in years, but that tells us nothing about what stocks
will do this year. Nor is the crystal ball brought more sharply
into focus for knowing that small-capitalization stocks were
massacred in the first three quarters of 1998 before coming to life
again in the last three months. The same goes for virtually every
other event that has received so much attention in year-end
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Let me hasten to add I do not think the markets are entirely
random. They aren't. But we need to rise above the statistical
noise of the market's month-to-month and even year-to-year
gyrations, and to focus on developments that are much more
long-term.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the meaning of last year's correction. According to my
reading of data from Ibbotson Associates, a Chicago research firm,
we are neither more nor less likely to experience a correction or
bear market in 1999 because of the summer selloff of 1998. We can
make that conclusion by going back much further _ to 1925, in fact
_ and examining the market's historical performance over seven
decades.
</P>
<P>
   In all the years since 1925 that followed a correction of at
least 10 percent, the market has produced an average gain of 11.8
percent a year and has risen 65 percent of the time. Those figures,
however, are not all that different from the market's overall
averages: During all the years since 1925, the market has returned
an annual average of 13 percent and risen 70 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you might say, consider the performance of small- and
large-cap stocks. Don't year-over-year trends in their relative
performance tend to persist? That's the conventional wisdom, but I
wouldn't bet the house on it.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, according to the Ibbotson data, that there is a
slightly-better-than-even chance that the relative performance of
small caps in any given year will be the same as in the previous
year. But it is not as well known that the pattern is heavily
dependent upon 10 of the last 75 years _ the period from 1974
through 1983, a period in which small caps outperformed large caps
every year. If you take away that decade, the statistical basis for
the conventional wisdom essentially disappears, and you are left
with a random relationship between the year-to-year relative
performances of small- and large-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   My skepticism about short-term phenomena extends to the track
records of financial advisers, too. This month, many investors will
choose a mutual fund, pension fund or newsletter on the basis of
how it performed in 1998. Who can blame them, with the financial
press inundating them with myriad lists of the best and worst of
1998? But one year is not nearly enough to separate those advisers
and managers with genuine ability from those who are merely lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a hypothetical portfolio that always invested in the
previous year's market-beating newsletters. Specifically, imagine a
portfolio that every year would be divided equally among all
newsletters that beat the market the previous year. For the 18
years that I have monitored the newsletter industry, such a
portfolio would have made a dismal 6.8 percent annualized return _
about what you could have earned in a money market fund. The stock
market itself gained 16.4 percent a year, on average, over this
period.
</P>
<P>
   Not all track records, however, are this unhelpful. My research
shows that past performance is meaningful only when measured over
periods of more than five years, and preferably more than 10.
</P>
<P>
   It thus makes more sense for investors to pay attention to what
the top-performing newsletters are saying over the long term. On
balance, they are cautiously bullish, with an average recommended
equity exposure of 60 percent. Only one of the top five _ Fabian
Premium Investment Resource _ advocates full investment; another,
Dow Theory Letters, is outright bearish.

LASZLO BIRINYI JR.: SEEING MORE FIRE IN THE EYES OF THE BULL
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 3) 
(bl) 
By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As 1999 begins, it is hard to make the case that stocks will
continue to race ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are high, earnings are declining and the economy seems to
be running out of gas. Many people who don't believe in lengthy
corrections _ let alone bear markets _ have never lived through
one.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those were just the sort of arguments making the
rounds this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   Laszlo Birinyi Jr. does believe in corrections, has lived
through a bear market and has heard the arguments before. But in
fairly stark contrast to most of his colleagues, he is wildly
bullish for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Birinyi, who runs his own stock market research firm and serves
as global strategist for Deutsche Bank Securities, was pretty much
right a year ago. He took some time last week to discuss his
forecast for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Q. By the end of this year you are projecting some fairly
eye-popping numbers for the major averages: over 12,000 on the Dow
Jones industrial average, 1,500 on the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and
2,800 on Nasdaq. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. I like the market for one major reason: I continue to see
strong buying on weak days, which is the market telling me the
outlook is positive. To me, people who are buying stocks on down
days are smart money people.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But aren't prices already much too high?
</P>
<P>
   A. Price-earnings multiples don't trouble me too much, because
they apparently don't trouble investors. During this decade, the
best earnings comparisons on a year-over-year basis occurred in
1994, which was also the worst year of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings are important, but there are times when the correlation
with stock prices is faulty. What I am suggesting is that by
looking at the flow of funds, we are seeing strong sentiment and I
think that is a very underrated factor. The basic rule of the
business is: Don't fight the tape. And what the tape is telling an
old trader is that people are continuing to put money into stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But what about the economy? Capital spending is slowing, Asia
is still in the dumps and Latin America seems on the verge of
recession. We got through all that last year. Can we do it again?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the economy is a bit better than people anticipate.
We see stocks that are economically sensitive, like Caterpillar and
International Paper, attracting money. That tells me the economy is
more likely to surprise on the upside than the downside.
</P>
<P>
   But I always like what John Maynard Keynes had to say about the
stock market. He said the critical issue is not the business cycle,
but the psychological cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, what would get you worried?
</P>
<P>
   A. I would get upset if we get carried away. Last year, more
money went into money market funds than equity funds. That tells me
individuals are still a little bit in check. If I start to see
money from money market funds flowing into stock funds, then I
think we might be a bit too euphoric.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A year ago your favorite stock was America Online, which has
gained more than 500 percent. What about this year?
</P>
<P>
   A. We still like America Online. There has been a net inflow
into that stock of almost $6 billion this year, including a
substantial amount during the correction last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Any other favorites?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a number of stocks, especially in technology, like
Intel and IBM. If you look around, at least in the business world,
very few people are giving out fax numbers. But they are giving out
e-mail and Web site addresses. If there was a dominant fax machine
manufacturer, that company would be a good stock to short.
</P>
<P>
   Our favorite brokerage stock is Charles Schwab, which at the
moment has a bigger market capitalization than Merrill Lynch, if
you can believe that. But we also like Time Warner, Bristol-Myers
Squibb, Philip Morris and Wal-Mart. I think the sleeper sector of
the year could be energy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Those are all big companies. People keep saying small-company
shares will outperform. You don't share that view, do you?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think big-cap stocks will continue to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   The market value of the entire Russell 2000 index is roughly
equal to the market cap of General Electric plus Microsoft. In the
mid-1970s, small-cap stocks had a couple or three years when they
did extraordinarily well. But since then that has not been the
case. And the reason is the individual investor, who is now the
market's driving force. Individuals are much more focused on things
they know, use and buy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And the United States is where to invest?
</P>
<P>
   A. I like this market above all others. You still have the Asian
problem, which makes other places less enticing. And people will
have questions about Europe as the monetary union is implemented.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A year ago, Madison Avenue was asking: Will 1998 be
as busy a year for agency and account acquisitions and
consolidations as 1996 and 1997 were?
</P>
<P>
   Now, after enduring another frenetic 12 months, Madison Avenue
is asking another question: How could anyone have even asked that
question? As a result, few are asking the question about 1999; the
tumult of the last three years is widely expected to keep on
keeping on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of acquisitions will continue,'' said Lauren Rich
Fine, an analyst who follows advertising for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in
New York. ``Some of that stems from the large agencies' need for
market share growth that clients alone can't satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you get market share growth,'' she added, ``that can
stave off any uncertainties about what clients will do'' about
their ad budgets for the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Vick, president and chief operating officer at Young &AMP;
Rubicam Inc. in New York, echoed Ms. Fine. ``The consolidation of
agencies is not over by any means,'' he said. ``There's no doubt
the multinational communications companies will continue to get
bigger and stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   As mergermania rages, said Edward Meyer, chairman, president and
chief executive at Grey Advertising in New York, ``we're all
focusing much more of our attention on marketing services'' outside
the realm of traditional advertising like direct marketing, sales
promotion and media buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made three acquisitions in the media business in the
last year,'' Meyer added, ``and we're in there trying to buy
whatever is still around.''
</P>
<P>
   James Dougherty, advertising industry analyst at Prudential
Securities in New York, said he agreed that deals in marketing
services ``and other specialty communications will clearly
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   That will come, he added, as spending for advertising and
marketing campaigns remains relatively strong.
</P>
<P>
   Despite dislocations in local economies, ``I think the
advertising industry's rolling,'' Dougherty said. ``While there are
some soft pockets, there are no really serious signs that
conditions in 1999 will be materially different from 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason he gave was that ``you now have a real engine
of growth in the United States,'' where ad spending is rising at a
higher rate than overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``One percent growth in the United States,'' Dougherty said,
``is worth a lot of Taiwans.'' America is the world's largest
single advertising market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketers, the guys who make stuff, have already gone through
growing profits by lowering costs and saving money,'' said Alan
Gottesman, managing director at West End Communications/Consulting
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the way to grow profits has shifted from saving more to
earning more,'' he added, ``and the way to earn more is to sell
more stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will drive marketing service companies' revenues over the
next couple of years,'' Gottesman predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like saying, `The answer is up; what was the
question?''' he said, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Russell, an industry analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter in New York, listed three reasons he was optimistic about ad
spending in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One is ``the continuing thrust from the pharmaceutical
industry,'' he said, to advertise prescription drugs directly to
consumers. The second is the growing number of campaigns to
discourage smoking that are sponsored by state and federal
governments. The third reason is the rising demand for Internet
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is not interesting as a percentage of total ad
spending,'' Russell said, ``because it seems to be 1 percent for
every business. But its very growth makes it interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick at Y&AMP;R said he believed that ``the rate at which electronic
commerce transactions take place on the Web will triple by the end
of next year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not only because of the technological explosion,'' he
added, ``but because people will finally realize their Visa is no
less secure online than at the Gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Some anticipate that conditions for the advertising industry
will improve further in the final months of 1999 as the year 2000
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have an Olympics and a presidential election in 2000,''
Dougherty of Prudential said, both of which stimulate demand for
commercial time and ad space, ``and the millennium on top of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer at Grey is also bullish on the millennium, predicting that
it will generate significant spending in the form of contests,
sweepstakes and other promotional pitches.
</P>
<P>
   As for what advertisers will tell consumers about 2000, ``the
messages will run the gamut,'' Meyer said, ``from boring
seriousness to outrageous mockery.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. In other words, not unlike advertising before the
millennium.

GOING ALONG FOR THE RIDE IN THE AUTO RACING RUSH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., N.C.) (For release Sunday, Jan. 3) 
(bl) 
By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball, basketball, hockey _ such is the televised fare on
which American couch potatoes have long gorged themselves. But
these days, it is auto racing that captures more TV viewers than
any sport except football, according to A.C. Nielsen, the ratings
company.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, attendance at auto races is growing at the breakneck
pace of 10.5 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, auto racing stocks roared ahead 31.3 percent, according
to Wheat First Union, a brokerage firm in Richmond. That compares
with a 26.7 percent gain for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
and a 3.5 percent loss for the Russell 2000 over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The run-up has everything to do with shifting tastes. Once
perceived as a working-class pastime in the Southeast's tobacco
belt, auto racing has gone national, and fancy new facilities are
being built in large markets from Fort Worth to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, television networks have been paying more for the
rights to broadcast the races. The rights to broadcast the three
dozen races in the Winston Cup _ the premier stock car racing
series _ generated $79 million in broadcast fees last year,
according to Tom Thomson, an analyst at Wheat First Union, up from
$49 million in 1997. For 1999, he expects $93 million.
</P>
<P>
   Investors can gain exposure to racing by buying the shares of
track owners. ``The way the business is structured is very
favorable,'' said Scott Barry, an analyst at Raymond James &AMP;
Associates. ``These are wildly profitable companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue chip is International Speedway, of Daytona Beach, Fla.,
which owns the track where the Daytona 500 is run. The company is
headed by Bill France Jr., who is also chief executive of NASCAR,
the National Association for Stock Car Racing, the sanctioning body
that awards Winston Cup race dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have the best company in the group with
International Speedway,'' said Scott Swanson, an analyst at Roger
Engemann &AMP; Associates, a money management firm in Pasadena, Calif.,
that owns 350,000 shares of the company. The stock, which closed
Thursday at $40.50, sells for 36.8 times 1999 projected earnings of
$1.10 a share. Swanson said the stock could reach $45 or more in
the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway Motorsports, based in Harrisburg, N.C., has the same
number of Winston Cup race dates as International Speedway _ 10.
But its tracks have more seating, the source of its higher margins
_ 19.5 percent, according to Thomson, whose firm holds a seat on
the company's board. Barry calculates the group's average net
profit margin at 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway Motorsports stock closed at $28.50 last week. Thomson's
12-month target is $42.
</P>
<P>
   Penske Motorsports, run by Roger Penske, the former driver who
built a network of automotive companies, has struggled this year as
a result of declining attendance at Indianapolis 500-type race
events. These races, which feature so-called ``open wheel'' race
cars, are not as popular as the NASCAr variety. Still, some
analysts think that Penske, now trading at $26.625, has more
potential for investors than Speedway Motorsports. Barry has a
12-month price target of $32 on Penske.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are risks in the sector. Weather-related delays
in races can hurt television ratings, raise costs and depress
earnings. The small-capitalization stocks are volatile, and they
tend to run up before the start of the racing season in February,
Barry said. Best to wait until April or May, he added.

STARS OF STAGE, SCREEN AND SOCIAL STUDIES CLASS
</HEADLINE>

 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ These days, almost every car is safe,
reliable and performs well,'' Gregory Brew said. ``Now, the trick
is to provide that extra little something that creates attachment
to an inanimate object.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brew speaks, Detroit, Stuttgart and Tokyo listen. As the
assistant chairman of the transportation design department at the
elite Art Center College of Design here, he is training the
20-something students who are expected to come up with the next big
things in cars _ the future equivalents of the Chrysler minivan,
the Mazda Miata and the Jeep Grand Cherokee, vehicles that captured
the hearts and wallets of a generation.
</P>
<P>
   The talent, empowered by computer-aided design and emboldened by
the anything-goes spirit of pop culture, is certainly out there.
There is only one catch, Brew suggested: With basic transportation
needs largely sated and manufacturing technology giving auto makers
the flexibility of short-order cooks, car design is entering an era
of ``creative anarchy'' in which individual customers have as much
say about what their vehicles look like as the designers.
</P>
<P>
   Back up a minute. By most measures this is a golden age for car
design. Prodded by global competition, the garish, unreliable land
yachts of the 1970's have morphed into the durable, luxurious
people movers of the 1990's, whose significant shortcoming is their
bland sheet metal. Family sedans tend to look like Toyota Camrys
and compacts look like Honda Civics and sport utilities aspire to
be Ford Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Even this tendency to conformity seems to be self-correcting,
though, as European auto makers, hard-pressed to compete on cost,
are distinguishing their products with provocative designs. Enter
the New Beetle, the Mercedes M-Class sport utility, the Audi TT
coupe, the BMW M Coupe. Equally impressive, but not seen on this
side of the Atlantic, are the elegant Alfa Romeo 156 sport sedan,
the high-tech Mercedes-Benz A-Class micro-van, the playful Renault
Twingo subcompact, the buglike Fiat Multiplia.
</P>
<P>
   This enthusiasm for arresting design has hardly been spent. Soon
to make a splash are two products from Mercedes-Benz: the
superluxurious Maybach and, on European roads, the eight-foot-long
Smart city car. Meanwhile, radical chic is trickling down to
budget-priced cars as Ford keeps pressing out its sharply creased
New Edge look and Volkswagen completes its curvaceous lineup with a
new Jetta.
</P>
<P>
   What comes next? One safe prediction is that eye-catching colors
and unusual materials will proliferate. The New Beetle's
imaginative use of textured plastic and tropical dashboard
lighting, Audi's use of brushed aluminum interior fittings (which
accent the all-aluminum body of the Audi A8) and the Mercedes
SLK230's electric-orange leather interior represent the wave of the
near future. With auto makers depending ever more on distinctive
design to defend high-margin niche markets, parts suppliers must
bend to the demand for variety. ``If we ask for headlights that are
two feet wide and two inches high, we'll get them,'' said Brew, who
moonlights as a senior designer for BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Another good bet is greater attention to the needs and wishes of
women, who are making ever more purchasing decisions even while
they are breaking into the male ranks of car designers. While there
is little evidence that women prefer their cars warm and fuzzy _
the very macho BMW Z3 roadster has been a hit with female buyers _
they do seem more concerned with the practical. And auto makers are
responding with extra doors on pickup trucks, high-intensity
headlights for middle-age eyes, extra 12-volt outlets for
electronic gadgets, side-impact and head-protection air bags and,
of course, cup holders in every cranny.
</P>
<P>
   Tisha Johnson, 28, who is finishing her degree at Art Center
College, thinks this trend is in its infancy. With the help of
dirt-cheap microprocessors and electronic sensors, she notes, there
are no barriers to producing ``intelligent interiors'' that adjust
music and lighting to the driver's mood, or that select video
programming to educate the restless six-year-old in the back.
``Cars should adjust to the needs of their passengers,'' she said,
``not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Brew envisions a rapid proliferation of models, in large part
because customization is now possible. Computers have sharply
shortened the cycle from sketch to working model, and a host of
changes in process engineering have slashed the cost of producing a
run of just a few hundred or a few thousand vehicles. The next big
step, he suggested, is custom manufacturing in which a car is
tailored to its buyer like a Savile Row suit.
</P>
<P>
   That will generate some very tangible benefits for drivers who
do not fit the common-denominator specs. ``There are millions of
women under 5-foot-2 who can never be comfortable in a
mass-produced car,'' Brew said, and a lot of them, he guessed,
would gladly pony up a few thousand dollars more for seats,
steering columns and controls that are made to measure.
</P>
<P>
   It could also mean endless variety in what cars look like.
Indeed, Brew speculates that the trend will lead to entirely new
ways to market personal transportation _ one built around the
increased durability of key parts and the falling cost of making
vehicles different.
</P>
<P>
   A car tailored to individual body shapes and tastes, he notes,
will not have much value to a second owner. By the same token,
there won't be much need to scrap cars built with
corrosion-resistant materials and engines that go 100,000 miles
between tuneups. Hence, he envisions a future in which individuals
keep cars much longer, but pay for frequent facelifts and add-on
frills.
</P>
<P>
   That is an enticing vision for consumers, one analogous to the
breakdown of rules in the fashion industry and the rise of clothing
that felt as good as it looked. But it could prove hard on auto
makers, who will be caught between the demands of the marketplace
and the wish to preserve brand identities. And it could prove even
harder on the next generation of designers, who may never realize
the dream of producing the distinctive vehicles _ the jelly-bean
Taurus, the E-Type Jaguar _ that became as familiar as the faces of
movie stars.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Windswept heavy snow will lash a large area from the central
Mississippi Valley through the southern Great Lakes as low pressure
moves northeast from the lower Mississippi Valley. The strong winds
will cause blowing and drifting of the snow, reducing visibility to
near zero at times.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, snow will mix with ice over southern Indiana to
southern Ohio as warm air arrives a few thousand feet above the
ground. South of the Ohio River mainly rain will fall as strong
breezes from the south develop.
</P>
<P>
   Bands of potent thunderstorms with heavy rain and a few
tornadoes will sweep east from the southern Mississippi Valley as a
cold front surges into the region. Behind the front, colder and
drier air will spread from the southern Plains to the western Gulf
of Mexico coast.
</P>
<P>
   After a frigid dawn in the Northeast, clouds will increase.
Light snow will spread from the eastern Ohio valley on Saturday
morning to southern New England on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, patches of freezing rain and sleet will develop
near the southern Appalachians, where a shallow layer of cold air
will be overrun by warmer air. Any ice will change to rain
throughout the Southeast and Middle Atlantic States by Saturday
night, as mild winds from the Atlantic increase.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, heavier snow will mix with ice on Saturday night
while coastal areas of southern New England have a change to rain.
Increasing onshore winds will cause coastal flooding from the
Carolinas to New England.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, mainly dry weather will prevail. Offshore winds
will keep the California coast unusually warm.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Cold Funnels
</P>
<P>
   Cold-air funnel clouds descended ominously from the clouds over
Lake Champlain on Friday. Cold-air funnels are typically innocuous,
hovering like alien spacecraft and seldom lowering to the ground.
Unlike tornadoes, which rely on steamy surface air to initiate
thunderstorms that spawn twisters, cold-air funnels form despite a
lack of sultry air near the ground. Instead, they depend on pools
of cold air several thousand feet aloft to promote rising, rotating
columns of air. As pressure lowers in the spinning column,
condensation occurs just below cloud base, revealing the funnel
cloud.

NEWSPAPERS ARE TRYING NEW MARKETING TECHNIQUES TO WIN LOYAL
READERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Texas, Ariz., N.C.) (For release on Monday, Jan. 4)  
(nk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most newspapers, the numbers game played out in the
twice-yearly audited circulation figures has been a losing
proposition for the last 14 years. The figures, which are often
considered a basic measurement of the industry's economic health,
have dwindled more than 10 percent, to slightly more than 56.7
million copies from a peak in 1984 of 63.4 million newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, reactions have ranged from a heavy dose of
price-cutting to a willingness to exercise unused marketing
muscles. But this year a new set of remedies is being readied as
some newspapers prepare to sell themselves in different ways and
different places on different days. Others are enlisting the people
in their circulation area as partners in their marketing drives.
</P>
<P>
   To find the latter strategy one need only head to New England,
to the Blackstone Valley area of Rhode Island. There, The
Providence Journal is betting that the devotion of communities to
their high school athletes can translate into permanent circulation
gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal, bought (along with nine television stations) in
1997 by the A.H. Belo Corp. of Dallas for $1.5 billion, is not
fiddling around with its pricing. Its cover price has been 50 cents
since August 1990. Instead, it is looking for targeted sports
coverage to produce targeted circulation gains.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot program last spring to marry sports coverage, marketing
and circulation is becoming routine this winter. It gives high
school athletic directors a chance to propose which of their
athletes should be profiled in articles designed for the editions
delivered to the neighborhoods around the school.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the newspaper interviewed and profiled the teen-age
volleyball or baseball or soccer players every Tuesday and
Thursday. Before publication, high school assembly announcements
mentioned the upcoming articles. Stores and newspaper boxes in the
neighborhood heavily promoted the player profiles. The work was
recognized as a largely promotional vehicle; the athletes sign
legal releases before participating in the interviews and photo
sessions, according to Peter Phipps, the newspaper's deputy
managing editor.
</P>
<P>
   Such blending of journalism and marketing has been taboo at many
newspapers, but the economic payoff was quick: The pilot program
pushed single-copy sales up 7 percent, about 250 copies, according
to Michael Dooley, the Journal's circulation director.
</P>
<P>
   And the new readers appear hooked; The paper has held on to
those circulation gains, helping stem a long-term decline that has
left the Journal with a daily circulation of 167,381 _ down about
24 percent from its daily peak of 219,000 in 1982. This year, the
program is being moved to the areas around Pawtucket and Woonsocket
in the Blackstone Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal, like many other newspapers, is also working to keep
subscriber revenues steady by asking home-delivery subscribers to
pay and renew by leaving credit card information on file with the
company. The number of subscribers who pay by credit card is still
small _ 7,000 out of more than 125,000 subscribers _ but it is more
than double the 3,000 of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, there is the same kind of credit card push, and the
circulation strategies are becoming more complex and
computer-dependent. Leon Levitt, the circulation director for The
Arizona Republic, said he was trying to make it more attractive for
subscribers to renew by using the growing data base of demographic
and economic information on its customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Republic wants to use data it gathers on subscribers to
decide, for instance, which readers would stay with the paper if
their discounted $2.25-a-week offer were continued, and which
readers would continue to take the paper even when the introductory
offer ends and the $3.80-a-week rate starts. After it kicks in, it
may also mean giving away papers to lower-income subscribers for
two months to win their loyalty, Levitt said.
</P>
<P>
   While The Republic is in a market most of Levitt's peers would
envy _ booming with new residents _ its circulation growth has not
kept pace with the region's population growth, he said. As of Sept.
30, it was selling an average of 435,330 copies daily and 553,495
on Sundays, down about two-tenths of a percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Another option being tried by several newspapers _ including The
Republic, which is owned by Central Newspapers Inc., and The
Charlotte Observer, owned by Knight Ridder _ is finding new
middlemen. Apartment managers take out subscriptions at a discount,
and they in turn offer it to tenants as part of the rent. In other
programs, customers pay for cable and newspaper service in one
bill.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the bygone days of the newsboy collecting
quarters door to door. But John Murray, vice president of
circulation marketing for the Newspaper Association of America,
points out that the Internet, like television, is creating a
generation of news consumers with no habit of paying for the
product. This, he said, makes direct payment increasingly
problematic. More of the cost, he believes, will be borne by
advertisers _ who already provide about three-quarters of the
industry's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Republic is also refining another strategy, though it is not
quite ready to put it into action. Instead of the old trio of
subscription options _ Monday through Saturday, Monday through
Sunday and Sunday only _ he wants to experiment with
have-it-your-day offerings. For someone who does not want to read
the paper on Monday or Tuesday but wants the grocery coupons on
Wednesday or Thursday or the entertainment news on Friday, why not
a Wednesday-Thursday-Friday-Sunday subscription?
</P>
<P>
   ``Up till now, we've been in the habit of doing things for our
convenience,'' not the customer's, he said, adding that the key is
developing an electronic route list that can change daily and that
carriers can download in the predawn hours before they begin their
routes. There is even talk, he said, that porch delivery _ as
opposed to leaving a paper at curbside _ could be offered for a
premium.
</P>
<P>
   Like the days of delivery, the bundle of paper delivered may
also be streamlined to suit the customer, he said. ``The biggest
stopper any salesman gets,'' Levitt said, ``is people saying they
have no time to read. We've been almost our own worst enemy. The
product gets bigger and bigger with more bulk, and that's not what
people want.'' Electronic route lists, based on refined subscriber
data bases, could shrink the pile of daily inserts. ``Advertisers
could give inserts for just people with pools or just people who
wear glasses,'' he said.

FOUR EUROPEAN COUNTRIES STAY OUT OF MONETARY UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Jan. 4)  
(lb) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The European Union's single currency, the euro, was
meant as an act of unification. But initially at least, it has
created a division among the 15 member nations.
</P>
<P>
   While 11 of the nations are in the monetary union, four _
Britain, Denmark, Greece and Sweden _ are not. And that means a
bumpy adjustment for all of them. Effectively, the four ``out''
countries have forfeited direct influence over the currency's
evolution; yet such is the scale of the new currency _ second only
to the U.S. dollar _ that it will transform markets and trade
throughout the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four, only Greece _ which, as the European Union's
weakest economy, failed to meet the criteria for the euro _ would
have preferred to tie its currency, the drachma, to the euro. Like
other southern European nations, Greece sought to hitch its economy
to the powerhouses of France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Europe, however, the view of the euro is quite
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe tends to be viewed as a good thing if you are, for
example, one of the southern countries where there's a clear
economic benefit from European Union transfers and lower interest
rates,'' said Katharina Hoyland, an economist with J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co. ``The political and economic benefits are much less obvious
from a Scandinavian perspective, where there are some concerns that
as a small country they'll lose sovereignty to Brussels.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are certain to be economic reverberations for the
four countries as their currencies fluctuate in value against the
euro.
</P>
<P>
   Though Denmark has an agreement with the European Central Bank
to support its currency, the krone, within a narrow band against
the euro, all three of the northern countries had currency problems
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The economic crisis in Russia exposed the Danish and Swedish
currencies to market jitters in September, forcing the Danish
central bank to intervene and raise interest rates, while the
Swedish currency sank in value. British exporters have complained
that their ability to compete has been hurt by the strength of the
pound against the German mark, the strongest currency in the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The four nations are expected to pay a premium for remaining
outside the monetary union, in the form of higher interest rates.
The risk is least acute in Denmark, which has pegged its rates _
currently 3.5 percent _ to euro averages. In Sweden, the deputy
central bank governor, Lars Heikensten, said his country was ``in
no hurry'' to lower its short-term benchmark from 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's interest rate is 6.25 percent, despite three rate cuts
in three months. Greece, always an economic and political maverick
in the union's affairs, has the highest rate of all, 12.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 euro nations agreed last month to start the euro with an
interest-rate target of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the risk that foreign investors in Europe will
shun nations outside the monetary union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine you are a United States investor and you look at the
euro area and say, `This is a great consumer market,''' said Cyril
Blesson, an economist with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``Everything
else being equal, would you invest outside it? No.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an issue even for Britain, which has long attracted
investment and business from the Continent because of its cheaper
skilled labor and lower taxes.

   ``The broader question is whether being out is going to make
investors want to locate somewhere in the euro area rather than in
London,'' said David Mackie, an economist with J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The debate over the euro is being closely watched in Britain,
which has the largest economy of the four outside countries. Some
economists see advantages in remaining outside the monetary union
at a time when British short-term interest rates are roughly twice
as high as the norm in the euro countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with being in EMU is that you have got to accept a
common interest rate from the north to the south,'' said Mackie,
referring to Europe's Economic and Monetary Union, which underpins
the euro. ``And that interest rate may or may not suit you.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Britain's own unresolved debate about joining the
euro is almost certain to fuel disputes over such issues as the
position by France and Germany that some tax rates within the 15
European Union nations should be more closely aligned _ a move seen
in Britain as threatening the competitive advantages of low
corporate and other taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll probably be bickering about lots of things,'' Mackie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, there is the betting about when the four out
countries will join the euro. Greece says it will be ready by 2001.
And the odds are that Denmark and Sweden, where public opinion
surveys suggest that resistance to the euro is easing, will join by
2002, when euro notes and coins come into circulation.
</P>
<P>
   This timetable could leave Britain as the last one out. Even
though Tony Blair's Labor government is much more welcoming to the
euro than its Conservative predecessor, it remains leery of public
opinion broadly opposed to the new currency. That inevitably means
a delay in deciding whether Britain joins. The government says it
will hold a referendum on membership only after the next election _
and that may be more than three years away.

TV NETWORKS CONFRONT NEED FOR RADICAL CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Jan. 4) 
 (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The network television business will enter the last year of the
century groping to find a strategy that will insure its future
profitability, and even viability.
</P>
<P>
   But discovering such a strategy is becoming increasingly
difficult, because the paradoxes about the networks almost
outnumber the hit programs:
</P>
<P>
   _ There has never been more revenue in the network industry _ an
estimated $15 billion plus. Yet there have never been bigger
losses. Only one network, NBC, is truly profitable, and even its
profits are in decline.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cable networks with fractions of ratings, like MTV and
Nickelodeon, are making much more money than broadcast networks,
which have several times as many viewers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Advertisers continue to pay increased rates for diminishing
audiences, because they want to reach large groups of viewers at
the same time. But they refuse to pay networks for all the viewers
they have, paying them only for certain viewers, mainly young
adults.
</P>
<P>
   _ To accommodate the desires of advertisers, broadcast networks
are increasingly trying to brand themselves _ the young adult urban
network (NBC and ABC), the young male network (Fox), the teen-age
girl network (WB) _ even though that brings them closer in identity
to cable networks, thus erasing the distinction that makes them
more appealing to many advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The kind of programming that still attracts reliably large
audiences, sports events and hits like ``E.R.,'' has become so
expensive that it often makes sense only as a loss leader. But
without it, viewers seem to drift away in even bigger numbers,
meaning that the networks face a choice of either losing money to
gain viewers or losing viewers, which eventually means losing
money.
</P>
<P>
   Contemplating the implications of these challenges, many
broadcast network executives now envision the need for nothing
short of a reinvention of their business. The new model is centered
on greater ownership of shows, much tighter cost controls on
programming, new sources of programming that move the networks away
from reliance on the big Hollywood studios and less (or no) money
going to affiliated stations for carrying network shows.
</P>
<P>
   But accomplishing these goals can merely be started in the next
year, even while the networks are in the midst of the same old
ratings competition that has driven their decision-making for the
last half of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``How bold do you think any of these executives can be when they
know their jobs are on the line if they don't produce results in
the next sweep month?'' asked one former network president.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, late last year two networks, NBC and Fox, removed their
head programmers, replacing them with executives who built their
careers at cable channels. Those moves were widely interpreted as
the first sign that the broadcast networks have to adopt a
``can't-beat-'em-join-'em'' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   At Fox at least, where the new president of entertainment, Doug
Herzog, is arriving with one cable program, the outrageous animated
series ``South Park'' as the most prominent entry on his resume,
the goal seems to be to play even more aggressively to the
network's core audience, the young men who watch little television
but love ``The X-Files,'' ``The Simpsons'' and specials featuring
elephants stomping their trainers and drivers crashing into
abutments.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog said he would try to finesse the distance between risky
ideas and broadly appealing programs.
</P>
<P>
   He also underscored his confidence that Fox was the place to be
for the future of network television because of the carefully
assembled assets of its parent, News Corp. It has brought all the
production functions inside the company, achieving what is called
vertical integration, which Herzog said is the only route to
success. That means Fox will get a heavy quotient of its programs
from the 20th Century Fox television studio. It will get movies
from Fox's movie studio; news from Fox News Channel, and sports
from News Corp.'s ever-expanding sports empire.
</P>
<P>
   The other network already set up for this asset alignment is
ABC, which, thanks to its corporate parent, Walt Disney Co., enjoys
similar access to movies and sports. The Disney television studio
is openly committed to producing shows that will specifically help
ABC.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The two fledgling networks, WB and UPN, which spent this year
going in opposite directions (up and down, respectively), exist
specifically to establish a distribution system for their corporate
family's studios (Time Warner's Warner Brothers and Viacom's
Paramount), presaging a move by the networks to own most or all of
their programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we and ABC just have advantages because of our
vertical integration,'' Herzog said. ``I'm sure it gives CBS and
NBC something to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of thinking is certain to go on at both CBS and NBC over
the next year about whether to make an alliance, through a merger,
sale or takeover, with a Hollywood studio or a cable network. Talks
have already gone on between NBC and USA Network, CBS and Sony
Corp., CNN and just about everybody. The issues can be complicated
because foreign companies like Sony are not allowed to own more
than 25 percent of a network, and companies like Time Warner that
have cable systems are not permitted to own broadcast stations.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at NBC and CBS have stated publicly that they have no
intention of relinquishing control of their companies. But the
pressures of intensifying competition for shrinking audiences and
profits could force a recalculation of the value of owning and
operating a network in this environment at almost any time.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, the real value of the network business resides
in owning stations. The networks want to own more, and they will
continue to press the Federal Communications Commission to change
the current limits so they can buy more.
</P>
<P>
   Failing that, the networks are likely to press all the more for
some other revenue stream, trying to match the advantage of cable
channels, which receive revenue from both advertising and
subscription fees. That may mean more direct sales appeals to
viewers for videos of shows.
</P>
<P>
   And the networks will continue to look for ways to ``repurpose''
their programs, like sending off repeats to cable channels, as NBC
has done, putting reruns from its ``Dateline NBC'' series on its
MSNBC and CNBC cable channels. They may also begin moving more
toward the idea of trying to sell accumulated audiences for shows
repeated several times in a month, as cable has often done. Some of
that is happening already. Fox ran the movie ``The Lost World:
Jurassic Park'' twice in three weeks in November; NBC ran a
wrestling special twice in the same month.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these tactics will diminish the ever-constant hunger
for the next big hit. With the competition closer than it has ever
been before, the difference between the top and bottom among the
network competitors, between profits and no profits, may be
determined by a single new hit show.
</P>
<P>
   The program makers say they are desperate for new ideas, new
formats, something that will either excite the public or at least
alter the program-cost formula.
</P>
<P>
   As the head of one major Hollywood television studio put it,
``If my garbage man gives me a good idea, I'll take it; and I'll
give him a `created by' credit.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Like a cyclone victim emerging from a storm cellar
to survey the damage, Asia ended 1998 with equal measures of shock
and relief. Shock at the enormity of the devastation wrought by the
economic crisis; relief that its storm-tossed markets and
currencies had finally regained their footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, everyone was stuck with a very gloomy picture,''
said Neil Saker, the head of economic research at SG Securities in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to cuts in interest rates in the United States and
the strengthening of the Japanese yen, Saker said a modicum of
confidence had returned to Asia. Stock markets and currencies in
Thailand, Korea and Malaysia have risen steadily since October.
Even fragile Indonesia has gained ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've turned the corner and we're in a period of stability,
which is the prelude to real recovery,'' Saker said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Asia could easily falter again. Experts said the blow
could come from a number of places: the United States, if its
growth slows; Japan, if it cannot revive its moribund economy; or
within Asia itself, if social unrest in Indonesia or Malaysia
spreads and scares off returning investors.
</P>
<P>
   Even without fresh shock waves, the region's recovery will be a
protracted and painful affair. After predicting that Asia would
follow a pattern similar to that of the Mexican currency crisis _
in which that country tumbled abruptly into recession but climbed
out just as fast _ most economists and international agencies are
now scaling back their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In recent reports, the World Bank and the International Labor
Organization both predicted that most of Asia's economies would
barely eke out positive growth this year. The World Bank forecast
that Indonesia's economy would shrink 2.5 percent, on top of an
estimated 15.3 percent decline in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And the supercharged growth that led people to marvel at the
``Asian Miracle'' may be gone for good. After growing at an average
annual rate of 6.8 percent between 1991 and 1997, the World Bank
projects that East Asia's four major economies _ Indonesia,
Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines _ will grow at an annual
rate of just 2.8 percent between 1998 and 2007.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus is that it will take two to five years for Asia
to recover,'' said Mac Overton, a portfolio manager at MBF Unit
Trust here. ``If you have a serious injury, it's not like you can
go out and play ball the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Asian governments will be to pursue
disciplined policies during this convalescence. Banks will have to
be shut down, corporate assets will have to be sold and millions of
workers laid off, all at a time when unemployment has tripled in
Korea, Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The economic stress is already fraying nerves. Indonesia has
been riven by clashes between students and soldiers, as well as
between Christians and Muslims. In Malaysia, crowds rallied to
denounce Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad for ousting and
imprisoning his change-minded deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no recovery in a year, these social problems will
multiply,'' said Marc Faber, the head of his own investment firm in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia may have less time than that. President B.J. Habibie
has begun to close unprofitable banks and take over debt-ridden
conglomerates. But his hold on power is tenuous at best. Although
Habibie has pledged new elections in the middle of this year,
student protesters say he has been irredeemably tainted by his ties
to his predecessor, President Suharto, and should step down
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an economist, how can you run a restructuring when it is
being influenced by the political process?'' asked Mari Pangetsu,
the executive director of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a research group in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Although Indonesia's neighbors are in less precarious shape,
they, too, face internal pressures that could derail changes. In
Korea, the chaebols, the corporate leviathans that dominate the
economy, are obdurately resisting efforts to slim down their
empires.
</P>
<P>
   The president of South Korea, Kim Dae-jung, recently summoned
the leaders of the five top chaebols to his residence, the Blue
House, for a curt lecture on the need to reduce their debt and spin
off unprofitable operations.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai is pushing for a
bankruptcy law that would allow the government to begin weeding out
insolvent companies. But Chuan's campaign is being threatened by
opposition from ``vested interests'' in the corporate sector,
according to James Stent, the senior executive vice president of
the Bank of Asia, Thailand's 11th-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Looming above all these stop-and-go efforts is Malaysia, which
has chosen a radically different remedy for its ills. Rather than
accept the prescriptions of outside agencies like the International
Monetary Fund, it has imposed sweeping capital controls on its
currency and financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Economists warn that the controls could sabotage Malaysia's
overhaul efforts. For now, though, they are shielding Malaysia from
the vagaries of the global economy. Some experts in Kuala Lumpur
argue that the economy is even perking up a bit. Outside analysts
fear that if Malaysia thrives while the rest of Asia languishes,
other countries will follow its example.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem comes if growth doesn't pick up in 1999,'' said
Simon Ogus, the managing director of Asian economics at Warburg
Dillon Read in Hong Kong. ``Then Malaysia may serve as a siren call
for other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is an even more fundamental debate under way, about
where countries should put their emphasis in economic policy. The
conventional wisdom here has been that Asian countries must export
their way out of recession. Only by selling rubber, palm oil, cars
and computer chips to their neighbors _ as well as to the United
States and Europe _ could they hope to recover.
</P>
<P>
   But now some economists argue that Asian countries cannot depend
on each other or on the West to fuel a recovery. Fred Bergsten, the
director of the Institute for International Economics, a research
organization in Washington, said these countries must first revive
demand in their domestic markets. To do that, he said the
governments should increase public spending and relax their
monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me that they're continuing to go downhill,''
Bergsten said. ``They really have to put a concerted strategy in
place.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a hectic year for Jim Callinan, manager of the Robertson
Stephens Emerging Growth Fund, but a rewarding one.
</P>
<P>
   While the small-capitalization stocks that Callinan buys were
lurching wildly, his employer, Robertson Stephens Investment
Management, was being offered for sale by its owner, BankAmerica,
which itself was being acquired by Nationsbank. So for much of
1998, Callinan was juggling the care of a volatile, high-turnover
portfolio with the work of making presentations to prospective
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   He teamed up with Sandy Robertson, a co-founder of Robertson
Stephens, to try to lead a buyout of the business. After that
effort failed, Callinan joined a group led by Randy Hecht, the
firm's president, that made its own, successful bid in November.
</P>
<P>
   The firm will be renamed RS Funds when the sale is completed,
probably late this month.
</P>
<P>
   The market, of course, has been far from tame, and Callinan has
taken investors on a particularly wild ride. At the nadir of the
summer stock selloff, his fund, which has $387.7 million in assets,
was down 48 percent from its July peak. But Emerging Growth has
bounced back, a result of its aggressive yet eclectic investing
style. Its 1998 return was 24.1 percent through Dec. 24, according
to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. The average
small-growth fund, by contrast, was off 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Callinan, 38, began managing Emerging Growth on July 1, 1996,
having arrived with a stellar record from Putnam Investments. Since
then, the fund has returned 18.5 percent, annualized, through Dec.
24, versus 4.8 percent for the average fund in its
small-capitalization category, according to Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   Credit the fund's unique approach to the markets. Callinan and
the fund's four analysts often start their search for stocks by
scouting what he calls emerging subsegments of growing industries,
like Internet commerce or the genomic area of biotechnology. They
look for companies that are gaining market share and have expected
revenue and earnings growth of at least 20 percent a year, as well
as increasing profit margins and high returns on equity. And they
seek companies with the business models, competitive advantages and
strategies that will help them achieve such results.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his style is flexible enough so that the fund also looks for
chances to buy attractive stocks when they have been beaten down.
Initial public offerings play a big role, too, in his investment
choices. ``Whenever there's an IPO period that's pretty intense, we
buy a lot of stocks, and then we kind of, over the next six months,
filter through them and get rid of the bad eggs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer Callinan paid $12 each for shares of Knight/Trimark
Group of Jersey City, N.J., parent of Knight Securities, a market
maker that buys and sells 6,500 Nasdaq stocks. He bought more after
the price fell to about $7 at the end of August. The stock traded
last week at $$23.9375. Callinan considers Knight/Trimark an
Internet-related play because half of its business is in stock
trades for online brokers like E(ASTERISK)trade.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that Knight/Trimark's earnings will grow from 92
cents a share in 1998 to $1.60 in 2000 and that the stock will be
trading this time next year at 15 times 2000 earnings, or $24.
</P>
<P>
   Callinan didn't catch any shares of International Network
Services at their initial offering price of $20 in 1996, but he
bought some soon thereafter at about $30. It climbed to $52,
Callinan sold, and the price dropped to a low of $15.25 in 1997.
``So we bought it back,'' he said, in the fall of 1997, ``in the
teens,'' and then bought more in 1998, ``in maybe the low 20s.''
Since then, he said, ``it has just been a superstock.'' It closed
at $66.50 last week.
</P>
<P>
   International Network Services, based in Sunnyvale, Calif.,
specializes in telecommunications systems engineering and
consulting. Callinan predicts that it will grow rapidly as
communications systems are updated, in part to handle growing
Internet traffic. He has a 12-month target price of $101 a share.
</P>
<P>
   A pure Internet play for the fund is Earthlink Network of
Pasadena, Calif., an Internet services provider with a rapidly
growing subscriber base, now at one million. Sprint Corp., with a
28 percent stake in the company, is committed by contract to
deliver 150,000 new subscribers a year to the company through its
Earthlink Sprint access service. But Callinan sees Earthlink's
subscriber base as growing much faster: In 1999, he predicted,
``they'll have 1.6 million; the year after that they'll have 2.3
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Callinan expects Earthlink to earn 45 cents a share this year
and $1.36 a share in 2000. He bought the stock at $30 in February;
it closed last week at $57. His target price is $120 within 18
months.

REVERSE MORTGAGES: CASHING IN, AND STAYING PUT
</HEADLINE>

approach to and arrival of retirement appears the first Sunday of

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a decade ago, Cynthia Brown, a retiree in Monroe, La.,
was having trouble making ends meet with her monthly Social
Security check. So she trekked to the local welfare office and
signed up for food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to swallow my pride,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1995, she heard about reverse home mortgages and got
one through Unity Mortgage Corp. Her home, valued at $76,300, had
been nearly paid for, and the reverse mortgage, which taps its
value, allowed her to pay the remaining $4,000 she owed on the home
and to establish a line of credit _ in her case, $27,300 _ to use
as she wished.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no ordinary line of credit: She will never have to
repay a penny as long as she lives in her house _ and she can live
there as long as she wants.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money has enabled Ms. Brown, 79, to make repairs on
her house and, after an intruder broke in and threatened her with a
gun, to buy a burglar-alarm system.
</P>
<P>
   She is no longer on food stamps and can live on the money she
gets from Social Security _ about $700 a month _ without having to
worry that an unexpected expense could force her to sell her house.
``It was the best thing I ever did,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cases like Ms. Brown's explain the growing popularity of reverse
mortgages. They have been around since the 1960s, but 80 percent of
them have been written in the last five years, according to the
National Center for Home Equity Conversion in Apple Valley, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of a reverse mortgage is simple: You borrow against
your home's value, but you are not required to make any repayments
as long as you stay put. If you move or die, you or your heirs will
pay back the loan by selling the house. In the meantime, no one can
kick you out.
</P>
<P>
   And here's a really good part: If you live long enough for the
accumulating interest to push the total debt above your home's
value, the difference is paid by insurance that is built into the
loan. That means the mortgage company can't touch anything else in
your estate.
</P>
<P>
   However, these mortgages have many variations, and the details
are complex. This has led some borrowers to turn unnecessarily to
outside agents, who have charged fees of up to 10 percent of a loan
for ``referral'' services or other information that is available
free from the government and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason that the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, the primary insurer of reverse mortgages, requires
consumers to meet with HUD-approved counselors before getting these
loans. The only fees you should ever pay are regular loan
application and origination fees _ directly to the lender.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify, homeowners must be at least 62. Mobile homes and
co-ops (sorry, New Yorkers) are not eligible. The mortgages are not
yet available in Texas. The amount you can borrow is limited,
regardless of your home's value, and varies from state to state and
even county to county.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you want to leave your home to your children, a
reverse mortgage probably isn't for you. Ditto if you plan to sell
your house anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   You can receive the money in several ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ As a credit line, either with a fixed limit, like Ms. Brown's,
or one that increases each year.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a lump-sum cash payment.
</P>
<P>
   _ In monthly payments for a specified number of years or as long
as you live in your home.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you take the cash payment, you can invest the
proceeds in an annuity that will provide monthly payments to you
for the rest of your life, no matter where you live.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of factors, including loan costs, should be
considered in deciding which option is best.
</P>
<P>
   A good source of information is the National Center for Home
Equity Conversion's Internet site (www.reverse.org). It contains an
online calculator: You enter your birth date, the location of your
home and its value to see how much money you might get from a
reverse mortgage. The center, a nonprofit organization, also
publishes a book, ``Reverse Mortgages for Beginners,'' which can be
ordered by calling (800) 247-6553. It costs $14.95, plus $4.50 for
shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   The payment options for reverse mortgages can be blended or even
changed later. Martha York Clements, 76, a widow in Port St. Lucie,
Fla., wanted to supplement her monthly income of $1,146 from Social
Security and an annuity. Last year she took out a reverse mortgage
on her $80,000 home, electing to take a combination of a $5,000
lump-sum payment and a monthly payment of $300 for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrific thing,'' she said. I intend to live long
enough to use up all the value in my house and then some.''
</P>
<P>
   And you don't have to be pressed for cash to get a reverse
mortgage. Aleck and Sheila Townsley, both 65, live in Foster City,
Calif., in a $555,000 house that overlooks San Francisco Bay. They
have a comfortable retirement income from her years as a teacher
and his as a lawyer. Through GMAC Mortgage, they chose a $65,000
line of credit that will eventually grow to $170,000 so they can
afford ``extras'' like travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no children,'' Townsley said. ``I want to spend my
last dime with my last breath.''

SEWING A LABEL ON A DECADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Jan. 4)  
(rl) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some decades in the life of the business world are easy to
label. The 1960s saw a rebellion against the established order.
Inflation dominated the 1970s. Deals branded the 1980s. But the
1990s, so far, seem to be the fill-in-the-blank decade.
</P>
<P>
   As the decade opened, Japan was an economic powerhouse, Eastern
Europe had its post-World War II borders, Democrats controlled
Congress and Republicans ran the White House. By its midpoint,
Japan had stumbled, parts of Eastern Europe were a killing field,
Republicans controlled Congress and Democrats ran the White House.
As the decade ends, Japan is an economic quagmire, Eastern European
capitalism is a question mark and it is not clear that anyone
controls anything in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people, who view the business world from different vantage
points, were invited to name this decade. Their suggestions follow.
</P>
<P>
   One caveat, as Richard Jenrette, one of the founders of the
investment banking firm of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, said: ``It
ain't over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of 1928, you would have said the 1920s were the
most prosperous decade ever,'' Jenrette said. ``There is something
wonderful about the eighth year; 1988 was the peak of the 1980s,
and 1968 was certainly the peak of that decade. But that ninth year
_ it can suddenly rise up and bite you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Jenrette calls the 1990s ``probably the most
prosperous, felicitous overall decade we've had this century.''
Whatever the decade's ninth year brings, he suspects the future
will see the decade as a time when the world began to question the
``rugged `let-the-markets-rule' philosophy'' of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decade may be the beginning of a kinder, gentler
capitalism,'' he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some funny things happen on the way to the millennium,''
Jenrette said, citing the political shifts to the left that have
occurred during the decade in Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
``And we just had a big swing back toward the Democrats in this
country,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on? ``I think the world tried the rugged brand of
capitalism, and not everybody found it to their liking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Jules Kroll, a former prosecutor, founded Kroll
Associates, a large corporate detective agency in Manhattan. He is
now chief executive of the Kroll-O'Gara Co., a corporate-security
concern formed in 1997 by a merger with an armored-car maker.
</P>
<P>
   As Kroll sees it, the decade has been a flashback to
``Network,'' the 1976 film by Paddy Chayefsky. ``You remember that
great line, `I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this
anymore,''' Kroll said. ``Well, I think the 1990s have been like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   People around the world spent the decade removing their leaders
over issues of corruption, he said _ in Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia,
Italy, Japan, Pakistan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can list an extraordinary number of individuals outside
the United States who have been removed or forced out by
accusations of corruption, proven and unproven,'' he said. ``It
seems to be based on people simply saying, `We've had enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the private sector, Kroll said, the decade has become the era
of the megafraud. ``Partly that's because there are just more zeros
out there _ the economy is so much bigger than it was in the 1980s
and everyone is playing with bigger chips.''
</P>
<P>
   But the growth in the use of esoteric financial derivatives has
also played a role, he argued. ``Most boards of directors, most
regulators, really don't understand the importance of this
derivatives activity,'' Kroll said. ``It is scary that so few
people understand it. It is the advent of these derivatives that
has opened the doors to the institution-threatening, and
nation-threatening, financial debacle.''
</P>
<P>
   For Maria Livanos Cattaui, who helped organize the prestigious
World Economic Conference in Davos, Switzerland, and who is now
secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce in
Paris, the label for the 1990s ``is absolutely obvious: This has
been the decade of globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the economies of the world have been inching closer
since the first caravans set forth centuries ago. ``But never has
the world been so intensively pulled together,'' she said.
Technology has dramatically altered ``the speed with which ideas _
and capital _ can whiz around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In her view, globalization was encouraged by the demise of the
Soviet Union in 1991. ``That unleashed all the capital and energy
that had previously been locked in this global power struggle,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cattaui warns against any nostalgia for a less-connected,
slower-paced world. ``When cars first came in, we didn't have any
uniform rules of the road,'' she said. ``Road systems all developed
nation by nation, with some driving on the left and some on the
right.'' And after more than a century, there still are no global
rules to govern electricity. ``You cannot take your computer from
home and plug it in anywhere else in the world,'' she said with a
laugh. ``The voltage is different, the outlets are different, even
the silly plug is different.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, she argued, today's business leaders and government
officials are doing a much better job of developing standards for
trade documents, global financial transactions, compatible computer
software and international telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization need not mean homogenization, after all,'' she
said. But, she added, it must mean better cooperation among
regulators and better communication among corporations about their
exposure to risk.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab, chairman of the financial-services company that
bears his name, said, ``I think the dominant theme of this decade
is confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Americans were freed at
last from what he called ``that awful, final what-if'' _ the
nuclear nightmare. ``That gave us personal confidence with respect
to our own and our families' security.''
</P>
<P>
   But the decade has also been marked by growing confidence in
``the sustainability of the United States growth story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be based on the broad access to the Internet and the
speed with which this technology is spreading, Schwab said.
Already, more than 70 percent of his company's relationships and
contacts with customers have been over the Internet _ ``up from zip
a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But the can-do spirit he sees as dominating the decade cannot
obscure the battle lines that stretch into the future, running
between ``the high-tech and the high-touch'' approaches to business
growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from the 1990s, he said, the future belongs to ``the firms
that get that balance right _ providing high-tech service but also
helping people, face-to-face.''
</P>
<P>
   To Nicholas Negroponte, the 1990s may turn out to be the decade
when both nations and corporations began to go the way of the buggy
whip.
</P>
<P>
   Co-founder and director of the Media Laboratory at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Negroponte is a pioneer in
the application of computer technology to everyday life and the
author of the 1995 best seller ``Being Digital'' (Knopf).
</P>
<P>
   In an interview by e-mail, he called the 1990s ``the digital
decade.'' From the emergence of the Internet to the Year 2000
computer bug, ``it is a decade where the biggest asset is having
none.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained, ``The energy, people, spaces and vehicles needed
to move physical things from country to country are suddenly a
liability in an age of weightless, sizeless, colorless bits which
move at the speed of light.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sees it, the bits of electronic information ``make the
world very small, borders truly meaningless and territory almost
irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Negroponte also sees the face of the future in the ``shockingly
high'' valuation the stock market is putting on new technology
companies with little revenue. It is, he said, ``a future that
tells us today that we are clueless about who will be our
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   But while investors may be in for a roller coaster ride, the
professor is optimistic: ``We're in a decade which is the first
hint of people belonging to a single planet. Kids born today will
grow up feeling like global citizens way much more than adults do
today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Children will be the agents of change,'' he added. ``A kid's
grasp of the digital world will look and feel genetic.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may be the old, not the young, who give the 1990s their
defining label, in the view of Richard Leone, president of the
Century Foundation, formerly the Twentieth Century Fund, a public
policy research foundation in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   For Leone, what is ``new under the sun'' in this decade is the
aging of the world's population, thanks to improvements in public
health and a dramatic drop in birth rates.
</P>
<P>
   Leone, former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey and former president of the New York Mercantile Exchange,
thinks this graying of the population will challenge both
government and business.
</P>
<P>
   For government, ``the key issue is the same issue we had when
the baby boomers were young,'' he said. ``The things that the young
and the old need are things that we once tended to supply with
public money. But that will be harder in the future,'' especially
for nations that do not yet have a secure social safety net.
</P>
<P>
   For business, the global graying will present big opportunities
for those that guess correctly about the aging population's
preferences. ``With everyone living longer, attitudes about the
importance of saving and investment are going to proliferate,'' he
predicted. ``Anything to do with aging and the extension of
vitality and vigor into one's later years will see dynamic
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Wasserstein, chief executive of Wasserstein Perella Group,
thinks the dominant theme of the 1990s has been its volatility.
</P>
<P>
   While Wasserstein, one of the leading dealmeisters of the last
decade, agreed that globalization and technology have left their
imprint, he said they came mixed in with ``immense frustration and
false gods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the foundations here are not as strong as one would
think,'' he added. ``There are a lot of false leads.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the exuberant bidding for Internet stocks when,
``in fact, the Internet may be technologically obsolete.'' For
example, in the course of the same decade, Japan was hailed as a
triumph and then collapsed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he said people optimistically ``assumed a legal
system in Russia that doesn't exist.'' He added, ``It is quite a
remarkable period.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wasserstein is hopeful that the world has changed for the
better, he noted that ``if you are in Brazil right now, it may not
look that way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In many of the emerging markets, the glory of an entire decade
has been wiped out in the last few months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Wall Street, the 1990s were the beginning of ``the new
era of consolidation,'' he said. With stock and bond offerings sold
globally and with mergers valued in the billions, he added, Wall
Street is likely to become a place where only about five giant
firms will survive. ``The problem is, there are about 30 people who
think that they are one of the five.''
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson is a computer industry consultant and venture
capitalist and the publisher of Release 1.0, an industry
newsletter. For her, the 1990s will go down in history as the
decade when the Internet started to be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major issue of the decade was that we got wired,'' she said.
``We got connected.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Dyson sees it, the advent of the Internet trumps all the
other changes the decade has seen. ``Globalization, the backlash to
globalization, the inevitability of globalization; the diminishing
importance of the nation state, the rise of the tribe, on the one
hand, and the corporation on the other _ the Internet makes a
difference to all of those,'' she said. ``Those changes are, in one
sense, being pushed by the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   While people always learn and adopt new technologies more slowly
than cyberspace pioneers expect, Ms. Dyson thinks the Internet has
unleashed wholly unappreciated changes in society. ``The Internet
permits people to communicate in a more decentralized way'' by
using a tool that is far more accessible than, say, a television
station or newspaper, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personal computer and the Internet put the means of
production in the hands of individuals,'' Ms. Dyson said.
``Businesses are motivated primarily to make a profit, but
individuals are motivated by other things, too. I think more people
want to do good, and just get ground down. So if you're given a
tool to resist that pressure, the world might be very slightly
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The historian David Hackett Fischer of Brandeis University
thinks the 1990s may be the decade when a centurylong surge in
inflation finally faltered and stopped.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``The Great Wave: Price Revolutions and the Rhythm
of History'' (Oxford University Press, 1996), Fischer suggested
that European history has been shaped by four great waves of
inflation, the first climaxing in the mid-14th century and the most
recent beginning in 1896 and continuing into this decade, with the
1930s a mere pothole in the upward path. It is this last long
inflationary wave that may have begun to break in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a very deep change in the dynamics of price
movements,'' he said. ``This is not the usual flutters, but
something more profound.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer attributes this apparent shift to a worldwide decline in
the rate of population growth coupled with a decline in military
spending after the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   He said the transition from inflation to price equilibrium in
the past has been a time of severe crisis _ and, indeed, he said,
just such a crisis has been unfolding in recent years, with the
shattering changes in the former Soviet Union and economic and
social strains elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Who wins and loses when prices finally stabilize? In the past,
Fischer said, the losers have included the world's farmers, as
commodity prices fell, and the lending classes, which earned very
low interest on their capital. On the other hand, businesses could
borrow cheaply, pensioners were more secure and workers' wages
stretched further, helping to close the gap between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have thought the world's recent troubles were caused by a
monetary crisis in Thailand that spread to other nations,'' he
concluded. ``But most people have missed the demographic factors
entirely. We have to look beyond economics to history and
demographics to understand what's happening.''

WORKING: TROUBLE, A DESK AWAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 3) 
(bl) 
 By MICHELLE COTTLE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Recently, my boss of seven years and I moved from our old
office to a separate company he owns. One of my new co-workers is
constantly complaining, ridiculing my boss (to whom I am devoted)
and speaking loudly during personal calls _ which I can't avoid
hearing because our desks are just 15 feet apart. This woman has
been with the company for five years, and everyone else seems to
think she is great. I am civil toward her, but my patience is
wearing thin. Should I talk to my boss or to the human resources
department about her behavior? Or should I try another approach?
</P>
<P>
   A. You are not in third grade, and your co-worker is not a
schoolyard bully who keeps stealing your lunch money. As such,
tattling should not be part of your plan.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Reynolds, career coach and owner of Covisioning, a
leadership training firm in Phoenix, says you should approach your
colleague directly with your concerns. Going over her head, she
said, will damage your relationship further. ``When you go to the
boss, it's like going to the principal,'' she warned.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Kalman, president of Performance First, a consulting firm
in Branford, Conn., agreed. ``This woman is your peer,'' she said.
``Call her on her behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But aim to be diplomatic, at least at first. As the new kid on
the block, you don't want to start by picking a fight with a
popular employee.
</P>
<P>
   First, take some deep breaths and try to understand what is
driving her behavior, Ms. Reynolds suggested. Perhaps the woman
feels threatened by your boss' _ and your _ arrival, she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to conventional wisdom, the first line of defense
against change is denial, but Ms. Reynolds disagreed. The first
step, she said, is complaining. ``We often complain when what's
really going on is we're frightened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that you try initiating a friendly conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell her, `You know, it's been hard for me to move, but I bet
it's really hard for you to have a new boss here,''' she advised.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, your co-worker may be oblivious to the impact of her
behavior, Ms. Kalman said, perhaps because she acts this way all
the time and no one has ever told her so.
</P>
<P>
   Delicately, let her know that you consider her chatter
inappropriate, Ms. Reynolds said. For example, if she rants on the
phone about a problem, go to her and say, ``I hear you're having
trouble in this area, and I'm wondering if I could help.''
</P>
<P>
   If diplomacy fails and you conclude that this woman is, indeed,
trying to drive you mad, be direct _ though still as pleasant as
possible. When a co-worker becomes disruptive, Ms. Kalman said,
``it's time to say: Get a clue,'' though she added that the nice
approach would be to tell her you're finding it difficult to come
into work each day and listen to all her negative energy.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, your co-worker should respect you for not
running to the principal at the first sign of trouble.

CHIPS ARE HIDDEN IN WASHING MACHINES, MICROWAVES AND EVEN
RESERVOIRS
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Monday, Jan. 4)  
(ms) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As companies and government agencies race to fix the Year 2000
computer problem, they have discovered to their chagrin that
problems lurk not only in computer rooms and personal computers.
There are also risks in billions of microchips, doing such diverse
things as mixing the fuel in automobile engines, controlling
factories and medical equipment and even automatically flushing
some toilets.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem has raised awareness of what has long been
true in the computer industry _ that hidden computers, sometimes
consisting of only a single chip, are far more numerous than the
machines on desktops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Approximately zero percent of computer chips are actually used
in computers,'' said Jim Turley, senior editor of Microprocessor
Report, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Turley's figure, surprising as it might be, is not too far off.
The market research firm Dataquest estimates that 4.6 billion of
these hidden chips, known as embedded microcomponents, were sold in
1997 alone. By contrast, only about 100 million microprocessors
were sold that year to perform computations in computers.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the personal computer microprocessors that get all the
attention. This is partly because personal computer chips like the
Pentium cost tens or hundreds of times more than the chips that
control microwave ovens or Furby, the fuzzy electronic stuffed
animal with an attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the microprocessor is an important consideration for
personal computer buyers. Embedded chips, by contrast, barely make
their presence known. ``You don't say, `I bought a new Whirlpool
washer with a Motorola processor,''' Turley said.
</P>
<P>
   The market for such hidden computer chips has long provided a
refuge for semiconductor companies that lost out to the Intel Corp.
to provide the brains of personal computers. Motorola Inc. is the
largest player in embedded processors, followed by the NEC Corp. of
Japan. Texas Instruments is the leader in one type of chip known as
a digital signal processor, which is used in cellular phones and
consumer electronics devices.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller companies like Integrated Device Technology Inc. and
Quantum Effect Design Inc., both of Santa Clara, Calif., have found
niches for their embedded processors, because such chips tend to be
more specialized than those for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, some of these more specialized computers are
starting to pose a direct challenge to the personal computer. The
biggest attractions at the Comdex computer trade show in November
were so-called information appliances. These include electronic
organizers, digital televisions, digital audio recorders and small
Web-surfing devices.
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits are saying that the world is entering the post-PC
era. The International Data Corp., a market research firm,
estimates that sales of information appliances that can connect to
the Internet, such as video games, smart phones, hand-held
computers and digital set-top boxes, will exceed sales of consumer
personal computers in the United States by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   There are also growing markets for such hidden computers well
beyond information appliances. Tom Starnes, an analyst at
Dataquest, estimates that the typical American home has about 63
processors, and the number could grow to 280 in five years. These
chips are found in everything from video cassette recorders and
microwave ovens to washing machines, sprinkler controllers and
auto-focus cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The figure includes the 15 or so processors the family car may
have, controlling the fuel mix in the engine, the anti-lock brakes,
the air bags, the remote keyless entry, the radio and the dashboard
displays. Some luxury automobiles have more than 60 processors,
doing such things as raising or lowering the volume of the radio as
the speed of the car varies, or adjusting the speed of the
windshield wipers automatically depending on the intensity of the
rain, Turley said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Boeing 777 jets have more than 1,000 processors, from
a mere handful in older Boeing models, according to Timothy D.
Fehr, the company's vice president for airplane systems. Most of
the processors are involved in delivering entertainment and
telephone service to each seat. And instead of having cables and
hydraulic systems running through the plane to control the flaps
and rudders, the newest planes use a fly-by-wire system, in which
digital signals are sent over wires to processors that activate
local hydraulic systems. This cuts the weight of the plane,
improving range and fuel efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But if the proliferation of hidden computers has brought
benefits, for the coming year at least it will also bring many
headaches. That is because companies and government agencies are
now having to root out these computers to determine whether they
will malfunction because they cannot handle the transition to the
year 2000, potentially shutting down factories or harming medical
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that only a small percentage of such systems will
malfunction. But with billions in use, even a small percentage can
cause widespread problems.
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquity of these chips, and the fact that many are hidden,
makes it a challenge even to find all these systems in order to
test them.
</P>
<P>
   At the Public Service Electric &AMP; Gas Co., a unit of the Public
Service Enterprise Group and New Jersey's dominant utility, Year
2000 team members walked through 250 locations, from power plants
to substations, hunting down hidden processors, a job that took
about a year.
</P>
<P>
   Just when they thought they had everything, they realized they
had forgotten to check a reservoir the utility had built to put
water into the Delaware River for environmental purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Could it possibly contain hidden processors?
</P>
<P>
   When the team members visited, they found that a technician
walks the dam twice a day with a hand-held device to check
creepage. That device, which contains a processor, needed to be
fixed for the year 2000. At the bottom of the dam was a control
system that monitored how much water was being released. It, too,
was not ready for the year 2000.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the years, Dr. Ari Kiev, Manhattan psychiatrist
and author, has researched witch doctors, counseled suicidal
students and advised Olympic athletes. What better preparation
could he have for coaching Wall Street's traders?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a guy who would hold onto a position while it was
dropping,'' Kiev said during a recent interview in his sunny office
on Manhattan's Upper East Side. ``He always had good reasons, but
it turned out he was really doing it because he could not tolerate
selling the stock and then seeing it go up.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the fellow who, while building up a position
in a particular stock, would become emotionally derailed if it
dropped. Instead of seeing such dips as possible buying
opportunities, he saw them as losses on the shares he already
owned, a perception that eroded his courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is another guy who makes $500,000 a month, month after
month, but he cannot exceed that number,'' Kiev continued. ``Even
if he makes the $500,000 in the first week of the month, he still
can't make more that month. He has limited himself but doesn't
realize it.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the thorny problems that Kiev tackles in his unusual
role as ``trading coach'' to several successful Wall Street hedge
funds. That work began when Steven A. Cohen, the founder of SAC
Capital Management, a hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn., invited Kiev
to work with the traders at his firm.
</P>
<P>
   Kiev's experience formed the basis for his new book, ``Trading
to Win: The Psychology of Mastering the Markets,'' just published
by John Wiley &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   The book, at $34.95, is pricey enough to fit the lofty tax
bracket of its potential audience. But it comes with an endorsement
from Cohen, who said that the ``proactive trading program'' that he
set up with Kiev at his firm helped his fund grow from ``a $20
million hedge fund to one handling over $500 million annually after
only five years.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is filled with anecdotes about unsuccessful strategies
_ behavior that many traders, amateur or professional, may
recognize with a groan _ and with stern sidelines advice. ``Macho
trading is equivalent to not facing reality,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   Most traders, as Cohen wrote in his introduction, ``are
indecisive, lack conviction, and are afraid of taking risks and
making mistakes;'' moreover, they are ``unaware of the personal
demons that are holding them back from true success.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping traders wrestle with those personal demons is Kiev's
job, although he says his coaching differs from the rest of his
practice, where he is best known for his research on suicide
prevention and for his treatment of depression, anxiety and
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he still sees connections. Many of his psychiatric
treatment techniques involve helping people confront what he calls
their self-created fears and change self-defeating behavior. That
approach can also help Wall Street traders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've encountered a guy making $30 million a year who is still
afraid, who doesn't feel like a success,'' Kiev said, shaking his
head in empathy.
</P>
<P>
   His gift as a coach is that he seems genuinely sympathetic to
such problems. He speaks passionately about helping people ``find
the dream or the vision for their life and then helping them create
the tension between what they really want and what they have
settled for because they were afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Settling for $30 million a year might not be difficult for many
of us, but Kiev's work with demon-plagued traders is not about _
well, not only about _ making more money. It is about realizing
one's potential and living life to the fullest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trading ``is not a game that tolerates your complacency,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make $1 million asleep, fine _ but wouldn't you
rather be alive?'' he asked. ``Wouldn't you rather be in your life
as fully as you can be? It's not that `more is better' _ unless
we're talking about more engagement, more involvement, more
personal growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiev's work with professional traders has given him a somewhat
alarming insight into the risks of amateur day-trading, which has
become a popular pastime in many middle-class American households.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like handing children the keys to the car,'' he said with
a visible shudder. Even he, with years of experience on the
sidelines at some of the industry's smartest trading desks, prefers
to leave the management of his finances to others. Why? Because it
takes so much time to master the skills required _ time he would
rather spend pursuing his own career.
</P>
<P>
   Kiev said amateur traders, like professionals, should set
targets that are reasonable and ``consistent with your capital,
after you have taken care of all your basic needs.'' After you have
set your goals, he said, ``you have to develop a system for
measuring your performance, relative to your targets.''
</P>
<P>
   The human tendency to change the rules in the middle of the game
is so strong that Kiev encourages amateur traders to identify some
outsider _ a buddy, another amateur trader or even a spouse _ who
can objectively compare their trading results with their goals.
``We are all inclined to deny and rationalize,'' he said. ``We need
someone to keep us honest.''

<P>
   Who would have thought it? Bosses, those storied ogres who
stereotypically withhold raises, tear up expense accounts and send
out pink slips on Christmas Eve, can actually have hearts of mush.
The softies among them help finance vacations, give Cupid a hand
and spring to the aid of the distressed. So next time you see a
boss, honk _ or at least smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s, I had a one-in-a-million boss who performed an
extraordinary act of kindness,'' writes C.M. Barnhart of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   When it appeared that Ms. Barnhart would not have enough money
to take a long-anticipated vacation in Greece, the boss gave her a
check for one-third of the trip's cost.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't all.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was about to leave on vacation, he handed me a roll of
drachmas for extra spending money,'' Ms. Barnhart writes. ``No
strings; it just pleased him to make sure I would have a great
vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Messineo of Clifton, N.J., recalls how her supervisor
approached her with a brochure in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a present for you,'' the boss said. The flier described
a conference on remedial reading _ Mrs. Messineo's field of
expertise _ to be held in the Southern city where her daughter and
family had settled recently.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Messineo writes: ``I was able to spend five days in a lovely
hotel, attend an informative conference and visit with my loved
ones with all expenses paid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Several years ago I was diagnosed with `incurable' cancer at
its most advanced stages,'' writes Kenny Moore of Totowa, N.J., a
manager of human resources for Keyspan Energy in Brooklyn. So Moore
underwent a year of experimental treatment at the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Md., consisting of aggressive chemotherapy
followed by full-body radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had held his job for just two years, his boss was
unequivocal in his reaction: ``Go do what you need to do. We'll
cover for you when you can't come to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore writes: ``For the next year, I lived the harrowing
experience which has become commonplace for cancer victims. Some
days I was barely able to come to work; other days I could barely
walk.''
</P>
<P>
   The company never wavered in its support, and the treatment
worked. ``Eleven years later, I'm still cancer-free,'' he says. And
still grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, I've had several opportunities to work
elsewhere,'' he says. ``While the money may have been better, I
have stayed. I continue to feel honored to work for a company whose
corporate values support both the business needs as well as the
human needs of its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Toni Heidrich of Convent Station, N.J., is a partner in a
15-person accounting firm. Most of the employees are under 30 and
are trying to save money for their future.
</P>
<P>
   When one of Ms. Heidrich's colleagues decided to marry, everyone
in the firm was invited to his wedding. But the event would be out
of state _ not within driving distance.
</P>
<P>
   When the firm's managing partner learned that the cost of air
fare and lodging was going to keeping many employees from
attending, he offered to pay for tickets, accommodations and food
for each employee and a companion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heidrich writes, ``Ten people ended up attending and were
happy to be able to share our friend's special day.''
</P>
<P>
   One Friday night in 1982, when Ben Suntag of Pomona, N.Y., was
working for Western Union as an engineer, he received a phone call
from his sister in Los Angeles. Their father had been struck by a
car and was in a coma.
</P>
<P>
   Suntag flew immediately to California to be at his father's
bedside. Early the next week, he talked with his boss, Harry
Halpert, back in New York. Halpert told him to spend as much time
with his father as he needed _ then to fly to the company's office
in San Francisco to take a few pictures. That way, he said, he
could justify reimbursing Suntag's return flight.
</P>
<P>
   When Suntag returned to New York two weeks later, he was
summoned to the office of his boss' boss, John Doherty. Paying for
his one-way fare back home was just not right, Doherty said;
instead, he insisted on paying for the round trip. Moreover, since
Suntag had visited the San Francisco office, he had obviously been
to the West Coast ``on business'' and would receive full salary for
his time away.
</P>
<P>
   Though his father never recovered from his injuries, Suntag
writes, ``there was some happiness in knowing that a big company
like Western Union and two great bosses like Harry Halpert and John
Doherty could make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when Dr. Heiko Spallek came to Philadelphia from the
former East Germany to become an assistant professor at Temple
University's School of Dentistry, one of his most difficult tasks
was overcoming his poor English.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Professor Titus Schleyer, the chairman of the Department
of Dental Informatics. To help Spallek master the language, he
offered some unusual motivational tools: a notebook and stickers
that depicted cartoon characters and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Into the notebook went the phrases that Spallek struggled with
most. When he used a phrase correctly, Schleyer rewarded him with a
sticker. When he mastered the expression, he received a sticker in
the shape of a star.
</P>
<P>
   At the department's Christmas party in 1997, one year and 600
stickers after the training sessions began, Schleyer awarded
Spallek a certificate for successful completion of the ``Dental
Informatics Linguistics Program.''
</P>
<P>
   Spallek says the framed certificate decorates his office wall.
``My boss,'' he writes, ``managed to pull me through a major
challenge in my life.''

ONE-OF-A-KIND BROADCASTER JACKSON WILL BE MISSED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a mark of college football announcer Keith Jackson's
greatness that he can rouse the passions of his listeners _ even
when he's just talking over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   That happened in a recent conference call with reporters when
Jackson was asked what he'll miss most when he retires from ABC
after Monday's Fiesta Bowl from Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the hour before the game,'' he pronounced, sounding
at once wistful and grumpy. ``That's a special time, if the
producers let you alone so you can sit there and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Warming to the fond recollection of autumn afternoons in Ann
Arbor, Mich., and Columbus, Ohio, Jackson proceeded to discuss the
exhilaration he feels every time he sees the teams charge out of
the tunnel onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   It is like ancient warriors before battle, he suggested, a
moment that ``has always been with mankind.'' Then there are the
bands, he added, and ``the coming-together of the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   After listening to Jackson set the scene from memory, you wonder
how he can leave now. Perhaps more than any other broadcaster of
the day, Jackson is the voice of a sport. More than Vin Scully is
baseball, Pat Summerall is the NFL, or Marv Albert was pro
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's time for me to step down and step aside,''
he stated firmly, sounding sure of his decision, though not quite
sure how to explain it. Jackson offered that his step is a little
slower these days, that he is less patient, and that he has to huff
and puff en route to the announcers' booth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, he doesn't feel old.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``When you've worked someplace for a half a
century, you need to see if you're doing a good job anymore. I see
things \RI'm doing on Saturday\S on Sunday and Monday that I don't
like. I just think it's time. It's a gut feeling I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Few listeners would agree with Jackson's assessment of his own
performance, since most days he's still as good as it gets in the
sports broadcasting business.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has his plans in place for retirement, however. Very
short-term plans, anyway. He and his wife will travel the country
playing golf next fall _ a time when he'd normally be working. When
he runs out of golf courses, he jokes, he'll commence to fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, he added, ``I don't know what happens. I'm a
blank page. And it's not everybody who gets a chance to be a blank
page. I've never been unemployed. We'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Jackson probably won't do is write a book. One reason,
he said, is ``I have no desire or reason to hurt anybody.'' So many
books these days do, and hurting people is not Jackson's style.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Jackson doesn't have the memories that come with 47
years in the business, covering pro football and basketball as well
as college football.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to pick a favorite game, he cites an Oklahoma-Ohio State
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a game at the Horseshoe,'' he says of the Buckeyes'
ancient stadium. ``Barry Switzer and Woody Hayes. Uwe von Schamann
is the place-kicker for Oklahoma. Ohio State is leading by a point
with 40 seconds to play, roughly.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson recalls the game, his deep voice rising and falling
with each statement, it is impossible to not feel as if you're at
the old stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma, Jackson continued, decided to try a 43-yard field goal
to win the game, so Hayes called three timeouts trying to ice the
Sooners kicker. But the cool von Schamann walked around in the
middle of the field during the timeouts ``conducting'' the crowd in
its booing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' Jackson concludes, ``he popped it right up the
highway. I thought it was remarkable seeing him stand up to 90,000
people.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been equally remarkable the way Jackson has performed in
what has become his farewell tour. While others, from stadiums full
of fans to officials, have celebrated him with cheers and with
sentimental gifts, Jackson has downplayed his departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd had my druthers, I'd have kept my mouth shut and just
walked away and said goodbye,'' he said. ``It's been somewhat of a
strain. People have been so generous and kind. I'm not used to
crying that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the impact of his retirement on college football
fans, Jackson is equally humble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never aware of posture,'' he said. ``I just do my ballgame
and go home.''
</P>
<P>
   And better than anybody else.

 &HT;        PA SENS. ARLEN SPECTER AND RICK SANTORUM SAY FULL SENATE
TRIAL NEEDED   By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan 01, -- Pennsylvania Republican Senators Arlen
Specter and Rick Santorum have emerged in agreement that the Senate
should hold a trial to resolve impeachment charges against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the consensus between the more moderate Specter and
conservative Santorum does not reflect one among GOP Senators, some
of whom favor a more swift conclusion to the impeachment process
that would bypass a full trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to proceed with a trial,'' Santorum said.
``That's the best course from the perspective of what is right for
the situation and for history. We set a dangerous precedent if we
dispense with a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter had initially favored waiting until after Clinton left
office to resolve the charges, but changed his mind when the House
voted to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, who was overseas and could not be reached for comment,
said on CBS's Face the Nation last week that he favored a
bipartisan, deliberative proceeding, but did not think a vote could
be ``taken today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it does have to go to trial,'' Specter said. ``I don't
think anybody is prepared to vote today.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter, also said that censure is ``really not worth the
tinker's damn...''
</P>
<P>
   Senate majority leader Trent Lott, R-Mississippi, is reportedly
circulating a plan that suggests taking a vote, up or down, on
whether charges against Clinton - even if they are proven true -
are serious enough to warrant his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Several Senators from both sides of the aisle have pushed for
such a plan, saying they wanted a quick resolution and an option to
consider censure.
</P>
<P>
   But Santorum said any movement toward favoring censure is media
hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say any push for a consensus on censure is
media-created,'' Santorum said. ``I don't know that anyone is
pushing for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said it wasn't constitutional for the Senate to censure
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure is punishment for the president,'' Santorum said.
``Our role is whether to convict on charges or not to convict. I
don't think we should be able to punish. Besides, anything short of
trial is thwarting our constitutional responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum, who is mum on whether he would convict Clinton, said
anybody who is ready to vote would ``not make an impartial juror in
a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how anybody can vote before they have heard all
the evidence and testimony,'' Santorum said. ``I don't think the
trial has to be long or drawn out. That all depends on how Clinton
cooperates.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said if a trial proceeds it would not jeopardize issues
like Social Security reform, which he has stated as a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all possible to get done,'' Santorum said. ``We
can get this impeachment process behind us and move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said he thinks Clinton's leadership has been key in
efforts to reform Social Security to prevent it from going
bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone else has shown that kind of commitment to
bipartisan Social Security reform,'' Santorum said. ``I do think
that would suffer if Clinton had to leave office.''

POPE SAYS RESPECTING HUMAN DIGNITY IS KEY TO WORLD PEACE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Pope John Paul II declared Friday that the defense of
human dignity forms the foundation of world peace, and he urged the
world to renew its dedication to the respect of individual human
dignity at the end of a century often marked by its violation in
war and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating Mass in St. Peter's Basilica to mark World Peace
Day, which was established by Pope Paul VI in 1967, John Paul
invited his listeners to glance back over the past century. He
evoked poignant images of ``two world wars, cemeteries, tombs to
the fallen, destroyed families, tears and desperation, misery and
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also reminded his listeners that the century would also
be remembered for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which
was proclaimed by the infant United Nations in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul, who in a year's time plans to lead ceremonies to
open a Jubilee holy year to mark the beginning of the third
millennium of Christianity, spoke in a reflective and somber tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we begin the year 1999, the last year before the Great
Jubilee,'' the pope said. ``It is as if the mystery of history were
revealing itself with more intense profundity before our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a gesture to Israel, which the pope has
repeatedly said he hopes to visit for the millennium, and to the
Jewish people, with whom he has sought reconciliation, the pope
said, ``How can we forget the concentration camps, the children of
Israel cruelly exterminated?''
</P>
<P>
   But he also recalled ``the sacred martyrs,'' and named two of
his particular heroes: the Rev. Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish priest
who died at Auschwitz and was declared a saint by the pope in 1982,
even though critics recalled Kolbe's attacks on Jews in earlier
publications, and Sister Edith Stein, a Jewish-born nun who also
died at Auschwitz. She was canonized in October despite Jewish
objections that she was killed because she was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul, who is 78, experienced much of the horror of
World War II as a young man in his native Poland. In the drive to
end decades of communist rule in Poland and other Eastern European
countries that was a hallmark of the early years of his
pontificate, the Pope often evoked respect for individual human
rights as a condition for a peaceful world order.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who was dressed in glittering gold vestments for the
90-minute service, praised efforts in this century to reassert the
rights of individuals, particularly after the last world war. ``Our
century is also the century of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, which recently celebrated its 50th anniversary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a New Year's address to 30,000 people gathered in St.
Peter's Square, the pope said he hoped 1999 would be a ``year of
authentic progress and serene and peaceful coexistence for the
entire world.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, John Paul issued a 20-page message in honor of the
World Day of Peace in which he emphasized that the ``culture of
human rights cannot be other than the culture of peace.'' In that
message, delivered to governments around the world, the pope also
urged them not to allow the globalization of financial markets to
pave the way for the neglect of basic human needs.

HUN SEN FAVORS A TRIAL FOR KHMER ROUGE DEFECTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ In an angry statement, Prime Minister Hun
Sen denied Friday that he was opposed to a trial for two
high-ranking Khmer Rouge defectors and said he supported an
investigation into the mass killings in the 1970s when the group
controlled Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to criticism for his statement this week that the
defectors should be met with bouquets rather than handcuffs, Hun
Sen said his first priority had been to secure peace and that the
question of trials was the next order of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``My position is that the trial of the Khmer Rouge is a fait
accompli and should proceed,'' Hun Sen said in a statement read by
an announcer on national television. He was referring to a case
that was opened 20 years ago after the Vietnamese army drove the
Khmer Rouge from power. He noted that in a statement welcoming the
defectors _ Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea _ he had said explicitly
that he could make no guarantees of immunity.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement made Friday, Hun Sen said he had been
consistent for years in seeking to bring the Khmer Rouge to justice
for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
   He accused foreign nations of ``fake morality'' for nurturing
the Khmer Rouge in a decade-long civil war against him when it
suited their purposes, then criticizing him when he lured them to
defect with a promise of national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   In a revealing comment about the apparent contradictions of his
statements, Hun Sen, who plays chess, said, ``The best chess player
is the one who knows how to move a large number of pawns in support
of each other from point to point to secure victory.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would have been a ``cowardly commander'' if he
had negotiated the surrenders of Khmer Rouge leaders only to turn
on them and arrest them the moment they were in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Though it does not appear that any arrest of a Khmer Rouge
leader is imminent, the two recent defectors may have reason to
rest somewhat less easily after Hun Sen's statement. He has many
pawns on the board, he is reading the politics of the situation and
his options are open.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling the heat, the Khmer Rouge mounted a verbal counterattack
Friday, with a spokesman also raising the muddy political and moral
issues of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Any trial of Khmer Rouge leaders for the deaths of more than a
million people between 1975 and 1979 should also include an
examination of ``200 days and 200 nights'' of American bombing of
Cambodia during the Indochina war, said the spokesman, Long Norin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they push for a tribunal, we will dig up the past and we
will present our own case,'' he said. ``Then we will go to The
Hague together for trial.'' The World Court is based in The Hague,
as is the international tribunal investigating war crimes in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen stirred controversy four days ago by appearing to oppose
a trial, saying, ``If a wound does not hurt why should we poke it
with a stick to make it bleed?''
</P>
<P>
   His statement Friday suggested that he had been affronted by an
outcry that branded him as soft on the Khmer Rouge. It has been a
point of pride for him that he has consistently opposed the
movement from which he defected in 1977 and that he has played a
major role in its defeat.
</P>
<P>
   He said his first priority had been to secure the surrender of
Khmer Rouge leaders, bringing peace to his country for the first
time in a generation. Next on the agenda is the question of how to
proceed with an accounting, he said, sounding very much as if he
did intend to proceed with a trial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``What type of court should be set up, national or
international?'' he said. ``Where shall it be located, in Cambodia
or abroad? Will they use Cambodian or foreign judges and
prosecutors or a mixture of both? Will the trial be based on
Cambodian or international laws?''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he is not a jurist and that it is not up to him to
decide either whether to go forward with a trial or how a trial
should proceed. Nevertheless, Cambodia is far from being a nation
of laws; the judiciary still answers to his diktat.
</P>
<P>
   The statements by both Hun Sen and the Khmer Rouge suggested
that if a trial were to proceed it would involve not only an
exploration of one of history's great atrocities but it might also
open a re-examination of U.S. policies and pragmatism during the
Vietnam War and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   In an aggrieved tone, Hun Sen recounted his history of
opposition to the Khmer Rouge and the parallel history of Western
powers in keeping the movement alive specifically to oppose his
Vietnamese-backed government during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, although it remained no more than a jungle
insurgency, the Khmer Rouge was allowed to keep its seat at the
United Nations. Hun Sen's Cambodian government was treated as an
international pariah, although it was the Khmer Rouge that had
carried out crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Hun Sen noted, it was the United Nations that tried to
draw the Khmer Rouge into Cambodian politics _ despite his protests
_ as part of the 1991 Paris peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Khmer Rouge not decided to boycott the U.N.-sponsored
election in 1992, he pointed out, the peace agreement would have
welcomed them back into society without a trial _ just as he has
done now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it then an artificial morality in the era of the Cold War
and ideological confrontation?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   A leading Cambodia scholar, David Chandler, made a similar
observation in an interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty sordid,'' he said. ``It was high Cold War, as
you remember. Pol Pot should have been pushed off to trial in the
1980s but that would have been embarrassing to the United States.
These things are very easy to be sanctimonious about but very hard
to draw lessons from.''
</P>
<P>
   Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge leader, died last year without having
faced a genuine trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Khmer Rouge statement Friday took history back more than a
decade earlier to the American bombing campaign in Cambodia, which
killed many Cambodians and helped spread the war across the border
from neighboring Vietnam. The bombing, which began in 1969, was
intended to cut the supply lines of the North Vietnamese army.
</P>
<P>
   The statement seemed to hold the hope that the United States and
other countries, facing the skeletons of their own past, might have
second thoughts and embrace the proposal made by Khieu Samphan on
Tuesday that everybody simply ``let bygones be bygones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of players were involved and it is a very complicated
situation,'' the Khmer Rouge spokesman said, echoing Khieu
Samphan's comment that history is complicated and that it is
difficult to pin down ``who is wrong and who is right and who is
doing this and who is doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen was clearly in a pugnacious mood on Friday. Breaking
with the protocol of Southeast Asian diplomacy, he took direct aim
at Cambodia's western neighbor, Thailand, which has given sanctuary
to his Khmer Rouge enemies since they were driven from power in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia has had to negotiate with Thai officials and obtain
their cooperation for each new round of defections. Thailand has
never admitted to its close relationship with the Khmer Rouge,
which has been a fact of life in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I ask our friends for an apology that I have been forced
to speak the truth for the sake of a real morality, not a fake
one,'' he said.

FREE ACCESS TO A SOFTWARE CODE MAY COME INTO ITS OWN
</HEADLINE>
  (For release on Monday, Jan. 4.)  
(nk) 
 By AMY HARMON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The seers of 1997 had the computing trends of 1998 pretty much
nailed down _ the Justice Department's antitrust challenge to the
Microsoft Corp., panic over the Year 2000 bug and Wall Street's
infatuation with Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Unforeseen, however, was one of the year's most striking
developments: The surging popularity of what has been called
open-source software _ probably because it had long been regarded
by the industry's most powerful players as more of a political
ideology than a way to make money.
</P>
<P>
   Open-source software provides every computer user with free
access to the software's source code, the actual lines of commands
that the programmers wrote to create the software. Publishing this
code offers users who are programmers the chance to examine it, to
fix bugs or inefficiencies or to suggest improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Once widely denigrated by commercial developers as chaotic
programming by committee, open source is now expected to come into
its own this year as a business model, with potentially
far-reaching consequences for developers and consumers of computer
software.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predict that the growing availability of
open-source software will push industry prices down. Others
forecast higher quality by both proprietary and open-source
products, driven by a new competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the start of 1998, the question was would there be an
economic model that would sustain the success of this open-software
movement, and I think that question has been answered,'' said
Robert F. Young, chief executive of Red Hat Software, which
provides services and support for a free computer operating system
called Linux. ``The question for this year is how rapidly is this
going to deploy?''
</P>
<P>
   Open software programs like Linux, (rhymes with ``cynics'') a
variant of the Unix operating system, are not owned by any company
or individual. Instead, a global network of programmers and users
manage and upgrade them, typically without being paid directly to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Their motivations vary. Many have built formidable reputations
with their contributions to open-source programs, and those
reputations can translate into lucrative job offers. Others profess
an almost moral commitment, arguing that open-source development
simply works better than the traditional closed, proprietary
environment of commercial programming.
</P>
<P>
   Linux, the star of the open-source movement, is seen as a
competitor to Windows NT, Microsoft's industrial-strength operating
system. Indeed, perhaps the most persuasive evidence of the
potential of open source to rattle the balance of power in the
computer industry came recently from Microsoft itself. In two
internal memorandums that found their way to the Internet, a
Microsoft engineer described Linux as a ``mind-share threat'' and
suggested ways to compete with and co-opt open-source development.
</P>
<P>
   Open-source has its roots in venerable programs like Sendmail
Inc.'s software that Internet servers around the world use to relay
e-mail to its intended destination, and Perl, the programming
language that was used to fashion many of the the World Wide Web's
interactive features.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of the Internet has fostered such projects,
broadening the universe of potential contributors and allowing for
nearly instant distribution of constant upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Open source began to gain support last year from blue-chip
technology companies. IBM, for instance, became a major contributor
to Apache, an open-source program for creating Web pages used by
the vast majority of Internet service providers. In a new
commercial twist on the theme, Sun Microsystems Inc. agreed to make
its popular Java source code available to developers who license
it. Sun is also retaining PricewaterhouseCoopers to audit the
process of who determines which new functions can be added to the
language.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most widely publicized move in this trend was when
the Netscape Communications Corp. released the source code to its
Navigator Web browser. America Online Inc., which plans to acquire
Netscape, has pledged to support its open-source initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The moves are driven in part by a common interest in supporting
alternatives to Microsoft. But they also reflect the emergence of a
new emphasis on making money through software services and support
rather than from the software itself.
</P>
<P>
   Young of Red Hat Software, which last year received investments
from Intel and Netscape, predicts that the top 10 manufacturers of
personal computers will offer Linux by the end of this year.
Although IBM and Compaq Computer's Digital division sell operating
systems, each has announced plans to make some of their software
work with Linux. The idea is that they will make money on hardware
sales and consulting fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge for open-source software is not whether it
will replace Microsoft in dominating the desktop, but rather,
whether it can craft a business model that will help it to become
the Intel Inside of the next generation of computer applications,''
wrote Tim O'Reilly, whose company publishes dozens of books about
open-source programs, in the November issue of the industry
newsletter Release 1.0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise,'' O'Reilly warned, ``the open-source pioneers will
be shouldered aside by someone who understands precisely where the
current opportunity lies.''

   Online Searches For Offline Work
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is no longer just for technophiles, and neither, it
seems, is online job-hunting. A growing number of services are
catering to job seekers of all types, offering everything from
online classified ads to aptitude evaluation questionnaires and
resume advice.
</P>
<P>
   And a new study suggests that most people searching the World
Wide Web for employment opportunities are not looking for jobs
involving computers and software.
</P>
<P>
   Career Mosaic, a Web employment site, analyzed key terms typed
in by job seekers who conducted 15.1 million searches of its data
base between July and September. The word that came up most often
was ``manager'' (or ``management''); only 3 of the 10 most
frequently used terms _ ``engineer,'' ``computer'' and
``programmer'' _ were specifically technical.
</P>
<P>
   Other search terms in the top 10 were sales (No. 3), marketing
(4), finance (5), accounting (6), assistant (8) and human resources
(10). Over all, the company said, the survey illustrates the Web's
increasingly mainstream place in the workaday world.
</P>
<P>
   Singing Those Retirement Blues
</P>
<P>
   Business publications regularly note how Americans are not
saving enough for retirement. A recent study by Ohio State
University researchers of data collected by the federal government
confirmed the trend, finding that 48 percent of Americans would not
be able to maintain their accustomed living standards, as measured
by current levels of spending, after they retired.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that current spending habits had a lot to
do with the ability to finance retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-one percent of respondents said their household spending
matched or exceeded their income in the previous year. Of that
group, the study found, only one-fourth would have enough income
during retirement to maintain their living standards. By
comparison, three-quarters of the remaining respondents, who spent
less than they made, would have enough for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who said when they intended to retire, 35 percent said
they were aiming for 61 or younger. But only 44 percent of that
group were likely to have enough resources to maintain their living
standards, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published recently in Financial Counseling and
Planning, a journal, was based on data from the 1,387 households
that took part in the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances, conducted
every three years by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury
Department. It examined participants' spending, saving and
investment patterns and their planned retirement ages.

GOING, GOING, GONE ON LINE TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For release on Sunday, Jan. 3.)  
(ms) 
 By JUDITH NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I just bid $180 for a Donna Karan black cashmere sweater I've
never seen. It's supposed to be new, but for all I know it has
spent the last three years locked in a closet with bulimic moths.
Until recently I had assumed that anyone foolish enough to buy
anything through an Internet auction had too much time, money or
both. But today, I find myself eager to shell out $100 for a used
scarf.
</P>
<P>
   How did this happen?
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, most of my friends have gone berserk
over Ebay, the online auction house offering everything from
Corvettes to Furbies. Ebay is like a flea market with a potentially
limitless number of booths _ and an all-important time limit on the
bidding. You can send in your maximum bid and hope for the best or
be a jockey and neurotically track the item's progress minute by
minute.
</P>
<P>
   One friend said she knew she had gone overboard when a dealer
sent her an e-mail beginning, ``Hello, Darling.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone I knew was urging me to join the fun. I resisted. Which
wasn't hard. I hate shopping _ that mad-dog look in everyone's
eyes, the doctor's-office feeling of taking off my clothes behind a
curtain. And I especially hate the overabundance of choices: too
many Fendi bags in one place and I hyperventilate. For years I've
strong-armed my best friend, who was approximately my shoe and
dress size, to accompany me on every shopping expedition so she can
try on stuff that might fit me. But recently, she lost weight and I
gained. So it's perhaps not surprising that she was the first one
to suggest I try Ebay. She used the one argument guaranteed to get
me to the Web site: Ebay, she promised, would help me realize my
ultimate goal of never having to leave my apartment.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why Ebay can make a rabid shopper out
of someone like me. First, the system allows you to limit choices.
Sure, you could get waylaid if you're not careful _ which is how I
found myself craving a blood-red evening dress yet bidding on a
blood-pressure gauge after typing in ``blood'' and ``read'' by
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're careful, Ebay can target the object of your desire
with the precision of a cruise missile. Typing the words ``Chanel''
``shoes,'' ``size 10'' means I never even have to think about
Guccis, about Ferragamos, or about whether Chanel 9's might fit.
For that matter, who knows whether a Chanel 10 in this particular
style will fit: but if it's a great bargain, if it's Chanel and if
I can capture it for me, me, me _ I become possessed.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows what new merchandise tomorrow will bring? That's
why one can't afford not to check in with Ebay once a day. Twice.
OK, 23 times _ but who's counting?
</P>
<P>
   Ebay also has its literary pleasures _ and I don't mean just the
used-book auctions. (A signed first-edition Anita Brookner was mine
for $27!) Many Ebay sellers seem to be frustrated philosophers. My
favorite is a seller of vintage clothing who goes by the name
enoki. Apparently, enoki sees old cheerleader outfits, deb evening
gowns and the like as her chance to comment on the human condition.
A recent typical entry, offering a pair of boys' cowboy boots:
``Back in the 50's, boys were encouraged to be `boys,' complete
with little Western outfits and capguns. Nowadays, Mommy is so
worried about raising a serial killer that she encourages little
Andy to play with A B C blocks and leave the guns to the Marines.''
Take that, J. Peterman.
</P>
<P>
   Also undeniably piquant, even to a full-time nonshopper, is the
covert market for fetishistic goods hidden among the wholesome
designer fashions. I found this out _ quite accidentally, of course
_ when I typed in ``Calvin Klein'' and discovered ads for used
underwear amid the jeans, jackets and eyeglasses. ``Help a college
kid continue with his education'' runs an ad for three pairs of
pre-owned briefs.
</P>
<P>
   On Ebay, my polite and timid department-store persona vanishes.
I am not a lumpy size 10 hoping the dressing room has those very
special skinny mirrors. Invisible and anonymous, I am a bronzed
beach bunny who'll look just fabulous in that vinyl halter
mesh-chain dress.
</P>
<P>
   But of all its advantages over other forms of shopping, the real
selling point is that Ebay allows for _ indeed, encourages _ the
consumer version of road rage. If I go to a normal sale, I am far
too genteel to elbow anyone out of the way for that last Escada
winter-white double-breasted jacket. And real-live auctions leave
me exhausted and anxious _ loathing myself for being so grasping
and loathing everyone else more for being greedier and richer than
I. On line, I am a shopping warrior, able to vanquish every foe
with a click of my mouse.  &UR; You say $80 for that Hermes scarf with
the galloping horsies? Die, Earthlings! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I've read the tales of fraud and disappointment on Ebay. I
understand that the $60 Ralph Lauren square-hoop earrings I just
bought for $15 might not be Lauren at all and that the gently worn
blue Versace jacket I'm furiously bidding on might not even fit.
Maybe there are shills, friends of the sellers' bidding up items.
Maybe I'm the shill. (One time I upped the ante on the highest
bidder _ only to discover that the ID of the previous highest
bidder was mine.)
</P>
<P>
   Who cares? I am hooked.
</P>
<P>
   It was the final evening of bidding for the Donna Karan cashmere
sweater, size L. The auction, which had been going on for six days,
was ending at 1 a.m. Someone could (and usually does) swoop in
during the last few minutes to beat the highest price. I had to be
at a party, and the hostess did not have a computer. I considered
bringing my laptop as I saw another Ebay devotee do during this
busy holiday season. Instead, I asked a friend to bid for me.
</P>
<P>
   At the party, I got into a long obsessional discussion with
another Ebay groupie. His habit was 1939 World's Fair memorabilia.
I confided to him about the sweater. Would I get it? I had
instructed my friend to bid up to $250. But it might not be enough
... Should I call him, just to see how things were going?
</P>
<P>
   Another guest leaned over and gently patted my arm. ``I want you
to know,'' she said, ``you'll be OK without the sweater.''
</P>
<P>
   She was right, of course. I perked up. Who needed yet another
black cashmere sweater? I scorn such nauseating displays of
consumerism in others, and I laugh at the country's obsession with
overpriced designer goods.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, I never had to face the future without this
sweater. The bidding stopped at $220. Let's see _ that's $30 less
than I'd planned to spend. Just enough to start the bidding on that
adorable pair of Prada ankle boots.

AUTO MAKERS PREDICT STRONG SALES THIS YEAR

 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Global slowdowns in the auto industry have
consistently started in the United States, which accounts for
nearly a third of worldwide demand. But that pattern, which dates
back to the end of World War II, seems to have been broken in the
last year as plunging sales in Asia and South America have hurt
auto makers around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether sales will stay strong in North
America, and whether the European auto market will remain vigorous
despite recent hints of weakness, particularly in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Most auto executives are still expressing optimism for 1999. But
difficulties in North America or Europe, the world's two biggest
markets in terms of sales, would create serious problems for
multinational auto makers.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's health is important because highly variable auto
sales tend to be a leading indicator of recessions. Auto
manufacturing accounts for about 4 percent of economic output in
the United States, for instance. The General Motors Corp. and the
Ford Motor Co. are the world's two largest companies in terms of
sales and share of global economic output, although the planned
acquisition of the Mobil Corp. by Exxon would produce an even
bigger company if antitrust regulators do not require the combined
enterprise to sell significant parts of their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For now, auto executives are watching low unemployment rates and
low interest rates in Western industrialized countries and
concluding that 1999 will be a fairly good year. ``If you look at
the world today, there are only two areas that look strong, but
they happen to be the two biggest,'' said John F. Smith Jr., the
chairman and chief executive of General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler AG are predicting a sixth
consecutive year of high sales of around 15 million cars, sport
utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans in the United States _ a
remarkable streak of level sales in an industry that until the
current boom had never managed more than two successive years of
roughly identical sales.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives in Europe are slightly less bullish about 1999
than their American counterparts, though they are not gloomy. ``We
will see a possible slowdown but we definitely don't see a
recession in 1999, as far as the United States and Europe are
concerned,'' said Juergen E. Schrempp, the German co-chairman of
DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the United States and Europe, there is a definite
pall. The domestic Japanese auto market has been moribund since
1990. Auto sales in smaller markets in Southeast Asia and Latin
America have fallen as much as 70 percent, compelling auto makers
to furlough workers and postpone investment plans made as recently
as two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts worry that the optimism in Detroit may be
misplaced, given the troubles overseas. Prosperity at home ``gives
us the mind-set things haven't changed,'' said Paul D. Ballew,
chief economist at J.D. Power &AMP; Associates, the automotive
consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in truth, he added, ``we are in the midst of a global
slump.''
</P>
<P>
   The precise level of worldwide auto sales is hard to calculate
because some developing countries provide statistics late, if at
all. But auto makers release detailed figures for worldwide auto
production, which match up closely with sales. The final worldwide
tally is likely to show a 12.8 percent drop in 1998, and a further
1.5 percent decline in 1999, according to estimates by J.D. Power.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest financial damage has been to Japanese and South
Korean auto makers, which face weak markets at home and were making
the most aggressive efforts to expand in Asia before that region
became the epicenter of global currency and economic problems. The
Hyundai Motor Co. of South Korea has already bought control of the
insolvent Kia Motors Corp., another Korean producer. Now auto
makers around the world are following the struggle of the Nissan
Motor Co., which was forced in November to negotiate a 100 billion
yen ($817 million) loan from the government-run Japan Development
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Asian auto makers are also suffering because they are strongest
in small cars, the segment of the global auto market hurt by an
enormous excess of assembly plants. Auto makers around the world
have the capacity to build 70 million vehicles a year of all sizes
for an international market of 50 million vehicles, and most of the
overcapacity is in small cars.
</P>
<P>
   But while small-car factories are being closed or are running
shorter hours, factories that produce sport utility vehicles and
other light trucks are typically running around the clock and are
still unable to keep up with demand. American auto makers own most
of the world's sport utility vehicle production capacity,
particularly for larger, high-profit models. These models have
become very popular in the United States and, to a lesser extent,
in foreign markets as gasoline prices have fallen in
inflation-adjusted terms.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Ford survived in the early 1980s partly because of
profits from their international operations, while foreign auto
makers used their profits overseas to build up American
subsidiaries. But as Asian and South American markets crumble and
the European market looks a little shaky, the North American market
has turned into a bastion of profits for the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the shoe is on the other foot _ North America is carrying
virtually everybody else,'' said William Clay Ford Jr., Ford's
chairman. ``We are very dependent on North American profits, and
particularly our North American truck profits.''

   Down for the Count, a Stock Becomes a Net Heavyweight
</P>
<P>
   For George Horowitz, chairman of the Active Apparel Group,
reviving his small clothing company's dead-in-the-cellar share
price often seemed like the name of his line of active wear, ``The
Grind.'' The thinly traded stock wallowed around at $1.25 a share
as recently as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Horowitz, 48, discovered the Internet. When he announced
that his company's retail Web site had started operations, Active
Apparel became an instant darling of the Internet stock-trading
community. Never mind that it had yet to peddle a single pair of
its Everlast boxing trunks electronically. The stock hit $19 by
Tuesday. Horowitz's stake surged from $758,000 to $10.8 million.
Since then, investor ardor has cooled and the stock has slipped to
$8.125, but it still managed a 550 percent gain for the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such big changes are a little unnerving,'' Horowitz said. In
fact, the volatility has taken a toll. Horowitz said he felt ``a
little under the weather from all this running around,'' including
appearances on CNBC and CNN. ``I just hope that when all this
settles down, we hold some of the premium. We should, I think,
because investors are just beginning to realize the value in our
company.''

   Ballooning? It's Just So 1870s
</P>
<P>
   Richard Branson, the gung-ho chairman of Virgin Group of Cos.,
presumably did not enjoy seeing a picture of himself _ windswept
and waterlogged _ on the front pages of Britain's newspapers the
day after Christmas. But he was unable to escape the barrage of
publicity that came when he aborted his fourth effort to
circumnavigate the Earth and ditched his hot-air balloon off
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Jean-Jules Verne, great-grandson of Jules
Verne, the author of ``Around the World in 80 Days,'' said he
couldn't take the efforts of Branson and his crewmates, Per
Lindstrand and Steve Fossett, seriously. ``I'm not taken in by the
ICO Global Challenger's team,'' Verne told Le Figaro, the French
newspaper. ``What they are doing is closer to a millionaire's whim
than a genuine scientific inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Verne, 36, who recently put his famous ancestor's works on
CD-Rom, said Jules wouldn't have been impressed, either. ``He would
be much more enthusiastic about a possible voyage to Mars than by a
competition reserved for people who can afford to indulge in this
sort of craze,'' he said.

   Another Day, Another $100 Million
</P>
<P>
   Another Las Vegas executive has given $100 million to a citadel
of higher learning. Just before Thanksgiving, James E. Rogers,
owner of Sunbelt Communications, doubled an earlier pledge to the
University of Arizona's college of law, to $100 million. Then,
before Christmas, Ralph Engelstad, owner of the Imperial Palace
Hotel and Casino, pledged $100 million to the University of North
Dakota in Grand Forks.
</P>
<P>
   Engelstad said that nearly half of the gift would be used to
build a 12,000-seat hockey arena at the school, where he played
goalie in the early 1950s. The university's president, Ken Baker,
told The Associated Press that he was ``really without words to
adequately express how incredibly grateful we are.''
</P>
<P>
   But Erik Siemers, editor of the school newspaper, The Dakota
Student, had a slightly different take. ``Personally, it's really
exciting,'' Siemers said, noting that hockey is something of a
religion in the state. But, he added, ``Some people might be
skeptical and ask, `How much does the hockey program need?' '' UND
teachers, he said, ``are very low-paid _ very.''
</P>
<P>
   Prepare for Departure. Quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It's the little things that count in making the planes fly on
time. Make that the little things you don't have to count. The
flight attendants on Delta Air Lines' no-frills carrier, Delta
Express, complained they were wasting time totaling up the
beverages and napkins for the next flight before loading them in
galley drawers.
</P>
<P>
   So Paulette Corbin, Delta Express' managing director (and a
former flight attendant), told them to skip the task. Also at their
suggestion, magazine racks were moved from the front to the back of
planes, so browsing passengers would not slow down boarding.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes after the last passenger gets off an airplane, the
crew starts getting it ready for the next load, Ms. Corbin said,
``and 30 minutes later we're flying again.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts did not exactly cheer the launch of Delta
Express two years ago. ``The first article that I remember called
us `Delta Distress,''' Ms. Corbin said. Since then, though, the
carrier has nearly tripled its daily flights, to 170 from 62.

ERA MAY END FOR FLOATING CURRENCIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year's dominant economic story might be summed up this way:
When currencies float, economies sink.
</P>
<P>
   From Thailand to Russia, many nations' currencies floated when
their exchange rates against the U.S. dollar collapsed, often under
pressure from speculators. Then, without exception, those nations'
economies sank. The failure of links, or pegs, to the dollar, the
world's benchmark currency, made it harder for Russia and many
Asian countries to repay foreign loans and contributed to severe
recessions.
</P>
<P>
   The currency-induced turmoil has shaken some core assumptions of
modern economics. For decades, the prevailing orthodoxy in monetary
policy has favored floating exchange rates. Financial markets, not
governments, should dictate the value of a currency, the thinking
goes. Central banks should achieve policy objectives by raising or
lowering interest rates to influence the market. Most major Western
economies manage their currencies this way.
</P>
<P>
   But one outcome of the global financial turmoil is that some
economists are challenging that way of thinking, at least as it
applies to smaller and less-developed countries. The debate seems
likely to heat up this year and could well lead to the most radical
shifts in the way economies interact with one another since the
system of fixed exchange rates broke down in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, Eastern Europe and parts of Asia, leading
economists, businessmen and government officials are pondering the
idea of effectively abandoning their independent currencies,
strictly curtailing the powers of central banks and linking
themselves to one or another of the world's major currencies,
especially the dollar or the euro, as the modern equivalent of
gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sense a growing feeling in Asia and Latin America,
particularly, that floating rates are fine for the United States
but not so good for small countries,'' said Merton Miller, a Nobel
prize-winning economist at the University of Chicago. ``For many
years, everybody in America thought floating exchange rates were
the answer, but now there's a sense that this exacerbates the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller has recently won converts to his long-held view that
smaller countries should replace the central bank with a currency
board, which in its pure form has none of the market-intervening
powers of today's central banks. In this system, the country still
issues currency, but the central bank by law agrees to exchange the
currency at a preset rate for dollars or some other strong foreign
currency. Money supply is dictated by the central bank's reserve of
hard currency, meaning that the quantity of local currency
fluctuates depending on how much foreign currency the country
gathers through trade or investment.
</P>
<P>
   A leading benefit of currency boards, proponents say, is to
remove the power of central bankers who use money supply to
manipulate their economies, often for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currency sovereignty is the right to have stagnant growth
because the central banks screw up all the time,'' said Rudiger
Dornbusch, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. ``In this environment it is increasingly ridiculous to
argue that every country must have its own central bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, only a handful of governments, including those of Hong
Kong, Argentina and Bulgaria, have currency boards, which were a
common management tool for colonies in the British empire. Hong
Kong and Argentina back their local currencies with U.S. dollars,
while Bulgaria guarantees convertibility with the German mark at a
fixed rate.
</P>
<P>
   Though countries with currency boards have been affected by the
same global turmoil that struck their neighbors _ Hong Kong's
economy is in a deep recession _ the currency boards have so far
survived. They have given the developing world a rare example of
monetary stability. Hong Kong, Argentina and Bulgaria are widely
seen as better positioned than their neighbors to rebound quickly,
in part because outside investors have faith that if they invest in
those nations they won't face the risk of devaluation before they
get their money back.
</P>
<P>
   Making money stable has been the greatest monetary challenge of
the ages. Stable currencies promote trade and investment, which
have become increasingly important drivers of economic growth in
recent years. Historically, countries sought to make their
currencies solid by stocking treasuries with gold, which prevailed
as the monetary standard in the United States from the late 19th
century until the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   With the decline of classical economics in the 1930s and '40s,
economists turned against the gold standard and promoted the
creation of bigger and much more powerful central banks. Now the
tide appears to be shifting again, in favor of smaller central
banks and more rigid currency regimes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest contributors to that shift, of course, is
European monetary union, which took effect Friday. The 11
participating nations are replacing their currencies with a single
currency, the euro, and a single central bank, a once unthinkable
sacrifice of national monetary sovereignty in favor of a
high-minded economic ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro is a great example of how the world is going to
look,'' said Sebastian Edwards, a professor of international
economics at the University of California at Los Angeles. ``The
euro itself will float against the dollar and other currencies, but
member countries will have rigid exchange rates among themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many economists see the world eventually dividing into
two or three currency zones, one ruled by the euro, one by the
dollar and perhaps a third, farther in the future, that uses the
Japanese yen or Chinese yuan as an anchor. Each smaller country in
a region would either simply accept the benchmark currency as legal
tender at home or adopt a currency board.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the transition, if it happens at all, to come
overnight. The International Monetary Fund has favored the use of
currency boards in some cases but discouraged them in others. Some
leading economists argue strongly that free-floating currencies are
still the best system. And many analysts agree that the leading
enemy of monetary stability is not a genuine free float but
currency alchemy, the kind of monetary distortion that may occur,
for example, when a country tries to have the fixed exchange rates
of a currency board but still gives its central bank power to
manipulate exchange rates and money supply.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has warned against
quick-fix solutions to fundamental problems in emerging markets,
arguing that tinkering with currency regimes is no substitute for
sound macroeconomic management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many emerging-market economies have tried a number of
technical devices: the fixed rate peg, varieties of crawling peg,
currency boards and even dollarization,'' Greenspan said in a
recent speech. ``The success has been mixed. Where successful, they
have been backed by sound policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some economists say they would not be surprised if the
move toward currency boards gathers momentum in coming months or
years. Among the countries most likely to adopt them are Brazil,
Mexico, Russia and Indonesia. The issue is being debated in all
those countries.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian economists and politicians are considering whether to
follow Argentina's lead by linking the real to the dollar, creating
the core of a currency alliance that would tie those two countries
together with Uruguay and Paraguay. A vocal group of Mexican
economists and businessmen are pushing for the dollarization of the
economy _ abandonment of the national currency altogether in favor
of reliance on the American dollar _ though few see that outcome as
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia explored setting up a currency board last year, before
the Suharto government collapsed, and the idea may be revived as
the nation struggles to restore order to its economy. Russia is
under pressure to take radical steps, including establishment of a
currency board, to restore some credibility to the battered ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Those nations would have to sacrifice sovereignty over areas of
monetary management that were once considered purely national. But
the lesson of the recent world turmoil may be that currency
management is fundamentally international anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that Germany and France had deep enmity extending
back many years,'' Miller said. ``They came together to form the
core of the euro countries. Who's to say that Brazil and Argentina,
or China and Japan, cannot resolve their grievances? I think that
sooner or later they will realize that this is the way to go.''

HOW TO SPEND THE LONG-SOUGHT SURPLUS

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1997, Congress and the Clinton administration
agreed on a five-year plan to balance the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, they watched in surprise as the deficit disappeared
ahead of schedule and the nation entered what should be a long era
of surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Congress and the administration will debate in earnest
for the first time what to do with the fiscal windfall, which the
Congressional Budget Office estimates should total $1.55 trillion
over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   They can use the money to help shore up the Social Security
system. They can use it for tax cuts. They can use it to increase
spending on education, health care, the military and other
politically popular programs. Or they can use it to pay down the
$5.5 trillion national debt accumulated over decades of deficit
spending.
</P>
<P>
   But if the options are clear cut, budget politics this year are
likely to be even more muddled than usual, even if the focus has
shifted from the belt-tightening of the deficit years to dividing
up the spoils generated by a strong economy and excess tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 18 years the goal of fiscal policy was clear: to
reduce the deficit,'' said Thomas Gallagher, a political economist
at Lehman Bros. in Washington. ``Now there's no clear goal for
fiscal policy. This will be the hardest year to anticipate the
outcome of the policy debate, and a hard year for the markets to
interpret what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the usual ideological and interest group politics
that shape the debate over tax and spending priorities, both
parties will be keeping a close eye on the economy. If growth slows
substantially and unemployment rises, Republicans are likely to
step up calls for a tax cut to give the economy some fiscal
stimulus and Democrats are likely to call for additional spending
on unemployment insurance, job retraining and other social programs
to help ease the impact of any downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a sharp economic downturn, though, the budget debate
will center on Social Security. With the retirement system heading
toward insolvency in 2032, according to the latest government
projections, the administration and congressional leaders are
looking for solutions among a host of ideologically charged and
politically sensitive proposals.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is not just Social Security's long-term health, but the
budget agenda for 1999. In a move that even Republicans concede was
brilliant politics, Clinton demanded early last year that Congress
set aside any surpluses until the nation had dealt with Social
Security _ a formulation that stymied Republican efforts to use the
surpluses to finance tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, too, have been itching to get at the surplus. After
years of being told that social programs had to be curtailed in the
interests of bringing down the deficit, they have a long list of
priorities that they say deserve more money, especially education,
child care and help for people moving off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Working out agreements that can pass a Republican Congress and
win the president's signature would be difficult enough, given the
ideological difference between the parties. Reaching bipartisan
deals in the aftermath of impeachment proceedings will be even
trickier.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, you have to find a way to accommodate both sets of
goals, or neither gets done,'' said Philip Moseley, a former
Republican chief of staff for the House Ways and Means Committee
who is now a partner at Ernst &AMP; Young. ``It's going to take some
accommodation. What I don't know is whether the political situation
will allow for that.''
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans succeed in freeing up some of the surplus for a
big tax reduction, they will face a fight among themselves about
what kind of cut to pursue. Social conservatives want to
concentrate on tax cuts for families, and have put at the top of
their list a reduction in the so-called marriage penalty. Economic
conservatives are pressing for an across-the-board cut in income
tax rates. In recent years the social conservatives have prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has left open the possibility that he could support a
tax cut once Social Security's problems are solved. But when asked
about uses for the surplus, Clinton's advisers have, in the last
several months, emphasized the need to also shore up Medicare, the
health insurance system for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the crosscurrents at play, Gallagher of Lehman Bros.
said he could see four possible developments. First is what he
calls ``the big deal,'' in which the two parties agree on Social
Security and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Second would be an outcome similar to 1998, in which the two
parties stalemate, spending a bit of the surplus, but basically
allowing it by default to go to reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The third of his outcomes is no Social Security deal, but a
modest budget package, including some additional spending plus some
reduction in the marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that
leads many two-income couples to pay more in taxes than single
people with the same incomes.
</P>
<P>
   And fourth is a sizable tax cut independent of a Social Security
overhaul _ an outcome that would be likely only if the economy
turned down sharply.
</P>
<P>
   There are some signs that the two parties might be able to reach
a compromise on Social Security. But any bipartisanship on that
front could be more than offset by lingering effects from the
impeachment proceedings. And if the two parties are unable to reach
some accommodation on fiscal issues this year, they will have to
wait until after the presidential race of 2000, which both sides
think could hinge on what priorities the nation wants to set for
the new era of fiscal plenty.

WHEN THE SUN GOES OUT OF THE SUN FLOWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 3)  
(DW) 
 By TOVAH MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I figured it was safe to visit Moses Pendleton only after
sunflower season was a distant memory. It didn't seem wise to
arrive in midsummer during the throes of this year's sunflower
fiasco. Moses, as he is universally known, doesn't suffer failure
lightly, and he finds helianthus-related humiliations particularly
hard to bear.
</P>
<P>
   Moses Pendletonis a dancer and choreographer. founder of the
groundbreaking Pilobolus troupe and the founder, choreographer and
artistic director of Momix. But 20 years ago, when he first settled
in a cavernous Victorian house in Washington, Conn., where both
Pilobolus and Momix are based, he decided that the place needed to
be spruced up by a garden. A friend advised that sunflowers were
the least labor-intensive option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hacked out ray-shaped beds from the wilderness, planted
seeds of Mammoth Russian and enjoyed an Instamatic garden,'' Moses
said. Beginner's luck continued for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the blissful days when sunflowers flowed freely.
Gardens planted in variations of a gigantic wheel with spokes or
spirals dense with sunflowers provided a reason for dinner parties
with tables set for 60 at the center of the helix. The gargantuan,
radiant botanical overachievers inspired Momix's 1991 ``Passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before sunflowers hit international stardom as cut flowers,
the biggest blooms found their way into vases throughout the
rambling Victorian house. Three rocking chairs on the porch were
commandeered by sunflower-faced scarecrows. Dried sunflowers
predominated Halloween and Thanksgiving decorations. By Christmas,
sunflower seed heads were pinned to the wallpaper in the living
room and strewn on mantels.
</P>
<P>
   That was 20 years ago, and Moses has ever since been found
planting sunflowers faithfully on the Ides of May. You can set your
watch by it.
</P>
<P>
   He insists on performing the sowing ritual himself, although he
has hired a gardener to tend, thin, weed and fertilize. When things
were going smoothly, every summer morning, he could be found in the
center of his sunflower wheel, getting ``energized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a solarist,'' Moses once said. ``I worship them.'' The
sunflower garden ranked among his proudest triumphs and most vital
muses, until something went awry about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the days when deer, chipmunks and crows were his
primary concern. However, the last couple of years have brought
foes of a more serious nature.
</P>
<P>
   First, it was verticillium wilt, then, it was rhizoctonia,
compounded by other opportunistic viruses. At first, a single plant
here and there curled up its leaves and wilted. Then stems started
succumbing wholesale to a distinct white mold. Before long, his
garden had a 90 percent mortality rate, or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of going down to the garden to become inspired, I went
down to bury the dead,'' Moses moaned.
</P>
<P>
   He tried everything, including altering his planting pattern to
leave infected soil fallow; spacing the plants, so that each had
plenty of breathing room; spraying every 7 to 10 days with a
fungicide; thinning out and burning infected bedfellows; and
sterilizing tools.
</P>
<P>
   Sunflowers are not normally such a challenge. They are often
recommended to beginners as a ``sow and stand back'' operation. But
nature doesn't usually smile on large-scale, single-species gardens
and Moses' property was a classic monoculture.
</P>
<P>
   He has experimented with cultivated varieties other than the
standard Mammoth Russian. But they all fall victim sooner or later,
even the age-old Tarahumara White Shelled sunflower grown by
Southwestern American Indians long before Europeans settled this
country. He draws the line at chemicals so toxic that they require
donning a full-body rubber suit, and he has yet to try steaming the
soil and then covering it with tin foil. He has consulted every
agriculture extension agent and university botanist who will listen
to his plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to call my senator,'' he threatened, in the heat of

   Moses refuses to surrender, although friends have tried to prod
him toward cannas, poppies or any other flashy flower that might
divert his attention. Instead, the sunflower-possessed
choreographer is seeking disease-resistant heirloom varieties and
look-alikes. (So far, the perennial many-armed Helianthus
maximilliani, as well as the closely related Mexican sunflower,
Tithonia rotundifolia, have proved steadfast.)

 By RUTH LA FERLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a short story serialized on the Internet, Prince William, the
16-year-old heir to England's throne, has just rushed to the side
of his injured girlfriend, Hannah, who lies in a hospital bed,
enmeshed in a network of life-support tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Upon seeing her helpless and inert, the prince can only stare.
``He had still not shed a tear,'' wrote Mary Duncan, spinning her
tale in The Shy Royal, billed on the Web as the newsletter of the
Prince William Fan Club. ``He just had to keep himself under
control. He had been trained for that since he was very young.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems fitting that the young nobleman with the proverbial
stiff upper lip has been given the star treatment in fiction that
is as melodramatic as anything on ``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince William crept into the consciousness of American girls,
many of them not yet teen-agers, shortly after the death of his
mother, Diana, princess of Wales. His stoic suffering touched their
hearts. But in recent months, the object of their fantasies has
gained the status of a full-blown idol _ and a formidable rival to
another charmer of young hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an international superstar almost on the level of
Leonardo DiCaprio,'' Christina Ferrari, the managing editor of Teen
People, said. ``That's the kind of hysteria he creates wherever he
goes among teen-aged girls.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no official tally of his fans, since there is no
officially sanctioned fan club (the palace discourages them), only
a scattering of informal clubs on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But the volume of letters and e-mail at Teen People (each month,
he is one of the magazine's 15 most requested male celebrities) is
great enough that the editors recently made him the subject of a
soft-cover book, ``Prince William, Prince of Hearts,'' the first
such venture for the magazine, published last month by Warner Books
and Teen People.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince William is a poster boy for crushes,'' said Beth
Mayall, the editor of ``All About You,'' a magazine for junior high
school girls. Last fall it featured the prince on its cover, after
readers rated him the celebrity they most wanted to see on the
newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   In paperbacks, magazine pinups, posters and snapshots that are
cropping up in supermarket checkout racks as well as appearing in
Sam Goody and Barnes &AMP; Noble, Prince William is seen skiing and
hiking, and gamboling in the park with his former nanny, Tiggy
Legge Bourke, and playing with his beloved dog, Widgeon, with his
diffident smile and cornflower eyes radiating.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not his looks alone that have captivated Prince
William's young admirers. They see him as a late-20th-century
Galahad embodying a kindness and valor most movie stars do not
possess. The thinking girl's sweetheart, he exudes a refinement
some fans see as a refreshing antidote to the churlish, bad-boy
image of Hollywood's top stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's civilized,'' declared Olivia Katz, a 13-year-old
eighth-grader at the Spence School in New York. Unlike DiCaprio,
whom she dismissed as ``really gross'' _ ``I think he parties a
lot, has lots of girls'' _ Prince William seems innocent, she said,
adding, ``He's not doing stuff you don't approve of.''
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder then that 8-to-18-year-olds venerate ``His Royal
Sighness,'' as fan magazines have dubbed him, tacking his pictures
to their walls, pasting his image inside their lockers and school
binders, exchanging factoids on the Web _ enshrining him in all the
places once reserved for DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   ``After `Titanic,' and all the hype, Leonardo DiCaprio just kind
of got old,'' said Julie Fletcher, 16, a sophomore at Stratford
High School in Houston and co-president of the Prince William Fan
Club, whose 200 members communicate on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince William is cuter than Leo,'' said Lauren Garfield, 10,
a fifth-grader at the Murray Avenue School in Larchmont, N.Y., who
has saved a spot on her bedroom wall for her idol. ``I'll probably
hang him over my bed,'' she said. ``He's hip, he's modern, he's the
new thing.''
</P>
<P>
   What gives him an edge over his stiffly regal forebears and his
entertainment-world rivals is his naturalness, his spontaneity, and
his apparent accessibility. ``Our readers know that he doesn't live
this hothouse-flower life,'' Ms. Ferrari said.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, in the eyes of his fans, he seems sincere.
``Movie stars have an image, but you know it's just an image, one
they put on for photo shoots,'' said Dana Lautin, a ninth-grader at
the Nightingale School in New York. ``But with Prince William, it's
not that. You see him in pictures at school with his friends or
hugging his father, and he seems really sweet; you know he's not
fake.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reinforcing the perception that the prince is no recluse tucked
away in a cold granite tower, is the steady proliferation of
magazine articles that describe him going to concerts, watching
MTV, dating the sisters of his friends and attending the ``Spice
World'' movie premiere, sharing the pastimes that other kids do.
</P>
<P>
   Readers of Seventeen, YM and Superteen learn that their idol
likes fast food, techno music and action-adventure fiction, that he
is an expert swimmer, that he has his own bathroom at Eton, his
boarding school, and that among his most treasured possessions is
his mother's Cartier tank watch.
</P>
<P>
   This avalanche of data has encouraged his most ardent groupies
to believe they might someday actually meet their prince. ``We
don't get that sort of reaction with our other celebrities,'' said
Ms. Mayall, whose celebrity roster at ``All About You'' includes
the actors Christian Slater, Matthew McConaughey and Joshua Jackson
of ``Dawson's Creek.'' ``Judging by their letters, some of our
girls believe they could even date him,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   But the youngest and most pragmatic of Prince William's fans
know better. ``In a way, he's just another heartthrob,'' said
Katharine Schub, 10, a fifth-grader at the Garrison Union Free
School in Garrison, N.Y. He has managed to retain his high standing
in her pantheon of idols that includes Ben Affleck, Brad Pitt and
Justin Timberlake of the pop group 'N Sync, and he rates a place of
honor on her bedroom wall. ``But you can't really keep your hopes
up; he is just so much older,'' she said. ``You know you could
never go out with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Still,'' she admitted, a note of wistfulness seeping into her
voice, ``he's the only person at the moment who I think is really
cute.''

<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors Corp. practically invented the
auto-design extravaganza, piquing the public's interest in the
1950s with its glitzy Motorama shows that included futuristic
concept cars. But in recent years, as its budgets were cut and its
marketers gained prominence over its designers, GM has pretty much
sat in the shadows at the leading auto shows, upstaged by its
crosstown rivals.
</P>
<P>
   This year, GM is planning to make a splash once again. Starting
with the 1999 North American International Auto Show in Detroit,
where press previews begin Jan. 3, and continuing through the other
leading shows this year, GM wants the world to know that a lot is
going on behind the closely guarded doors of its design center.
</P>
<P>
   GM is providing a sampling of some 200 vehicle concepts it has
developed to explore new types of vehicles and design themes it
plans to use for each of its divisions. The company has not put on
such a corporate spread of design studies since the '50s, said
Wayne Cherry, vice president of design at GM.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've selected concepts representing five divisions to show
publicly all at once,'' Cherry said. ``They will show the breadth
and depth of GM's portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the GM concept cars making their debut at the
Detroit show, which opens to the public Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   BUICK CIELO _ Based on the Regal GS and equipped with GM's
venerable supercharged 3.8-liter V6 engine, the Cielo _ Spanish for
``sky'' _ is a a five-passenger, four-door contemporary convertible
built for a family.
</P>
<P>
   The car is laden with technology: The hardtop retracts along
roof rails that extend from the front pillar to the rear deck; the
roof responds to spoken commands, retracting in segments or all the
way. The clamshell doors _ access is easy, because there is no
pillar between front and rear _ also open electronically on
command. And voice recognition is also used to fold down the rear
seats and operate the various entertainment and climate controls.
</P>
<P>
   With its fluid lines, the Cielo's design is reminiscent of the
first Buick concepts created by GM's legendary design chief, Harley
Earl. The car revives a discontinued Buick trademark _
``portholes'' outside the engine compartment _ and has a prominent
Riviera-style grille.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cielo has a very strong design theme that I think we can
use with Buick for the foreseeable future in terms of giving us a
strong identity,'' Cherry said.
</P>
<P>
   CADILLAC EVOQ _ This two-passenger roadster bristles with
technology, but perhaps more significantly it is is ``a medium to
show the visual direction of Cadillacs of the future,'' Cherry
said.
</P>
<P>
   The black Evoq (pronounced evoke) has sharp edges and a
retractable hardtop similar to the Mercedes SLKs. And Cadillac is
using it as a showcase for its latest high-tech devices, including
Night Vision, a system that uses infrared cameras to allow drivers
to ``see'' objects at night that are beyond headlight range; an
on-board computer that can connect to the Internet; a digital audio
system, voice recognition controls and external rear-view cameras
instead of conventional mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   The engine is a supercharged 4.2-liter version of the acclaimed
Northstar V8.
</P>
<P>
   CHEVROLET NOMAD _ Chevy, which has been reviving famous names
like Malibu and Impala, has dusted off this appellation originally
used in the 1954 Motorama and then applied to sporty station wagons
in 1955-57 _ cars that are treasured by collectors today.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Nomad defies categorization. Technically, it is a
performance coupe because of its two doors, its rear-wheel drive
configuration and its 5.7-liter V8. Stylistically, the
five-passenger vehicle looks like a station wagon. But access to
the back seat is through pivoting panels that pull out and back,
somewhat like the doors of a minivan. The rear seats fold flat with
the rear floor. A tailgate pulls down like a pickup truck's, then
slides under the cargo bay. The roof retracts in sections like a
Venetian blind, allowing tall loads to rise above the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   OLDSMOBILE RECON _ GM calls this, like the Nomad, a crossover
vehicle, though it clearly resembles a compact sport utility. With
hard edges even more severe than the Evoq's, this five-passenger,
four-door hatchback has a two-panel sunroof and is loaded with
technology, including an Internet-capable computer.
</P>
<P>
   PONTIAC AZTEK _ A vehicle that seems much like a sport utility,
the Aztek mixes in attributes of a sedan and a minivan. An
extremely sporty four-door, four-passenger hatchback, the bold
Aztek has flip-and-fold rear bucket seats to provide a flat floor _
they can also be removed _ and has innovative storage areas like a
minivan. The instrument cluster resembles that of a motorcycle. The
Aztek is front-wheel drive with traction control and is powered by
a 3.4-liter V6 engine. It features traditional Pontiac styling
touches like air scoops, a split grille and ribbing along the
sides.

FORD EAGER TO MAKE A SPLASH

   When J. Mays took over the top design post at Ford Motor Co. in
October 1997, he boldly promised to put his signature on Ford's
cars at the Detroit auto show in 1999. He would begin, he said, by
making the company's brands more distinct from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Mays, one of today's most watched car designers, will begin
delivering on his promise today with the unveiling of a reborn
Thunderbird evocative of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Ford will showcase that car, along with other concept vehicles
and production models, in an elaborate and huge (about 100,000
square feet on two levels) exhibit that Mays played a prominent
role in designing. Each brand under Ford's control _ Aston Martin,
Ford, Jaguar, Lincoln, Mazda and Mercury _ will have its own
display area intended to set a complementary ambiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overall theme for the show is separation and amplification
of the individual marques under the Ford umbrella,'' Mays said in
an interview. Ford will also showcase ``aspirational products''
like the Thunderbird. He describes these as ``products you desire
and covet'' and that stimulate an emotional response.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are cars with a point of view, and a point of view that
isn't going to appeal to everyone,'' he said. ``It's much the same
as Harley-Davidson says _ they try to delight the few and therefore
attract the many.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are two products Ford will display:
</P>
<P>
   FORD THUNDERBIRD _ This rear-drive, V8-powered two-seat roadster
uses styling touches from the 1955-57 and 1961-62 T-Birds and uses
pastel colors from those periods. Aluminum provides a modern touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to give people the car they looked at and dreamt
about as children,'' Mays said. ``It's a very light-hearted,
relaxed American look at what a great Sunday afternoon drive could
look like.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thunderbird is scheduled to go into production as a 2000
model, marking the 45th anniversary of the original T-Bird.
</P>
<P>
   LINCOLN BLACKWOOD _ Mays describes this luxury pickup truck,
which was shown publicly last week at the Los Angeles auto show, as
the ultimate utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   It looks much like a Lincoln Navigator from front bumper to back
doors, but behind those is a pickup bed lined with stainless steel
and covered by a metal top. The exterior is accented with dark,
trendy Wenge wood _ not an applique _ from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackwood could easily be produced, and because it would
require few new components it would cost relatively little to
build. Mays said Ford had not decided whether to offer it.

TORTURE CHAMBER INCLUDED IN CONSERVATIVES' `DARK AGES' RETREAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Really, truly, they are not the Anti-Clinton Party,
say the conservatives who are meeting here in this sun-baked desert
for their now-annual examination of their identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But disgust with the president is so pervasive, and the
perception that he is ``winning'' the political and cultural wars
despite his recent impeachment is so galling, that he seems to have
replaced the Soviet Union as the organizing principle around which
conservatives can rally.
</P>
<P>
   Listen in on a radio interview conducted in a hallway here by
Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R.-Ariz., a former broadcaster who matches Rush
Limbaugh's gusto when seated before a microphone: ``We have gotten
such rhetorical bilge from this administration, such patented
falsehoods, and that leads to the crisis of confidence on any issue
involving this president,'' Hayworth intoned.
</P>
<P>
   In the few seconds that Hayworth allows his guests to comment,
Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and a
columnist for the American Spectator, assented.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Clinton was ``hollowing out'' the military but that
the country had not been able to focus on that because the
president is ``making everyone focus on the fact that he treats
women like dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Dark Ages, a conservative conclave designed as a
send-up of Clinton's Renaissance Weekend in Hilton Head, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative gig, staged here at the toney Arizona Biltmore
(rooms start at $350 a night) with its lush rolling fairways, maze
of heated outdoor pools and warm cerulean skies, is in its third
year.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, conscious of the signals that the name Dark
Ages sent, the organizers dropped the parody and called their
gathering ``The Weekend'' in an attempt to give themselves an
identity that is not Clinton-dependent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to react to the Establishment left,'' Norquist
said when released from Hayworth's sound stage. ``This is a
counterpoint to Renaissance, but you don't want to go around in
life reacting to them. They aren't that important. We're not the
`Not Clinton Party.' We don't need to define ourselves in
opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's so much fun.
</P>
<P>
   When Laura Ingraham, a talking head on MSNBC and a co-founder of
The Weekend, opened the event here Thursday, she could not resist
spoofing the notoriously earnest, self-absorbed, politically
correct panel discussions at Hilton Head.
</P>
<P>
   This year's topics, Ms. Ingraham deadpanned, ranged from ``A
Path Toward Personal Empowerment: How Perjury Can Work For You,''
to ``Understanding the Politics of Personal Destruction. Panelists
include Sidney Blumenthal, James Carville, Maxine Waters and Ann
Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the name change, the rules for the 300 Weekend guests
are consistent with those of the Dark Ages: ``No sharing the pain
of another, and no building of bridges to the next century,'' the
program cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   As at Renaissance, there are panel discussions here. But they
are more outward than inward, more political than personal, and
littered not with captains of industry but with the new information
gurus _ cable-television personalities from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Major topics: ``The Republican Party: What's Ahead?'' and
``Conservatism With a Heart.'' Keynote speakers include party
luminaries like Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Sen. Fred Thompson of
Tennessee, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of
New York and Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Added at the last minute as a substitute for Rep. Henry Hyde of
Illinois, who is busy preparing for an impeachment trial before the
Senate, was Matt Drudge, the bad-boy cyber-scoop artist, who teased
the crowd here with the promise of a story that he said would rock
the world. He provided no details but relished feeding the
ever-hungry Clinton-scandal maw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a huge story, if it comes together,'' Drudge confided to
Hayworth's KYFI radio audience, his earphones slung around his neck
so that he could sport his trademark Walter Winchell hat. ``It's a
story of world-wide impact. People have been moved into safe houses
today, awaiting medical results. This is all I will say on this.
Stay tuned to the Drudge Report.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he had to compete with other rumors circulating here,
most speculating about what Larry Flynt, the Hustler publisher,
plans to reveal next week in his continuing expose of the private
lives of public Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the theatrics, and after a bracing climb up the
craggy crevices of nearby Camelback mountain, conservatives here
expressed deep anguish about the conservative movement and its
wayward parent, the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   It bubbled up from the rank-and-file activists, many of them
Californians who believed the Republican Party abandoned them in
the last election and who sought clues from the panelists as to
some of Washington's mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are all the liberals willing to fall on their swords for a
narcissistic sociopath like Bill Clinton?'' asked one audience
member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are Republicans intimidated by Bill Clinton?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we in the condition we're in?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
offered a status-quo message of unity and was practically booed off
stage. One of his chief chiders was a fellow panelist, Arianna
Huffington, the conservative columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson tried to reassure The Weekenders that the party would
``coalesce,'' with a message developed by a ``message outreach
team,'' once it had a presidential nominee. ``And that is only 15
months away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Huffington was flabbergasted. ``Fifteen months?'' she asked
incredulously. ``Fifteen months is an eternity.'' In a scathing
review of the party establishment she said that Nicholson's
statement demonstrated that the party was leaderless and bereft of
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The angry conservatives applauded her loudly. But they gave
their most vigorous support to a Democrat sitting on the same
panel. He was Patrick Caddell, a Hollywood writer and former
adviser to the presidential campaigns of George McGovern, Jimmy
Carter, Walter Mondale and Gary Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell lashed the Republicans for political ineptitude. He said
they foolishly carried out a partisan impeachment over the
president's sex life while failing to go after the Clinton
administration for what he said was the far more serious offense of
accepting foreign campaign money and transferring sensitive missile
technology to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the White House is wondering, can anybody here play this
game against us?'' Caddell said. ``You guys do not know how to pick
the right fights,'' he declared, unleashing a smashing round of
self-flagellating applause and winning himself a standing ovation.

<P>
   NEBRASKA CITY, Neb. _ Lewis and Clark would not know the
Missouri River now.
</P>
<P>
   The tumultuous water that taunted their canoes as they forged
the way to the American West is docile now, domesticated.
</P>
<P>
   The ``confused jumble of savage-looking snags'' that Mark Twain
steered his steamboat through is now slick and sterile. And there
is little left of the muddy water that Horace Greeley once said was
like ``thick milk porridge _ you could not discern an egg in a
glass of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years now, the hand of man has tamed the Missouri River,
damming it and diking it, streamlining and straitjacketing it into
a channel for barges and a generally well-behaved feeding tube for
the fertile farmland on its banks.
</P>
<P>
   But big changes are coming to the Big Muddy, America's longest
river, stretching nearly 2,500 miles from Three Forks, Mont., to
St. Louis, is in the throes of an identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   After the withering drought of the late 1980s and the ferocious
floods of 1993, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which essentially
controls the river's water flow, decided it needed to re-evaluate
its master plan.
</P>
<P>
   The fracas over the river's future is fierce as
environmentalists, farmers, barge operators, recreation boosters,
hydroelectric utilities, Indian tribes and municipal leaders all
try to make sure the river stays _ or becomes _ what they want it
to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody would dearly love if we could come up with a
recommendation that everyone could agree on,'' said Richard H.
Opper, executive director of the Missouri River Basin Association,
a coalition of the eight river-basin states and two dozen Indian
tribes, which met recently to discuss the river.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle is the Corps, which controls how much water
is released from upstream reservoirs after each year's snow melt _
and when. It has the sometimes Sisyphean task of insuring there is
enough water when and where it is needed, but not so much that it
mutinies its banks.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps has issued a list of options _ different ways to
adjust the ebb and flow of the Missouri _ with the aim of making a
decision later this year.
</P>
<P>
   And that has unleashed a torrent of debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying for years there are really two things that the
Corps could not propose politically,'' Opper said. ``One was
keeping the current situation the same. The other was any sort of
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Nebraska City, an unpretentious, plain-vanilla Plains
town about 400 miles upriver from where the Missouri dumps into the
Mississippi near St. Louis, most of the conflicts are easy to see.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers like John Crook, growing corn and soybeans on river
bottom land his great grandfather staked out in 1878, want the
Missouri to be reined in further so their crops won't drown.
</P>
<P>
   People like Ray Pinney, who manages the barge terminal here,
want the water to stay swift and deep so towboats and barges can
keep hauling fertilizer up from St. Louis and Kansas City and
taking grain down river at harvest time.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Smith, who represents the environmental group, American
Rivers, in this part of the country, and Gerald Mestl, a biologist
with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, want the river to
return, as much as possible, to its natural, free-flowing state.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of management have destroyed miles of natural habitat,
threatening the survival of many species and landing three _ the
pallid sturgeon, the piping plover and the least tern _ on the
endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
   And Nancy Hoch, who heads the economic development corporation
in this town of about 7,000 people, is supportive of farming and
business interests. But like leaders in other cities that once used
the river as an industrial dumping ground, she also understands
environmental concerns. After all, Nebraska City's claim to fame is
as the home of the inventor of Arbor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly that the river does not belong to
anyone,'' said Ms. Hoch. ``It does not belong to the least tern. It
does not belong to barge traffic. We need to balance the river.''
</P>
<P>
   But balance is hard to come by on a river that sculpts the
country's mid-section, draining about one-sixth of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Further north of Nebraska City, a booming hunting, fishing and
boating industry wants to insure the reservoirs don't lose too much
water each year.
</P>
<P>
   And up and down the Missouri are Indian tribes, who have begun
to assert claims to water rights along significant portions of the
river, supported by a turn-of-the-century Supreme Court ruling.
When they ultimately negotiate what water they control, the tribes
say they envision many uses including irrigation, electricity and
exporting water for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many interests in the Missouri River Basin,'' said
Richard Bad Moccasin, executive director of the tribes'
organization, Mni Sose Intertribal Water Rights Coalition (``Mni''
means ``water'' in the Lakota language, and ``Sose,'' Bad Moccasin
said, means ``the way the Missouri used to be _ murky and muddy and
wild and woolly.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't envy the Army Corps,'' he said, ``but, well, they
created the monster _ trying to change that mighty Missouri.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALAKHANY, Azerbaijan _ A forest of rusting oil derricks, relics
of the last oil boom here a century ago, stretch from this gritty
town toward the shore of the Caspian Sea. They are producing
low-grade crude, worked by laborers who live nearby in hovels. Oil
permeates the soil, and in warm months its stench becomes nearly
unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   A welder who lives at the edge of the sprawling oil field, Kazim
Heydarov, earns a monthly salary of $50 from the state-owned
Azerbaijani oil company. With that and the produce from a small
vegetable garden, he supports his wife and three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the oil money starts coming in, the government will pave
our streets,'' Heydarov predicted during a recent break from his
work. ``There will be free medicine and schoolbooks. I'll be making
enough money to move to a nicer place away from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he and his friends would react if the oil wealth did
not filter down to them, Heydarov paused, as if he had never
considered the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money has to be used for our benefit because we're the
people of this country,'' he said finally. ``If it doesn't, of
course we will be very angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Waves of cash are expected to begin pouring into the treasuries
of Azerbaijan and the two other new Caspian nations, Kazakhstan and
Turkmenistan. Even with a slump in crude oil prices, all three
former Soviet republics will probably have more than enough money
to guarantee most citizens a comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden riches, however, can be dangerous. Oil money has made
some countries prosperous, but it has helped destroy others. The
three new nations on the shores of the Caspian Sea are ruled by
despots, torn by ethnic rivalries, plagued by corruption and
surrounded by unruly neighbors. Many outsiders doubt their ability
to survive the bonanza ahead. Some fear a decline into
Nigeria-style chaos rather than a rise to Norway-like stability and
affluence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sign that they will have the capacity to manage
this wealth,'' said Ercan Murat, the chief U.N. representative in
Azerbaijan. ``It will create a lot of problems. It will increase
the already substantial gap between rich and poor, and eventually
it will affect political stability.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point in the coming decade, when oil and gas production
reaches full capacity and pipeline networks are in place, the three
new Caspian nations will be hit by what planners call ``the wall of
money.'' Each will probably take in billions of dollars each year
from energy exports.
</P>
<P>
   Falling oil prices have sobered energy executives and government
officials in Caspian countries. Their resource is large enough,
however, that even with low prices, they can be reasonably sure of
making enough money to lift their countries out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials pledge that they will use this money to
build schools, hospitals and roads. But they concede that no plans
are in place to assure such promises.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Azerbaijan, where the big money is expected to begin
arriving around 2003, newly rich ``oil sharks'' pay cash for luxury
cars but can barely drive them outside the capital because roads
are in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   In Kazakhstan, which also expects to see riches in about five
years, the government has moved its capital from the largest city,
Almaty, to Astana, a remote town on the northern steppe, at a cost
that may reach billions of dollars. Yet almost nothing is being
spent to deal with a virulent strain of tuberculosis that is
sweeping the country, or to combat other diseases ranging from
polio to bubonic plague.
</P>
<P>
   It is less certain when great wealth will come to Turkmenistan,
because someone must first build a pipeline for its natural gas
reserves, and energy companies are still deciding which route would
be most economical. But even with no decision in sight, President
Saparmurat Niyazov has embarked on a billion-dollar building spree,
borrowing money from foreign banks to pay for hotels, palaces and
mosques.
</P>
<P>
   ``The region could become a breeding ground of terrorism, a
hotbed of religious and political extremism and a battleground for
outright war,'' the U.S. deputy secretary of state, Strobe Talbott,
asserted in a speech.
</P>
<P>
   Three specters figure in almost every Caspian nightmare:
corruption, ethnic war and battles over political succession.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan spent
decades in the communist apparatus, rising to pinnacles of power in
a system that rewarded the clever, the devious and the ruthless.
Today they rule in the style of absolute monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Even critics of the three leaders acknowledge that they have
done remarkably well in balancing pressures from foreign
governments and oil companies. President Heydar Aliyev of
Azerbaijan has proven especially deft, returning from political
oblivion and then emerging as an international deal maker. Yet he
also personifies the region's weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Aliyev, who is 75, has crushed several potential successors,
apparently fearing that they might seek to overthrow him.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about the post-Aliyev era is taboo. Last year, the
police suppressed a magazine that had predicted chaos when he
passes from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   If Aliyev had wanted to encourage the emergence of younger
politicians, October would have been a fine time to do it. He was
running for re-election, and few doubted that even in a free
election he would win handsomely. But foreign diplomats and
election observers proclaimed the campaign deeply unfair, with the
police attacking opposition rallies and with ballot boxes evidently
stuffed to guarantee Aliyev a resounding victory.
</P>
<P>
   In facing the succession issue, as in other ways, Azerbaijan is
a troubling model for the two other Caspian nations awaiting their
riches.
</P>
<P>
   Niyazov, 58, was hospitalized in 1993 for what was described as
an arterial blockage in his lung, and last year he underwent a
quadruple bypass heart operation. Nonetheless, he insists that he
is in perfect health and brooks no talk of successors.
</P>
<P>
   When Niyazov visited Washington in May, journalists asked him
about reports that he represses opposition parties. ``We do not
have any opposition parties,'' he replied. ``You are misinformed.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, also
58, has called an election for January, apparently hoping to
prolong his mandate before any trouble sets in. He has forbidden
his most potent critic to run against him and has arranged for the
press to give him lavish coverage while virtually ignoring his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, both Azerbaijan and neighboring Georgia,
through which an oil pipeline is being built, were consumed by
civil wars. They could erupt again.
</P>
<P>
   In Azerbaijan, fighting between government troops and ethnic
Armenians from the Nagorno-Karabakh region ended in early 1994 with
the Armenians triumphant. But within a few years, Azerbaijan will
have enough money to build a powerful army and may be tempted to
try to retake Nagorno-Karabakh. That could prompt a regional
conflict, especially if Armenia's old friend Russia, or its new
friend Iran, decides to come to its aid.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, rebels have seized territory in two regions and
could probably stage insurgencies in two others. Shooting regularly
breaks out along disputed borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most disruptive things that could happen in these
countries are battles over succession and a renewal of ethnic
conflicts,'' said an American oil executive based in Azerbaijan.
``In your worst case they happen together.''
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is blatant in Azerbaijan, where many diplomats and
local citizens say that nearly every public official may be bought,
from lowly customs inspector to august cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country anyone can become rich overnight if the
president favors him,'' said Zardoucht Alizadeh, a leader of
Azerbaijan's small Social Democratic Party. ``If I get a permit to
export 100 million barrels of oil, I will be so rich I will never
have to work again. And that is without doing anything, just by
getting one favor from the president.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ambitious neighbors are watching them enviously. Some powerful
Russians dream of retaking these lands and their energy reserves,
or at least imposing pro-Russian regimes on them.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is working to increase its influence over neighboring
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. China thirsts looks longingly at the
reserves just over its western border in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this array of threats, many people in the new Caspian
nations remain optimistic. They complain about corruption and are
impatient for better housing, schools and medical care. Yet they
believe the promises their leaders have made, and they are eagerly
waiting for the money to pour in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is going to get better,'' predicted Muatlieva
Aksha, a mother who runs a roadside kiosk in Turkmenistan. ``We've
heard government people on TV talking about how much oil and gas we
have. It means that poor people aren't going to be poor any more.''

IN CITY OF CASTRO'S TRIUMPH, MOST STILL BACK HIM

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Cuba _ It has been 40 years since Fidel Castro marched
into this seaside colonial city at the head of a column of rebels
and declared the end of the Batista dictatorship from the balcony
of city hall. For residents here, it has been 40 years of
socialism, economic sacrifice and endless maneuvering in a cold war
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But as the city prepared Friday for Castro's return Friday night
to give a speech commemorating the anniversary of the revolution,
it was hard to find anyone on the streets here who would openly
criticize the 72-year-old Cuban leader or his policies.
</P>
<P>
   The town was dressed in propaganda. Cuban flags flew from
balconies, and signs celebrating the ``triumph of the revolution''
could be seen in all the shop windows. Banners bearing pro-Castro
and communist slogans were stretched across the narrow streets.
``To be Cuban is a privilege and a pact with Fidel,'' said one
sign.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, several working-class people and veterans of the
rebel army said they still supported Castro's long experiment with
socialism, despite the economic hardships they have had to endure.
Even with the economy in tatters, many said they have more
opportunity now than they did before 1959, when a good education
was out of reach for most poor people, especially those with black
skin. Castro's supporters also blame the U.S. trade embargo and not
the Castro government for their economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blockade is a crime against Cuba _ Cubans never deserved
this,'' said Ibrahim Salazar, a 63-year-old retired bus driver, who
was waiting with friends near the main plaza where workers were
setting the stage for Castro's speech.
</P>
<P>
   He wore a frayed T-shirt commemorating the revolution's 30th
anniversary. Salazar said he believed the revolution's major goals,
like free education and health care, had been met. His son had
become an engineer, something unthinkable for poor people 40 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't lose faith,'' he said. ``We have problems, but we are
going to conquer them.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
country's economic fabric had been slowly unraveling since 1991,
when the Soviet Union stopped subsidizing the economy with more
than $4 billion in aid. Since then, Cuba has become a country where
doctors make less than $30 a month and must moonlight as cab
drivers for tourists to make ends meet and where some educated
women with professional skills choose prostitution at resort hotels
as a way out of poverty. The average monthly salary is 207 pesos,
or about $10.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a country that more than 1 million people have fled
since Castro took over. Just last year, more than 450,000 applied
for visas to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sort of Titanic,'' said a one resident of Santiago,
who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared arrest.
``Everyone is trying to get a boat to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The system doesn't work. At this moment money is the
principle problem for everyone here. You need money to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   After four decades of Castro's socialist experiment, Cuba has
become a paradox. With free education and health care, it has the
highest literacy rate and the lowest infant mortality rate in Latin
America. The average life expectancy is now 75.3 years, far above
the 60 years in 1959. The number of university graduates per capita
has quadrupled, and Cuban doctors have broken new ground in
biotechnology and vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Castro has failed to break the island's dependency on the
sugar crop and tourism for most of its hard-currency earnings _
twin factors that were blamed before the revolution for making Cuba
an economic vassal of the United States. And the country is no more
democratic than it was under Fulgencio Batista, the dictator who
fled on Jan. 1, 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Castro has reluctantly
undertaken some market-oriented reforms. He has legalized the
dollar and allowed some small-scale private business: farmers'
markets, plumbing enterprises, hairdressers, language schools. He
has also decentralized some of the state-owned industries.
</P>
<P>
   But professionals like doctors, who continue to work are not
doing it for the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The living is not much, but we manage,'' said Dr. Juan
Fernandez, a general practitioner, who says he makes about $30 a
month. ``I like my profession, and I'm dedicated to my work.''
</P>
<P>
   To his supporters here in Santiago, Castro remains the best hope
for the working-class people in Cuba. Even if he is an autocrat,
several said, he is their autocrat, looking out for their
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his appeal is rooted in history and nostalgia. Some of
the older residents remember the New Year's Day morning in 1959
when Castro and his troops marched into town and announced the end
of Batista's rule. There was jubilation in the streets, people
singing and cheering for the end of the regime, which had used
increasingly repressive measures in an effort to stanch the
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lived through many assassinations, many tortures, and
the life was impossible here,'' recalled Rafael Guillen, an
accountant. ``When Fidel came, it was as if we had been in great
pain and someone had given us a painkiller.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The new generation who didn't live through it cannot
understand it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Others continue to support Castro because he has advanced
equality for blacks and women. Fermin Reynoso, a 40-year-old
driver, who is black, said that before Castro's takeover, blacks of
his father's generation never had a chance of rising in society.
Racism was pervasive then, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But under Castro, Reynoso could have a military career. He
served for nine years, fighting in Angola and Ethiopia, and retired
as a lieutenant. Now he has a relatively good job, and his children
have a chance at a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The socialist system has given a lot of opportunities to all
the blacks here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rolando Segui, 83, is typical of many of the older people here
who still support Castro. Like his father before him, Segui was a
butcher in the 1950s. There was no chance of going to college, he
said, nor of becoming something other than a butcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to become a butcher because there was no other work,''
he said. ``I never had the opportunity to study.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined Castro's rebellion, the July 26 Movement, because he
was appalled at the political assassinations that Batista's
operatives were carrying out in the streets of Santiago,
eliminating young people on unproven charges that they sympathized
with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   After Castro's victory, Segui was rewarded with government jobs,
first as a health inspector and later a housing inspector. He
retired 10 years ago. Segui says he is still optimistic about the
future. The abject poverty, illiteracy and sickness he witnessed in
his youth no longer exists. Most important, he said, his
grandchildren have a chance of rising in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we fought for,'' he said. ``If you want to be a
doctor, and you have the capacity to be a doctor, you can be a
doctor.''

 CLINTON PREFERS GOLF TO TALK AT RENAISSANCE WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also CONSERVATIVE-RETREAT) 
(mk) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILTON HEAD, S.C. _ President Clinton rang out his most unusual
of years in his usual, if peculiar, way: in very earnest policy
discussion with more than a thousand acquaintances and fans _ and a
few old friends and unimpressed strangers _ assembled at the annual
Renaissance Weekend here.
</P>
<P>
   For more than an hour as midnight approached on Thursday, the
president and Hillary Rodham Clinton fielded questions selected by
the event's organizers. In all the talk about Africa, Social
Security and health care, impeachment and Monica Lewinsky went
unmentioned. At midnight the president kissed his wife, then joined
in a champagne toast and sang along to ``Auld Lang Syne.''
</P>
<P>
   To some guests, the Clintons appeared solemn, far less spirited
and engaged than in the past. Indeed, after a year in which he
admitted adultery before his family and the world, launched his
biggest military assault, and became the second president ever
impeached, Clinton seems in particular need of renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   But if so, he did not seek it in the organized doings here. He
spent more time on the golf course and with his Labrador retriever
on the beach during his three days at this studious gathering, a
kind of ``Big Chill'' retreat for Baby Boomers who didn't inhale.
``This is sort of paradise if you're a C-Span junkie,'' enthused
Bob Richardson, winner of a Nobel Prize in physics for discovering
superfluidity in liquid helium 3.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not attend any of the chin-stroking seminars that,
like bran flakes in a retirement community, are a staple of the
official fare. He passed up the half-day ``academy'' devoted to
``Character: What is it? Does is it count?'' He also skipped ``My
Family's Lessons for Life,'' ``Spiritual Life in a Secular
Society,'' and a session on the meaning of the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   In some seminars, Clinton's trying year was an unavoidable, if
delicate, subject for the businessmen, politicians, scientists and
journalists. ``I don't think anyone here is quite so gauche as to
directly address'' Clinton's problems, said Walt Cunningham, the
Apollo 7 astronaut and conservative radio talk show host, though he
said the subject had been debated in a ``genteel way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentility is the reigning principle of this privileged, even
precious conclave, and guests bemoan what they regard as the
baffling failure of political discourse at large to mimic
Renaissance Weekend's lonely model. So far, the only ones to take
up the challenge are the conservatives who set out to mock it by
creating the rival ``Dark Ages'' conference, now known as ``The
Weekend,'' which is focused more tightly on politics.
</P>
<P>
   The throng here leans distinctly to the left, but there are some
notable Republicans, including Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., who voted
to impeach the president. He told The Associated Press that he
intended to avoid any talk of that with Clinton. ``They'd probably
be fairly unproductive conversations, to say the least,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford said he would encourage Clinton to achieve ``a legacy''
by fixing Social Security _ apparently not expecting the president
to be removed any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave the same impression, appearing as cheerful and
confident in public as ever. But those who spent private time with
him here described him as clearly in need of recreation and
preoccupied with maneuvering in the Senate over his upcoming trial.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a question-and-answer session with young people
Thursday evening, followed by the banquet and exchange later that
night, Clinton did not attend any Renaissance Weekend events. On
Friday, he spent more than four hours on the golf course _ on top
of almost six on Thursday _ before returning to the beachfront
estate he is using here. There, he watched his beloved Arkansas
Razorbacks lose a heartbreaker to Michigan in the Citrus Bowl. With
their daughter, Chelsea, the Clintons flew back to Washington late
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons have been regulars at Renaissance Weekend for 15
years, almost since its founding in 1981. Their detachment this
year contrasted sharply with past appearances, particularly with
the exuberant touch football games and job-seeking of 1992, after
Clinton's first election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That election transformed the annual event from a fringe,
low-key gathering into an A-list magnet for those who keep track of
such things. (Clinton's rising tide also elevated the weekend's
founder, Philip Lader, to the Court of St. James's, where he is the
U.S. ambassador.)
</P>
<P>
   Participants still gush about the breadth of the discussion and
the vigor of the networking. Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster,
rhapsodized about spending 90 minutes on Thursday walking the beach
with Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the sex expert, and Alan Blinder, the
Princeton economist. ``Al Franken's wife is helping me decorate my
new home!'' he added, referring to the comedian.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz's question was the last one read to Clinton on Thursday
night. After noting that he had got rich helping to write the
Republicans' Contract with America, he asked, ``What advice would
you give to the Republican party? I need the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton replied, according to the White House and participants,
that the Contract with America helped the Republicans in 1994 and
the Democrats in 1996. He called for a partisanship devoted to
debates over worthy subjects like Social Security. And in his only,
oblique reference to his difficult 1998, he said he hoped the
country would ``move away from the politics of personal
destruction.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Overseas stocks rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter, both in
developed and emerging markets. But in some emerging markets even
100 percent rallies were not enough to make up for the selloffs
that pushed stocks to their lows just as the quarter began. Many of
these markets still ended the year with declines.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Indonesia. Its stock market surged 120.6 percent in
dollar terms in the fourth quarter, according to the
emerging-market indexes of the International Finance Corp., the
private sector financing arm of the World Bank. But for the year,
the stock market is down 29.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian stock market rose 27.3 percent in the last three
months but is off 43.6 percent for the year. Brazil slipped 0.3
percent and is down 42.6 percent for the year, while the Mexican
market climbed 9.5 percent in the third quarter but is off 39
percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall Latin American markets, which are still being held back
by the doubts about the success of budget reform in Brazil, rose
6.9 percent in the fourth quarter but plunged 38.3 percent for the
year. Asian emerging stock markets jumped 24.6 percent but are down
6.7 percent for the year, according to the I.F.C. data.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea was an exception. Its stock market surged 123.3
percent in the last quarter, and the market is now up 119.1 percent
for the year. South Korea's economy has stabilized more quickly
than a lot of other Asian countries. Interest rates have fallen and
the country's trade deficit has turned around.
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Chapman, head of international equities at the Dreyfus
Corp., said most of the rallies in emerging markets had been driven
by local investors. Foreign investors, he said, are still staying
away.
</P>
<P>
   William P. Sterling, the global strategist for BEA Associates,
an investment management firm, said that ``some of these stock
markets have become penny stock markets, and institutional
investors can't play that.'' He also said investors could not
assume that good fundamentals had precipitated the fourth-quarter
rallies. ``I think that would be misleading,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the world's developed stock markets, the story was more
positive as the fourth-quarter rally, in many cases, wiped out the
losses from the selloff that accelerated with the ruble devaluation
and debt default by the Russians in August. In Europe, according to
the Financial Times/Standard &AMP; Poor's world indexes, Britain,
Belgium, Finland, France and Italy led a rebound that pushed the
European-wide index up 18 percent and left it up 24.8 percent for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The best performer in Europe was Finland, a market that few
investors pay much attention to. It surged 40.4 percent, buoyed by
two stocks that dominate the market: Nokia, the mobil phone maker,
and Sonera Group, the state-owned telephone company that went
public in November. Since then its stock is up 40.8 percent for the
year. Finland is up 106.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum was Norway, where stocks rose
3.5 percent in the Financial Times index, and Germany, Europe's
largest economy, where stocks rose 12.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Oil-dependent Norway was hurt by the plunge in petroleum prices.
In Germany, the market was held back by weakness in banks, like
Deutsche and Dresdner, industrial companies like Thyssen and energy
companies like RWE.
</P>
<P>
   European emerging markets were mixed. Eastern Europe together
was up 28 percent in the quarter but down 64.8 percent for the
year. Russia surged 66.3 percent, but it was still off a staggering
87.5 percent for the year. Hungary rose 37.2 percent in the last
three months, cutting its annual decline to just 10.8 percent. The
Slovakian market dropped 15.5 percent and plunged 54 percent for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   For next year, Chapman said that Europe would be bedeviled by
the same questions facing the United States: How much will the
economy slow down and what will happen to corporate earnings? He
said that in just the last several months the 1999 growth forecasts
for Continental Europe had dropped to 2 percent or less from almost
3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For American investors, the dollar played a key role in many of
the world's markets.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, including Indonesia and Japan, much of the
fourth-quarter rebound came from a slide in the value of the dollar
at the end of the year. When the value of the American currency
falls, returns from abroad are worth more when they are translated
back to dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, the dollar's decline accounted for one-third of
the investor's return.
</P>
<P>
   And in Japan, the weaker dollar was about four-fifths of the
quarter's 26.9 percent gain that pushed the stock market into
positive territory for the year with an increase of 5.5 percent.
All of the annual gain was due to a weaker dollar: In yen, the
Japanese market was down 8.5 percent. If many forecasters are
right, the dollar may begin to rally against the Japanese yen this
year, making gains for American investors much harder to come by.
</P>
<P>
   In New Zealand, Australia, Thailand and other countries the
weaker dollar added smaller, but significant, gains to the
quarterly return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incremental returns from the dollar are nothing to sneeze
at,'' said Mark Eisner, a co-head of the index products group at
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.

ON EURO WEEKEND, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN VAST REPROGRAMMING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Thursday was a day for champagne and
confetti. Friday began the long weekend of strong coffee and
takeout food.
</P>
<P>
   One day after 11 European countries christened the euro as their
new currency, financial institutions across the continent began the
enormous job of reprogramming their electronic networks before
markets reopen on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank has more than 3,200 people working
in shifts around the clock. In London, which remains Europe's
financial center even though Britain has not adopted the euro, more
than 30,000 workers are camped out in trading rooms and back
offices. And in countless smaller cities, local bank managers are
converting accounts for customers who want statements in euros
rather than marks or francs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In technical terms, this is by far the most complicated effort
we have ever attempted,'' said Susan Kirchhoff, J.P. Morgan's euro
project director in London. ``It really is unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversion affects thousands of electronic networks involved
in almost every aspect of exchanging money: Systems that trade
global currencies, that buy and sell stocks, that transfer money
between banks, manage customer accounts or simply print out bank
statements.
</P>
<P>
   All of that has to be ready by Monday morning, and none of the
actual conversion could begin until the close of business on New
Year's Eve. Though euro notes and coins will not enter circulation
until 2002, European banks and stock exchanges are required to
carry out transactions in euros as soon as markets open Monday. But
while almost every institution is bracing for technical glitches,
financial executives say they are cautiously optimistic about a
smooth start.
</P>
<P>
   Most big banks and investment companies began planning more than
a year ago and began writing new software and procedures months
ago. Many banks and brokerage firms have carried out elaborate
rehearsals in conjunction with companies that settle transactions.
In France, financial regulators organized a full-scale rehearsal
that involved most of the nation's top banks, brokerage firms and
exchanges at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's appropriate to have a healthy respect for the complexity
of it, but I'm not really worried about it,'' said Mitchell
Shivers, head of Merrill Lynch's global preparations for the euro.
``The financial industry has been well prepared for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Never before have so many separate financial institutions had to
coordinate so much change in such a short period. Instead of
pricing and trading stocks in 11 currencies, traders will suddenly
have to do so in just one. Brokers' computer systems will have to
calculate stock valuations, like price-earnings ratios, in euros
even if the company still reports its earnings in marks or lira.
</P>
<P>
   Even more daunting is the wide range of institutions involved,
most of which transfer vast amounts of money and data among one
another over electronic networks. The list includes banks, stock
exchanges, brokerage firms, clearing companies and big
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been so many different institutions that it will be
a big job just getting these different lanes to work together,''
said Victor Bruns, who is coordinating euro conversion at Deutsche
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The most intense preparations are under way in London. Even
though Britain has refused to join the euro for at least two more
years, London's financial district remains Europe's biggest
financial center _ particularly for companies that trade securities
and raise capital for clients across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels in London have been booked solid for the weekend, in part
because transit workers had threatened to strike on Jan. 3 and
companies feared they wouldn't be able to bring in workers from out
of town. The strike has been postponed, but the hotels are still
booked.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan has deployed about 800 technical and financial
workers for its conversion efforts. Like most other big
institutions, the company has carefully choreographed the entire
procedure based on its experience during several full-scale
rehearsals in the last several months. Ms. Kirchhoff is overseeing
the project from a central command room, which monitors progress on
thousands of separate steps that have been scheduled in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Similar plans are under way at Merrill Lynch, which has about
900 workers on duty during the weekend. Shivers estimated that his
company has to convert more than 200 systems around the world and
is measuring progress against the schedule of 5,000 separate
``milestones'' _ each of which has scores of steps.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the confidence about euro conversion is that
financial institutions have not sought to delay or stretch out the
process over a longer period of time. For all the complexity, the
banks have not protested the timetable set by government leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through the entire conversion in our rehearsals and
we've done it within the required time limits,'' said Ms. Kirchhoff
at J.P. Morgan. ``We knew what was happening. We knew what was
coming. It's definitely doable.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives have been preparing a long time for conversion.
Deutsche Bank began its planning more than a year ago and moved
into intensive preparations as soon as European leaders decided
last May which countries would take part in the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Bruns at Deutsche Bank estimates that the entire conversion will
cost his company several hundred million dollars. But most banks
would have spent considerable money anyhow on normal technological
upgrades. In addition, banks are combining efforts on euro
conversion with preparation for the so-called ``millennium bug,''
which may afflict many computers when the year 2000 arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives say European leaders helped as well by
smoothing out many procedural differences between countries. Until
those differences, like the ways for calculating interest, could be
reconciled, financial institutions had difficulty rewriting their
own procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our anxiety would have been a lot higher if we were doing this
six months ago, because at that point there were a lot of protocols
that had not yet been set,'' said Shivers of Merrill Lynch. But
most of those problems were ironed out in the last several months,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean things have been easy. Actual conversion
could not begin until after European leaders locked in their
exchange rates on New Year's Eve. Indeed, most institutions had to
wait until Friday because they had to close out their year-end
books before embarking on the euro project.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that many banks have tested their systems in
individual areas but not all at once. That is because they would
have had to build almost an entirely separate storage system just
to back up all their data.
</P>
<P>
   Banks have also had to deal with uncertainty among their
corporate customers, many of which have been unsure about when to
change their own accounts into euros. Under the laws governing the
phase-in of the euro, nonfinancial institutions can continue to use
local currencies until the year 2002. But as the euro's arrival has
drawn nearer, many companies have abruptly decided to convert
sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   As the euro weekend ended its first day Friday, industry
executives and regulators said conversion appeared to be going
smoothly. But no one knows what will happen on Monday, when all of
Europe's various financial players open for business under the new
set of rules.

   METHADONE-POLICY (New York) _ Methadone frees, but it also
imprisons. It is a wizard at blocking the yearning for heroin, but
much less so the simple craving to get high. It is highly addictive
in its own right, with fiendish withdrawal symptoms. At more than
moderate doses, it can leave some patients in a barely functional
daze. Methadone is one bridge to a new life, but there are many
other rivers to cross. All of which goes a long way toward
explaining why methadone has long been caught in the cross-currents
of social policy, though never more so than right now in New York.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Blue Room,'' ``Electra'' and ``Cabaret'' with
Alan Cumming, all imported to Broadway from London. ``Shakespeare
in Love,'' ``Elizabeth'' and ``Hilary and Jackie'' on our screens.
``Two Fat Ladies,'' ``Sister Wendy'' and ``Teletubbies'' attracting
cults to PBS. More British names on mastheads. English DJs at Twilo
and Limelight. The oh so post-modern Wallpaper magazine. Alexander
McQueen, the Verve, Ewan MacGregor and the well-tousled Tony Blair,
all giving off glamour rays from afar. In the buzz kingdom of
Manhattan, it's a felicitous time to be British.
</P>
<P>
   And with the ferocity of ... well, wasps, they are colonizing
downtown. They can be seen having breakfast at Les Deux Gamins on
Sheridan Square, spotted at dinner at Da Silvano on Avenue of the
Americas (around the corner from Anna Wintour's town house) or
Balthazar (owned by their countryman Keith McNally) and smelled
chain-smoking in the back room of Piadina on West Ninth Street.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all. On Thursdays, you'll find them at Don Hill's
bar on Spring Street, where British models like Karen Elson, Kate
Moss and Sophie Dahl, a granddaughter of Roald Dahl, congregate for
'80s revival nights. Other spots include Telephone Bar, Two Eyes,
N.V. and, every Saturday at 10 a.m., Nevada Smith's for soccer on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get all kinds for the games,'' said John Birchall, a
Liverpool-born hairstylist for Cindy Crawford and a Nevada Smith
regular. ``We've seen Vanessa Redgrave and Posh Spice. Sting was in
here once, too, but nobody cared because we were watching the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, when Sting's ``Englishman in New York'' was a hit 10
years ago, it was addressing an alienation that no longer exists
here for the English. These days, downtown is a Little London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans think we all know each other and hang around
together,'' said Vicky Ward, the features editor of The New York
Post, ``and what's shocking is, we sort of do. It's the herd
instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ward said that English people with the gumption to move to
New York, leaving it to their peers to settle down back home, are
downtown types by nature who get a kick out of the novelty of loft
living. Others say they like Greenwich Village because it resembles
London.
</P>
<P>
   Toby Young, a writer, is surrounded on West Fourth Street by
Oxford and Cambridge graduates. ``It's almost like being back at
university,'' said Young, whose father is an English lord, and who
asked for ``The Honorable'' on his credit card to impress American
women. ``In fact, my apartment is about the same size as my room at
Oxford. Well, anyway, it's just a place to sleep between parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Parties and more parties. It's almost like the American
expatriate scene in Paris in the '50s, minus the artistic
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the Brits who come here tend to be very ambitious,''
Ms. Ward said. ``But many of them know that eventually they'll be
going back to England, so that gives the whole adventure a certain
holiday atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, living in Little London isn't everyone's cup of
Yorkshire tea. ``I find most British men tedious,'' said Patti
Munter, a Jane Street resident, ``because they're all so sure
they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York, who
moved to the United States from London in the mid-1980s, also finds
the influx unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something so xenophobic about the English,'' he said.
``And there's something so silly about their smug enjoyment of
their horrible food and twee customs. I mean, when the English
colonized the world, they took their tea trays and other annoying
little things with them. Really, the idea of hanging around English
people who are eating English food here seems preposterous to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Everett, James Truman, Gabe Doppelt, Honor Fraser, Stella
Tennant, Joe McKenna, Hamish Bowles, Ms. Wintour, Ms. Moss and
James Murdoch, a son of Rupert, who just bought a town house on
Downing Street and may as well be British. In my neighborhood these
days, I can't run out for a box of tissues without running into
another boldface English person. They're all over the place, and
succeeding as lavishly as orchids in a hothouse.
</P>
<P>
   The British have always sent America their fashionable figures,
from Wilde and Dickens to the Beatles and Bowie, and the visits
have always bolstered their careers. These days, ever more Brits
seem to be coming to New York to get the royal treatment in a
meritocracy that likes to believe it doesn't give a hoot what one's
background is but is nonetheless cowed by accents that sound like
something out of ``Masterpiece Theater.''
</P>
<P>
   So I wondered: if I were to devote a day to being English, would
some of what they have rub off on me? Maybe I could overcome the
age-old inferiority complex Americans feel around the British.
Maybe I could pick up a witticism or two that would singe with
laserlike focus the next time I'm introduced to some supercool
English media pooh-bah who doesn't have the time of day for me.
Maybe, after a good long bath of Britishness, I would be able to
purge myself of feeling so terribly, unstylishly, sincerely
American.
</P>
<P>
   Thackeray, among others, called the English ``a nation of
shopkeepers,'' and so I decided to go shopping. I slipped into my
Katharine Hamnett shirt and a Burberry cashmere turtleneck, then
pedaled my old English bicycle (a black Dunelt _ very Cambridge
tutorial) up to Myers of Keswick on Hudson Street.
</P>
<P>
   Myers of Keswick (it's important that you don't pronounce the w
in Keswick) is a shop with a window photo of Keith Richards, who
sometimes calls in for kippers or steak-and-kidney pie. For an
American, it's a puzzling place. Sausage butty? Marmite? Clotted
cream? When a lovely woman in Birkenstocks, who turned out to be
Stella Tennant, walked in pushing a baby stroller, I seized the
opportunity to ask her how to breakfast like a Briton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to have marmalade on white toast,'' said Ms. Tennant,
who has a notable aristocratic family in England but lives instead
among the media aristocrats of Greenwich Village. ``And for later,
I recommend you try the Branston pickle.'' She had come in for
Cumberland sausages, Cadbury chocolate powder and other English
foods, which, I suggested, all seemed very high in cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all your American low-fat foods are a bit silly, really,
aren't they,'' Ms. Tennant said, ``because they're all just loaded
with sugar instead of fat.'' Having made me feel like a culinary
alarmist, she pointed her stroller toward the door. ``Well, then,''
she said with a warm smile. ``Have a nice day being English, and do
watch your diet if you must.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done. Because a few minutes later, Peter Myers,
who opened Myers of Keswick on July 4, 1985 (``I didn't have
anything better to do that day,'' he said), was feeding me one of
his homemade pork pies. I was still getting over the taste of the
vile Marmite on toast he had just served: Marmite is a yeast
extract that tastes like cheese-flavored shoe polish. While the
cold pork pie beat the Marmite, it wasn't exactly appealing,
either, with aspic congealed on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't like it?'' asked Myers, who has Sweeney Todd
eyebrows and a North Country accent. ``But I made it up so nice for
you.'' He isn't always so welcoming. In the English tradition, he
can be withering to the fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are just so stupid,'' he added. Naomi Campbell, he
said, used to drive up to his store in ``her chauffeur-driven
Jeep'' and charge through his aisles ``like a blinking dervish
while gollaring into a mobile phone to make sure that everyone in
the store knew who she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Just listening to his evisceration of her made me want to
improve my diction and sit up properly. But then, that's the effect
most English people have always had on me. They either tie my
tongue or make me howl like a dog in an attempt to impress, while
they watch with cool moonlike faces.
</P>
<P>
   When I told Myers that I was going to visit Niall Smith, the
antiques dealer, he gave me some Chipolata sausages to deliver.
Stuffed full of pork pie and a bit of bile, I got on my bicycle and
wobbled away.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a stout man whose disheveled blond hair hangs elegantly
in his face, quietly took the sausages from me without making a
fuss. His shop on Bleecker Street smelled of old furniture and was
silent except for one 150-year-old mantel clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``No antiques store should be without a ticking clock,'' said
Smith, who, like Oscar Wilde, is an Irishman who came of age in
London.
</P>
<P>
   If Myers is the stern English butcher, then Smith is the
eccentric dealer. Although he's well known for his Biedermeier
furniture, he declined to talk about the success of his business.
He preferred to describe being followed around in August by a
writer modeling a character on him for a Rupert Everett movie in
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly had a good time talking about that in England,''
said Smith, who uses the same rotary phone he had when he opened
his shop 30 years ago but seems not to find himself eccentric at
all. ``Quentin Crisp is a real eccentric,'' he said. ``He lives
without any money in a one-room flat in the East Village.'' Asked
what he thought about American eccentrics like RuPaul and Sandra
Bernhard, he pursed his lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not eccentric,'' he said. ``Eccentricity is a form of
rebellion. You cannot make a career out of it.'' It seemed a
typically English put-down of success. The thing is, and I didn't
want to argue this with Smith, New York is the place to make a
successful career out of anything that suits you.
</P>
<P>
   It's exactly why the foppish Hamish Bowles at Vogue, loopy
Victoria Bartlett at Interview, and other style-world somebodies
like Candy Pratts-Price, Plum and Lucy Sykes, Melanie Ward and
Doonan have such flashy careers here, too. They are eccentric,
irreverent ironists who are deeply skeptical of American sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   What, if anything, do the English here believe in? The
importance of not being earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to declare but my genius,'' Oscar Wilde said
when he arrived for a well-publicized tour of America in 1882 and
was greeted with unchecked enthusiasm. He had not yet written
anything of note. It mattered little. He was English, a confident
dandy dripping with solicitude. ``I know perfectly well why
Americans are so violent,'' he said at one stop. ``It's because
your wallpaper is so ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Could I be more ironic and eccentric, if not in spirit, then at
least in appearance?
</P>
<P>
   At the shop of Paul Smith, the quasi-mod English designer (Fifth
Avenue and 16th Street), I tried on a pink velvet blazer with
embroidered foliage. I resembled an overwrought cupcake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all in the way you wear it,'' said the salesman, Clive
Williams, a young Cockney. ``An English person would never make a
fuss about it. An American will tell people to look at his new
blazer and announce who made it. But to wear this blazer properly,
you have to be understated and not expect any compliments. You have
to be very, very cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Cool. That's a large part of being successfully English.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't spring for the blazer, but I did buy a pair of
baby-blue socks with birds painted on them. Williams (who said he
gets better drinks here because bartenders like to hear him talk)
told me it's very English to wear loud socks. Then I hopped on my
understated bicycle in my understated Burberry turtleneck and
pedaled understatedly into the dusk with my new loud socks in tow.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I got off at Tea and Sympathy, a cozy restaurant on Greenwich
Avenue that serves only English food. On Sundays, the line for
roast beef and Yorkshire pudding floods the sidewalk. ``It's a big
hangover crowd,'' Nicky Perry, the owner, told me. ``That's when
the boys miss Sunday dinner at their mums' at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's the case with Rupert Everett, who had just
clicked off his cell phone (the English call them ``mobiles'') and
was sitting alone, reading a magazine. I approached politely to ask
him about living in the Village, and he snubbed me so elegantly
that I felt chilled. ``I really don't want to get into this right
now _ it's just too intrusive,'' he said. ``I enjoy living here,
and this restaurant has all the comforts of home. Is that what you
want to know?''
</P>
<P>
   What hauteur! Surely, had I been British _ cooler, quippier,
waspier _ I would have been able to engage him, or at least fire
off an amusing retort. Instead, I quickly backed away, leaving him
to his Hello magazine and returning to my bangers and mash, which
is Cumberland sausage and mashed potatoes _ heart-attack food that
added to my anxiety with each bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just be an American and wish him well,'' Ms. Perry told me as
I quivered with humiliation. ``I love that about living here. Plus,
you have 24-hour everything, and you can step out onto the street
and yell for a taxi. We English love America because we see
everything you take for granted!''
</P>
<P>
   As I got up to leave Tea and Sympathy, Ms. Perry asked if I was
warm enough. ``Yes,'' I told her. ``My sweater is cashmere, and
it's Burberry. Isn't that so English?'' She shook her head. ``If
you want to be English,'' she said, ``don't be showing off what
you're wearing, mate!'' Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I changed into red tartan pants and a hip black
mackintosh, and I did not take for granted how easy it was to hail
a cab to go to Limelight, where it was ``Made in England'' night.
Inside, two DJs from England were playing Trance, the club music
that's been big in London for a while. The modest crowd on the
dance floor seemed not very English at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, this place was packed with English people,'' said
Jason Hobert, a London party promoter who is thinking about having
Teletubbies and Lulu nights at Limelight later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole vibe between the two countries,'' he said, ``is
working very well right now.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked how I could be more English myself, he looked me
over. ``I think you're doing very well,'' he said. ``With that
look, you could be a hipster in London, without a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of English person I need to run into more
often.
</P>
<P>
   Later, someone named Fat Tony, a visiting English DJ who was
tipsy but not fat, offered to buy me a drink at the bar. ``What can
I have that's English?'' I asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have a Scotch,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   Now I was the one acting haughty, and it felt, to use an
American word, empowering.
</P>
<P>
   My quest for all the Englishness I could find downtown in a day
ended there. It was midnight, after all, and I was feeling great,
not only about the English in New York, but about myself, too. So
what if I hadn't learned to intimidate anyone elegantly? I had been
told I looked like a hipster from London. That would do.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I have felt purged of my obsessions with the
English. I've also stopped reading Wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be yourself, no matter what they say,'' Sting sings in ``An
Englishman in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are lyrics to live by, even if they are by a Brit.

COMMENTARY: FORCED-FED FUN
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perpetual New Year's Eve anxiety is officially here.
</P>
<P>
   Though we've only just kissed off Dec. 31, 1998, this is one
weekend-after that will bring no relief. The annual societal
pressure that New Year's Eve be the bubbliest, happiest, most
spiritual and yet entertaining night of the whole year _ or else
your life is a sham unworthy even of the cheap champagne you're
getting sick on _ is already rising to a previously unimaginable
pitch for Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   By international mandate, our next New Year's Eve cannot be
anything less than the usual Nirvana _ times 1,000. Anyone who
fails to reach a state of pure millennial ecstasy is less likely to
cross the bridge to the 21st century than to throw himself from it.
</P>
<P>
   How did we get to this sorry pass? I still remember childhood,
when New Year's Eve was all innocent joy, no sweat. You stayed
safely at home, watching Johnny Carson past your bedtime, while all
the parents went out to drink and fight to the sounds of Guy
Lombardo.
</P>
<P>
   No one warned you then that once you reach adulthood, New Year's
Eve becomes a job. You must go to the right party, which is surely
not the party you're invited to, let alone giving. Failing that,
you must partake of the best meal or sex or stupor you've ever
known. You must have fun, conspicuous fun, in the same way that the
upwardly mobile pursue conspicuous consumption. Should you fail,
you will find yourself facing the void at 12:03 a.m., the
temperature will be zero, and there will be no cabs.
</P>
<P>
   What New Year's Eve activity could possibly offer enough fun to
usher in 2000? According to one poll, 75 percent of Americans want
to be traveling next New Year's Eve. Another survey says that 46
percent of the country wants to end up in Times Square. There's a
message in this for New Yorkers: Get out of town.
</P>
<P>
   But where? Every nationality is becoming as pushy and
competitive as we are about New Year's Eve: one tiny island nation
in the Pacific, Kiribati, went so far as to change its time zone so
its parties could upstage those of all its neighbors. With
countless entertainment-packed cruise ships planning to crisscross
the international date line at midnight, any passenger is bound to
have a collision _ if not with another ship or an iceberg, then
surely with a floor show starring Kathie Lee.
</P>
<P>
   For an airborne escape, the names of Harvard and Northwestern
are attached to a $44,950-per-person time-zone-leaping bacchanal by
private jet, stocked with prominent lecturers on the various Asian
cultures that will be providing servants at each luxury hotel along
the way. This is not a option for me without a scholarship, but
even were money no object, there's still the Y2K problem. No matter
how much the Federal Aviation Administration assures us that planes
won't fall out of the sky, are we really certain they won't in
Tonga or Western Samoa? When the computer clock turns '00, the
misrouted luggage and rental-car reservations alone may be enough
to break the spirit of all but the hardiest American families.
</P>
<P>
   Much less scary or costly is a slow boat to Basseterre, St.
Kitts, where, a brochure from my travel agent informs me, there's
``a gingerbread version of Big Ben to strike the hour.'' Somewhat
less glamorous, perhaps, is the special Millennial package offered
by the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Dearborn, Mich., which, at $450, no
doubt includes all the antifreeze you can drink. A monastic
antidote to excess is offered by the Four Seasons Hotel in London,
where one sought-after suite will resist all celebrations with
blacked-out windows, special soundproofing and the banishment of
clocks and calendars. But if you're in an isolated cell, why not
save a buck and go directly to Dearborn?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure the world will let us black out our windows in any
case. The mob demands we be festive, or else. Perhaps the only
escape is to stay home, pull up the covers and watch TV as we did
as children. But will there be anything to watch? Fox Broadcasting
chairman David Hill told Variety last week that the audience ``is
going to be out rocking and rolling that night,'' and that any
stay-at-homes ``would have to be hooked up to life-support
machines. We wouldn't want 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the dire alternatives, those of us who dread millennial
New Year's Eve are left with little choice but to root for
apocalypse now.

RUSSIA: IN AN ECONOMY OF SURVIVAL, OPTIMISM HAS A WAN SMILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Monday, Jan. 4) 
(bl) 
By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin left his sickbed to deliver a
surprisingly bullish year-end verdict on Russia's economy. ``Russia
is on the up,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, in fact, is probably the only optimist. From
international economists to the Kremlin's own specialists, the
prognosis is decidedly grim.
</P>
<P>
   The chief question is not whether Russia will turn the corner
this year. It is whether Russia will find some way to muddle
through despite a weakening economy or whether the situation will
tumble precipitously out of control.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just an economic matter. Given its vast store of
nuclear material and often poisonous politics, Russia's struggle to
establish a stable, pro-market system has powerful implications for
the West.
</P>
<P>
   The muddle-through school believes that Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and his unlikely coalition of Communists and social
democrats are far more realistic than their polemics would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   True, they have lauded the idea of state intervention in the
economy and mocked the specialists at the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But optimists say the government team will try to limit the
printing of new rubles, contain public spending and do just enough
market reform to pry a few billion dollars from the IMF and the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The movement toward a market economy will continue, they
maintain, but at a slow pace. And Russia will be spared yet another
debilitating government shake-up, like the ones last year that
resulted in the ouster of Sergei Kiriyenko as prime minister and
Anatoly Chubais, one of the nation's most prominent economic
reformers.
</P>
<P>
   The muddle-through theorists even have a name for this policy:
they call it the ``Russification of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The darker view foresees hyperinflation, a deepening recession
and mounting confusion among the top government ranks, as financial
problems overwhelm Primakov's untested and ideologically
incongruous team.
</P>
<P>
   No one can say for sure how Russia's economy will fare. That
will depend mightily on the government's ability to make unpopular
but necessary decisions about the economy and to make them stick.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the IMF, the U.S. Treasury, most specialists and
the news media to foresee Russia's current economic crisis should
chasten anyone bold enough to hazard a prediction.
</P>
<P>
   It is sobering, however, to see what a ``good year'' signifies
for Russia's policy makers. The nation's gross domestic product
fell almost 6 percent in 1998 and Russia will be fortunate if the
decline is no more than 4 percent or 5 percent this year. (The IMF
projects that economic output will shrink 8.3 percent, and some
critics fear the contraction could be as much as 15 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Inflation, the Russian government hopes, will hover at 30
percent in 1999. (The IMF is predicting 56 percent and other
critics say it could be more.)
</P>
<P>
   The government says the exchange rate this year will be about
21.5 rubles to the dollar, more or less the rate in late December.
Before the currency collapsed in August, the rate was about 6, and
few believe that the ruble will not be devalued further.
</P>
<P>
   With a little luck, and some food and other humanitarian aid
from the West, the nation will suffer only isolated pockets of
hunger. (That, experts say, is a fairly credible expectation,
assuming that the assistance reaches those that need it and is not
stolen.)
</P>
<P>
   The economic crisis gathered force when foreign and domestic
investors began to lose confidence in emerging markets because of
the economic turmoil in Asia. That was a huge problem for Russia,
because it had financed much of its debt through the sale of
government Treasury securities to foreign investors. Its troubles
were compounded by the plunging prices of oil and other natural
resources that Russia exports.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis hit average Russians hard. Many people lost their
savings when the banking system collapsed. After the government
stopped propping up the ruble in August, the price of imports
soared, no small concern considering that the goods most desired by
Russian consumers are made abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Since many Russians are owed months of back wages, the
devaluation of the nation's currency means that the wages they will
eventually receive will be worth only a fraction of what they
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Real incomes dropped 15.6 percent last year, according to
government statistics. The Kremlin's sanguine view is that real
income will continue to drop by 7.5 percent this year and then rise
in 2000, a presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   There has not been any sustained period of economic growth since
the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. And as the government tells it,
growth is always just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   There is no easy explanation for the Russians' ability to grin
and bear it. But the question is a vital one _ especially for those
who are worried where the economy is headed.
</P>
<P>
   Russians appear to have become accustomed to many of the
material benefits of a freer economy even as they have become
disillusioned with Russia's corrupt version of market reform.
Russia may not be moving boldly to carry out economic changes, but
at least it has not been moving backward.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have the nation's financial elite been dislodged by the
economic crisis. The so-called oligarchs who dominate the nation's
energy, banking, natural resources and media industries are mostly
still in place, though they are not quite as swaggering as they
used to be.
</P>
<P>
   The key factors to watch will be Yeltsin's faltering health,
which could open the door to early elections, and a change of
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Much will also depend on whether the Primakov team has the will
to tackle fiscal problems. Primakov has successfully pressed
Parliament to pass important legislation, encouraging foreign
investment in Russia's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   The list of unaccomplished changes, however, is long and
includes a new tax code, laws that would allow farmers to buy and
sell land and the overhaul of the battered banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the nation's fiscal house in order is also essential.
After defaulting on its domestic debt, the Kremlin can no longer
finance its deficit by selling Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
   Printing money is not the answer. The money supply was increased
20 percent after the August crisis, but the Primakov government
understands that it is flirting with hyperinflation if it covers
the deficit by running the printing presses at full steam.
</P>
<P>
   Assistance from the IMF and the World Bank would help. But the
fund has made it clear that it will not provide more aid until the
government demonstrates its ability to cut spending and collect
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The fund put it accurately, if somewhat inelegantly, in its
latest report on the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, it said, urgently needs a fiscal policy under which most
expenditures ``would be financed by tax revenue, without resort to
arrears, and whose financing would allow inflation to be reasonably
well contained, without price controls.''

   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan _ A striking new look has crept into this
capital of Soviet-era concrete blocks, where a half-dozen swank
hotels, office buildings and a theme park that people call ``Mini
Disneyland'' are open or under construction.
</P>
<P>
   The change is puzzling, because hotel rooms are not scarce here;
guests are. And the potential foreign tenants for prime new office
space, who initially flocked to the country, have been deserting
Uzbekistan's closed economy for two years.
</P>
<P>
   So if not demand, what is behind the flashy building boom? The
answer, diplomats say, is Islam Karimov, Uzbekistan's autocratic
president, whose nation for years has vexed foreign economists by
rejecting most market reforms but nonetheless sustaining jobs and
public services better than any other former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
   Today foreign economists are warning again that unless the
president radically changes course, a crisis is inevitable in this
Central Asian nation of 24 million people. But Karimov is defiant,
on the attack, and by all appearances as popular as ever with his
people. He dismissed subordinates accused of failing to fulfill his
wishes and criticizes foreign critics who refuse to concede that
his way is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karimov is the kind of man that every international economist
loves to hate,'' said Paul Bergne, a former British ambassador to
Uzbekistan who now teaches the history of the region at Oxford
University. ``It is fair to say that he has been making life hard
for himself, which is to say hard for anyone trying to make
investments in his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you ask Central Asians, Karimov is seen enviously. He
is seen locally differently from how he is seen in international
eyes. People say that Uzbekistan has fewer problems than anywhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union broke up seven years ago, the intertwined
economies of its 15 republics crashed with it. Obsolete factories
collapsed, and by 1997 the republics were turning out an average of
just 59 percent of their last Soviet-era production. Four of the
republics, including Russia, suffered civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Uzbekistan, which only reluctantly left the Soviet Union, is an
exception. It has kept a system of strict state control of the
economy and restrictions on conversion of profits to dollars,
allowing no real privatization of industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   But it has retained 85.8 percent of its 1991 production,
according to a study issued in May by the International Monetary
Fund, ``The Uzbek Growth Puzzle.'' The rate in Uzbekistan has even
outpaced the 80 percent in Estonia, considered the former Soviet
Union's economic star.
</P>
<P>
   Today, unlike many of its neighbors, Uzbekistan still pays
salaries mostly on time, maintains its roads, keeps its cities tidy
and delivers electricity and gas to homes.
</P>
<P>
   The state had also kept price controls on major commodities. At
an outdoor Tashkent cafe, 60 cents buys a large bowl of delicious
pilaf with raisins and beef, in addition to a plate of lamb shish
kebab smothered in onions and a warm slab of flat Uzbek bread.
</P>
<P>
   A result of all this is that, despite a climate of fear that
deters almost anyone foreign or local from speaking in other than
glowing terms about him for the record, Karimov seems genuinely
well-respected.
</P>
<P>
   People widely appear to agree with Karimov when he defends his
decision not to plunge into reforms. And they do not much question
the frequent, televised tirades in which, discussing the economy,
he accuses underlings of failing to carry out his programs.
</P>
<P>
   But many foreign economists and some local businessmen assert
that no matter how good things look, the future here is worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining Uzbekistan's successes, for example, the IMF study
said that the economy here did not crash as it did for former
Soviet neighbors that depended on industrial production because
Uzbekistan was mainly an agricultural and mining nation.
</P>
<P>
   While other republics struggled to find products to sell abroad
after the Soviet Union collapsed, the report said, Uzbekistan was
able to bank $2 billion a year from the world's second-largest
volume of cotton exports, and much more from Murantau, considered
the biggest gold mine on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   These advantages ``suggest that Uzbekistan's favorable output
performance did not occur because, but in spite of, its
macroeconomic and structural policies,'' the study concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a bad harvest has reduced Uzbekistan's 1998 cotton
export profits to $1 billion, and its gold earnings have plunged
with world gold prices. Cash and gold reserves _ a key indicator of
economic health _ have halved in the last two years, to $1 billion,
according to Western figures.
</P>
<P>
   Uzbekistan's relatively few private merchants have suffered as
the value of the national currency has fallen by two-thirds since
summer, after the Russian crisis, and strict state controls have
made it harder and harder to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, they said, `Do your business the way you
want and just pay taxes,' '' a local appliances trader said. ``Now
they say, `Do your business the way we say.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In Tashkent, the construction boom has helped buoy economic
appearances. In the countryside, though, the problems are more
easily visible.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Zanca, who teaches on the region at Northeastern
Illinois University, spent two months last summer in the central
sheep-raising town of Nurota, where he saw people under such
economic pressure that they were returning to old-time ways. The
main cooking fuel was sheep manure cakes called chalma, and donkeys
were ``an increasingly important means of transportation between
villages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have enough to eat,'' he said, but malnourishment is a
growing winter and spring phenomenon. Unemployment in many villages
runs from 60 percent to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western banker here summed up the concern. ``The Uzbek
model has been tried in Latin America in the '60s, India in the
'70s,'' he said. ``It doesn't work. Things are starting to come
apart.''

FOR LONGHORNS, THERE'S A MAJOR CHANGE IN THE LEADERSHIP ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Ricky Williams stopped by the Cotton Bowl to say
goodbye yesterday. He did it with proper Heisman-like fanfare,
gracing us with yet another 200-yard rushing day, one last peek at
his shy, unassuming smile, even striking an un-Ricky-like,
picture-perfect Heisman pose after his 37-yard, third-quarter
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Happy trails, Ricky. Don't forget to write. See you in Port
Charlotte this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing, though, as Williams, college football's all-time
leading rusher, rumbled toward the exit, an upcoming Hula Bowl stop
and a flirtation with major-league baseball in March before April's
NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky, for a change, wasn't the biggest story of the day as
Texas impressively ate Mississippi State's brunch, 38-11, in a game
that kicked off almost before the roosters crowed.
</P>
<P>
   Not by a long shot, despite what those who voted him the game's
offensive MVP would like you to believe.
</P>
<P>
   You see, as Williams was bidding us all a fond farewell, a
red-haired, freckle-faced Tom Sawyer straight out of ``Mayberry
RFD'' was quietly, firmly, convincingly, saying hello.
</P>
<P>
   Major Applewhite is the new future of Texas football.
</P>
<P>
   From Captain Dreadlocks to Howdy Doody, just like that.
</P>
<P>
   Snap your fingers here, to get the proper idea.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ricky's team when the Longhorns appeared through the fog
created by an overzealous smoke machine yesterday morning, but by
the time the game was over, it belonged, heart and soul, to the kid
freshman who didn't even begin the season as the starting
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think,'' Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis
concluded afterward, ``that we'll put a few more eggs in his basket
next year.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite? If he hadn't been wearing shoulder pads and his No.
11 burnt orange jersey, you'd have probably mistaken him for the
waterboy, not the leader of a major-college offense.
</P>
<P>
   This is the baby boy who was named after Alabama running back
Major Oglivie, but as his dad would say later, must have been born
to be a Longhorn because he already had the burnt orange hair; the
slightly chubby kid who spent his junior high years playing in the
offensive line; the eager high schooler who regularly asked his dad
to run pass routes when he had no other receivers available; the
determined quarterback who came home after high school dates and
retired to the garage to do jump-rope sets to 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players used to call him `Opie,''' Texas coach Mack Brown
said wryly after Applewhite, Williams and a stingy defense had led
the Longhorns to their eighth victory in their past nine games.
``Now they call him Major. I figure that's progress.''
</P>
<P>
   While Williams was gouging the Bulldogs for 208 yards and two
touchdowns on 30 carries, Applewhite calmly hit 15 of 26 passes for
225 yards and three touchdowns. I'm here to tell you that while
Applewhite's numbers may not be as impressive, they were much more
significant.
</P>
<P>
   Not to take anything away from Williams or the excellent job
that Texas' offensive line did in stopping Mississippi State's
all-out blitz, because one doesn't work without the other. But it
was Applewhite's touchdown strikes to wide receiver Wane McGarity _
first for 59 yards and then for 52 _ that sliced the Bulldogs'
jugular and sent Texas to the locker room with a 14-3 halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Applewhite's 18-yarder to Kwame Cavil that put the
game on ice at 38-3 with 14 seconds left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not give up the deep ball,'' lamented MSU coach
Jackie Sherrill. ``That's what hurt us.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Black-eyed peas and an embarrassing loss by Sherrill _ what a
way to start the year!)''
</P>
<P>
   ``Applewhite did a great job of getting the ball where it's
supposed to be. He throws the deep ball very well. He puts some air
under it and gives his receivers a chance to go get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was when the Longhorns went three-and-out on
their first possession that a worried Davis began to believe that
everything was going to be OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we really talked to our team about was to
not get frustrated when \Rthe MSU\S defense makes plays, because
they're going to make some,'' Davis said. ``First series, we're
three-and-out and Ricky gets hit in the mouth on the second play
and Major comes out, gets on the headset and says, `Coach, we're
fine. We'll get 'em next time.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of poise I knew we'd need.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of poise _ and the kind of quarterback _ that
Brown and Davis will build an offense around next season.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Dreadlocks is over and out.
</P>
<P>
   The Major has the ship now.

LOW OIL PRICES FORCING INDEPENDENTS TO HALT PRODUCTION

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GILLETTE, Wyo. _ Until late November, the shed next to one of
George Fancher's wells here in northwestern Wyoming was alive
around the clock with the chugging and hissing of pistons and
pumps. They filtered water coming out of his well and injected
clean water back in to keep the oil flowing.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, the only sound was the low whir of a heater _
kept on to assure that in the sub-zero chill, the equipment did not
freeze, crack and rupture.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three decades of running his own, independent
company, Fancher is taking part in the shutdown of vast swaths of
the nation's oil industry. The lowest oil prices, adjusted for
inflation, since before the 1973 oil crisis have forced him to idle
wells, lay off workers and cut off many contractors who depend on
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst I've ever seen,'' Fancher said in a voice
more gravelly than the road into here. ``I've never seen prices go
this low and stay this low for this length of time.''
</P>
<P>
   And Fancher is among the lucky: He's financially strong enough
that he considers his production halt only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Low prices and foreign competition, which favor the Exxons and
Mobils over the George Fanchers, are making the wildcatter an
endangered species. Enshrined in fable for his enterprise and
daring, the oilman in jeans and boots is giving way to the oilman
in a suit.
</P>
<P>
   Except for huge oilfields far offshore or in Alaska's wilds,
major oil companies consider most of the United States too
expensive or played out to bother with. As the oil giants shifted
production abroad, they left independents to drill five of every
six new wells, producing half the crude in the continental United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon's planned acquisition of Mobil has only compounded many
independents' sense of powerlessness. Exxon, the nation's largest
oil company, was already insulated against lower prices, with
higher earnings from refineries, chemical plants and gas stations
balancing lower earnings from production. Exxon and Mobil see their
deal as a way of cutting payrolls and costs even further.
</P>
<P>
   But independents, devoted entirely to oil or natural gas
production, are less able to ride out the cycles. They shut down
more than 48,000 of the nation's 573,000 wells in the first half of
1998, and prices kept on falling. Now, when oil producers gather in
Texas or Louisiana or Wyoming, they quietly speak of trying to form
their own OPEC in the hope of pinching production and raising
prices.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation already importing half its oil, and domestic
production falling, the independents see themselves as the bulwark
against even greater foreign domination.
</P>
<P>
   The exploration and production industry's payrolls fell to
314,000 in November, down about 25,000 from a year earlier. States
like Wyoming have been hardest hit, as tax revenues that pay for
schools, roads and health care dwindle. In other areas, from
Louisiana and Texas to California, the oil bust has slowed or
reversed the job growth enjoyed by the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   A robust national economy, however, has helped limit the damage.
In Louisiana, welders and pipefitters who lose oilfield jobs can
often find new ones in the shipyards. Texas, the nation's largest
oil producer, is so diversified that its current predicament is how
to spend a hefty budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Though Wyoming might not seem like the center of the oilpatch,
oil is its lifeblood, natural gas its air, coal its very food. Just
100 miles or so south of Gillette lies Teapot Dome, the oilfield
that in the 1920s became synonymous with Washington scandal.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas now has more jobs in high technology than in energy,
Wyoming has little besides buried reserves and rising fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody does like cheap gasoline prices, but Wyoming really
suffers,'' said John Kennedy, a leading independent here who is
shutting down his 125 or so wells one by one. As job losses mount
and tax revenues decline, he added, ``It's just a disaster looking
for a moment to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, a state commission with six legislators and five
citizens appointed by the governor recommended introducing
Wyoming's first personal income tax. ``If it's not going to be an
income tax, it's going to be some rather draconian cuts in the
services we have,'' said Shelby Gerking, a committee member who
teaches economics at the University of Wyoming in Laramie.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette itself, population about 17,000, is the capital of the
Powder River Basin, the nation's largest producer of coal.
Strip-mining is so mechanized, though, that oil remains a larger
local employer.
</P>
<P>
   The area, a rolling, windswept prairie of sagebrush and spiky
grasses, is not the Wyoming of Yellowstone and the Tetons.
``There's not a lot to do unless you're involved in the oil or
mining business,'' Fancher said. ``And sometimes not even then.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Much of Wyoming, like California, has the disadvantage of
producing crude that is heavy and sour, or high in sulfur. Higher
refinery costs mean lower prices at the wellhead. Prices of
lower-grade crudes have fallen even more than the higher grades
because of imports, with some American refineries switching from
domestic supplies to cheaper Mexican and Venezuelan ones.
</P>
<P>
   With oil trading recently at about $11 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, Fancher was getting $4 or less _ or $1 to $3
below his replacement cost.
</P>
<P>
   Shutting down a well is still a tough decision. It costs $2,000
or $3,000 initially and then up to $1,000 a month for maintenance
and inspections, which sometimes require snowmobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Fancher, rugged and jut-jawed at 59, is a petroleum engineer and
the son of a petroleum engineering professor. He still speaks of
his chosen career in almost religious terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a dream and a vision,'' he said, looking over more of
his wells where the stoic bobbing of his pumpjacks had been halted.
``I got to know some of those independents who were students of my
dad. I was inspired by the challenge and the rewards.''
</P>
<P>
   A dry hole can cost a wildcatter hundreds of thousands of
dollars, while in good times a strike can pay millions.
</P>
<P>
   Fancher has his office in Denver, where strong
telecommunications and cable industries are cushioning some
cutbacks in energy. Aboard the narrow 19-seat turboprop to Gillette
that Fancher calls ``the cigar,'' he began to describe how he had
as many as 16 employees in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're selling yourself short,'' said Fred Ronanjenko, an
oilfield mechanic in the next row back. ``I remember when you were
keeping 40 people working. You were keeping the trucking outfits
going. You were keeping the rig units going.''
</P>
<P>
   Having recently let about five employees go, at least
temporarily, Fancher expected to have only four or five left by
January. He drilled no new wells last year. The Energy Department's
national rig count fell to 734 in October from more than 1,000 at
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   James J. Hladky, president of Cyclone Drilling, says Fancher is
no different from his other customers. ``This is the first time in
the 23 years I've been in business where I haven't had a rig
running in the Powder Basin,'' he said at the Village Inn diner
here, where Fancher and others gather at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   With a sound balance sheet, nearly three decades of experience
and 30 wells that can produce about 1,500 barrels of oil _ more
than 60,000 gallons _ a day, Fancher was 23rd among the state's 700
or so producers in 1996. Though he is more vulnerable than some
independents with billions in annual revenues, he has always
considered himself more secure than the tens of thousands of
``strippers,'' or mom-and-pop oil companies with wells that produce
10 barrels a day or less.
</P>
<P>
   While the strippers have been closing down for years, today's
low prices have put much larger producers at risk. ``This truly is
an emergency,'' said George M. Yates, chairman of the Independent
Petroleum Association of America, whose own company, in Roswell,
N.M., has shut down about a quarter of its wells. ``At these prices
hardly anything in the lower 48 onshore is economical. There was a
Washington Post story on the hardships in Russia and Indonesia
because of low oil prices. Nobody seems to know we are the
second-largest producing country right here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department is studying whether to aid the
independents by purchasing more oil for the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve. But the independents' other perennial aid proposals, like
new import tariffs, usually run into the arguments that low energy
prices strengthen the economy and please every motorist.
</P>
<P>
   One solution, from when oil prices crashed in the 1930s, was to
send the Texas Rangers into West Texas to enforce a shutdown. Now,
Fancher said, only labor unions can get away with strikes. ``If we
suggest to someone else that we organize and shut things down, we
get threatened with government action,'' Fancher said. ``So we've
got to be careful how we say things.''
</P>
<P>
   Fancher was alluding to a West Texas oilman, John D. Bell, who
planned a 10-day production halt beginning Dec. 23. Then a lawyer
for the Independent Petroleum Association of America advised Bell
that, unlike the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, he
was subject to antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a producer from Kermit, Texas, makes 20 barrels a day and
violates antitrust measures, how in the world can Exxon and Mobil
merge?'' Bell recently said. ``That isn't an antitrust violation,
yet John Bell from Kermit, Texas, is? That's wild.''
</P>
<P>
   To publicize the small producers' plight, Bell is organizing a
Jan. 18 Starving Oil Workers March at the State Capitol in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Some large independents with plenty of cash, like the Apache
Corp. of Houston, say low prices and big mergers might present
buying opportunities. As Jay Beach, general manager of Key Energy
Services Rocky Mountain, explained at his office in Gillette: ``An
independent can get oil out of the ground so much more cheaply than
a major. For every meeting an independent has, they have to have 10
meetings and a policy decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas interests have helped some other large independents
remain healthy. But not companies like Pioneer Natural Resources,
based near Dallas, which borrowed heavily for a poorly timed
acquisition binge, and now has to sell off properties and lay off
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Fancher has had better times of his own, which have left a
chunky gold Rolex, its dial and case encrusted with diamonds, on
his wrist. While hardly deprived now, Fancher has kept his 1992
Lexus a few years longer than usual, and this winter there will be
no exploration of Hawaiian or Caribbean beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his family understood, he nodded. He has given his
children interests in his wells. ``They can see their checks go
down,'' he said. ``I don't have to tell them what the situation
is.''
</P>
<P>
   But whenever oilmen gather in Gillette these days, that
situation dominates the discussion to the end. ``Come up and see me
sometime,'' said Jim Rodgers, an oilfield service provider and
another partner in some Fancher properties, as he rose from
Fancher's breakfast table. ``Especially when you have some wells to
drill.''

YOUNG CHINESE WRITER FINDS SUCCESS WITH SOUL-BARING JOURNALISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Each day An Dun receives a dozen calls from people
desperate to spill their deepest secrets, vying to have their
private lives laid bare and dissected in her popular weekly
newspaper column. Some have become pregnant out of wedlock. Some
have been raped by their bosses. Some have been abandoned by their
husbands. Others have done the ditching themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In conservative Chinese society, such topics are generally taboo
even among close relatives and best friends, and they are certainly
not mainstream media fare. But since 1996, when Ms. An started
recording matter-of-factly the stories of real people caught in
such predicaments, she has wowed the younger generation with her
candor and helped to liberate a nation's skeletons from the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Her first book, ``Absolute Privacy,'' a sometimes moving,
sometimes sordid volume containing the stories of 20 women's love
lives, quickly sold a quarter million copies when it was published
last summer, and most have now passed through dozens of hands. In
student dorms, in airport lounges, on crowded subways, readers
engrossed in dog-eared copies of ``Absolute Privacy'' are
everywhere. Her second book, ``Going Home,'' came out last week,
and like her recent columns, shifts the focus to relationships
between parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work is popular because nobody has written about these
kinds of things before,'' said Ms. An, a lively straight-talking
29-year-old, dressed for work in a blue silk dress and pearls.
``Chinese people are very reluctant to talk about private matters.
I hope that at least I've raised these topics and made them public
now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a crusade that has made her a celebrity, engendered more
than a dozen copycat collections of ``real life'' tales, and
brought enough financial success that she now has a retreat in the
coastal city of Dalian, where she escapes to write.
</P>
<P>
   But her work has also come under fire from conservative Chinese,
who regard her tales of unwanted pregnancies, office love affairs
and runaway teens as ``spiritual pollution.'' And she often butts
heads with government censors at her newspaper, the progressive
Beijing Youth Daily. All newspapers in China are owned by a
Communist Party or government branch, in this case, the Communist
Youth League.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent column about a teen-ager who had hidden her
pregnancy from her mother, editors at her newspaper censored almost
a quarter of the text, 300 words. ``The pressure is pretty scary,''
Ms. An said. ``Some senior comrades think it's immoral and
destabilizing to write about the ugly side of life, that it will
give children bad ideas. They want us to hide everything ugly and
tell a fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think we have to tell children that there is Adam and
there are snakes, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. An said she wrote her books in part to have greater freedom
to tell her subjects' stories, with all their pathos and unseemly
details. Books require less formal approval than newspapers before
publication.
</P>
<P>
   In her books and in her column, Ms. An tells of chaotic lives
without judgment or advice. Each story is based on extensive
interviews; names and places are changed.
</P>
<P>
   In one, a young college graduate from a simple rural town gets a
coveted government job in Beijing only to be forced to have sex
with her boss, an older married man. After a year, she quits and
finds a job in a foreign-owned company, but remains depressed and
fearful that no man will ever love her defiled body. Ms. An meets
her at a drugstore where she is buying a hymen-repairing kit.
</P>
<P>
   In another, a married journalist has a liaison with a married
mid-level bureaucrat and leaves her husband after she becomes
pregnant by her lover. But the bureaucrat fears the scandal will
hurt his chances of promotion and decides not to leave his
marriage. She aborts the baby and leaves Beijing, heartbroken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to understand more about marriage and family and
people's emotional lives,'' Ms. An said. ``As the economy has
opened, people have become more individualistic. In the past,
people put their feelings last; now they have started to pay more
attention to their feelings and the quality of their relationships,
which is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. An's books and columns are part sociology and part soap
opera, and have been particularly popular among young urban women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everyone I know has read it,'' said Yu Xiao, 31, a
teacher in a black jacket trimmed with fake leopard fur, as she
browsed at Beijing Book City, Beijing's new mega-bookstore. ``We
used to be so closed off about people's private lives but now that
we're more open, people are very interested and are really thinking
about this for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. An, a self-made go-getter who is in many ways an archetypal
new Chinese professional woman, felt compelled to take on her
countrymen's taboos after her own personal life ran afoul of
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   At 24, she fell in love with a married businessman 10 years her
senior, who was separated from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents hated the idea,'' Ms. An said. ``He was older. He
was divorced. He had a son. People just assumed there must be
something wrong with me, like that I was infertile.''
</P>
<P>
   After her parents relented, the two got married, and Ms. An quit
her job as an accountant for a time. But she quickly tired of
hanging around with other nonworking wives of successful
businessmen. Most were well-educated young women and seemed to have
everything, and yet many were miserable. After a year she borrowed
money from her mother to buy new work clothes and to pay car fare
to job interviews, and set about becoming a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Her rarefied year among the ladies who lunch led to her first
newspaper story, ``Canary in a Cage,'' which she sold to Beijing
Youth Daily for a onetime column in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The editors thought we couldn't run more than one like this,''
Ms. An said. ``They were worried my article would teach young
people about bad options. They didn't want to highlight that there
were people leading this kind of life and not contributing to
society.''
</P>
<P>
   But readers loved this kind of story, and at a time when
government subsidies to newspapers were drying up, it drew in
advertisers as well. Ms. An's column became a weekly feature in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where therapists are still a rarity, it is easy to
see why people bare their souls to her, an intent listener with an
open mind and an easy smile. She could be a psychiatrist, though
she prefers to think of her work as anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think Chinese people have become somewhat more
tolerant,'' she said, noting that in the past, people who had been
unfaithful to their spouses were branded as hooligans and
ostracized. But, she added, ``change is very slow, which is why
people talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Almost everyone in the West can find someone to
talk to about their inner feelings, but not here. The people who
talk to me have friends and relatives but they dare not speak to
them about this. This way they can stand in the shadows and see
what others think.''

POLICE OFFICER HELD IN DUI FATALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACK HOPKINS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Two suspected drunk drivers _ one of them an off-duty
police officer from the suburb of Bellevue _ collided Friday in a
grinding, high-speed crash that left one passenger dead and three
others injured.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington State Patrol officer who was riding with the
Bellevue cop when the collision occurred is in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal accident happened at 3:15 a.m., just hours after tough
new drunk driving laws took effect in Washington _ laws for which
the policeman involved in the crash had recently taken training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done a good job of setting an example,'' said an
obviously saddened Bellevue police spokesman Mike Johnson as
investigators checked the crumpled remains of the off-duty
officer's Dodge Strata.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no mystery to any law enforcement officer in the state
about the new laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The new laws lower the blood-alcohol level required for proof of
intoxication from 0.10 to 0.08 percent and provide tougher
penalties for those convicted of drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   Police involvement in the fatal accident stunned area residents
who have fought drunken driving for years and counted law
enforcement officers among their staunchest allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly is dereliction of duty by law enforcement
officers and itsends out the wrong message,'' said state Sen. Adam
Kline, D-Seattle, who helped push through tougher laws against
drunken driving and formerly served as president of the local
chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it demonstrates a point MADD has been trying to make for
years: That driving under the influence is not an offense committed
by a small number of career criminals... Even a generally alert,
conscientious person can fall into that and we need ongoing
vigilance on everybody's part.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue police declined to release the name of the officer
involved in the crash, but said he was arrested on suspicion of
vehicular homicide. The 29-year-old policeman suffered a bruised
heart in the crash and was reported in satisfactory condition
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the officer has been a patrolman for about two or
three years and said he is unaware of any previous problems
involving the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a nice guy who is well liked by his peers,'' he said.
``He did a nice job for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue police also declined to identify the state trooper
riding in the front passenger seat with the policeman at the time
of the crash. They said only that he was 26 years old and had been
a trooper for about 2 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   The state patrolman suffered head and chest and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner's office identified the dead man as Brian
Heath Grooms, 26, of Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue police said Grooms, a salesman, was a friend of the
state trooper and was in the Seattle area on vacation. He was
riding in the back seat of the Dodge Strata when the crash
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellevue police officer driving the Strata had been drinking
and was traveling southbound at ``a high rate of speed'' when he
lost control of the vehicle, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The policeman's car went spinning across the center line and
collided with a northbound Ford Expedition driven by a 45-year-old
Bellevue man, who was identified only as a Navy officer.
</P>
<P>
   There were two passengers in the Expedition _ the officer's
53-year-old wife and a 78-year-old man in the back seat. The Naval
officer and the elderly man, believed to be the father or
father-in-law of the Navy man, were not injured. The woman was
reported in satisfactory condition and hospitalized with neck and
leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alcohol appears to be a contributing factor to the accident,''
said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Blood-alcohol tests were given to both drivers, but police
declined to release the results. He said, however, that both
drivers are believed to have been drunk at the time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he didn't know if open containers of alcoholic
beverages were found in either car.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy man was cited for driving under the influence and
released. The off-duty Bellevue policeman was arrested on suspicion
of vehicular homicide, a more serious offense that almost always
carries a prison term upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they did not know where the off-duty cop, the
trooper and the other man had been in the hours before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Police were called to the scene by a nearby resident who was
awakened by the sound of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I heard a crashing sound and then a horn that was
stuck on `on,' '' Jeff Johnson said. ``We immediately knew that
something was very wrong outside the house and called 911.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he quickly dressed and hurried to the crash site
where he spotted about six people clustered around the Strata,
trying to help the victims of the collision.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed amazement that an officer was involved in an
alcohol-related crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is amazing and sad,'' he said. ``For someone that much in
the know, someone who has seen the results of accidents... If
anybody should know better, it would be officers of the law,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, meanwhile, say it could take quite some time before
police wrap up their investigation and prosecutors make a charging
decision in the case.

EURO EXPECTED TO LIFT EUROPEAN STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related EURO) 
(rl) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Euroka! That's the view of many investors looking forward to the
debut in major financial markets on Monday of the euro, the single
currency that now binds 11 European countries and promises to
create a more unified economy in much of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, which has emerged in the past couple of years from a
long slump, should become an increasingly popular place to buy
stocks and bonds, experts say. ``The introduction of the euro will
raise the profile of the region,'' said Erik Granade, an
international portfolio manager for Invesco Capital Management in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   As obstacles to trade and investment across borders have been
broken down under the European Union's campaign to build a single
market roughly the size of the American economy, European companies
have been scrambling to become more competitive. That has led to a
whirl of merger activity, like the recent combination of Britain's
Zeneca Group with Sweden's Astra, and a wave of restructurings.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, over the last year, the stock prices of many large
European companies have risen. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50, which
is made up of 50 large European companies, gained 26 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   But many investment managers believe that the planned changes
from adopting a single monetary policy for much of Europe will
offer opportunities to profit for years to come. They believe
Europe could see a period of prosperity not dissimilar to what
occurred in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s from U.S.
corporations' efforts to downsize and restructure themselves.
``This can have very, very long legs,'' said George Murnaghan, an
executive vice president for Rowe Price Fleming International in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam Investments, the Boston mutual fund group, is also
bullish on the prospects for European companies. While the return
on capital achieved by U.S. companies has drastically improved
since the 1970s, the returns of companies in France, Italy and
Germany have actually declined. ``There is a tremendous gap that
has opened up there,'' said Jonathan Francis, the head of global
strategy for Putnam.
</P>
<P>
   Most portfolio managers say the introduction of the euro will
force investors to take a broader approach when selecting stocks.
``There is going to be dramatic change in how they view things and
how they operate,'' said Michael Gerding, an international
portfolio manager for Founders Asset Management in Denver. While
many managers, both in the United States and in Europe, often
bought the shares of leading companies in different countries
simply to lessen risk and enhance diversity, they will increasingly
focus on choosing stocks in attractive industries and picking the
best companies in all of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Take ENI SpA, a big Italian oil and gas company with broad
interests elsewhere, which may have been overshadowed by British
Petroleum and Royal Dutch/Shell. It could become a more popular
holding for investors as the oil industry recovers and ENI, which
is already included in major European baskets of stocks, becomes
better known around the globe. ``You are going to have so much
focus on the big names,'' Gerding said.
</P>
<P>
   Many portfolio managers say the companies that are poised to
benefit most from this new emphasis on specific sectors and
industries are also the ones that should prosper in a more
pan-European environment: the large, multinational companies that
most resemble the blue chips in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If scale is increasingly important and the ability to operate
in many different nations is important, I think it does favor large
companies over small companies,'' said Murnaghan of Rowe Price
Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   But those companies are not necessarily located in the countries
joining forces. Murnaghan points to Nestle SA, the giant Swiss food
company. The company's executives ``have positioned themselves very
well to compete,'' he said. (Switzerland, which has rejected
membership in the 15-nation European Union, will maintain its own
Swiss franc and has no plans to join the 11-nation euro bloc in the
foreseeable future.)
</P>
<P>
   And smaller companies, which are successfully exploiting a
niche, will also prosper. Gerding, for example, points to TelePizza
SA, a Spanish fast-food company that has managed to fend off many
competitors. But he would avoid also-rans: companies that are the
fourth or fifth largest player in their market.
</P>
<P>
   Francis of Putnam Investments warned that investors would be
making a mistake to blur the distinctions among the countries
taking part in the euro, especially when buying government bonds.
Investors may currently be giving too much credit _ literally _ to
Italy by failing to significantly differentiate in price its bonds
from those of Germany or France.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of the euro is also expected to fuel the growth of
the corporate bond market in Europe, according to N. Graham Allen,
the chief fixed-income officer for Wells Capital Management in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some portfolio managers are approaching the enthusiasm
over a unified Europe with caution. The euro countries may have
their fair share of infighting as they struggle to operate under a
common monetary policy that will no longer take account of
differences in economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't give it great odds of being as effective as everyone
thinks,'' said James Paulsen, chief investment officer for Norwest
Investment Management in Minneapolis. But even more important, in
Paulsen's view, is that any evolution of a truly united Europe is
bound to take time. ``It doesn't happen in a flash,'' he said. ``It
happens generationally.''

GROUP SEES MIXED TREND IN GIVING AMONG PROTESTANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (lb) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the recessionary years of the early 1990s, some major
Protestant denominations faced budget shortfalls and were forced to
downsize, cutting back staff at the national levels.
</P>
<P>
   Such developments reinforced a concern among some church
officials about those denominations' financial futures.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, one organization that studies patterns of
giving among Protestants has reported positive news _ although with
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   An annual survey of giving by members of 29 Protestant
denominations has found that what people are putting into the
collection plate, when measured as a percentage of Americans' per
capita income, has grown slightly for three consecutive years after
falling for most of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, by Empty Tomb Inc., a nonprofit organization
dedicated to ``Christian service and research,'' reports that
members of those denominations increased their giving to about 2.6
percent of their disposable income in 1996, the last year for which
statistics are available, from about 2.5 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cautiously optimistic,'' said Sylvia Ronsvalle,
executive vice president of the organization, which is based in
Champaign, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Ronsvalle said she was concerned that the giving
picture had a downside in that the proportion of members' money
earmarked for purposes outside the local church (that is, money for
seminaries, missionary work, hunger-relief programs and other
causes), had continued to decline, even as overall giving had
risen.
</P>
<P>
   The denominations included in the survey range from mainline
Protestant bodies like the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the
United Church of Christ to more conservative, evangelical
denominations, like the Church of the Nazarene and the Southern
Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   On average, members of the denominations gave $538 each in 1996,
out of a per capita income of $20,840, as measured by the Bureau of
Economic Analysis, a branch of the Commerce Department. Of the
total given, $453 went to the local congregation to pay for budget
items ranging from clergy salaries to the cost of utilities and to
such in-house charitable activities as soup kitchens and food
pantries.
</P>
<P>
   Through denominational financial statistics, Empty Tomb has kept
track of giving by Protestants since 1968 and has seen a fairly
steady decline since then, measured against per capita income. In
its surveys, the organization has reported that church members gave
slightly more than 3.1 percent of their disposable income in 1968.
That fell to slightly less than 2.5 percent in 1992 and 1993, the
organization reported.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ronsvalle, whose husband, John, is president of the
organization, said she was particularly concerned with the gradual
decline in the proportion of giving to ``benevolences,'' causes
beyond the local congregation. By Empty Tomb's calculations, church
members gave about 0.7 percent of their per capita income to such
causes in 1968, but that has fallen to 0.4 percent in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the church were helping church members integrate their
faith, you would expect to see different patterns in the way they
spend money,'' Mrs. Ronsvalle said.

LOW OIL PRICES FORCING INDEPENDENTS TO HALT PRODUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wyo., Texas, La., Calif.) (EDS: See also OIL-ROUGHNECK.)

 By ALLEN R. MYERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GILLETTE, Wyo. _ Until late November, the shed next to one of
George Fancher's wells here in northwestern Wyoming was alive
around the clock with the chugging and hissing of pistons and
pumps. They filtered water coming out of his well and injected
clean water back in to keep the oil flowing.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, the only sound was the low whir of a heater _
kept on to assure that in the sub-zero chill, the equipment did not
freeze, crack and rupture.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three decades of running his own, independent
company, Fancher is taking part in the shutdown of vast swaths of
the nation's oil industry. The lowest oil prices, adjusted for
inflation, since before the 1973 oil crisis have forced him to idle
wells, lay off workers and cut off many contractors who depend on
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst I've ever seen,'' Fancher said in a voice
more gravelly than the road into here. ``I've never seen prices go
this low and stay this low for this length of time.''
</P>
<P>
   And Fancher is among the lucky: He's financially strong enough
that he considers his production halt only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Low prices and foreign competition, which favor the Exxons and
Mobils over the George Fanchers, are making the wildcatter an
endangered species. Enshrined in fable for his enterprise and
daring, the oilman in jeans and boots is giving way to the oilman
in a suit.
</P>
<P>
   Except for huge oilfields far offshore or in Alaska's wilds,
major oil companies consider most of the United States too
expensive or played out to bother with. As the oil giants shifted
production abroad, they left independents to drill five of every
six new wells, producing half the crude in the continental United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon's planned acquisition of Mobil has only compounded many
independents' sense of powerlessness. Exxon, the nation's largest
oil company, was already insulated against lower prices, with
higher earnings from refineries, chemical plants and gas stations
balancing lower earnings from production. Exxon and Mobil see their
deal as a way of cutting payrolls and costs even further.
</P>
<P>
   But independents, devoted entirely to oil or natural gas
production, are less able to ride out the cycles. They shut down
more than 48,000 of the nation's 573,000 wells in the first half of
1998, and prices kept on falling. Now, when oil producers gather in
Texas or Louisiana or Wyoming, they quietly speak of trying to form
their own OPEC in the hope of pinching production and raising
prices.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation already importing half its oil, and domestic
production falling, the independents see themselves as the bulwark
against even greater foreign domination.
</P>
<P>
   The exploration and production industry's payrolls fell to
314,000 in November, down about 25,000 from a year earlier. States
like Wyoming have been hardest hit, as tax revenues that pay for
schools, roads and health care dwindle. In other areas, from
Louisiana and Texas to California, the oil bust has slowed or
reversed the job growth enjoyed by the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   A robust national economy, however, has helped limit the damage.
In Louisiana, welders and pipefitters who lose oilfield jobs can
often find new ones in the shipyards. Texas, the nation's largest
oil producer, is so diversified that its current predicament is how
to spend a hefty budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Though Wyoming might not seem like the center of the oilpatch,
oil is its lifeblood, natural gas its air, coal its very food. Just
100 miles or so south of Gillette lies Teapot Dome, the oilfield
that in the 1920s became synonymous with Washington scandal.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas now has more jobs in high technology than in energy,
Wyoming has little besides buried reserves and rising fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody does like cheap gasoline prices, but Wyoming really
suffers,'' said John Kennedy, a leading independent here who is
shutting down his 125 or so wells one by one. As job losses mount
and tax revenues decline, he added, ``It's just a disaster looking
for a moment to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, a state commission with six legislators and five
citizens appointed by the governor recommended introducing
Wyoming's first personal income tax. ``If it's not going to be an
income tax, it's going to be some rather draconian cuts in the
services we have,'' said Shelby Gerking, a committee member who
teaches economics at the University of Wyoming in Laramie.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette itself, population about 17,000, is the capital of the
Powder River Basin, the nation's largest producer of coal.
Strip-mining is so mechanized, though, that oil remains a larger
local employer.
</P>
<P>
   The area, a rolling, windswept prairie of sagebrush and spiky
grasses, is not the Wyoming of Yellowstone and the Tetons.
``There's not a lot to do unless you're involved in the oil or
mining business,'' Fancher said. ``And sometimes not even then.''

UCLA STUDYING FOR ARIZONA TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The talent and lofty rankings remain, as does the
large, silver-haired chap pacing the visitor's bench. But in every
other respect, tonight's Pac-10 opener at Pauley Pavilion lacks the
ingredients that made Arizona-UCLA one of the nation's best
rivalries for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a matchup of traditional powers and top-10
teams,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said. ``It's less of a love-hate
type rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 6 Wildcats and No. 10 Bruins have won or shared the
Pac-10 title every year since 1986, and for each of those seasons
there was an antagonist, someone who stirred the passion drink.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona despised Trevor Wilson and Don MacLean just as the
Bruins scowled at the sight of Brian Williams. More recently, Santa
Ana natives Reggie Geary and Miles Simon turned up Arizona's
intensity for showdowns with high school rivals Toby Bailey and
Kris Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there are no personality clashes. Arizona (8-0) has
two L.A. area natives _ Bell-Jeff grad Ruben Douglas and Long
Beach's Rick Anderson _ but they are freshmen with no sworn enemies
on the UCLA roster, itself loaded with out-of-area players.
</P>
<P>
   It remains a rivalry, of course, but without the backyard-brawl
feel of previous encounters. So the Bruins (8-2) are trying to
create it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition has been passed on from guys like Toby,'' UCLA
sophomore Rico Hines said. ``They told us Arizona is our real
rival. Everybody thinks it's USC, but it's really Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have to inform our younger guys slowly but surely that
this is a big-time game.''
</P>
<P>
   For confidence and momentum, yes. For Pac-10 title and NCAA
Tournament seedings, probably not. The teams are similar in many
ways, most notably the inexperience that permeates both rosters and
the uncertainty of their postseason assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats have an advantage with two senior starters, point
guard Jason Terry and center A.J. Bramlett, but otherwise they
depend on unproven talent like Douglas, power forward Michael
Wright and wing man Richard Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   For the past month both teams have dined on subpar competition _
UCLA smashing the likes of Delaware State, Cal State Northridge,
American and Loyola Marymount; Arizona hammering Holy Cross,
Wyoming, Iowa State and UC Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   For both, tonight's game will be a major advance in intensity
and competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Similar to Maryland and Kentucky, this will be a test to find
out where we are and find our deficiencies,'' Lavin said. ``And
because it's such a competitive league, we have to protect our
homecourt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have assumed a contrarian view in recent days.
Because both teams are young, they say, because both teams are
unproven and trying to carve a path to title contention, tonight's
game is the most important on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we lost the first game of the Pac-10 season at
Arizona, and it set the tone,'' UCLA junior forward Sean Farnham
said. ``We have to set the tone here, let everyone know we're ready
to contend. It's a momentum game for both teams. Nobody has proven
anything, that's why it's so important.''

 GILLETTE, Wyo.: even then.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much of Wyoming, like California, has the disadvantage of
producing crude that is heavy and sour, or high in sulfur. Higher
refinery costs mean lower prices at the wellhead. Prices of
lower-grade crudes have fallen even more than the higher grades
because of imports, with some American refineries switching from
domestic supplies to cheaper Mexican and Venezuelan ones.
</P>
<P>
   With oil trading recently at about $11 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, Fancher was getting $4 or less _ or $1 to $3
below his replacement cost.
</P>
<P>
   Shutting down a well is still a tough decision. It costs $2,000
or $3,000 initially and then up to $1,000 a month for maintenance
and inspections, which sometimes require snowmobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Fancher, rugged and jut-jawed at 59, is a petroleum engineer and
the son of a petroleum engineering professor. He still speaks of
his chosen career in almost religious terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a dream and a vision,'' he said, looking over more of
his wells where the stoic bobbing of his pumpjacks had been halted.
``I got to know some of those independents who were students of my
dad. I was inspired by the challenge and the rewards.''
</P>
<P>
   A dry hole can cost a wildcatter hundreds of thousands of
dollars, while in good times a strike can pay millions.
</P>
<P>
   Fancher has his office in Denver, where strong
telecommunications and cable industries are cushioning some
cutbacks in energy. Aboard the narrow 19-seat turboprop to Gillette
that Fancher calls ``the cigar,'' he began to describe how he had
as many as 16 employees in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're selling yourself short,'' said Fred Ronanjenko, an
oilfield mechanic in the next row back. ``I remember when you were
keeping 40 people working. You were keeping the trucking outfits
going. You were keeping the rig units going.''
</P>
<P>
   Having recently let about five employees go, at least
temporarily, Fancher expected to have only four or five left by
January. He drilled no new wells last year. The Energy Department's
national rig count fell to 734 in October from more than 1,000 at
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   James J. Hladky, president of Cyclone Drilling, says Fancher is
no different from his other customers. ``This is the first time in
the 23 years I've been in business where I haven't had a rig
running in the Powder Basin,'' he said at the Village Inn diner
here, where Fancher and others gather at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   With a sound balance sheet, nearly three decades of experience
and 30 wells that can produce about 1,500 barrels of oil _ more
than 60,000 gallons _ a day, Fancher was 23rd among the state's 700
or so producers in 1996. Though he is more vulnerable than some
independents with billions in annual revenues, he has always
considered himself more secure than the tens of thousands of
``strippers,'' or mom-and-pop oil companies with wells that produce
10 barrels a day or less.
</P>
<P>
   While the strippers have been closing down for years, today's
low prices have put much larger producers at risk. ``This truly is
an emergency,'' said George M. Yates, chairman of the Independent
Petroleum Association of America, whose own company, in Roswell,
N.M., has shut down about a quarter of its wells. ``At these prices
hardly anything in the lower 48 onshore is economical. There was a
Washington Post story on the hardships in Russia and Indonesia
because of low oil prices. Nobody seems to know we are the
second-largest producing country right here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department is studying whether to aid the
independents by purchasing more oil for the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve. But the independents' other perennial aid proposals, like
new import tariffs, usually run into the arguments that low energy
prices strengthen the economy and please every motorist.
</P>
<P>
   One solution, from when oil prices crashed in the 1930s, was to
send the Texas Rangers into West Texas to enforce a shutdown. Now,
Fancher said, only labor unions can get away with strikes. ``If we
suggest to someone else that we organize and shut things down, we
get threatened with government action,'' Fancher said. ``So we've
got to be careful how we say things.''
</P>
<P>
   Fancher was alluding to a West Texas oilman, John D. Bell, who
planned a 10-day production halt beginning Dec. 23. Then a lawyer
for the Independent Petroleum Association of America advised Bell
that, unlike the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, he
was subject to antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a producer from Kermit, Texas, makes 20 barrels a day and
violates antitrust measures, how in the world can Exxon and Mobil
merge?'' Bell recently said. ``That isn't an antitrust violation,
yet John Bell from Kermit, Texas, is? That's wild.''
</P>
<P>
   To publicize the small producers' plight, Bell is organizing a
Jan. 18 Starving Oil Workers March at the State Capitol in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Some large independents with plenty of cash, like the Apache
Corp. of Houston, say low prices and big mergers might present
buying opportunities. As Jay Beach, general manager of Key Energy
Services Rocky Mountain, explained at his office in Gillette: ``An
independent can get oil out of the ground so much more cheaply than
a major. For every meeting an independent has, they have to have 10
meetings and a policy decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas interests have helped some other large independents
remain healthy. But not companies like Pioneer Natural Resources,
based near Dallas, which borrowed heavily for a poorly timed
acquisition binge, and now has to sell off properties and lay off
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Fancher has had better times of his own, which have left a
chunky gold Rolex, its dial and case encrusted with diamonds, on
his wrist. While hardly deprived now, Fancher has kept his 1992
Lexus a few years longer than usual, and this winter there will be
no exploration of Hawaiian or Caribbean beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his family understood, he nodded. He has given his
children interests in his wells. ``They can see their checks go
down,'' he said. ``I don't have to tell them what the situation
is.''
</P>
<P>
   But whenever oilmen gather in Gillette these days, that
situation dominates the discussion to the end. ``Come up and see me
sometime,'' said Jim Rodgers, an oilfield service provider and
another partner in some Fancher properties, as he rose from
Fancher's breakfast table. ``Especially when you have some wells to
drill.''

MAMA, DON'T LET YOUR SONS GROW UP TO BE ROUGHNECKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wyo., Mont.) (EDS: With OIL-U.S.) 
(nk) 
 By ALLEN R. MYERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GILLETTE, Wyo. _ As Tim Gimbel sees it from the double-wide
trailer near here where he now spends his days, even working a
drilling rig when it's 25 below beats a layoff. He won't have the
money to build a garage this summer, so his wife, Laura, has at
least two more winters of creeping an icy hundred yards uphill
every morning to fetch her car from a shed as she leaves for her
job as a secretary.
</P>
<P>
   She often asks how soon her husband expects to be called back,
or why he wants to remain a driller in the first place, and whether
there aren't more dependable ways to make a living. ``She's done
everything but put her boots on and kick me out the door,'' Gimbel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, he joined 600 others, out of 1,000, whom Caza
Drilling, based in Denver, has sent to the unemployment offices
over the last year. As oil prices sank, Caza, whose clients include
George Fancher, went from running 30 rigs to 10 or 12.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Schledwitz, Caza's operations manager, has seen the toll.
It's not just the 21 of his own field people it takes to keep a rig
running, he says, but also his office staff and 20 or so more at
his suppliers and service companies. Oil deposits _ and, thus, the
jobs _ in such a volatile business tend, perversely, to be in
places where other options are few. ``In Wyoming or Montana,
farming and mining are about the only other industries,''
Schledwitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone could see the romance of a grimy, dangerous job
requiring seven straight days of 12-hour shifts, as likely to be 7
p.m. to 7 a.m. as the reverse. Not to mention living away from home
with 10 or 12 others jammed into a single trailer.
</P>
<P>
   But workers speak of oilfield labor, its highs and lows, almost
the way addicts speak of drugs. Dale Shaffer, a Caza driller who
lives in Thermopolis, near Casper, Wyo., said he once tried
breaking his habit with a job indoors, in an oil pump shop. ``I did
that for two years and about went stark raving mad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer, 34, began as the lowliest of the roughnecks _ working
the worm's corner, as they say _ digging ditches and doing other
jobs nobody else would touch. As a driller, he supervises a crew of
four, earning $600 to $700 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Besides seeing his checks fall to less than half that on
unemployment, Shaffer has to pay an extra $200 a month to keep his
health insurance. With his wife, Karla, pregnant and due in March,
insurance is essential.
</P>
<P>
   The clothing store where his wife worked as a sales clerk has
laid her off, too, while the closing of other local stores has
killed her job prospects. ``A lot of it is because of the oil
business being so slow,'' Shaffer said. ``People aren't out buying
stuff. There really aren't jobs to be had.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer, laid off in mid-December, hopes to help friends who
install carpeting or serve as roustabouts, driving trucks and
delivering oilfield supplies. Having grown up on a Wyoming ranch,
he has worked as a cowboy, too, but that paid only $12,000 a year.
He won't be called back by Caza Drilling for at least three months,
but he isn't complaining since others from his company have been
waiting a year.
</P>
<P>
   Gimbel, 45, might tide himself over by driving a bus to take
miners and train operators to the coal mines. He knows he could
then be called out at any hour of the day or night, but he does not
know the pay. ``They've always got an ad in the newspaper,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gimbel admits he should have known better after seeing his
father auction off his rigs and go out of business in an oil slump
12 years ago. His father's old shop is where Laura Gimbel now
leaves her car. But even now, Gimbel focuses more on the $45,000 or
$50,000 he can earn for a full year's work than on his $240 a week
in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer accepts that buying a home, instead of renting one, is
now at least two years off. By then, the costs of his 16-year-old
stepson's college could delay homebuying even more.
</P>
<P>
   But whenever his stepson, Ryan, speaks of tracking his father
into the oilfields right after high school, Shaffer tells him,
``Get your education first.''

TEXAS POUNDS MISSISSIPPI STATE BEHIND APPLEWHITE, WILLIAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ By the time Ricky got his groove back, the Longhorns
were already in one.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' Heisman Trophy-winning back Ricky Williams burst out of
the fog for 104 yards, including touchdown runs of 37 and two
yards, to lead Texas to 24 points and the record for the most
productive third quarter in Southwestern Bell Cotton Bowl history.
</P>
<P>
   Williams finished with a Texas bowl-rushing-record 203 yards on
30 carries and caught five passes for 45 more yards, earning him
honors as offensive player of the game. But the groundwork for
Texas' 38-11 victory against Mississippi State before a crowd of
72,611 had already been laid through the air and in the trenches.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to a 14-3 halftime lead, the Longhorns' surprising
defense, led by linebacker Aaron Babino, had withstood the best
that MSU tailback James Johnson had to offer. Though Johnson gained
105 of 122 yards in the first half, the Bulldogs reached no deeper
than the UT 22.
</P>
<P>
   And in the meantime, Texas quarterback Major Applewhite and wide
receiver Wane McGarity had taken measure of the best pass defense
in the Southeastern Conference. Applewhite and McGarity connected
for first-half touchdown passes of 59 and 52 yards. And those jabs
set the Bulldogs up for Williams' knockout punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those touchdown passes did a few things,'' said Texas coach
Mack Brown, whose Longhorns rose to 9-3 by winning Texas' first New
Year's Day bowl since defeating Alabama here in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they had to try to slow Ricky down and rattle
Major. That has to be the plan if you're going to play us. When
Major hit the two big balls \Rto McGarity\S and the other screen
\Rto Kwame Cavil\S that was so close to a touchdown, I felt like
that gave him the confidence that he could play against their
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then when they had to slow down their blitzes some, Ricky
made the big plays in the third quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   After his 37-yard scoring run put Texas up 21-3 less than three
minutes into the second half, Williams struck the Heisman pose his
teammates have been after him all year to do. The end-zone antic
cost Texas a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on the kickoff, but to
no damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like we had a big enough lead that the penalty wouldn't
hurt us,'' Williams said, sporting a sheepish grin.
</P>
<P>
   The youthful but poised Applewhite completed 15 of 26 passes for
225 yards and three TDs _ including an 18-yard strike to Cavil with
14 seconds left in the record-setting third quarter that gave Texas
a 38-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that Major did a great job,'' said MSU
coach Jackie Sherrill. ``He did a great job of getting the ball
where it was supposed to be. But you can't give Major all the
credit because he had some help.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity's ability to get deep against a defense that prepped to
prevent such occurrences, loomed large. He caught four passes for
132 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play a defense that takes a lot of chances,'' McGarity
said. ``We took advantage of that and made it a weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite _ the focus of MSU's defense _ was sacked only once
behind an offensive line that picked up and discarded almost every
blitz and stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their offensive line was real tight with their splits,'' said
MSU defensive end Edward Smith, who had 12 sacks this season, none
yesterday. ``We weren't able to get the penetration we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite became one of four quarterbacks to throw three TD
passes in a Cotton Bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to put a word on this season, it would be historic,''
he said. ``You end a 47-game \Rhome\S winning streak \Rat
Nebraska\S. Ricky winning the Heisman and all the rushing records
he broke. The season has been historical and at the same time
magical. It is a great moment for Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Brown's first in a New Year's bowl and iced a
magical first season at Texas, which should move up from its No. 20
ranking in the final Associated Press poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've become one of the best teams in the country, and
I hope the ratings show that when they come out after the national
championship game,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was very special for us for a lot of reasons. We were
not champions of the Big 12 or the Big 12 South, so we felt this
was the only way we could become champions and we did that today.
Also, it was important for us to win a major bowl game because we
had not won one since 1982. It's been a great season.''

AN EJECTION LED TO A SYRACUSE-FLORIDA MATCHUP
</HEADLINE>

   MIAMI _ Tony George insists he does not dwell on what might have
been. Others do it for him. They say that if the Florida cornerback
and co-captain had shown some restraint, the Gators might well be
in Arizona playing for a national championship instead of settling
for the Orange Bowl Classic here.
</P>
<P>
   George was thrown out of the Gators' pivotal game against
Florida State in late November minutes before it started, allegedly
for punching an FSU coach. Two obscure Seminoles also were tossed,
and Florida State exploited a George-less secondary in a 23-12
victory for a spot in the Fiesta Bowl's national title game on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators dropped to 9-2 and find themselves paired with
Syracuse (8-3) in Saturday night's Orange Bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched several tapes and it's been shown throughout,''
George said of his untimely scuffle. ``No punches were thrown,
especially from my hands. I admit there was a lot of pushing and
shoving on my part and some key name players on their part. But
only I get thrown out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gators suffered two ways from the loss to Florida State. The
importance of their bowl game is dramatically different, but the
difficulty of the opponent may be comparable.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse's victims include Michigan, Virginia Tech and Miami,
and the Orangemen lost by only a point to Tennessee, Florida
State's foe in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen have three particularly distinguished offensive
players _ quarterback Donovan McNabb, wide receiver Kevin Johnson
and fullback Rob Konrad. All are expected to go high in the next
National Football League draft.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb is at the throttle of Syracuse's 42.5-points-a-game
offense. He combines the elusiveness of a halfback with some newly
appreciated passing skills, earned by completing 62.5 percent of
251 passes this season for 2,134 yards and 22 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   To those who label him as basically an option quarterback,
McNabb politely demurs. ``I'm a quarterback first and foremost,''
he said this week. ``Secondly, I can do other things besides just
drop back and throw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson arrived at Syracuse as a quarterback the same year
McNabb did. After an intense battle between the two, Syracuse opted
for McNabb on what Coach Paul Pasqualoni called a ``gut feeling.''
Johnson was crushed, thinking he would have to spend his college
career watching others play.
</P>
<P>
   Then he had a talk with Marvin Harrison, Syracuse's best
receiver at the time, who reminded him that there were not too many
professional quarterbacks his size _ 5 feet 11 inches, 195 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Johnson has committed himself to being a wide
receiver. He caught 60 passes this season for 894 yards and 9
touchdowns, rushed for three more scores and returned two kickoffs
all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Konrad is the first fullback in Syracuse history to wear its No.
44 jersey, which was made famous by the tailbacks Jim Brown, Ernie
Davis and Floyd Little. Konrad's blocking and versatility make him
special in his own way, Pasqualoni said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be the tailback, the fullback, the receiver, he's great
in protections _ he blocks very, very well for the tailbacks,''
Pasqualoni said. ``So much can happen when Rob is playing.''
</P>
<P>
   As diversified as Syracuse's offense is, Pasqualoni said Florida
raises diversification to a new standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They use three wideouts, four wideouts, five wideouts,'' he
said. ``Then they can go with two tight ends and two wideouts in
the game. Then they can have one tight end in the game with two
wideouts and two backs. It just goes on and on and on. They wear
you out just trying to keep track of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very multiple,'' Pasqualoni said. ``I'd say they're
probably a little more multiple than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   But this has not been a particularly great year offensively for
the Gators. Coach Steve Spurrier says their running game has
suffered, and that is usually when Florida is most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at our losses since I've been here,'' he said. ``When
our running game is pitiful, we lose. The '93 Auburn loss was the
only time we've run the ball well and lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier has used two quarterbacks _ the junior Doug Johnson
starts on Saturday _ and says he is sorry neither one is mobile
enough to scramble for a first down occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Spurrier's complaints, Florida is scoring nearly 32
points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, a distinct edge goes to Florida, which has held the
opposition to an average of 14.1 points, 10.4 better than Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators have a number of potential NFL draftees, headed by
linebacker Jevon Kearse, a 6-foot-5, 250-pounder who projects as a
likely top-10 pick, even as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Orangemen's defense is populated by seven
first-year starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any big all-star names there,'' Pasqualoni said.
``It's jersey No. 7, jersey No. 10, that type of thing. But they
have learned that if they play together and very, very hard,
they'll do well.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: BOWL GAMES LOSING THEIR INCENTIVES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I never thought I'd see the day when a UCLA football team would
view a trip to the Rose Bowl as settling for something. But the day
has come. UCLA's players are grousing about a mighty tumble that
sent them from an undefeated season and a national championship
showdown with Tennessee to a beauty pageant game Friday against
Wisconsin. After UCLA's stunning loss to Miami last month, guard
Andy Myers said: ``Oh well, we're still going to the Rose Bowl.
Didn't that used to be the big one?''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Rose is simply another one. Between Dec. 19 and Jan. 4,
24 bowl games will have been played. The only game that truly means
something will take place on Monday night when Tennessee and
Florida State meet in the Fiesta Bowl for the national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system we have that brings No. 1 and No. 2 together cries
out to be the only game that matters,'' Mike Tranghese, the Big
East Conference commissioner, said. ``The others get a little
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost? Bowl games are being played that most fans don't even know
existed. Insight.com? Humanitarian? Great as a concept,
questionable as a game. In days of old, leading a team to a bowl
game was certain to save a coach's job. No more. The glut of games
cheapens the accomplishment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Washington made it to the Oahu Bowl with a 6-5 record and lost,
45-25, to Air Force. On Wednesday, the Washington administration
fired Coach Jim Lambright. Ticket sales were slow for Friday's Rose
Bowl; prices went from $75 for last year's game to $110 this year.
UCLA returned 6,300 unsold tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a world of outlets willing to put the games on
television, sponsors willing to sponsor them and teams willing to
go to them,'' said Jim Delany, the Big Ten Conference commissioner.
``They are celebrations for communities, players and sponsors. They
are part of the American sports mosaic.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about Delany's reference to the American sports
mosaic, but this is certainly the way we do business in the United
States. We seem to find a way to commercialize, and often corrupt,
everything. Not just everything, but every inch of everything. The
universities have allowed themselves to become ivy-covered
billboards for corporate sponsors. Nokia. Micron. Federal Express.
Two years ago the Rose Bowl refused to take a corporate sponsor
because its officials thought it would dilute the game's image.
When ABC offered the major bowls a half-billion dollars over the
next seven years if they would sign up for the Bowl Championship
Series, the Rose Bowl jumped.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Day used to be defined by games: Rose, Cotton,
Orange, Sugar and eventually the Fiesta. In my neighborhood,
families came together for black-eyed peas, greens and cornbread.
College players crashing into one another into the evening provided
reassuring background music for our celebration.
</P>
<P>
   But now the bowls are not a day but a season unto themselves, a
separate industry. They represent a pyramid of realities: at the
top, elite teams compete in the several major bowls, one leading to
a national championship; at the bottom, a glut of teams competes
for varying reasons, revenue obviously, but also exposure and in
many cases to provide a perk for boosters and fans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Tulane, the remarkable accomplishment of an undefeated 12-0
season might have gone unrecognized but for an opportunity to face
nationally known BYU in the Liberty Bowl. Tulane won, 41-27.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA players should be angry; I'm angry, too. Four weeks ago
we were looking forward to a smashing debut of the BCS: explosive
Tennessee with the first-year starter Tee Martin at quarterback
against UCLA with Cade McNown. Florida State is worthy, but so is
Ohio State. John Cooper, coach of the once-beaten Buckeyes, is
pulling for once-beaten Florida State to defeat unbeaten Tennessee
in the Fiesta Bowl so Ohio State might get a share of the national
title. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This tosses us back to the method of selecting a national
champion in major college football. Help may be on the way. ISL
Worldwide, a Switzerland-based sports marketing and licensing
company, is proposing a 16-team major college playoff. The plan
would use the bowls as setup games. The BCS would be expanded from
one game to a 16-team playoff. The semifinals and finals would be
bowl games. The ISL timetable would launch the playoff in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series, with all its flaws, at least
brings us closer to the kind of resolution we often lack in our
civilian lives but routinely get from sports: winners and losers
determined in an objective manner, not by polls, not by politics,
not by pundits and their computers. Instead they are determined by
games: six Friday , one Saturday night and finally the national
title showdown on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The system isn't perfect, but it's moving in the right
direction. &QL;

POLICE OFFICER HELD IN DUI FATALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACK HOPKINS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Two suspected drunk drivers _ one of them an off-duty
police officer from the suburb of Bellevue _ collided Friday in a
grinding, high-speed crash that left one passenger dead and three
others injured.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington State Patrol officer who was riding with the
Bellevue cop when the collision occurred is in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal accident happened at 3:15 a.m., just hours after tough
new drunk driving laws took effect in Washington _ laws for which
the policeman involved in the crash had recently taken training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done a good job of setting an example,'' said an
obviously saddened Bellevue police spokesman Mike Johnson as
investigators checked the crumpled remains of the off-duty
officer's Dodge Strata.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no mystery to any law enforcement officer in the state
about the new laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The new laws lower the blood-alcohol level required for proof of
intoxication from 0.10 to 0.08 percent and provide tougher
penalties for those convicted of drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   Police involvement in the fatal accident stunned area residents
who have fought drunken driving for years and counted law
enforcement officers among their staunchest allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly is dereliction of duty by law enforcement
officers and itsends out the wrong message,'' said state Sen. Adam
Kline, D-Seattle, who helped push through tougher laws against
drunken driving and formerly served as president of the local
chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it demonstrates a point MADD has been trying to make for
years: That driving under the influence is not an offense committed
by a small number of career criminals... Even a generally alert,
conscientious person can fall into that and we need ongoing
vigilance on everybody's part.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue police declined to release the name of the officer
involved in the crash, but said he was arrested on suspicion of
vehicular homicide. The 29-year-old policeman suffered a bruised
heart in the crash and was reported in satisfactory condition
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the officer has been a patrolman for about two or
three years and said he is unaware of any previous problems
involving the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a nice guy who is well liked by his peers,'' he said.
``He did a nice job for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue police also declined to identify the state trooper
riding in the front passenger seat with the policeman at the time
of the crash. They said only that he was 26 years old and had been
a trooper for about 2 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   The state patrolman suffered head and chest and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner's office identified the dead man as Brian
Heath Grooms, 26, of Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue police said Grooms, a salesman, was a friend of the
state trooper and was in the Seattle area on vacation. He was
riding in the back seat of the Dodge Strata when the crash
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellevue police officer driving the Strata had been drinking
and was traveling southbound at ``a high rate of speed'' when he
lost control of the vehicle, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The policeman's car went spinning across the center line and
collided with a northbound Ford Expedition driven by a 45-year-old
Bellevue man, who was identified only as a Navy officer.
</P>
<P>
   There were two passengers in the Expedition _ the officer's
53-year-old wife and a 78-year-old man in the back seat. The Naval
officer and the elderly man, believed to be the father or
father-in-law of the Navy man, were not injured. The woman was
reported in satisfactory condition and hospitalized with neck and
leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alcohol appears to be a contributing factor to the accident,''
said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Blood-alcohol tests were given to both drivers, but police
declined to release the results. He said, however, that both
drivers are believed to have been drunk at the time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he didn't know if open containers of alcoholic
beverages were found in either car.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy man was cited for driving under the influence and
released. The off-duty Bellevue policeman was arrested on suspicion
of vehicular homicide, a more serious offense that almost always
carries a prison term upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they did not know where the off-duty cop, the
trooper and the other man had been in the hours before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Police were called to the scene by a nearby resident who was
awakened by the sound of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I heard a crashing sound and then a horn that was
stuck on `on,' '' Jeff Johnson said. ``We immediately knew that
something was very wrong outside the house and called 911.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he quickly dressed and hurried to the crash site
where he spotted about six people clustered around the Strata,
trying to help the victims of the collision.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed amazement that an officer was involved in an
alcohol-related crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is amazing and sad,'' he said. ``For someone that much in
the know, someone who has seen the results of accidents... If
anybody should know better, it would be officers of the law,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, meanwhile, say it could take quite some time before
police wrap up their investigation and prosecutors make a charging
decision in the case.

AS NATIONS FADE, IS A RETURN TO THE MIDDLE AGES IN THE FUTURE?  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it possible that cyberspace and economic globalization are
pushing the modern world back into the Middle Ages?
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 years have passed since the late Hedley Bull, then
professor of international relations at Oxford, suggested the
existing system of nation states might be replaced by ``a modern
and secular equivalent of the kind of universal political
organization that existed in Western Christendom in the Middle
Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then many scholars have sought to explain changes in the
present-day world by making analogies with medieval Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of this neomedievalist case is that as a result of a
variety of pressures, the modern organization of nations, generally
seen as dating from the Treaty of Westphalia, which ended the
Thirty Years War in 1648, is, if not broken down already, then
certainly going through a period of profound weakening.
</P>
<P>
   Once nation states exercised absolute sovereignty over a clearly
defined territory, ``bundling together,'' in the phrase of James
Anderson of the Open University in Britain, responsibility for all
aspects of the ``secular, moral and spiritual'' lives of their
citizens. No higher authority existed than the ruler of such a
state, whether it be king or parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But no longer. Today nation states' traditional responsibilities
are being ``unbundled'' by a combination of forces.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of multinational corporations and global markets limit
their economic influence. Cyberspace and the internet belong to no
one. And increasingly nation states are surrendering sovereignty by
joining together in international organizations, recognizing that
many of their aspirations can be achieved only through concerted
action.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a modern citizen can be subject to many different,
often overlapping authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The life of a resident of the European Union, for instance, is
shaped by the decisions of local authorities, national parliaments,
the faceless Eurocrats of the Brussels Commission and a host of
other international bodies like the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, numerous U.N. agencies and, since
Friday, Europe's new single central bank with its new single
currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The growing complexity and diffuseness of modern authority
reminds some scholars of the Middle Ages, before nation states were
invented, when the boundaries of kingdoms were often vague and
subject to the fortunes of war and dynastic marriage, and many
different centers of power competed for influence.
</P>
<P>
   As Anderson puts it: ``Political sovereignty was shared between
a wide variety of secular and religious institutions and different
levels of authority _ feudal knights and barons, kings and princes,
guilds and cities, bishops, abbots and the papacy _ rather than
being based on territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen J. Kobrin of the University of Pennsylvania recently
argued in a paper in the Journal of International Affairs:
``Political power and authority were not geographically defined in
medieval Europe and may not be in a digitalized world economy
organized through overlapping electronic networks. Thinking about
the Middle Ages, the last premodern period, might help us imagine
possibilities for a postmodern future.''
</P>
<P>
   Other parallels can be glimpsed between today's world and that
of the Middle Ages, too. Christianity may no longer be the
universal religion, but some, particularly in the United States,
argue that democracy and free markets are close to playing a
similar role as an almost universally accepted ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Matthew, a political scientist at the University of
California at Irvine, has suggested that environmentalism is ready
to become a contemporary version of Christianity because it is a
global cause that transcends national borders.
</P>
<P>
   As the world of self-contained nation states starts to break
down, Kobrin believes, there is a quest under way for ``a center,''
some body with the universally accepted authority medieval popes
once claimed. Not just the United Nations but virtually every
intergovernmental organization in existence today was created since
World War II. ``It's like the medieval longing for the restoration
of the Roman Empire,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Kobrin finds a further parallel between the castles, retainers
and private armies of the medieval nobility and the rise of crime,
gated communities and private security companies in today's world,
showing that the nation state's traditional monopoly of coersive
power is losing strength.
</P>
<P>
   In his account of the collapse of civil authority over much of
West Africa, the writer Robert Kaplan warns that in some regions,
nation states are being ``replaced by a jagged-glass pattern of
city states, shanty states, nebulous and anarchic regionalisms''
suggestive of the Dark Ages that preceded the medieval world after
the fall of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   In his eyes, and others, it seems we're headed back to the
future.

CONFERENCE HOPES SKY'S THE LIMIT FOR NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge was granted admission into
the Big Sky Conference three years ago for reasons that could come
to fruition in two months. Or so the Big Sky hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors have an opportunity to win the Big Sky, host the
postseason tournament and reach the NCAA Tournament. That scenario
would give the Big Sky the type of exposure it has lacked in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   The conference season begins today with four games, including
CSUN's opener. The Matadors travel to two-time defending league
champ Northern Arizona for a 6:05 p.m. game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Northridge could develop a program where they had good
athletes, were good year after year and developed something there,
it could really help us,'' Big Sky commissioner Doug Fullerton
said. ``We'd love for them to go to the NCAA Tournament and do
something because it would give them more exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   In Missoula, Pocatello, and Ogden, among other places, the Big
Sky Conference is as known as the Pacific-10 is in California. But
in the San Fernando Valley, introductions are still in order when
it comes to the Big Sky. Just play the match game and figure out
which city goes with which school:
</P>
<P>
   If you got Missoula and Montana, Pocatello and Idaho State and
Ogden and Weber State, then you're in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Big Sky wants to change. The belief at the
conference headquarters, which is in Ogden, Utah (but you knew
that), is that if CSUN wins the regular-season title and hosts the
tournament, the schools and the corresponding cities will become
more familiar.
</P>
<P>
   However, many of the Big Sky coaches aren't thinking that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the best team in the league to represent the
conference the best,'' Northern Arizona coach Ben Howland said. ``I
don't know if (CSUN gaining exposure for the league) is the concern
or not. It's who's the best representative.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullerton, a former athletic director at Montana State and the
commissioner since July 1995, figured it would take a few years for
the league's investment in CSUN to mature.
</P>
<P>
   He said the league received limited dividends from the football
team's success, and he's optimistic basketball could accomplish
something similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been competitive, but I think they could possibly be
more competitive in the future,'' Fullerton said. ``I thought it
would take two or three years to get it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to year No.3 for the Matadors. At 8-4, it's the first
time in nearly a decade they've ended the calendar year with eight
wins.
</P>
<P>
   How CSUN handles being a contender isn't known. In their first
two seasons in the league, the Matadors finished sixth and seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can win it, and some people are expecting us to win it,''
CSUN guard Jason Crowe said. ``There's too much talent on this team
not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if CSUN were to bring the widespread notoriety only Los
Angeles can offer to the Big Sky, Fullerton said other issues need
to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   First, CSUN must address its gym. A recent renovation made it
more aesthetically pleasing, but the capacity is still below Big
Sky standards. The gym holds 1,600, 1,000 or so fewer than any
other school and 4,300 under the league's average capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were under a memorandum of understanding when they came
into the league of things we wanted to see,'' Fullerton said.
``They changed some things at their facilities, but we'd still like
for them to have 4,000 to 5,000 seats.''
</P>
<P>
   The seats could be added to the second level of the gym, but
they may go largely unnoticed. And unused. The Matadors were last
in attendance last season, averaging a paltry 858 per game.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the issue of electronic media coverage. The only
time television cameras appear at the campus is when the Matadors
play UCLA, or when bad news hits. And CSUN lacks a radio package.
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprises me,'' Fullerton said. ``It's a Division I school
with a chance to go to the Division I tournament. I thought they'd
be on the radio.''

SOUTH AFRICA LIMPS OUT OF BAD YEAR FOR POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ This Christmas-New Year's season
has not been kind to the South African police. But then 1998 was
not a very good year for them in general.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Chauke, the mastermind of blood-soaked armored-car
robberies and South Africa's most-wanted man, was not behind bars
by Christmas, as Bushie Engelbrecht, the country's most famous
detective had, in a rash moment, promised he would be.
</P>
<P>
   At least 25 people died in massacres in KwaZulu-Natal, although
for the first time in almost ritual Christmas bloodshed, most of
the killings looked like family feuds rather than political ones.
</P>
<P>
   The annual report card on the performances of Cabinet ministers
by The Mail &AMP; Guardian, a liberal weekly newspaper, gave Sydney
Mufamadi, the minister in charge of the police, an ``F.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 16, 50 brand-new BMW highway patrol cars were handed
over to the police at a ceremony on a race track. On the way home,
the police crashed six of them.
</P>
<P>
   That same week, television networks around the world carried
pictures of a Johannesburg inventor's solution to the carjacking
crisis: a chassis-mounted flamethrower that roasts anyone within 3
feet of the car. A police superintendent bought one.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Center for the Study of Violence and
Reconciliation published a study showing that 1,081 people had died
in police custody in the previous 18 months. During the worst years
of apartheid, no more than 200 people a year died in custody, noted
a former member of a group that helped apartheid arrestees.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that frustrated police officers, certain
that the courts would release criminals on bail, were killing them
instead. Criminals, for their part, fearing summary execution, were
choosing shootouts over surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after that report was issued, a police sergeant shot
dead two of his colleagues for talking too loud. He then went back
into his room and shot himself. The killings highlighted the issue
of police suicides, of which there are about 150 a year, nine times
the U.S. per capita rate.
</P>
<P>
   The police here, who take home pay of only about $4,000 a year,
are under enormous pressure and get almost no counseling. A
suicide-prevention expert from the University of Natal said
officers, who often live in barracks far from home, were three
times more likely than average citizens to snap violently or commit
suicide when under stress.
</P>
<P>
   At least 269 members of the force were killed in action last
year, about five times the U.S. rate per capita. That is about
three times the number killed in 1990, when black guerrillas were
deliberately targeting police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The daily crime reports in the press showed that many officers
were ambushed and killed by thieves who were after their guns, yet
the public outcry and huge manhunts that usually follow an American
police killing were missing here. Few of the cases are solved.
</P>
<P>
   A survey released in early December said 20 percent of all South
African households were victims of crime in 1997. In line with old
patterns, the rich were more likely to be the victims of burglars
and the poor were more likely to be victims of violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   But 42 percent of all South Africans thought the police were
doing a worse job than they were in 1994, the year the first
all-race elections brought the African National Congress to power.
Only 26 percent said they were doing better. ``Indifferent
officers'' was the chief complaint.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 21 scores of crime victims left flowers, candles and
crosses outside President Nelson Mandela's home, which is in an
expensive, secure Johannesburg neighborhood. The demonstration was
arranged by the opposition Democratic Party, but many of the
participants were relatives of those killed recently.
</P>
<P>
   And a week later, Anne Paton, the 71-year-old widow of Alan
Paton, author of ``Cry the Beloved Country,'' wrote a widely
published essay explaining why she was leaving South Africa after
35 years: Nine of her friends had been murdered in the last four
years, she said, and she had been carjacked at gunpoint, mugged
twice in her own home in midafternoon and terrorized with her own
Girl Guide knife.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably fair to say that the bad news has come faster and
more furiously in the last three months than it usually does, but
the flood of it has been startling. Furthermore, it was given
impetus by the fact that for a while things had seemed to be
getting better.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the police said crime had stabilized, although at high
levels. Meyer Kahn, the chairman of South African Breweries, a
well-run conglomerate with bold affirmative-action policies, had
been acting as chief executive officer of the police for a year and
was unveiling some reorganization plans.
</P>
<P>
   And the police and the Department of Transport had markedly
slowed down the ``taxi wars'' in which owners of fleets competing
for lucrative routes hired hit squads to rake rivals'
passenger-crammed taxis with machine-gun fire.
</P>
<P>
   There had also been a lull in embarrassing high-profile crimes.
In fact, some had been solved: Moses Sithole, a serial killer, had
been convicted of 38 murders. A wealthy couple shot dead at their
dining-room table had not been killed by intruders, as had at first
been thought; their son was arrested. Two ``mugged'' cricketers
from the Pakistani national team turned out to have staged the
incident to cover up their beating by a whorehouse bouncer. A spate
of political killings in the Richmond area of KwaZulu-Natal had
been stopped through Engelbrecht's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The only conclusion that could be drawn was that the travails of
the police, like crime itself, come in waves.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Antoinette Louw, a police specialist for the Institute for
Security Studies, a think tank that studies crime and war, said it
was hard to tell whether the police were doing a better job, or
whether the perceptions about them were worse. The police were once
hated as the functionaries of an apartheid state. Now, as they
struggle to fight crime instead, they are derided as incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   The police made real strides in 1998, Ms. Louw said. Absenteeism
was down. Many carjacking syndicates were cracked, some because the
officers who were sending them stolen cars were arrested. The
entire Illegal Alien Unit was arrested on corruption charges and
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Bank robberies and hijackings seemed to be going down, and
murders were definitely down while rape was definitely up, she
said. But overall it was ``incredibly difficult'' to say that any
trend was established. Pre-1994 statistics were worthless, and
current ones fluctuate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception that crime is still skyrocketing is untrue,''
Ms. Louw said. ``But the police statements that it is stabilizing
are misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis, she said, is in leadership. While the department has
suffered rapid post-apartheid attrition, many precinct captains
have never even been told how to do their jobs.

ECONOMIC SCENE: 5 PROBLEMS TARNISHING A ROBUST ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
 (For release on Monday, Jan. 4.)  
 (bl) 
By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It might seem churlish to find fault with a best-in-a-generation
economy. Unemployment and inflation rates are at record lows, and
low-paid workers are, for the first time in decades, receiving wage
increases that outpace price increases. But despite the benefits of
a temporarily buoyant economy, deep-seated problems remain.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Levy, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, notes that the best time to tackle problems is when the
economy is flush. He points to increasing inequality at a time of
stagnating wages in his new book, ``The New Dollars and Dreams''
(Russell Sage Foundation, 1998). Borrowing a phrase from Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., Levy warns against ``defining
deviancy down _ accepting economic outcomes as normal today that
would have been seen as pathological 10 or 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The new year is traditionally the time for making lists. So here
are five profound problems facing the U.S. economy:
</P>
<P>
   INCOME INEQUALITY: A study by Sheldon Danziger of the University
of Michigan shows that from 1969 to 1997, when the earnings of
college graduates rose briskly, the inflation-adjusted median
earnings of white male high-school graduates 25 to 34 fell nearly
30 percent. An economy that was supposed to lift everyone to new
highs of income and consumption instead pushed the least skilled
workers down.
</P>
<P>
   Danziger points to a stunning statistic: the earnings of these
less skilled white workers fell so far that they earned less in
1997 than their black counterparts, a notoriously underpaid group,
had earned almost 30 years earlier. And those black male
high-school graduates fared almost as badly. From 1969 to 1997,
their inflation-adjusted earnings fell 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Levy's data show that the richest one-half of 1 percent of
American taxpayers account for about 11 percent of aggregate
income, and about 5 percent of households take home 20 percent of
total income. The share of income captured by the bottom 60 percent
of households is falling. Only college graduates, about a quarter
of the work force, are racking up significant wage gains.
</P>
<P>
   There is substantial evidence that the nature of technology in
an information-intensive era is stacked in favor of workers with
college-level verbal and math skills. That leaves at least half of
the work force behind.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, the richest country in history, has a fifth
of its children in poverty. That this has taken place when the
national unemployment rate hovers around 4.4 percent raises the
question: What will happen when the next recession strikes?
</P>
<P>
   WEALTH INEQUALITY: The only sure way for a country to grow and
prosper is for its citizens to save and invest, in education,
highways, research, machinery and other wealth-creating activities.
But data from Edward Wolff of New York University show a country
where few people save. That leaves them with skimpy bank accounts
and meager holdings of stocks, bonds, real estate or other forms of
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 percent of American households, Wolff contends,
possess no net wealth (the value of their liabilities, like
mortgage debt, offsets the value of assets) or negative net wealth
(their liabilities exceed their assets). The bottom 40 percent of
households control a meager 0.2 of total wealth. By contrast, the
wealthiest 1 percent of households control nearly 40 percent of the
total wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The picture looks even grimmer if the value of housing _ a form
of wealth that cannot be bought and sold quickly and is, therefore,
largely unavailable for solving many financial emergencies _ is
subtracted from the calculations. By this measure, the bottom 40
percent of families have more debt than assets. And from 1983 to
1995, the poorest 40 percent of households lost 80 percent of their
wealth, while the wealthiest 1 percent of households gained 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Members of minority groups did much worse. In 1995, Wolff
reports, for example, the typical black household held only 12
percent as much wealth as the typical white household. Subtract
housing, and that figure falls to 1 percent. More than 30 percent
of black households, but only about 15 percent of white households,
have no net worth.
</P>
<P>
   SLUGGISH PRODUCTIVITY: Over the long sweep of history, wages
rise only about as fast as productivity _ the value of output per
hour of work by all workers. If productivity rises by, say, 3
percent a year, employers can raise wages by 3 percent without
sacrificing any profit. But if wages rise faster, workers' extra
income can only come out of payments that would otherwise go to
investors and creditors, a process that cannot continue
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   During the halcyon days of the 1950s and 1960s, productivity
rose by an average of 3 percent a year. At that rate, wages could
double in 20 years or so. But since the 1970s, productivity has
been crawling along at a 1 percent annual clip, taking about three
times as long to double. The productivity numbers have improved
recently, but there is scant evidence that the new numbers will be
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing for an economy, as is currently the case, to
operate close to capacity, thereby reducing unemployment and
driving up employment and wages. But to keep wages rising
thereafter requires harnessing technology to expand the economy's
productive capacity.
</P>
<P>
   On this score, the lessons of history are sobering. For much of
the last 100 or so years, productivity has been rising at the
seemingly slow pace of about 2 percent. The fast pace of the 1950s
and 1960s was anomalous. At the very least, it would take stiff
increases in savings and corporate investment to return the economy
to fast growth, but, according to Wolff's data, Americans appear
unconvinced that they need to make such sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   EDUCATION GAP: Investing in training and education is a possible
cure for sluggish productivity and rising inequality. Indeed, the
hiring practices of employers increasingly reward employees with
college-level verbal and math skills, a trend caused by
skill-biased technology. In 1978, male college graduates 25 to 34
earned about 15 percent more than recent high-school graduates. Now
the gap is about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet college and, therefore, access to high-income jobs remain
beyond the reach of many families. In 1992, about 40 percent of
high school seniors from the 25 percent poorest families did not
enroll in post-secondary education. By contrast, only 10 percent of
students from the 25 percent richest families failed to enroll in
college or other post-secondary education.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are turning increasingly to college-educated workers.
Over the last 20 years, the number of full-time workers who are
college graduates has risen from about 20 percent to almost 30
percent. Many unskilled male workers have become so discouraged
that they have dropped out of the labor force, increasing the
fraction of nonworking male high-school dropouts from about 25
percent in 1975 to 35 percent in 1995. The current employment rate
of high school dropouts, 40 percent, is only about half that of
college graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Given the huge earnings increase associated with college
attendance, it is no surprise that college enrollments are rising.
About 65 percent of whites in this country now acquire some college
education. But black attendance rates are about 10 percentage
points lower. Hispanic students are about four times as likely to
drop out of high school as are whites.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious explanation for these wide gaps in college
attendance _ the ability of the family to cover tuition and living
expenses _ may not be accurate. James Heckman of the University of
Chicago argues that the income of parents at the time their
children leave high school has less impact on the decision to
attend college than do long-term factors, such as the economic and
social circumstances of the family when the child was young. The
time to intervene, Heckman argues, is early in a child's life.
</P>
<P>
   TATTERED SAFETY BLANKET: Millions of adults have dropped out of
the labor force because they cannot afford to replace their
government-paid health insurance with a private policy. Nor can
they afford day care for their young children. The percentage of
the population without health insurance has risen to about 16
percent and is nudging higher. An ominous trend is that workers are
increasingly turning down offers by employers for insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has turned quickly and viciously against unskilled
workers, leaving many of their families adrift. Fifty years ago,
low-paid workers could seek their fortunes by migrating out of
Southern agricultural areas and into Northern manufacturing cities.
Today, escape routes are far more difficult to find. As Levy of MIT
notes, ``getting an education is harder than getting on a bus.''

JETS WATCH AND WAIT    
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ As the first playoff bye week in Jets history
sailed along Friday, some members of the organization found
themselves in unfamiliar territory.
</P>
<P>
   After all, if you have seldom been there, how do you deal with
playoff tickets? When do you print the guide for the news media?
How do you scout the teams in the playoffs you may never even face?
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, unaccustomed to this sort of thing more than most
teams, are enjoying this bye week before their divisional playoff
game on Jan. 10. They reached this point by capturing a division
title in what has been an unusual season league-wide. After all, it
was merely the second time in league history that there are new
champions in all six divisions.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the Jets do know. By about 3:30 p.m. Sunday they
will have discovered whether they will play Jacksonville (which
meets New England) or face the winner of Saturday's Miami-Buffalo
wild-card game. The Jaguars are heavily favored to beat the
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   So Curtis Martin, will you be watching both games this weekend?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the 1,000-yard running back said. ``Neither game. I'm
not a big football fan.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coach Bill Parcells and those around him will watch. Also,
the Jets have dispatched their highly regarded pro personnel
director, Scott Pioli, to Jacksonville to scout the game between
the Jaguars and Patriots. Meanwhile, Jo Jo Wooden, who works under
Pioli, will be in Miami to scout the Dolphins-Bills game.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has used this week to introduce his club to the Jaguars
on tape. He put his players in pads today after meetings that
included a second day of looking at Jacksonville. They will
practice again on Saturday and then be off until next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm going to feel good about our preparation for this
game,'' Parcells said. ``We had ample time.'' And if the Jets wind
up facing either Miami or Buffalo, the Jets merely have to go back
and get one or two game films. The Jets played both teams in the
past month.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the Jets' offices, Doug Miller was also feeling good
about his playoff preparation. Miller, the assistant director of
public relations, could finally exhale. The thick, magazine-sized
playoff guide was ready this week, even though he had waited until
the team had clinched to put on the final touches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I had it all set the last month and I think I
jinxed us,'' Miller said. ``This year our printing company kept
saying, `We have to get started.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller would not hand it over. He kept telling the printer,
``I'll call you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had updated the information all along,'' Miller said, ``but
I didn't start to get ready to put it out until we beat Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets return to the Meadowlands for their playoff game,
400 members of the news media will be in the press box as part of a
total of more than 800 people covering the game. That will include
more than 200 people from CBS, which is doing two broadcasts, over
the regular airwaves and on experimental high-definition
television.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1991, the Jets also have sent out
playoff ticket notices. These went out Thanksgiving week, and about
75,000 of the 77,000 season's tickets have been taken. The league
sets the price increase at all playoff sites. For the Jets,
traditionally the lowest-priced seat in the NFL, the $35 ticket
will cost $58 and the $40 seat has gone up to $63.
</P>
<P>
   Next week team officials are going to Miami to scout the hotel
that the American Conference winner stays in for the Super Bowl.
After all, you never know.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets will be sending Mike Kensil, the operations director;
Kevin Coyle, the director of travel; Steve Yarnell, in charge of
security, and Frank Ramos, the public relations director. This is
standard procedure among all the teams who get to the divisional
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say `Super Bowl' are words you're not supposed to say
when you're in the playoffs,'' Ramos said. ``But you can't just
suddenly prepare for the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   It appears that all the Jets' regulars who started the season
will be able to play in the post-season. Aaron Glenn,  &UR;  &LR; who missed
the last three games at left cornerback with a sprained ankle, is
practicing at an increased tempo. ``It looks like he has a real
shot, unless he has a setback,'' Bill Parcells said &UR; . &LR;  Fullback
Keith Byars &UR; ,  &LR; who also did not play the past three games, has had
the cast removed from his broken forearm. The only regular player
sidelined for the year was Marvin Jones &UR; ,  &LR; who suffered a serious

player, had a rib injury that ended his season after Game 14. &QL;

2 INDUSTRIES UNITE TO PAVE WAY FOR HIGH-SPEED WEB ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 4)  
(mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has used the Internet at both work and home knows
that those are vastly different experiences. Whatever the metaphor
they choose _ jack rabbit and tortoise, water and molasses, heaven
and hell _ most people who access the Net from home via dial-up
modems miss a big part of what cyberspace ought to be all about:
high-speed, low-hassle access to text, graphics, audio and video.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that typical modems are simply not
able to do the Internet full justice. And most consumers have no
other economically realistic options for connecting.
</P>
<P>
   But if the telecommunications and cable television industries
have their way, that will start to change in a big way this year,
beginning a process that could bring quick Internet connections
from the office to the living room just as Henry Ford brought the
automobile from the mansion to the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the advent of truly low-cost personal computers,
the mass deployment of cheap, reliable, high-speed Internet links
for residential consumers could have an impact as deep as Ford's.
After all, it was not until cars became less a novelty for the rich
than a necessity for the rest that it made sense to actually pave
roads.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the broad availability of high-speed cyberspace
connections could foster the development of new sorts of
applications that make today's Internet look like a rutted cart
path.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the bet that many of the nation's largest
telephone and cable television companies have made or are getting
ready to make. And 1999 will probably be the year that those two
industries, with their vastly different financial, regulatory and
cultural dimensions, join their battle to control the future of how
the nation's consumers enter cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest single opportunity that exists in all of
communications,'' said Howard Anderson, managing director of the
Yankee Group, a high-technology consulting firm in Boston. ``It
will get very serious and this, 1999, is the year that we will see
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable television and telephone industries are trying to use
radically different technologies to deliver huge amounts of data to
homes, but the financial opportunity for each of them is
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most aggressive projections peg the number of homes
that had high-speed Internet access at the end of last year at
something less than 750,000 (a vast majority of those using cable
modems rather than the telephone technology known as asymmetric
digital subscriber line, or ADSL.)
</P>
<P>
   Overall, somewhere around 45 percent of the nation's 100 million
homes have computers, and only about half of those, or around 22.5
million, are online at all.
</P>
<P>
   US West Inc. has been the most aggressive of the Bell local
phone companies in deploying ADSL technology, planning to sign up
as many as 25,000 customers by the end of last year. Michael
Rouleau, a US West vice president for marketing, estimated that
about 10 percent of cyberspace-using homes would pay extra for
high-speed access.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jermoluk, chairman of At Home Corp., the cable-modem
venture backed by many of the nation's large cable system
operators, said his company's business plan was to win 20 percent
of any given market's online homes as customers after four years.
</P>
<P>
   Split the difference at 15 percent and the potential market
today _ at $40 a month a home, which is roughly what both the
telephone and cable companies are charging _ comes to about $1.6
billion. In the communications world, that is not a large number.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson of Yankee Group, however, believes that fully half of
the online homes would pay $40 a month for high-speed Internet
access. If that were true, and if, in a few years, the proportion
of U.S. homes that had computers rose to 60 percent and the
proportion of online homes also rose to 60 percent, then the market
opportunity would be a much more significant $8.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But even that is just the entrance to the potential gold mine.
That $40 a month just covers basic access to cyberspace. What the
telephone and cable companies may try to do is to leverage that
relationship with users to sell them additional services, ranging
from e-mail to clothing shopping to video games.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, standing in the way of such incremental revenue are
some very daunting fixed costs. It generally takes around $700 to
upgrade each phone or cable line to provide high-speed data access.
(Additional options, like offering Internet-based phone service
over a cable line, cost even more.)
</P>
<P>
   So, for instance, because At Home's affiliates serve about 60
million customers, Jermoluk said, it would cost a staggering $42
billion to get all of them online using cable modems. And so the
deployment goes slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Other than competition between each other, however, the biggest
force pushing the cable and telephone companies to deploy
high-speed data systems may not be consumers, but the computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In this day of 450-megahertz processors and video cards with as
many transistors as Pentium chips, the biggest bottleneck in the
computer system is the link to other computers. If the connections
do not increase in speed, the prospect of buying a new computer
every year or two becomes less compelling.
</P>
<P>
   That is why companies like Compaq Computer and Microsoft are
perhaps even more eager for widespread high-speed data connections
than even the most intense Internet surfer. For the local phone and
cable companies, the Internet is the future. For the computer
companies it is now.

TOBACCO: COMPANIES REFOCUS EFFORTS AS LITIGATION CLOUD LIFTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Monday, Jan. 4) 
(bl) 
By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cigarette makers are starting this year relieved of their
biggest financial and legal threat but still not free of the
uncertainty that has recently hovered over the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In November, producers and 46 states, including many that had
filed lawsuits against the industry to recover health care costs
related to smoking, settled those actions in a package worth $206
billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Producers had previously reached similar settlements with the
four other states totaling $40 billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The plans, under which producers also agreed to certain
marketing restrictions, such as a ban on tobacco billboards,
brought to a close a cycle of litigation that once threatened to
bankrupt the industry. But the deals did not satisfy the
anti-smoking groups, which wanted stronger measures like federal
regulation of nicotine, and other lawsuits may continue to plague
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single biggest litigation threat has receded,'' said
Martin Feldman, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ``But tobacco
will remain a difficult social issue, and the residual litigation
risk will be of concern to investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Aronson, the president of Aronson Washington Research,
which advises institutional investors on tobacco litigation risks,
said that state lawsuits were just part of a ``snowstorm'' of legal
problems that have fallen on the industry in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Still continuing are a Justice Department investigation into
possible criminal wrongdoing by producers, individual cases brought
by smokers and a class-action case, now under way in Miami, that
was brought on behalf of all Florida smokers.
</P>
<P>
   There are also assaults from abroad. Nicaragua filed suit in
Puerto Rico last month, seeking to recoup the cost of treating sick
smokers, and Brazil has threatened to sue as well. Guatemala
brought a similar action in Washington last spring.
</P>
<P>
   But such matters, both Ms. Aronson and Feldman agreed, pose a
lesser threat than the state lawsuits did, and industry officials
are turning their attention away from the courthouse and back to
their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlement allows the companies to operate in an
atmosphere of greater stability,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette producers that participated in the plan are Philip
Morris Cos.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco
Holdings Corp.; Lorillard Tobacco, a unit of Loews Corp., and Brown
&AMP; Williamson Tobacco, which is owned by BAT Industries PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's fifth-largest cigarette maker, Liggett &AMP; Myers, a
subsidiary of the Brooke Group, also joined in, at the 11th hour,
and U.S. Tobacco, which is owned by UST Inc., the nation's largest
producer of smokeless tobacco, settled with all states except
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the biggest test for the industry will be the
effect of recent price increases on smoking rates. Soon after the
signing of the settlement, both Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds
increased prices 45 cents a pack at the wholesale level, passing
along the settlement's cost to smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts are speculating that the price increase could
reduce cigarette consumption by 6 percent to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Feldman, say that while the price increase is not
likely to make many smokers quit the habit, it may cause them to
reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke each day.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Szymanczyk, the chief executive of Philip Morris U.S.A.,
said in a recent interview that he had little idea how the price
increase would affect consumption.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts believe that Philip Morris will continue to
consolidate its position as market leader, the biggest winner from
the tobacco settlement may be Liggett &AMP; Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its larger competitors, Liggett, as part of a last-minute
deal with attorneys general, was essentially given a free ride to
participate in the $206 billion settlement plan. The company will
not have to contribute to the settlement unless its future sales
exceed 1997 levels by 125 percent. And that outcome is all but
impossible because the company, just before signing the plan, sold
three of its cigarette brands, representing some 14 percent of its
sales, to Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Liggett can raise its prices, too, without feeling
any of the pain of having to give up any revenues to the states.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Klemperer, an economist at Oxford University, recently
estimated that even if Liggett &AMP; Myers loses some sales when it
raises its prices, it will still collect an additional $100 million
a year, a sum equal to its recent market value.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently also see a boom for the company. In late
November, when states approved the $206 billion pact, the stock of
the Brooke Group, long an industry laggard, shot up nearly 60
percent in a single day's trading.

POLICE OFFICER HELD IN DUI FATALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACK HOPKINS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Two suspected drunk drivers _ one of them an off-duty
police officer from the suburb of Bellevue _ collided Friday in a
grinding, high-speed crash that left one passenger dead and three
others injured.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington State Patrol officer who was riding with the
Bellevue cop when the collision occurred is in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal accident happened at 3:15 a.m., just hours after tough
new drunk driving laws took effect in Washington _ laws for which
the policeman involved in the crash had recently taken training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done a good job of setting an example,'' said an
obviously saddened Bellevue police spokesman Mike Johnson as
investigators checked the crumpled remains of the off-duty
officer's Dodge Strata.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no mystery to any law enforcement officer in the state
about the new laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The new laws lower the blood-alcohol level required for proof of
intoxication from 0.10 to 0.08 percent and provide tougher
penalties for those convicted of drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   Police involvement in the fatal accident stunned area residents
who have fought drunken driving for years and counted law
enforcement officers among their staunchest allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly is dereliction of duty by law enforcement
officers and itsends out the wrong message,'' said state Sen. Adam
Kline, D-Seattle, who helped push through tougher laws against
drunken driving and formerly served as president of the local
chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it demonstrates a point MADD has been trying to make for
years: That driving under the influence is not an offense committed
by a small number of career criminals... Even a generally alert,
conscientious person can fall into that and we need ongoing
vigilance on everybody's part.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue police declined to release the name of the officer
involved in the crash, but said he was arrested on suspicion of
vehicular homicide. The 29-year-old policeman suffered a bruised
heart in the crash and was reported in satisfactory condition
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the officer has been a patrolman for about two or
three years and said he is unaware of any previous problems
involving the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a nice guy who is well liked by his peers,'' he said.
``He did a nice job for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue police also declined to identify the state trooper
riding in the front passenger seat with the policeman at the time
of the crash. They said only that he was 26 years old and had been
a trooper for about 2 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   The state patrolman suffered head and chest and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner's office identified the dead man as Brian
Heath Grooms, 26, of Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue police said Grooms, a salesman, was a friend of the
state trooper and was in the Seattle area on vacation. He was
riding in the back seat of the Dodge Strata when the crash
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellevue police officer driving the Strata had been drinking
and was traveling southbound at ``a high rate of speed'' when he
lost control of the vehicle, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The policeman's car went spinning across the center line and
collided with a northbound Ford Expedition driven by a 45-year-old
Bellevue man, who was identified only as a Navy officer.
</P>
<P>
   There were two passengers in the Expedition _ the officer's
53-year-old wife and a 78-year-old man in the back seat. The Naval
officer and the elderly man, believed to be the father or
father-in-law of the Navy man, were not injured. The woman was
reported in satisfactory condition and hospitalized with neck and
leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alcohol appears to be a contributing factor to the accident,''
said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Blood-alcohol tests were given to both drivers, but police
declined to release the results. He said, however, that both
drivers are believed to have been drunk at the time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he didn't know if open containers of alcoholic
beverages were found in either car.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy man was cited for driving under the influence and
released. The off-duty Bellevue policeman was arrested on suspicion
of vehicular homicide, a more serious offense that almost always
carries a prison term upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they did not know where the off-duty cop, the
trooper and the other man had been in the hours before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Police were called to the scene by a nearby resident who was
awakened by the sound of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I heard a crashing sound and then a horn that was
stuck on `on,' '' Jeff Johnson said. ``We immediately knew that
something was very wrong outside the house and called 911.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he quickly dressed and hurried to the crash site
where he spotted about six people clustered around the Strata,
trying to help the victims of the collision.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed amazement that an officer was involved in an
alcohol-related crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is amazing and sad,'' he said. ``For someone that much in
the know, someone who has seen the results of accidents... If
anybody should know better, it would be officers of the law,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, meanwhile, say it could take quite some time before
police wrap up their investigation and prosecutors make a charging
decision in the case.

<P>
   NEBRASKA CITY, Neb. _ Lewis and Clark would not know the
Missouri River now.
</P>
<P>
   The tumultuous water that taunted their canoes as they forged
the way to the American West is docile now, domesticated.
</P>
<P>
   The ``confused jumble of savage-looking snags'' that Mark Twain
steered his steamboat through is now slick and sterile. And there
is little left of the muddy water that Horace Greeley once said was
like ``thick milk porridge _ you could not discern an egg in a
glass of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years now, the hand of man has tamed the Missouri River,
damming it and diking it, streamlining and straitjacketing it into
a channel for barges and a generally well-behaved feeding tube for
the fertile farmland on its banks.
</P>
<P>
   But big changes are coming to the Big Muddy, America's longest
river, stretching nearly 2,500 miles from Three Forks, Mont., to
St. Louis, is in the throes of an identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   After the withering drought of the late 1980s and the ferocious
floods of 1993, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which essentially
controls the river's water flow, decided it needed to re-evaluate
its master plan.
</P>
<P>
   The fracas over the river's future is fierce as
environmentalists, farmers, barge operators, recreation boosters,
hydroelectric utilities, Indian tribes and municipal leaders all
try to make sure the river stays _ or becomes _ what they want it
to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody would dearly love if we could come up with a
recommendation that everyone could agree on,'' said Richard H.
Opper, executive director of the Missouri River Basin Association,
a coalition of the eight river-basin states and two dozen Indian
tribes, which met recently to discuss the river.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle is the Corps, which controls how much water
is released from upstream reservoirs after each year's snow melt _
and when. It has the sometimes Sisyphean task of insuring there is
enough water when and where it is needed, but not so much that it
mutinies its banks.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps has issued a list of options _ different ways to
adjust the ebb and flow of the Missouri _ with the aim of making a
decision later this year.
</P>
<P>
   And that has unleashed a torrent of debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying for years there are really two things that the
Corps could not propose politically,'' Opper said. ``One was
keeping the current situation the same. The other was any sort of
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Nebraska City, an unpretentious, plain-vanilla Plains
town about 400 miles upriver from where the Missouri dumps into the
Mississippi near St. Louis, most of the conflicts are easy to see.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers like John Crook, growing corn and soybeans on river
bottom land his great grandfather staked out in 1878, want the
Missouri to be reined in further so their crops won't drown.
</P>
<P>
   People like Ray Pinney, who manages the barge terminal here,
want the water to stay swift and deep so towboats and barges can
keep hauling fertilizer up from St. Louis and Kansas City and
taking grain down river at harvest time.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Smith, who represents the environmental group, American
Rivers, in this part of the country, and Gerald Mestl, a biologist
with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, want the river to
return, as much as possible, to its natural, free-flowing state.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of management have destroyed miles of natural habitat,
threatening the survival of many species and landing three _ the
pallid sturgeon, the piping plover and the least tern _ on the
endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
   And Nancy Hoch, who heads the economic development corporation
in this town of about 7,000 people, is supportive of farming and
business interests. But like leaders in other cities that once used
the river as an industrial dumping ground, she also understands
environmental concerns. After all, Nebraska City's claim to fame is
as the home of the inventor of Arbor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly that the river does not belong to
anyone,'' said Ms. Hoch. ``It does not belong to the least tern. It
does not belong to barge traffic. We need to balance the river.''
</P>
<P>
   But balance is hard to come by on a river that sculpts the
country's mid-section, draining about one-sixth of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Further north of Nebraska City, a booming hunting, fishing and
boating industry wants to insure the reservoirs don't lose too much
water each year.
</P>
<P>
   And up and down the Missouri are Indian tribes, who have begun
to assert claims to water rights along significant portions of the
river, supported by a turn-of-the-century Supreme Court ruling.
When they ultimately negotiate what water they control, the tribes
say they envision many uses including irrigation, electricity and
exporting water for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many interests in the Missouri River Basin,'' said
Richard Bad Moccasin, executive director of the tribes'
organization, Mni Sose Intertribal Water Rights Coalition (``Mni''
means ``water'' in the Lakota language, and ``Sose,'' Bad Moccasin
said, means ``the way the Missouri used to be _ murky and muddy and
wild and woolly.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't envy the Army Corps,'' he said, ``but, well, they
created the monster _ trying to change that mighty Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, concerned that the river would overrun some of
the nation's richest farmland _ and eager for a public works
project to employ the veterans of World War II _ the Corps erected
six dams on the Missouri, with reservoirs to hold the snow melt
from South Dakota to Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Further downstream, it narrowed a wide bramble of sandbars and
side-channels into a single, manicured canal, with fast, deep water
to satisfy towboats and barges plying between Sioux City and St.
Louis. Dikes and levees were rigged up too, keeping the river in
check, and holding back the runoff that once muddied its waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people,'' Opper said, ``say it more closely resembles a
plumbing system rather than a natural river.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The voices of those who say that have gotten stronger in recent
years. Environmental groups, distressed that the loss of about half
a million acres of the river's habitat has threatened or endangered
a fifth of the plant and animal species in and around the river,
have been pressing for substantial changes.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the American Rivers group proposed ending all
commercial navigation, saying it pales in economic significance to
the river's environmental and recreational value.
</P>
<P>
   When that was met with anger, the group suggested the Corps
change its policy of releasing a constant amount of water from the
spring through the fall and instead release more water in the
spring and less in the summer. That would create a ``spring rise,''
that would act as a kind of aphrodisiac to fish, and in summer
would encourage the formation of sandbars, where birds like to
nest.
</P>
<P>
   To the navigation industry, that would be a grave threat. It
would ground barges and towboats when the river was low in summer.
While the Missouri's barge traffic has never been heavy and has
diminished in the last 20 years _ the Army Corps says 2 million
tons of cargo a year travel on the Missouri compared with over 100
million tons on the Mississippi _ industry officials say it is
important because it forces railroads to set competitive shipping
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Paul J. Werner, a vice president with American Waterways
Operators, the barge industry trade association, said keeping the
Missouri's water level consistently high is also crucial for
insuring the Mississippi has enough water for navigation.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, for their part, worry a spring rise could cause
flooding or make it impossible to drain fields in time for
planting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's too wet to get a crop planted by the first of June,
you're not farming this year,'' said Crook, who like many farmers
here is reeling from the loss of some crops in recent years because
wet weather has made the river unusually high.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, weather anomalies like that have made the Army Corps'
impending choice even harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The river changes and you need to change with it,'' said John
Remus, a hydraulic engineer with the Army Corps, standing on a bank
near Nebraska City. ``We're not going to be able to be as
high-handed as we once were. We're going to have to listen to other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Opper, who in the last year has managed, with the help of
professional mediators, to get sworn enemies to at least
acknowledge each other's claims to the river, hopes the pressure of
the Corps' upcoming decision and the responsibilities imposed by
the Endangered Species Act will force the groups to reach a
consensus, even though ``it will be a recommendation that nobody is
completely happy with.''
</P>
<P>
   But one recent change on the river has so far not angered too
many people.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps has begun buying up parcels of farmland along the
banks, grafting them onto the river and converting them into
wetlands that re-create a little bit of the old Missouri. The
environmentalists approve, even if they consider it a drop in the
bucket. And most navigators and farmers aren't complaining, since
the wetlands are walled off with rocks so they don't disturb the
flow and depth of the main river channel.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these, Hamburg Bend, created in 1996 just south of
Nebraska City, is a chute carved from land so damaged by the 1993
flood that it became practically impossible to farm.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent tour in a flat-bottomed skiff, as a bald eagle and a
blue heron flapped by, Mestl of the Game and Parks Commission
pointed out the sandbars, slower, shallower water, and tapered,
natural banks that attract wildlife, including the speckled chub,
the plains minnow and the catfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lewis and Clark called the Missouri a catfish river,'' Mestl
said. And even though the wetlands are small consolation for
environmentalists, he said, at least ``people are starting to catch
fish here.''

BRAZIL: A JOUST WITH INFLATION, RECESSION AND HUGE FOREIGN DEBT
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Monday, Jan. 4) 
(bl) 
By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ If investors were buoyant over Brazil's
prospects in 1997 and sobered by its vulnerability to a world
credit squeeze in 1998, they are focused this year on the
government's efforts to cut costs and reduce debt.
</P>
<P>
   As South America's largest country, with nearly 165 million
people, half the continent's population, and 40 percent of its
gross domestic product, Brazil will in some measure affect every
economy in the hemisphere as it succeeds or fails. Investors and
economists from Caracas to Santiago will be watching it closely to
gauge their prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But uncertainty about 1999 abounds. Some economists question the
prescription that Brazil accepted in November under a $41.5 billion
loan package arranged by the International Monetary Fund. President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso is committed to carrying out a
combination of spending cuts and tax increases totaling $84
billion. The IMF hopes that interbank interest rates, which are now
above 30 percent and at one point soared above 50 percent, will
come down to 16 percent or 18 percent in the final months of 1999.
But continuing pressure on the country's currency, the real, may
make that impossible, and tax revenue would decrease under a
deepening recession.
</P>
<P>
   Critics speak of a vicious cycle and warn that supporting an
overvalued currency with high interest rates may only deepen
Brazil's debt problem by stifling growth and raising the cost of
government borrowing. Consumer interest rates were at annual rates
of 70 percent to 100 percent at the end of 1998, and economists
expect that any lowering of interbank rates will be passed onto
consumers very slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the government appears ready to square off not so
much with the opposition as with its own notoriously unruly allies.
The legislative wrangling already in evidence at the close of last
year blocked the president's attempts to convene a special session
of Congress to extend a tax on financial transactions. That
conflict may foreshadow bitter disputes to come between Cardoso's
government and its coalition partners, which are already
positioning themselves for presidential elections in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what,'' said Theresa Paiz, vice president for
sovereign risk analysis at Thomson Bank Watch, ``it's going to be a
hard year.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists are predicting that the hardest months of recession
will come in the first half of the year. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
estimates that economic output will shrink 7.5 percent from January
through March and 5.7 percent in the second quarter. Most analysts
expect Brazilian output to fall by 1.5 percent to 3 percent. Its
Social Security deficit, even with the legislate tightening that
the government is proposing, is likely to hit $40 billion, and
commodity prices are expected to sink further. Unemployment,
officially at 7.3 percent, may reach 12 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF loan package is reassuring banks and investors somewhat.
Up to $37 billion of the IMF money could be available this year if
Brazil meets targets for government savings and reforms under its
letter of agreement with the fund. The government is aiming to
bring its budget deficit, swollen to 8.3 percent in 1998, down to
4.7 percent next year. But it is less confident of reaching the 2.6
percent primary surplus _ a figure that reflects revenue minus
expenses, without interest on debts _ that it promised the fund for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Costs for Brazil's foreign debt, expected to reach $250 billion
in 1999, are rising. Vincent Truglia, a managing director of
Moody's Investors Service, expects Brazil's medium- and long-term
foreign debt to exceed 70 percent of the value of exports in goods,
services and financial transfers, up from 60 percent in 1997 and 44
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Roque Sut Ribeiro at Marka Nikko Asset Management said that some
$250 billion of domestic and foreign debt would have to be
refinanced in the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   And Truglia said that ``since the government can't determine in
advance what interest rates will be, it can only try to deal with
what's in its power.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil expects to make at least $21 billion this year through a
series of privatizations, starting with the sale of ``mirror
licenses'' in telecommunications. The sales open the field for
private phone companies to compete with those that paid $18 billion
for pieces of the Telebras communications holding company in July.
Important sales in electrical energy are also likely to move
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Major economic decisions will unfold in Congress, which faces
votes on simplifying Brazil's confusing patchwork of 60 kinds of
taxes, cutting long-generous pension benefits for civil servants,
and detailing the criteria for laying off tens of thousands of
those workers. The government is also planning to extend a special
tax on corporate earnings, set to expire next year, until 2006, and
to increase it to 3 percent from 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such steps will not come easily amid the public hardship that is
expected to deepen. Investors will be watching, Truglia said, for
Brazil's ability ``to sustain these kinds of different economic
policies for a considerable period of time, as the negative
consequences of the adjustment become felt.''

INTERNET SPECULATORS TARGET POLITICIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif., Va., Mo., Minn., N.J., Tenn., Mass., Ala.)  (lb) 
 By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has never declared himself a
presidential candidate, at least 39 pieces of prime Internet real
estate have already been claimed in his name. Yet only two of those
addresses for sites on the World Wide Web _ Bush2000.org and
GeorgeWBush.com _ belong to people officially affiliated with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest were snatched up by a small group of
speculators who have been grabbing politicians' names like mining
claims in the Old West. Their motive is financial, not political.
</P>
<P>
   The speculators, who paid $70 for each domain name, as such
Internet addresses are known, hope to sell their cyberclaims to the
highest bidders _ even if the buyer happens to be a political
opponent of the potential candidate in question.
</P>
<P>
   The leading player in this game is Alex Goldstein, 25, of Los
Angeles, who has spent at least $10,000 on domain names. Goldstein,
a native of Long Island, N.Y., who worked for a few years as a bond
trader in Chicago and now works for an Internet marketing firm in
California, owns nine variations of Bush's name, five for the
magazine publisher Steve Forbes and at least 15 for former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for any major national political figures who had
left useful names open,'' Goldstein said. Politicians, he said, are
good targets for domain-name investment because they cannot
trademark their names. Speculators who tried to grab corporate
names in recent years found their claims thwarted by lawsuits
claiming trademark infringement.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining a domain name is otherwise not difficult. A $70
registration fee is paid to Network Solutions Inc., the Herndon,
Va., company that has handled domain registrations for the last
five years under an exclusive contract with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who describes himself as nonpartisan, said that
whether the bidders for his names are supporters or opponents of a
candidate is irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't really care who controls these names,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 elections, political operatives quickly learned the
value of publishing Web sites under names that would attract an
opponents' supporters. For example, when supporters of Sen. Bob
Dole pointed their browsers to dole96.com, they found content that
ridiculed and belittled their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Like many cyberspace speculators, Goldstein expressed surprise
that so many politicians had failed to learn from the 1996 campaign
and had left themselves open to the potential for opponents to
create sites under Web addresses similar to those of official
campaign sites, which candidates use for everything from
biographical information to text of speeches to fund raising. He
predicted that in six months the going rate for such names would be
five figures for each.
</P>
<P>
   But several political consultants said that while candidates
could be hurt by their ignorance of the ways of the Internet,
speculators like Goldstein could get soaked by their ignorance of
the ways of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hockaday, president of Campaign Solutions, a Republican
consulting firm in Alexandria, Va., that specializes in direct
mail, telemarketing and Internet services, predicted that campaign
managers were ``not going to be held up by highway robbery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Should they be really worried? Not really,'' Hockaday said.
``Should they do better promoting of the official site?
Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 elections, very few campaigns bothered to promote
their Web sites on brochures or television advertisements. But that
may change as candidates face the prospect of a field of
``look-alike'' sites, Hockaday said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the presumed candidates, Bush's name has proved to be the
most popular among the speculators, with at least 39 variations
having been registered. For most of the domain names purchased, no
sites have been built.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential candidates who have been attracting domain-name
speculators are Vice President Al Gore (at least 20 addresses),
Forbes (21) and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. (19).
Eight names each have been registered for possible candidacies by
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., and former Democratic Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, the candidates' own organization had generally
registered only one or two of the domain names. But few political
consultants see the need to buy a block of Web addresses to protect
their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only get troubled over things over which you have
control,'' said Karl Rove, a consultant to Bush, based in Austin,
Texas. ``If people are interested in good information on a
candidate and they find a site that's just a rant about a
candidate, they'll pass it by.''
</P>
<P>
   But advisers to former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander disagreed.
Mel Lukens, a former aide with Alexander's political action
committee in Nashville, strategically purchased six variations of
the name to block opposition sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every positive site,'' Lukens said, ``there's a multitude
of people who want to get negative information out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are also strategic issues to be considered when potential
candidates or their agents register domain names. To secure one
name for a campaign Web site is cautious, for example, but to
register 15 names is tantamount to a declaration of candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do a dance before you're a declared candidate,''
said Michael Cornfield, a professor at The George Washington
University's Graduate School of Political Management who
specializes in online politics. ``You don't want to tip your hand
to the Federal Election Commission and to the other candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, the lack of defensive domain-name
registrations also shows widespread ignorance among political
operatives of the growing importance of the Internet as an
information medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elites in the political consultancy world are television
people,'' Cornfield said. ``They just don't get it.'' The emerging
class of Internet political consultants _ who would invariably
advise candidates to buy blocks of Web addresses _ ``don't have the
access to the inner circles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few people who bought domain names based on potential
candidates in 2000 said they planned to create sites opposing the
candidate whose name they had registered.
</P>
<P>
   Among this group is David Crump of Boston, who runs adult Web
sites for a living and bought three variations on
``AlbertGore2000.'' Crump, a Libertarian, said he might establish
parody sites under the vice president's name that direct traffic to
the Libertarian Party's Web site. Of course, he allowed, if someone
were to offer him money for the names, he would sell them.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Walker, a rent collector in St. Louis, registered four
addresses based on Gephardt's name. Walker, who had volunteered for
the congressman's campaigns in the past, said he would donate the
names to the campaign if anyone asked for them. Walker said he had
never used the Internet but when he heard that people were
registering addresses to build opposition sites against candidates,
he acted to protect Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rodgers, a real-estate broker in Austin, registered the
domain name GeorgeBush2000.com because, he said, ``I don't want
George Bush to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, who describes himself as ``neither Republican nor
Democrat _ just frustrated,'' said he had no intention of selling
the name.
</P>
<P>
   Still, profit potential is by far the most popular reason for
registering a domain name. Four Web addresses registered under
variations of Gore's name are already hawking political
memorabilia. Vollie Goehring, the systems administrator for the
political consultant to Bush, said he received e-mail daily from
people offering to sell campaign-related domain names.
</P>
<P>
   To Joe Moorman, the domain game is part of the democratic
process. Moorman, a 28-year-old Libertarian programmer in
Birmingham, Ala., owns GeorgeBush2000.org and GeorgeBush2004.com.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he might set up parody sites but that he would be
willing to sell the names, ``especially if I could recoup all those
taxes the politicians keep raising on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Moorman wonders, in the face of all the speculating,
whether the domain-name registration process will remain democratic
for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I fear,'' he said of politicians, ``is that they're going
to try to rewrite the laws _ because they're in control _ and take
them from us.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, when the hot flashes hit and her hormones took a nose
dive, Janet Brown, 50, became a self-described raging bull. ``I was
hot, cranky, impossible to live with, angry in my own body and
looking for love in all the wrong places,'' said Ms. Brown, who
owns a high-end designer boutique in Port Washington, N.Y. ``Not
one person could be near me. I could alienate a planet.'' Her
doctor referred her to Dr. Patricia Allen, an obstetrician and
gynecologist with a reputation for taming the most unruly patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Allen came along, otherwise known as the Elmer Gantry of
medicine, and made me lose 25 pounds, take medication and see
specialists for everything to get my body back into good health
after seven years of neglect,'' Ms. Brown said. ``I don't perspire
anymore. I am absolutely the most amiable 50-year-old in the world.
I was born again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allen's all-encompassing approach to female health care _
she has prescribed hormone-replacement therapy and a personal
trainer in the same breath _ along with her take-charge, ``Queen of
England'' manner, have attracted a fierce following, especially
among New York's power elite.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allen, who was born in a Kentucky farmhouse 51 years ago,
conducts examinations in her Upper East Side office in a Chanel lab
coat and Manolo Blahnik stilettos. Her patients have been known to
receive faxes in their paper gowns. Liz Smith, the gossip
columnist; Joni Evans, the literary agent, and Barbara Taylor
Bradford, the novelist, are among the strong-willed, often
demanding women who submit to Dr. Allen's orders, in part because
they regard her as one of them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to seeing as many as 25 patients a day, Dr. Allen
may also preside over a charity lunch for the New York Presbyterian
Hospital, where she is on staff, and then spend the evening at the
opera. She has been known to make a quick exit from a black-tie
affair to tend to a hospital emergency, only to return to the party
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I met Pat,'' Ms. Bradford said, ``I thought,
`Now who does she remind me of? A cross between Edwina Sandys, the
granddaughter of Sir Winston Churchill, and Pamela Harriman.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allen's active social life notwithstanding, she owes her
reputation to her innovative methods of treatment. ``She's really
out there on the forefront,'' said Dr. David Skinner, chief
executive of the New York Presbyterian Health-Care System.
</P>
<P>
   She has helped shape a new attitude toward menopause, once a
hush-hush event signaling the end of a woman's fertile years, now
perceived as a positive experience. Her interest in the subject
coincided with her own menopause and the publication, in 1991, of
``A Silent Passage,'' a reconsideration of menopause by one of her
patients, Gail Sheehy, who used Dr. Allen as a source.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat was a pioneer,'' Ms. Sheehy said. ``She recognized the
neglect of women in this age group.'' In 1996, Dr. Allen started
the New York Menopause Center at her office on 90th Street, off
Madison Avenue, a cozy setting where Provencal decor and fresh
flowers mix with the latest ultrasound and scanning equipment. She
has assembled a network of doctors _ surgeons, urologists,
psychiatrists, a cardiologist, dermatologist, endocrinologist and
nutritionist _for the women under her care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women need a consolidated way to get things done,'' Dr. Allen
said. ``They don't want to go someplace for a bone-density test, go
someplace else to be counseled and then come back to me. They want
one visit.''
</P>
<P>
   This one-stop shopping is a hit with her patients. ``I had a
checkup with Pat to get a routine bone-density test because I'm on
hormone-replacement therapy,'' said Ms. Evans, the literary agent.
``She found a fibroid, an orange going to grapefruit size. If Pat
hadn't found it, it would have been a tree in a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allen's care is not limited to gynecology. ``When I walk in,
she says, `Remember to take off your socks so I can see your toes
because women over 45 tend to get melanomas between the toes and on
the ankles,' '' Ms. Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allen has also been known to dispense nonmedical advice,
suggesting a different hairstyle, or marriage counseling. Last
spring, when interviewing a new patient, Dr. Allen discovered that
the woman's marriage was in crisis. Dr. Allen called the patient's
husband, then recommended a family therapist.
</P>
<P>
   In an age of impersonal managed health care, Dr. Allen's
professional style harks back to her roots, in Columbia, Ky. The
eldest of six children _ her father was a tenant farmer, her mother
a schoolteacher _ Dr. Allen was delivered by a local practitioner.
``He and another local doctor not only did obstetrics and
gynecology, but pediatrics, geriatrics and general surgery as
well,'' she said. ``They were the emergency room doctor and the
psychiatrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allen strives to be a small-town doctor in the big city.
After making a referral to a surgeon, she may accompany the patient
to the consultation, a cup of coffee in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had me in the hospital for a D and C,' '' said Ms. Smith,
the columnist. ``She encouraged all my friends to come and see me.
She came to see me before the operation and twice afterward. She
explained everything. She did all my tests twice. She must really
be a joy for a hypochondriac.''
</P>
<P>
   And she is not the kind of obstetrician who shows up at the
hospital when the patient is screaming for pain relief at the end
of labor. Dr. Allen sits with mothers-to-be from the moment they
are admitted to the hospital. In six years, she has not missed a
delivery, she said, though she insists that her patients give her
enough advance warning to do her hair before a delivery, even a
midnight one. And she is never without her lucky 22-karat gold
angel earrings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the clicking of her heels coming down the hallway in
the hospital,'' said Linda Wells, the editor of Allure magazine
whose two sons were delivered by Dr. Allen. It was Ms. Wells who,
as a token of appreciation, gave her doctor the Chanel lab coat.
``She bullies you if you gain too much weight in the first three to
four months of pregnancy,'' Ms. Wells said. ``I know one person
whom she sent to Weight Watchers. I don't think Weight Watchers
accepts people who are pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Ms. Wells wondered how to keep her condition a secret
until she got back her amniocentesis results, Dr. Allen had an
answer for that, too. ``She said: `Just get your hair done,' '' Ms.
Wells recalled. `` `It'll draw attention away from your belly.'''

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Heeding warnings from the nation's military chiefs,
President Clinton has decided to propose the first real increase in
the Pentagon's budget in nearly a decade and the largest since the
Cold War buildup of the mid-1980s, administration and defense
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal, only the first step in a drawn-out process
with Congress, would reverse years of dwindling defense resources
after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It would address growing
strains, the officials said, caused by aging weapons and increasing
operations overseas, from Bosnia to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal represents a significant political shift for
Clinton. A Democrat who has often had an uneasy relationship with
the military, he came into office in the wake of the Cold War,
focused more on his domestic initiatives than on defense.
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of growing complaints about military readiness,
both from within the military and from Republicans, he was
persuaded to seek an increase of more than $4 billion in the
defense budget for fiscal 2000 and about $100 billion over the next
six years. That is the first increase, discounting inflation, since
1991, when spending spiked slightly for the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to announce the increase in his weekly radio
address on Saturday, and the early word of his plans appeared to be
an effort to blunt new criticism. It is unclear, however, how he
would pay for his proposals, setting the stage for what is sure to
be an intense fight with the new Congress over defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   In the budget he will submit to Congress in a month, Clinton
plans to propose increasing spending for the Department of Defense
to nearly $269 billion, the officials said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   While that is a modest net increase of just under 2 percent
after inflation, Clinton has also agreed to let the department keep
another $8 billion freed up as a result of lower-than-expected
inflation and fuel prices, money that normally would be returned to
the Treasury, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the Pentagon would have $12 billion in new funds
to spend on everything from new equipment to spare parts to raises
for the nation's military personnel in the fiscal year that begins
in October.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six years, Clinton's budget would propose
additional spending of slightly more than $100 billion. That would
represent the most significant rise in military spending since the
buildup by President Reagan in the early 1980s, although it is only
two-thirds of what the military chiefs had said they would want in
an ideal world.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry
H. Shelton, and the chiefs of the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine
Corps are scheduled to appear before the Senate's Committee on
Armed Services.
</P>
<P>
   When they last testified before the committee in September, they
faced unusually hostile questioning over the military's readiness
problems from Republicans who accused them of having sugar-coated
issues like pilot shortages and training cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is considering a
presidential run in 2000, said then that the chiefs were ``not
candid to this member in the problems and challenges that we
faced.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite strict spending caps set by the Balanced Budget Act of
1997, many Republicans have called for much larger increases in the
Pentagon's budget, accusing Clinton of having let the military
become ``hollow'' and the generals and admirals of not blowing the
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James M. Inhofe, R.-Okla., who leads the Senate's
subcommittee on military readiness, reacted strongly when asked
about Clinton's plan to increase spending now, saying the president
was belatedly trying to head off Republican criticism that he has
skimped on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's personally responsible for the defamation of our defense
system and our hollow forces,'' the senator said. ``The president
is going to try to make it look like he's a pro-defense president.
It's an outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials dismiss the accusations. In interviews
this week, they said Clinton's proposals reflected the reality of
today's military. The armed services are doing more _ from flying
over Kosovo to bombing Iraq _ while the jets, ships and other
equipment bought during Reagan's buildup have become old and need
replacements or at least spare parts.
</P>
<P>
   The officials refused to say exactly how Clinton would propose
paying for the increase in defense spending. He has already vowed
not to spend the recent federal surplus until he and Congress agree
on a way to shore up the Social Security system, which is lurching
toward insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   And the Balanced Budget Act has placed strict caps on total
discretionary spending, requiring that any increases be offset by
reductions elsewhere. Clinton could propose to pay for new defense
spending by cutting other domestic programs, although he has not
done so in the past and seems unlikely to now.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the administration is expected to find or create new
pots of money that could be used for new increases. One
administration official said Clinton would call for increases in
both defense and domestic programs when he outlines his budget
priorities, beginning with the State of the Union address later
this month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For much of the last year, Defense Secretary William Cohen and
the service chiefs have been steadily trying to build a case for an
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Even though no threat on the scale of the Soviet Union has
emerged to challenge U.S. supremacy, they have argued that the
declining or flat budgets since the Reagan years have left the
country spending less on defense as a portion of the total federal
budget _ now just under 15 percent _ than at any time since World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   When Cohen asked the chiefs to list their budget priorities,
they came back with requests for personnel and equipment that
totaled $148 billion over the next six years. Cohen cut the
requests back to $112 billion. Negotiations with Clinton's budget
aides have since whittled that down to roughly $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still short of what we needed,'' one uniformed officer
grumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most Pentagon officials interviewed this week
sounded pleased. One senior officer said that $12 billion in the
coming fiscal year and more than $100 billion over six years would
go a long way toward shoring up the areas of the budget under the
most strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their most critical needs could be covered with something over
$100 billion,'' the officer said.

IS CADBURY LOOKING FOR AN EXIT FROM THE BEVERAGE BUSINESS? 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By agreeing to sell nearly all its international beverage
business to the Coca-Cola Co., Cadbury Schweppes PLC made it clear
last month that it was leaving the global soft-drink field to
Coca-Cola and Pepsico Inc.
</P>
<P>
   What is less clear is Cadbury's strategy for its remaining
soft-drink business, which will now be concentrated in its most
profitable market, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some popular brands like Dr Pepper, Cadbury lags far
behind Coca-Cola and Pepsico in market share, which was part of the
company's justification for selling its international business.
While it says the sale will allow it to focus better on the U.S.
market, one major bottler contends that the deal signals the
British company's intention to leave the soft-drink business
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe this is the first step in determining what some
kind of exit strategy might be for Cadbury,'' said Jim Turner, one
of the biggest independent bottlers of Dr Pepper and 7-Up, another
Cadbury brand. The Coca-Cola deal, he said, ``certainly opens up a
lot of questions in terms of Cadbury's long-term plans in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury executives say they are committed to staying in the
American soft-drink market. ``Dr. Pepper/Seven-Up is an important
component of the Cadbury Schweppes family, and there are no plans
to sell it,'' said Philippa Dworkin, a spokeswoman for Dr.
Pepper/Seven-Up, based in Plano, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While its geographical sweep will be much smaller (Cadbury is
keeping its soft-drink brands in France and South Africa, as well
as the United States), the company is retaining the most profitable
part of the business. Indeed, about 65 percent of Cadbury's
beverage profits came from its operations in the United States in
1997, according to the company's annual report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see North American beverages as very different from the
rest of the world,'' said John F. Brock, Cadbury's managing
director for global beverages. ``We have a 15 percent share here,
compared to a 3 share outside the U.S. We have a terrific set of
brands, led by Dr Pepper, and an increasingly secure route to
market.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cadbury and Coca-Cola executives announced the $1.85
billion sale on Dec. 11, it was presented as a deal that was in the
best interests of both. Without a cohesive distribution network,
Cadbury could not develop its own brands overseas as well as
Coca-Cola would be able to, both companies said. Coca-Cola wanted
those brands _ to round out its portfolio, or, perhaps, to keep
them away from archrival Pepsico.
</P>
<P>
   (Pepsico, which has bottling agreements with Cadbury in Canada,
Chile, Eastern Europe and other places, greeted the news warily,
saying it will have to ``take a long, hard look'' at every aspect
of the arrangement.)
</P>
<P>
   Michael Branca, a beverage analyst with Lehman Brothers, said
the deal with Coke was an effort to create value for Cadbury's
brands. At the same time, he expects a sizable portion of the
deal's proceeds to be spent on buying back shares, benefiting
shareholders _ many of whom never liked the idea of getting
involved in the American soft-drink market in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Since the deal was announced, American depository receipts of
Cadbury _ each representing four shares of the British company _
have risen 12 percent. The stock closed on Thursday at $69.125,
near the 52-week high of $70.125 it touched on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury's brands, which also include Crush, Hires and A &AMP; W,
have long plied a treacherous path between Coca-Cola and Pepsi,
with some bottled by each giant and the rest handled by independent
bottlers, a famously Balkanized lot. In the past, Cadbury brands
have been unceremoniously dropped from Coke and Pepsi delivery
trucks; when Coke and Pepsi decided to acquire their own root-beer
brands not long ago, neither giant wanted to continue distributing
Hires and A &AMP; W.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Cadbury signed an agreement with Pepsico to continue
bottling and distributing the brands it currently handles, which is
thought to extend a certain amount of security to 7-Up. In
February, Cadbury signed another agreement with Coca-Cola
Enterprises, Coke's biggest bottler, to distribute Dr Pepper
through 2005. Coca-Cola Enterprises handles about 19 percent of Dr
Pepper's total volume.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those agreements, Cadbury's route to market would be
more secure if the company had its own distribution system to rely
on. Yet it seems unlikely that Cadbury will pour money into
building up that distribution immediately.
</P>
<P>
   In February, after much foot-dragging, Cadbury spent about $300
million for a 40 percent stake in the American Bottling Company,
formed by the merger of two Midwestern bottlers. Cadbury's partner
is Carlyle Group, a Washington investment firm. At the time, the
company said the new bottler would absorb others, continuing a
consolidation of the so-called third tier. To date, more than 10
months after the company was formed, only one bottler has been
added to the fold _ hardly an impressive pace.
</P>
<P>
   But Brock, the Cadbury executive, said some money would be spent
on consolidating Cadbury's bottling operations. ``It's a fairly
modest investment to get the independent system consolidated,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, there are also acquisitions to be made in the
candy business, using the money from the Coke deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the confectionery side, we see the global opportunity
higher than in soft drinks,'' Brock said. ``The top six players
make up only about 50 percent of the business. It's far more
fragmented.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Pirko, a beverage-industry consultant, says Cadbury's
decision to sell its overseas brands to Coca-Cola was indeed the
right move. ``It moves them back to their position of strength,
which is confectionery,'' he said. ``It gives them an opportunity
to go after what they do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other analysts say that certain Cadbury Schweppes
executives are more comfortable in the confectionery business,
where the company is a major global player and the fourth-largest
chocolate maker, than in the soft-drink business.
</P>
<P>
   Without the international beverage operations, Cadbury will be
tilted more toward confectioneries, whose sales totaled about $3.7
billion in 1997. Beverage sales minus the brands being sold will be
closer to $2 billion, with profits of $470 million. Confectionery
profits in 1997 were about $479 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intuition tells me that they are going to invest more in
the confectionary side than the soft-drink side,'' Turner said,
``and they will also try to consolidate some of the bottling
operations in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner speculated that such a consolidation could be a precursor
to spinning off the bottling and beverage operations as a separate
company. And, he noted, both Coca-Cola and Pepsico would love to
own Dr Pepper, a perennial moneymaker for both companies' bottlers,
should the Federal Trade Commission, which has blocked previous
efforts by both companies to acquire Dr Pepper and 7-Up, become
more accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   One problem that might impede any possible sale is the
performance of 7-Up, which has been losing market share in many
areas to Sprite the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they wanted to sell, they might not get full value
because they haven't turned 7-Up around,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a
global consumer-products analyst for Merrill Lynch. ``And if you
can do that, why do you want to get out of the business?''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman says, the decision to concentrate on the United States
soft-drink business signals that Cadbury will battle Coca-Cola and
Pepsi. ``There isn't a graceful exit,'' he said. ``They wouldn't
have put this bottling thing together if that's what they were
looking for. That means they plan to stick around.''

SPOTLIGHT KILLS LOUISIANA WOMAN CELEBRATING NEW YEAR'S 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A woman celebrating New Year's died in a hotel lobby
early Friday when a 200-pound spotlight fell on her from the fourth
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Guy, 33, of Kenner, La., was walking through the lobby of
the Hyatt Regency in downtown Houston when a spotlight used in the
hotel's celebration crushed her.
</P>
<P>
   Guy was rushed to Ben Taub Hospital, where she was pronounced
dead from her injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Guy's companion, 27-year-old James Lutz of Luling, La., was
treated for a contusion to his left foot and released later.
</P>
<P>
   Two Houston party-goers, Kimberly Vega, 32, and Haytham
Alkhaldi, 26, also were treated for contusions suffered in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight, one of two mounted on a fourth-floor ledge, was
being removed by workers with, LD Systems Inc., a company that
provides equipment for special events when it fell, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred as the hotel's party was finishing up.
Witnesses said there were fewer than 100 people left in the lobby
area when the spotlight fell or more people would have been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Police said when a sandbag was removed from the light's base, it
became too heavy for another worker to hold, and it toppled over
the ledge.
</P>
<P>
   A hotel spokesman Friday called the death ``very sad,'' but
referred questions about the incident to police.
</P>
<P>
   Houston homicide investigators, many of whom were working extra
jobs at the hotel for the New Year's party, were looking into Guy's
death but said there was no indication it was anything other than a
tragic accident.

IN WHAT MIGHT BE HIS LAST COLLEGE GAME, COUCH STIFLED BY PENN
STATE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ If it was Tim Couch's final game at Kentucky, it
was not the best way to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State kept the Wildcats' standout quarterback from
finishing what he began. The Nittany Lions (9-3) did enough on both
sides of the ball to post their second Outback Bowl victory in two
appearances in four years, beating Kentucky, 26-14, Friday at
Raymond James Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Nittany Lions shut out Kentucky for the final
three quarters. Offensively, they came back from an 11-point
deficit to give 72-year-old Coach Joe Paterno his 19th career bowl
victory, a National Collegiate Athletic Association record.
</P>
<P>
   Couch completed 30 of 48 passes for 336 yards and both
touchdowns for Kentucky (7-5). But the 6-foot-5-inch junior was
picked off twice by Penn State's Anthony King in the first half and
went 10 for 19 for just 106 yards in the second half. Penn State,
which had a team-record tying 47 sacks going into the game, also
sacked him six times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was brilliant,'' Kentucky coach Hal Mumme said of Couch.
``We wouldn't be playing in a New Year's Day bowl game without him
or several other key players''
</P>
<P>
   Mumme added: ``I'd like to have him for another year. He has to
make a very big life-changing decision in a short period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch said he would make a decision Wednesday or Thursday as to
whether he will stay for his senior season. The deadline for
underclassmen to file for the National Football League draft is
next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm 50-50 as to living the dream of being an NFL
quarterback or staying with my teammates,'' Couch said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats benefited from a missed field goal to score the
game's first points. Couch capped a 66-yard drive in six plays by
throwing a 37-yard scoring strike to Lance Mickelsen over the
middle. Mickelsen worked his way free from Penn State safety Shawn
Lee before making a leaping catch in the end zone wth 7 minutes 17
seconds gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions countered with the first of Travis Forney's four field
goals, an Outback Bowl record and a school record for bowl games.
After coming up short on a 51-yard effort on the previous
possession, Forney hit a 43-yarder 2:18 later after freshman
tailback Eric McCoo ran 25 yards from midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Couch then guided Kentucky to its second touchdown. A 40-yard
connection to Kevin Coleman was wiped out by a holding call, but
Couch went back to Coleman for 22 yards and a first down at the
Kentucky 46.
</P>
<P>
   Couch completed his next three passes _ 8 yards to Derek Homer,
30 to Mickelsen and the last 16 on a screen to Anthony White, who
eluded a Penn State defender at the 8 before trotting in for a 14-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to get discouraged, but the defense kept their
poise and discipline,'' said Paterno. Of Kentucky, he said:``You
don't get any better than what they did early.''
</P>
<P>
   After a shanked punt, the Lions used the big play to cut into
their deficit. On second-and-16, Kevin Thompson scrambled out of
the pocket and hit an open Joe Nastasi for a 56-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Forney booted a 26-yard field goal with 63 seconds left in the
second to trim the Wildcats' halftime lead to 14-13.
</P>
<P>
   Things began to fall apart early for the Wildcats in the third
quarter. On the second play of the second half, Couch was sacked
for an 8-yard loss by Courtney Brown, who was named the game's most
outstanding player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've been held scoreless in a half for two
years,'' Couch said. ``We hurt ourselves a lot with penalties. They
made some good adjustments in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   That forced a punt and the Lions turned that into a 21-yard
Forney field goal 7:09 into the third period, putting them ahead
for good at 16-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cut the defensive package a bit,'' Paterno said. ``Toward
the end they beat us with the back out of the backfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Couch's 30 completions, 14 went to running backs and only two
went to his favorite receiver, Craig Yeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a lot of good adjustments,'' Couch said. ``It's been
a while since I saw that many different defensive looks. They were
well-disguised.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats drove to a potential go-ahead field goal with 3:54
left, but Seth Hanson's 29-yard try was blocked by all-American
linebacker LaVar Arrington. It may have been Kentucky's last chance
to win.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State used two big plays by McCoo to set up Forney's fourth
field goal. Right after Kentucky's missed kick, McCoo broke loose
for 30 yards. He later took a screen pass from Kevin Thompson and
scampered 21 yards to put Penn State in field-goal range. Forney's
25-yard kick with 13 seconds left in the third quarter made it
19-14.
</P>
<P>
   To open the fourth, Kentucky had second-and-1 at its 35 and did
not gain another yard. Arrington stopped Derek Homer on fourth
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't question going for it, but I question the call,''
Mumme said. ``I'd go for it again, but I would have made a better
call.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions sealed the victory win with 11:03 left on a
19-yard reverse Chafie Fields for the final touchdown. Fields
eluded four would-be tacklers at the Kentucky 6.

PATAKI, STARTING 2ND TERM, SAYS NEW YORK CAN LEAD NATION
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ George Elmer Pataki began his second term as
governor Friday by declaring that his success in scaling back
government had rekindled New York's spirit, saying that the strides
of the last four years showed that the state was ready to lead the
nation into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We the people of New York must light the way to a brighter
future,'' Pataki said in a 14-minute inaugural address that often
had the feel of a civic-minded pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, 53, a Republican who rose from a childhood on a
Peekskill farm to become the state's 53rd governor, outlined no new
proposals in the speech and did not refer to his ambitions beyond
Albany, which have been the subject of growing speculation since he
easily won re-election in November.
</P>
<P>
   But the tirelessly upbeat oratory suggested he was honing a
theme he plans to expound while traveling the country: that his
brand of Republicanism _ fiscally conservative, with little
emphasis on divisive social issues _ had worked in New York, and
would work elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We charted a bold new course for this state,'' he said, ``a
course driven by our determination to see that government remains
the people's servant and not their master.''
</P>
<P>
   As he often does, he referred to his idol, Theodore Roosevelt,
who was inaugurated governor of New York 100 years ago Friday.
Pataki noted that both he and Roosevelt stood ``at the edge of a
new century, which is spread out before us like an undiscovered
land of promise.'' Roosevelt also was the last New York Republican
to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has declined to say whether he will run for president
next year, insisting only that he has not ruled it out and saying
that as leader of a large state, he wants to help set his party's
agenda. In recent weeks, he has uncharacteristically lashed out at
the Republicans in Congress. He has asserted that they have damaged
the party by neglecting core issues, like cutting taxes, in their
zeal to impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential bid could prove daunting for Pataki, because
while his support for abortion rights and views on other social
issues play well in New York, they put him in conflict with the
conservatives who hold sway in Republican presidential primaries in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   Though he did not detail his agenda for his second term Friday,
he plans to use his State of the State Message on Wednesday and his
budget message later this month to announce new proposals. They
will include a budget that is to be considerably more austere than
his election-year one, which raised spending at more than the rate
of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At the ceremony in the Convention Center in Albany, Pataki took
the oath of office from the state's chief judge, Judith Kaye, while
a 19-gun salute resounded in the piercing cold outside.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier, Judge Kaye swore in the new lieutenant governor, Mary
Donohue, a former judge and prosecutor from upstate New York, who
was recruited by Pataki to replace Betsy McCaughey Ross. Pataki had
a long falling-out with Ms. McCaughey Ross. After he removed her
from the re-election ticket, she became a Democrat, lost the party
primary and ran against Pataki in the general election on the
Liberal Party line.
</P>
<P>
   The state Comptroller H. Carl McCall and the new attorney
general, Eliot Spitzer, also took their oaths of office Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Besides starting his second term, Pataki is now the most
prominent Republican in the state, replacing his mentor, U.S. Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, who was defeated for re-election in November. In
1994, D'Amato had anointed Pataki, then an obscure state senator,
as the party's nominee for governor.
</P>
<P>
   The D'Amato defeat capped a disappointing election for the
Republicans. Dennis Vacco was ousted as attorney general by
Spitzer, a wealthy former state prosecutor from Manhattan, and the
party failed to pick up seats in the Legislature, despite spending
heavily. That showing blunted Pataki's victory over the Democratic
nominee, New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato sat in the front row during the inaugural ceremony, two
rows in front of New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican
who spurned Pataki and endorsed the three-term Democratic
incumbent, Mario Cuomo, in 1994, only to return to the fold in last
fall's election and campaign for Pataki. Giuliani also has national
aspirations, but publicly, he and Pataki say they get along.
Privately, there is no affection between their camps.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's relatively short address Friday had little in common
with his first in 1995, when he cited his upset victory over Cuomo
as evidence that the public was angry with the state's condition.
He attacked a ``paid and pampered bureaucracy,'' pledging a smaller
government, new work requirements for welfare recipients and tough
criminal justice laws, including the death penalty, which Cuomo had
blocked. He returned briefly to these issues Friday when he noted
that he had followed through on his promises.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the speech was not the only difference. The
inauguration this year was short and restrained, with none of the
exuberance of 1995, when the Republicans held a weekend of parties
to celebrate winning the governor's mansion for the first time in
24 years. About 2,100 people attended the swearing in Friday, down
from 13,000 in 1995.

EDITORIAL: CUSTOMERS IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Jan. 2:
</P>
<P>
   Online shopping jumped dramatically this holiday season, and
when preliminary estimates indicated that 1998 Christmas sales more
than tripled the previous year's figures, investors flocked to buy
shares in Internet retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices _ fueled by dreams of mass marketing online _
soared even though actual sales on the Internet are still tiny
compared with sales in the bricks-and-mortar world. Even a tripling
of sales is not terribly surprising given how limited online
retailing has been.
</P>
<P>
   One extremely optimistic forecast pegs total Internet-based
retail sales in 1998 at about $13 billion, a trivial amount when
compared with $2.6 trillion in annual retail sales in the United
States, and a fraction of the $118 billion transacted annually in
Wal-Mart stores alone. It may be several years before e-tailing
comes close to the volume of sales done through mail-order
catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   But growth in e-commerce is certain, and even traditional
retailers sense they cannot ignore the Internet for long. Next
year, some of their customers might just decide to stay home and
click on that little shopping-cart icon. Speed and convenience are
the obvious lures _ no more waiting in the checkout line or on hold
for a customer service agent to take your catalog order (though
back orders can be a big problem in cyberspace, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, though, some surveys suggest that traditional
retailers may be best positioned to take advantage of online growth
if they are nimble. Companies with stores, catalogs and Web sites _
multichannel retailers _ account for nearly 60 percent of all
Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that many customers will research products online,
then phone in their orders or even visit the store. Fears about
sending a credit-card number over the Internet may be a factor. But
a lot of consumers obviously think that talking to a sales clerk is
an indispensable part of the hassle. At least for now, most of them
prefer a live human to an electronic mouse.

FLUTIE AND DOLPHINS SPARRING BEFORE PLAYOFF BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This weekend the American Football Conference playoffs are about
quarterbacks: who will play, who won't play and who should have
kept his mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Bills play the Dolphins in Miami in the early game
Saturday, and the New England Patriots are at Jacksonville on
Sunday. That matchup is the one the National Football League
probably did not expect.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will be without three-time Pro Bowler Drew Bledsoe
because his finger that was fractured six weeks ago has not healed.
So instead of having Bledsoe, the sixth-rated quarterback in the
conference, New England will go with Scott Zolak, making his first
playoff start in eight pro seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of knew what was going to happen,'' Zolak said, ``but
as far as the mindset of the team, they know who the quarterback is
and that's what we're going to rally around.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing against Zolak, but Bledsoe's absence is a terrible blow
for the Patriots, who might not be able to exploit a mediocre
Jaguar defense. Jacksonville will probably stack the line of
scrimmage with seven or eight men for much of the game, trying to
stop the rookie running back Robert Edwards and daring Zolak to
beat them.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars have their own problems at quarterback. Mark Brunell
has practiced all week despite a troubling high ankle sprain and
will probably start. The question is: how long will Brunell be able
to go?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll watch him closely as the game goes on,'' said Coach Tom
Coughlin.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of attention for the Miami-Buffalo game will also be
on the quarterbacks. The ``S'' word _ as in short, as in 5 feet 9
inches tall _ has come up again in relation to Buffalo's Doug
Flutie, perhaps the best story in the league this year.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie and Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson do not have a lot of love
for each other because Flutie feels that Johnson has taken some
cheap shots at him over the years regarding his height. Now
Dolphins cornerback Sam Madison has poked fun at Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie this week said there was no way Miami cornerbacks could
cover Buffalo's wide receivers, in particular Eric Moulds, who has
been explosive this season.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie also said Madison and the other starting corner, Terrell
Buckley, do a lot of clutching and grabbing while in coverage but
are rarely called for pass interference. The Dolphins have the
sixth-ranked pass defense, and Madison and Buckley combined have 16
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, Flutie's words were posted on a bulletin
board in Miami's locker room. Madison seemed particularly perturbed
by the assertion that Miami defensive backs could not cover Buffalo
receivers with single coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's 5-foot-5 and can't see over the line unless he
scrambles, that does make me mad for him to say something like
that,'' Madison said. ``That really touched a nerve with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to get him out of the pocket,'' Madison added,
``because he's too short to see over the defensive line. We're
going to be ready for that and get him on the ground and shove some
Flutie Flakes down his throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie did not back down from his comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just having fun with the guys,'' he said. ``I feel we
have talented receivers and, I mean, you always look in your reads
to go to the guy, try to find the guy that is matched up one-on-one
who doesn't have help over the top, who doesn't have inside help,
you try to find those matchups. And I feel very confident that we
have quality receivers and they can get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie was asked if he realized that his comments would probably
irk the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, are they going to play harder?'' Flutie responded. ``I
think if that makes someone play harder, then why didn't they play
that way last week or the week before? It is playoff time. I hope
you can play as hard as you can possibly play.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley was amused by Madison's anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks at it as an insult, but being a veteran, I'm going to
wait until I get out there Saturday,'' Buckley said. ``You don't
want to spend your energy getting mad now, or you might be tired by
the time the game begins.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami quarterback Dan Marino has stayed out of the fray because
he has more important things to worry about, like beating the Bills
in the postseason. Marino is 0-3 against Buffalo in the playoffs,
and it's easy to understand by the numbers. Marino has completed
only 49.4 percent of his passes against the Bills in the playoffs
and has a quarterback rating of 64.1. He has also thrown for six
touchdowns and has had seven interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Marino has struggled is because the all-pro defensive
end Bruce Smith gets fired up to play him and does well against the
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wouldn't be extra motivated against Marino?'' Smith said.
``He's a great player.''

FOREMAN SAYS HIS JAN. 23 BOUT WITH HOLMES IS OFF
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Foreman is pulling the plug on his Jan. 23 bout against
Larry Holmes. According to Roy Foreman, the former heavyweight
champion's brother, the promoter Roger Leavitt could not secure
financing in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   The fight between the aging heavyweights had been in trouble for
some time.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Foreman told The Associated Press Friday that he had
received a call from his brother telling him that the fight was
off. Leavitt was supposed to give letters of credit to both
fighters last week, but did not. He said that he had lost one of
the major financial backers for the fight and needed more time to
find another one. The fighters gave Leavitt another week to come up
with the letters of credit, which he was supposed to provide them
on Thursday. He did not.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt has already given George Foreman a $1 million advance on
his $10 million purse and has given the 49-year-old Holmes $400,000
of his $4 million purse. Those deposits are nonrefundable.
</P>
<P>
   The fight was planned to coincide with Foreman's 50th birthday
and was supposed to be held in Foreman's hometown, Houston, at the
Astrodome. It was also supposed to be broadcast on pay per view by
Viewer's Choice. However, once Mike Tyson regained his boxing
license after having been suspended for biting Evander Holyfield
during their 1997 bout and chose Jan. 16 as his comeback date,
Foreman-Holmes became a dicey proposition.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely that another promoter will step in to save the
fight, because of the large purses that each fighter has been
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman (76-5) became the oldest heavyweight champion when he
regained the World Boxing Association title at age 45 by knocking
out Michael Moorer in 1994. In his last fight, Foreman lost a
controversial split decision to Shannon Briggs in 1997. Holmes'
record is 66-6.

EDITORIAL: CURIOUS RULINGS ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 2:
</P>
<P>
   In a sound ruling last week, New York state's highest court
struck down most of the plea-bargaining provisions of the state's
four-year-old death penalty statute. These provisions, the Court of
Appeals found, unconstitutionally penalized defendants in capital
cases for exercising their Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a portion of the statute that specifically
prohibited the death penalty whenever the defendant in a capital
case reached a plea agreement. That gave New York the dubious
distinction of being the only death penalty state with a law that
encouraged defendants to plead guilty rather than risk a death
sentence by going to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling will not necessarily block plea negotiations. The
main immediate impact will be to push those negotiations into the
early phase of the case, before the prosecution files notice of its
intention to seek the death penalty. That makes all the more
troubling the court's other death-penalty-related action last week,
slashing the compensation for assigned counsel in capital cases,
with the deepest cuts reserved for work done in the pre-death
notice phase.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the lead counsel in capital cases will be paid $100
an hour before the prosecution decides to seek the death penalty,
compared with $175 now. Assisting lawyers will also be paid
considerably less.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Judith Kaye and her colleagues may have succumbed to
death penalty politics. Gov. George Pataki has called the original
fees ``exorbitant.'' But the court should have been more concerned
by the warnings of New York bar leaders that the new fee schedule
could make it difficult to attract qualified counsel. This has
happened in other death penalty states that have skimped on fees.
The capital case fees that offended the governor were lower than
the fees the state regularly pays private lawyers for work on bond
issues and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the ruling was curious. Just a few days after a
constitutional ruling elevating the importance of early work in a
capital case, the court chose to pay lawyers less for doing that
work.

JAPAN: BRACING FOR ANOTHER YEAR OF RECKONING, AMID SIGNS OF CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Monday, Jan. 4) 
(bl) 
By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ When economists and investment strategists in Japan talk
about the country's prospects for this year, even those who
classify themselves as optimists predict horrendous times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year will be the worst recession since the war,'' said
Tadashi Nakamae, one of the nation's most respected economists.
``The economic situation will be disastrous.'' Despite this bleak
prognosis, Nakamae said, ``I'm more optimistic for the future of
Japan than I was a year ago _ really I am.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others base their visions on higher unemployment, record
bankruptcy rates, declining capital investment and shrinking
consumer spending. They say Japan's recession, its worst since the
end of World War II, will deepen this year, forcing the government
to bend to the will of the markets.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one important caveat: They said the same thing last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years we've said things are getting worse and that they
would be forced to accept change,'' said Ronald Bevacqua, an
economist at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. ``It hasn't happened, and
without some external jolt to make it happen, I don't think it
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is an air of desperation in the government's
latest efforts to spur growth, moves that critics say must be
accompanied by an overhaul of the world's second-largest economy to
be effective.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the government has spent more than $800 billion over the
last eight years in largely futile efforts to bolster the economy
and has dropped interest rates to just above zero. Its latest
package, in November, had nearly $200 billion worth of tax cuts,
loans, investment projects and other economic stimulants to be
introduced this year.
</P>
<P>
   The government also plans to issue shopping vouchers in the
spring in hopes of reversing the slide in consumer spending, a
program even the most cash-strapped consumer regards as silly.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank is keeping much of the nation afloat by buying
commercial paper, and it may have to start buying corporate bonds
because banks and investors are avoiding longer-term instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Many financial analysts worry about Parliament's recent decision
to order the Japan Development Bank, a government-backed lending
institution whose original mandate was to help companies with
capital investments, to bail out big corporations that cannot
refinance their debts and have neither the cash flow nor the
borrowing capacity to fully cover their expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has nine fingers in the holes in the bottom of
the ship, and the 10th is about to plug another one,'' said Kathy
Matsui, chief strategist at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the ruling party was plugging away again, floating a
plan for the government to buy up 10 percent of the stock market in
an effort to revive it.
</P>
<P>
   The fancy finger work is aimed at ameliorating the symptoms of
Japan's economic crisis rather than its causes, say many
economists. The economy is still burdened by excess capacity,
increasing levels of household debt, rising unemployment and
severely constrained credit, and many analysts are wondering how
sincere the government is about changing the nation's debt-laden
financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, Bevacqua is predicting a slight improvement in the
gross domestic product, saying it will decline by 1.7 percent in
the fiscal year that begins April 1, compared with a 2.2 percent
decline in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Nakamae predicts that the gross domestic product will decline 5
percent this fiscal year, versus a 3 percent decline in the last
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   He expects corporate sales to fall an average of 10 percent this
year, causing 90 percent of Japanese companies to lose money,
compared with some 70 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The government is less pessimistic, though its initial
projections are regarded as little more than an attempt by the
ruling party to advance its cause in wrangling over the budget for
the next fiscal year. The Ministry of Trade and Industry predicts
that the economy will grow at a real rate of 1 percent, though the
Economic Planning Agency is more circumspect. It predicts growth of
0.5 percent next year _ and if past history is any guide, the
agency will grow even less hopeful as the year progresses.
</P>
<P>
   For Nakamae, the current gloom provides reason for cheer because
it suggests a shift is afoot. ``Japan is changing so rapidly,'' he
said. ``The conventional wisdom 12 months ago is no longer valid.''
</P>
<P>
   He points to the difficulty that bureaucrats leaving the
Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan are having in finding
jobs. In the past, corporations and banks kept cushy posts waiting
for such officials in a time-honored process called amakudari, or
the descent from heaven. Now those officials are lucky to find a
position at a university.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies are losing money, and profits are shrinking at
those that are not. The decline in capital investment and the
rising unemployment rate, trends that were once as alien to Japan
as wearing shoes in the house, suggest that corporate Japan is
embarking on a long-awaited restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, corporations like Hitachi and Toshiba have begun to cut
costs and emphasize profitability rather than focus on expanding
sales and market share, the traditional preoccupation of Japanese
management.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan Motor Co., one of the most visibly troubled of Japan's
major companies, is working feverishly to pare down its balance
sheet, selling its headquarters building and reducing its stakes in
various affiliates not directly related to its core business of
making autos.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Tokyu Department Store chain closed one of its
stores in downtown Tokyo, the first time a major retailing company
has moved in a definitive way to address the issue of overcapacity.
</P>
<P>
   In the financial sector, both Sanwa Bank and Sumitomo Bank have
taken steps to overhaul their extensive branch networks so that
some branches specialize in retail banking and some in lending to
small and midsize businesses, rather than offering soup-to-nuts
service in all branches.
</P>
<P>
   They and other banks have been grudgingly selling off properties
and closing overseas branches in an effort to raise money and pare
costs.
</P>
<P>
   No company has announced major layoffs, but almost everyone here
has at least one neighbor whose benefits have been reduced. And
Hitachi, Toshiba and other corporations have announced work force
reductions, to be achieved through attrition, that seem like a drop
in the bucket compared with those announced recently by U.S.
companies but that are significant in a country where lifetime
employment is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unemployment is going to be one of the biggest catalysts
behind change here, and it's picking up,'' Ms. Matsui of Goldman
Sachs said.

OUTDOORS: RIDING HORSEBACK IN MONTANA TO FISH FOR TROUT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GREG THOMAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAILEY, Idaho _ With temperatures seasonably wintry out here, it
seems as good a time as any to unhook and release a fish story
about a particularly satisfying adventure in Montana trout country.
At the least, it will help address my cabin fever.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer I ventured on horseback into the
grizzly-bear-riddled Bob Marshall Wilderness in northwest Montana
with Jack and Karen Hooker, who run Whitetail Outfitters in the
village of Ovando. I wanted to concentrate on the Bob Marshall
Wilderness trout, cutthroats that range up to 20 inches and seem
particularly eager to inhale any dry fly cast in their direction.
</P>
<P>
   But my horse, Snip, didn't help matters. Snip shook my saddle
bag loose during the first two miles of trail riding. I dismounted,
shored up loose ties and found myself displaced to the back of the
pack.
</P>
<P>
   Late on the second day of our five-day trip, with my buttocks
feeling saddle sore and screaming revolt, we reached Basin Creek,
which drains into the South Fork Flathead River. There, I found
myself wading knee-deep in crystal-clear water on one of the most
remote fly-fishing waters in North America, 32 miles deep in the
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Basin Creek and the South Fork Flathead's waters are a mix of
long, shallow runs highlighted by deep, alluring pools. The water
takes on an aqua-green color and shimmers beautifully in the
morning and evening light.
</P>
<P>
   Peering into the clear currents, you can spot trout finning at
the bottom in 10-foot-deep pools, hovering above the rocks as if
suspended in space. Most of those fish have never seen an
artificial fly and likely never will.
</P>
<P>
   Trout aren't the only attraction. Lots of bears, both blacks and
grizzlies, feed along the river's gravel bars. Elk, moose, mountain
goats and even some bighorn sheep feed on the higher slopes. Mule
deer, nearly as tame as a dog or cat, wander into camp in the
mornings and evenings, feeding on lush green meadow grass.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the South Fork Flathead and to view its varied
wildlife, an angler has two options: hike in on foot, under full
burden of a heavy backpack, or ride on the back of a horse with a
packstring along to carry food and gear. My suggestion, having
hiked into wilderness areas in the past, losing gallons of sweat in
the process, is this: take the horse.
</P>
<P>
   Each day during our rides, which ranged from 8 to 18 miles, we
wandered through dense stands of lodgepole pine trees, ancient,
old-growth forests that held a cathedral quality. In the afternoons
we lounged in wonderful little glades and meadows, eating our
lunch, bartering with each other for extra candy bars, soaking in
the healing summer sun, wandering to small, spring-fed streams that
run as clear and tasty as any water in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Life was laid-back and I loved it, but it was the fish that I
was after. And I found them.
</P>
<P>
   The fishing was easy; when I placed a dry fly over any of the
deep pools, little, eager cutthroats would fire up from the bottom
to inhale any offering without inspection. After pursuing trout on
challenging tailwaters and spring creeks for 11 years, those
wilderness trout were a welcome treat. During the trip, I caught
numerous native west-slope cutthroat on large, bushy dry flies that
floated like corks.
</P>
<P>
   One particular evening, on Basin Creek, I wandered away from our
group and found the mother of all trout holes. The surface was
covered with small olive mayflies and it was frothing with rising
fish.
</P>
<P>
   From that hole, in maybe an hour, I caught about 20 trout, most
rating 9 inches, with a couple of monsters that stretched 16 inches
or more. Each native cutthroat was beautiful, their bellies the
color of orange peels, their gill plates splashed a rosy red, and
their chins streaked with the red slashes from which they gain
their name.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone want to fish for anything else? Could a man
survive a winter in the wilderness? I was about ready to answer
that question when rain started pelting my face. Instead of braving
the weather, I returned to camp, where a savory slab of chicken,
along with peas, hot rolls and peach cobbler, waited.
</P>
<P>
   Don't hike! Take the horse!
</P>
<P>
   While fishing the South Fork Flathead and its tributary streams
was memorable, if not truly outstanding, perhaps the best part of
the trip was listening to Jack Hooker's stories. If you had been
nestled around the Danaher Valley horse camp last August, staring
contentedly into a large bonfire, you would have heard, among other
entertaining and unedited narratives, many tales about grizzly
bears.
</P>
<P>
   That was fine, engaging conversation for most of our group.
However, one member, Brad, couldn't stand it. He'd seen ``Night of
the Grizzlies'' on the big screen. He'd read gruesome tales about
grizzlies pulling helpless campers from their sleeping bags. His
fear of grizzlies was deeply imbedded and it showed. When Jack told
his stories, Brad's eyes opened proportionately wider and his jaw
dropped lower, his skin turning paler with each word. By the end of
the trip, a crackle from the bonfire might send Brad dashing for
the nearest tree.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of our scheduled pack trip, we loaded horses one
final time and wandered away from the South Fork Flathead and its
cutthroat trout.
</P>
<P>
   Then and there, I decided to extend my stay and enjoy an extra
night in the wilderness on one of western Montana's most remarkable
rivers. &QL;

MUCKLER GETS TOUGH OVER TOUGH GUYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Colo.)  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Late last season, shortly after he became coach of
the Rangers, John Muckler ignited a shouting match with coach Mike
Milbury of the Islanders after Milbury called a timeout with a big
lead late in a game. The confrontation took place with both men
behind their respective benches. Late Thursday night, Muckler
verbally confronted another counterpart, Bob Hartley, the rookie
coach of the Colorado Avalanche. It happened as both teams and
their coaches crossed the ice after the final buzzer in a 6-3
Rangers victory.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler was angry that Hartley played Scott Parker and Jeff
Odgers, two of his tough guys, against Wayne Gretzky's line late in
the game. ``It was a minor-league move,'' Muckler said of Hartley's
choice of personnel. ``I just took it as a cheap shot, which it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler said Parker made gratuitous contact with Gretzky, who
had two assists. Asked if he had punched Hartley, Muckler said he
had not. But the two appeared to come very close to physical
contact before players and officials got between them.
</P>
<P>
   Hartley at first joked that Muckler was wishing him a happy new
year. In a more serious vein, Hartley said he had been trying to
give ice time to some players who rarely get it. Earlier in the
game, Parker had fought Darren Langdon of the Rangers and Odgers
had fought Rumun Ndur of the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why double-shift Petr Forsberg instead of giving a kid some
time?'' Hartley said, referring to his best player.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Brown, a spokesman for the National Hockey League, said
the league had nothing to announce regarding the incident and that
he did not know as of late Friday if it would be investigated by
league headquarters. Speaking in general terms, Brown said that
some incidents of this nature are penalized through fines, not
suspensions, and that the fines are not announced.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the second for the Rangers in three games of a
four-game road trip that began in Carolina last Saturday and will
end on Saturday night with a visit to the Blues, weather
permitting. The Rangers traveled here Friday from Denver and the
Blues were coming from Nashville, Tenn., despite daunting weather
conditions. Snow, fog, sleet and freezing rain caused many flights
to St. Louis to be canceled. The Rangers arrived several hours late
and called off plans to practice here in the late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The scorers for the Rangers on Thursday were Mike Knuble,
Mathieu Schneider, Petr Nedved, Marc Savard, John MacLean and Adam
Graves. Schneider, Nedved and Graves scored on the power play, and
Nedved's came with a two-man advantage. Each team scored on its
first shot of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler juggled his lines somewhat, switching the centers Savard
and Gretzky. Savard skated with MacLean and Kevin Stevens, while
Gretzky was between Graves and Todd Harvey. Several Rangers said
they were bolstered by a morning meeting at which Muckler and the
team captain, Brian Leetch, spoke out.
</P>
<P>
   Graves, who leads the Rangers with 16 goals, said: ``Obviously
there were some things to be said, and Brian hit the nail on the
butt. When he speaks, everyone listens, because it comes not only
with intelligence, but from the heart. He was right on the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky called the meeting ``positive and kind of upbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider said, ``We talked about relaxing and trying to be more
creative and not worrying about making mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Richter, who returned as starting goalie after Dan Cloutier
filled in for him in Phoenix, said Muckler's words also were
important. ``With all the traveling and a lot of fatigue, it's easy
to get off track,'' Richter said. ``Your mind can wander. Muck is
very good about reminding us that every game is critical. If you
don't say it right, it can end up falling on deaf ears, but Muck
keeps the attention of the players. He lets you know what he
expects and what's going to happen if it doesn't take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler said he was concerned about the team's ``fragile''
confidence after it lost 3-1 in Phoenix on Wednesday night. ``We
had an exceptionally good meeting,'' Muckler said. ``Some of the
players were maybe losing confidence in themselves, questioning
themselves.'' The defeat in Phoenix, Muckler said, was ``the rock
bottom,'' and he called it ``a game we could have won and should
have won.''
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, the Rangers faced a Coyotes team playing without the
forwards Jeremy Roenick and Keith Tkachuk, both of whom are
injured. In Denver, the Avalanche was without the center Joe Sakic
and the goalie Patrick Roy, both of whom were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' confidence and spirits seemed high after Thursday's
game. In the dressing room, the players watched on television and
some counted along as the screen showed the ball dropping in Times
Square to signal the new year. ``1999!'' shouted MacLean, 34 years
old, ``and I'm still playing!''
</P>
<P>
   Langdon, who is from Newfoundland, advised everyone that it had
already been a new year for 30 minutes in Newfoundland because of
its peculiar time zone, east of the East Coast. It's an avant garde
kind of place, that Newfoundland, ahead of the times.

EDITORIAL: GETTING SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION RIGHT 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 2:
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Board of Education's new report on its 1,100
schools consists of 71,000 pages of disheartening news. Conditions
are still generally poor, and in the best-case scenario they will
only be ``fair'' after five more years of intensive effort.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools are also overcrowded, and the city will not be able
to take advantage of new state aid for smaller classes and
pre-kindergarten programs unless it gets more classroom space.
</P>
<P>
   The board is thus proposing a five-year, $11 billion rebuilding
plan. Putting that package together will require help from the
city, state and national governments. One huge barrier is
dissatisfaction with the School Construction Authority's record of
delays and shoddy construction.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report on the construction authority's work on Public
School 131 in Brooklyn, where falling bricks killed a 16-year-old
girl, is disturbing. The general contractor, who failed to
construct protective sidewalk sheds or use even the most basic
safety precautions, was prequalified for the job under a system so
meaningless that no applicant was ever rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The project officer was married to the top aide to Gov. George
Pataki's appointee to the construction authority's board of
trustees. An official inquiry found that although the officer
behaved erratically and tolerated unprofessional behavior by the
workers, his supervisors rated his performance as ``good.''
</P>
<P>
   The SCA is run by three trustees, appointed by the governor,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew. Giuliani
argues that it would perform better if he had full control. The
Democrats in Albany and the teachers' union want trustees of their
own. But the last thing the construction authority needs is a
diversionary power struggle. Despite its terrible performance at PS
131, the authority may actually be figuring out how to do its job.
Milo Riverso, the latest chief executive, is getting good grades
for completing projects more quickly. The caliber of the
professional workers seems to be improving.
</P>
<P>
   What the SCA most needs is better procedures for screening
contractors and more qualified project officers with smaller work
loads. Riverso says that these are his goals. The Legislature can
help by changing the burdensome rules it has imposed on the
authority, like the requirement that much of the building design be
done in-house rather than by outside contractors. The lawmakers
must also renew the authority's exemption to the ridiculous Wicks
law, which requires separate contractors for different pieces of
each public construction project.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has asked the Legislature to transfer his power to
appoint a trustee to Giuliani, an unusual offer to relinquish
authority. The governor's eagerness to get out of the construction
authority may have something to do with the fact that there is a
disturbing amount of evidence connecting the PS 131 tragedy to the
patronage needs of members of the Conservative Party, with which
the governor is aligned. But rather than changing the law, Pataki
can cede his powers simply by appointing a new trustee of
Giuliani's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Giuliani will have controlling authority, since he
can count on Crew. This page has supported his argument that
government works best when there are clear lines of responsibility.
His task now is to grasp those lines, tell the Legislature and
public what practical internal changes the SCA needs to operate
efficiently, and then direct his attention to making sure it has
the resources and the will to do things right.

A BACKUP SOARS WITH AN EGO AS BIG AS THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ It is the red hair shorn close that earned him
the nickname Rooster. But a cocky strut was there long before
Marcus Outzen wandered onto the field during Florida State's 10th
game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It was there last spring when the quarterback, bummed that his
name was listed near the bottom of the Seminoles' depth chart,
busted into Bobby Bowden's office for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   He was a red-shirt sophomore, an option quarterback in high
school, whom Bowden brought to Tallahassee, frankly, to be a
backup. The kid was talking transfer. The coach was taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen was neither a super talent, nor had he waited his turn as
better Seminole quarterbacks had done in the past. The coach
conceded that yes, Dan Kendra and Chris Weinke, were ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I told him to stay around, to give spring practice his
best effort. Then, we'll talk transfer. You never know what's going
to happen,'' Bowden told him.
</P>
<P>
   What happened was Kendra injured his knee out in Florida State's
spring game, underwent surgery and ceded the job to Weinke. While
Weinke, a 26-year-old former baseball minor-leaguer, ran off an 8-1
record, Outzen watched as his backup. When Weinke suffered a
herniated disk in his neck in the first half against Virginia, the
20-year-old Outzen suddenly became the most unlikely quarterback to
play for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   He will lead No. 2 Florida State (11-1) against top-ranked
Tennessee (12-0) here Monday night at the Fiesta Bowl. He has gone
from third-team to title dream only eight months after having
enough cheek to challenge a coach who won the national championship
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't used to sitting on the bench. No one here is used to
sitting on the bench,'' Outzen said, not seeing anything at all
wrong with the tete-a-tete between him and Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the realist, Bowden says he is worried. He lost six years,
10 starts and a howitzer for an arm at quarterback when Weinke went
down. The kid he convinced to stay around? He has completed 36
passes and started two games, but besides liking Outzen's
``swagger,'' Bowden says, dadgummit, he doesn't know what he has
behind center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a blue-collar quarterback,'' said Bowden, comparing him
to former National Football League yeomen Billy Kilmer and Joe
Kapp. ``His ball wobbles. It flutters, but it gets there.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback, however, is not worried. For Christmas, he
bought his father, Eric, the Fiesta Bowl poster, which declared
Tennessee and Florida State were playing for the inaugural Bowl
Championship Series national championship. He promised him he was
going to win it. He knows there is little on his abbreviated
resume, but he tries to crow about what he can.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen is a business communications major who is bright enough
to accumulate a 3.4 grade-point average, the highest on the team,
and he is astute enough to hone his message. He likes talking about
the Florida game, only his second career start and it was against
the Seminoles' most-hated rival. He was 13 of 22 for 167 passing
yards and threw his first collegiate touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, nothing against Tennessee, but down where we are in
Florida, playing the Gators is a championship in itself. I went
into it with the goal of staying calm, and I did,'' he said of the
17 unanswered points he engineered to beat Florida, 23-12, a feat
more remarkable because he had two first-half fumbles, one in the
end zone for a safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I've had a whole month or practicing with the first
team,'' Outzen said. ``Our game plan is broader. Never in a million
years did I think that I'd be in a game like this. But anyone would
be wrong to believe I don't know what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   His all-American wide receiver, Peter Warrick, believes in the
Rooster. Back in the summer, Weinke organized throwing drills for
the quarterbacks and receivers. Warrick says a different Outzen was
there each day. ``He was more quiet. Just there putting his work
in,'' Warrick said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the second half of the Florida game that the
receiver saw what he believes was the birth of a championship
quarterback. Outzen had just picked up a third and long on a
hard-nosed scramble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got nailed, really hit and he came back to the huddle
pumped up and yelled `Come on, fellas, let's go down and . . .' you
know,'' Warrick said, letting a smile tip off his quarterback's
colorful language, ``he said something real fired up. It was
something Chris would have done. And from then on, I knew we'd be
all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden might have thought he was getting a future backup when
Outzen came out of Fort Walton Beach (Fla.) High School, but Mickey
Andrews, the Seminoles' defensive coordinator who recruited him,
knew better. He watched Outzen, 6 feet 2 inches and 220 pounds, run
the option all the way to the state championship. Outzen was quick,
overpowering and, tough enough to play on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong safety,'' Andrews said, admitting that in the back of
his mind he had hoped to convert him.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, the Seminole offense has a fledgling quarterback
leading it into the second-most important game in its history. In a
role reversal from the summer workouts, Weinke is here in the
shadows on the sidelines, his season done. His 19 touchdowns and
2,487 yards started Florida State's title run. How does he feel
about Outzen finishing it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here as a supporter. He knows I'm five yards behind him
every day to help him with any questions he has,'' Weinke said.
</P>
<P>
   Has Outzen asked any? The fallen quarterback smiles sheepishly.
``Not one,'' Weinke said. ``He's a really confident guy.''  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shortly after 9 a.m., Pamela Carlo arrived at the
tiny, nondescript clinic in Chinatown for her daily deliverance. It
was a cool day, with a packed gray sky. The tang of fish was in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   She displayed her ID card at the check-in window, consulted the
blackboard to see who had to give a urine sample (she didn't), then
waited on the scuffed linoleum floor until her name finally
crackled over the loudspeaker.
</P>
<P>
   At one of four dispensing windows, a nurse proffered a plastic
cup partly filled with the reddish liquid known as methadone. The
nurse was required to watch her drink it. Ms. Carlo diluted it with
water to mask the taste and swallowed it in three gulps, grimacing
and stamping her right foot. ``Oh, that's evil,'' she howled. ``It
never tastes any better.''
</P>
<P>
   The nurses ask patients to say something, to insure they aren't
``slagging,'' stowing the liquid in their mouths so they can sell
it on the street. One man used to conceal a plastic bag in the hood
of his sweatshirt; he would raise his cup past his ear and pour the
methadone in. The nurses trust Ms. Carlo; in any event, she is
rarely quiet for two seconds. ``OK,'' she said. ``That's that.''
</P>
<P>
   Days on methadone begin like this _ this ordered, schoolmarmish
protocol at the clinic window. The grinding privations of life on
methadone are why the former heroin addicts who take it speak of
being ``tied by a rope'' or ``on permanent parole.'' They love the
drug, and they hate it _ for the vise grip of its rules, and for
its vise grip on them.
</P>
<P>
   Methadone is a wizard at blocking the yearning for heroin, but
much less so the simple craving to get high. It is highly
addictive, with fiendish withdrawal symptoms. At more than moderate
doses, it can leave some patients in a barely functional daze.
</P>
<P>
   All of which helps to explain why methadone has long been caught
in the crosscurrents of social policy, though never more so than
right now in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, methadone has become the favored treatment for
heroin addiction, and the federal government has lately pledged to
make it more accessible. That view was endorsed by a recent report
in The Journal of the American Medical Association, which said,
among other things, that methadone can help curb crime and reduce
the spread of infectious diseases like AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, on the other hand, has declared his
desire to eliminate methadone-maintenance programs in New York and
instead wean patients quickly to abstinence, though it is unclear
how much power he has to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Like others scornful of methadone, the mayor feels that addicts
too weak to confront the pathology of their past are simply
shedding an illegal habit for a legal one. Indeed, to many people
in mainstream society, there is something unsavory and almost
contemptible about methadone. But, in truth, few people uninvolved
with methadone know much about it. And then there are the patients,
for whom methadone is virtually an occupation.
</P>
<P>
   In the community of methadone users (population 115,000
nationwide, 36,000 in New York City, according to federal and state
officials), there is a continuum of dependence. On this day in the
autumn of 1998, Pam Carlo occupied the vast middle; methadone
allowed her to work on and off, but the employees at the clinic
doubted she would ever leave it behind.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Griffin, a fellow patient, was almost weaned from
methadone; she could already taste life on the other side. Jamil
Muhammad continued to abuse drugs; he was what the clinic workers
call a ``resistant'' patient, who requires great effort but gives
little in return.

LONGHORNS' DEFENSE MEETS ITS GOALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mississippi State coach Jackie Sherrill said he felt
his team needed to score at least 28 points to keep up with the
high-powered Texas offense in the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs didn't come close.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Texas defense proved just as significant as Ricky
Williams' running and Major Applewhite's passing in the Longhorns'
38-11 victory against the Bulldogs yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they expected our defense to be as tough as it
was,'' Texas linebacker Dusty Renfro said. ``All week long we had
to listen to how good their offense was and how good their defense
was. We knew we had to outplay their defense and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   For extra inspiration, Renfro wore No. 60 yesterday instead of
his usual 46. The switch was in honor of Mike Campbell, the former
assistant under Darrell Royal who designed the defenses that helped
the Longhorns win national championships in 1963 and 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell died in June, and Renfro wanted the spirit of those
great defenses to carry the Longhorns yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we accomplished that,'' Renfro said.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Aaron Babino, who was named the defensive player of
the game, said, ``Our goal was to shut them down under 17 points,
and we did that. We just got out there and got after them.''
</P>
<P>
   Babino, who stepped into the Longhorns' starting lineup late in
the season when Anthony Hicks went down with a knee injury, led the
Longhorns with nine tackles, including three for losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns, using a variety of blitzes, held the Bulldogs to
87 yards rushing while Mississippi State quarterbacks Wayne Madkin
and Matt Wyatt were a combined 16-for-40 passing for 205 yards.
They were sacked three times, and Madkin threw an interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept pounding and pounding and pounding,'' Babino
said. ``We knew eventually they would give up.''
</P>
<P>
   The defensive performance was the latest indication of the
improvement the Longhorns have shown since giving up 49 points to
UCLA and 48 to Kansas State on consecutive Saturdays in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the season we were using a new defense, and there
were new things we had to adjust to,'' Babino said. ``One or two
people would blow an assignment on every play, and you can't have
that. We corrected that because the coaches stressed guys who make
mistakes wouldn't play. Now we have our assignments down, and
things are working out.''
</P>
<P>
   They've worked out to the point where the Longhorns believe
their defense will be a significant factor in a serious challenge
for a national title next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it,'' Babino said. ``I feel with our defense,
next year we'll be able to compete with anybody.''

IN AUSTRALIA, A TRIBUTE TO LOST SAILORS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOBART, Australia _ A thousand yachtsmen and an estimated 4,000
more visitors and summer tourists gathered here at Constitution
Dock Friday afternoon to pray for those affected so traumatically
when a fierce storm ripped apart the fleet in the 54th
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race.
</P>
<P>
   As the families and fellow crew members of the six lost sailors
cast a red rose and a bed of daisies into the still waters, the
muted bells of St. David's Cathedral tolled their own tribute, and
many wept as they remembered other seamen who had perished in
previous storms.
</P>
<P>
   For 54 years, Constitution Dock in this capital city of the
island state of Tasmania has been a haven and temporary home for
thousands of yachtsmen and women who have competed in the annual
ocean race.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, with a gentle sea breeze blowing up the Derwent River on
a warm and sunny afternoon, Monsignor Phillip Green, chaplain of
the Royal Yacht Club of Tasmania, delivered the ``Yachties
Farewell.'' It was not only a paean to the lost sailors _ the
British Olympic Star Class sailor Glyn Charles from the Sword of
Orion; Bruce Guy and Phil Skeggs on Business Post Naiad; and Jim
Lawler, Mike Bannister and John Dean, swept off the veteran cutter
Winston Churchill _ but to the enduring affection between Hobart
and the sport of yacht racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We who live by the sea and depend on it,'' said Green,
speaking from a table draped by a green and gold sail, ``know, like
the yachties, its beauty, but also its power.''
</P>
<P>
   In a eulogy, Commodore Hugo van Kretschmar of the Cruising Yacht
Club of Australia, the club that has organized and conducted the
Sydney-to-Hobart race every Christmas since 1945, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We will miss you; we will remember you always; we will learn
from the tragic circumstances of your passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``May the everlasting voyage you have now embarked on be blessed
with calm seas and gentle breezes. May you never have to reef or
change a headsail in the night. May your bunk always be warm and
dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the international fleet of 115 yachts that set sail from
Sydney Dec. 26, only 44 completed the 725-mile course. Seventy-one
boats retired, many seeking shelter before encountering the worst
of the storm. Seven yachts were abandoned, and 55 sailors were
saved in the largest search-and-rescue operation in the history of
an Australian ocean yacht race.

   INDEPENDENT OIL COMPANIES SUFFER DURING WEAK MARKET
</P>
<P>
   Independent oil producers in the United States and the small
companies that provide services to them have been hurt by low
prices and foreign competition more than giants such as Exxon and
Mobil have. Enshrined in fable for his enterprise and daring, the
oilman in jeans and boots is giving way to the oilman in a suit.
</P>
<P>
   Except for huge oilfields far offshore or in Alaska's wilds,
major oil companies consider most of the United States too
expensive or played out to bother with.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, the contract drillers and oil-service
companies, which do everything from making drill bits to flying the
helicopters used to transport offshore workers, are expected to
post their second consecutive quarter of falling earnings. As oil
prices languish at the lowest levels in more than a decade,
contractors are taking rigs out of service as rents slide.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA READIES DEBT PLAN
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government will soon announce how it plans to cover
the debts of the nation's second-biggest financial company, which
it closed in October, and the news for foreign bankers is likely to
be bad. China closed the financial arm of the company, Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corp., because it could not
repay more than $2 billion of foreign debt. All told, GITIC, as the
company is known, owes an estimated $10 billion to foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
   PREPARING FOR EURO'S MARKET DEBUT
</P>
<P>
   One day after 11 European countries christened the euro as their
new currency, financial institutions across the Continent began the
enormous job of reprogramming their electronic networks before
markets reopened for business Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   SURGE IN HONG KONG REAL ESTATE
</P>
<P>
   People in Hong Kong, from first-time buyers to the big
development companies, have been trying to decide whether the
strong housing sales of November were a sign that the worst
recession in a generation was nearly over, or whether the market
only found a false bottom and would continue to drop if the economy
kept contracting. Sales have been driven, in part, by falling
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   INSURERS EXPECT SMALL GAINS
</P>
<P>
   The nation's property and casualty insurers are expected to
report slim profit gains for the fourth quarter because competition
has kept a lid on premiums. The group, including Allstate, CNA
Financial and St. Paul Cos., is expected to report an average
earnings increase of only 1 percent for the quarter, far below the
28 percent gain for all of 1997.

LACK OF PASSING GAME SPELLED TROUBLE FOR MISSISSIPPI STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mississippi State running back James Johnson gave his
team 105 yards in the first half, and he provided some hope for a
Bulldogs rally yesterday in the Southwestern Bell Cotton Bowl
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   When the Texas defense figured out how to stop him however,
Mississippi State's day was over, 38-11.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had 1 yard in the third quarter, and his team was forced
to throw in an attempt to trim a 35-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
   After a first half of outgaining Texas running back Ricky
Williams, Johnson could only watch as Williams got stronger en
route to 203 yards rushing, 45 yards receiving and one Heisman
Trophy pose.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson finished with 22 carries and 112 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half, you look at Ricky and you look at James,
you saw two very good backs on the field,'' Mississippi State coach
Jackie Sherrill said. ``In the first half, we did quite well at
certain things. But when you're not throwing the football, you're
not going to run it as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the performance by Johnson in the first half, the
Bulldogs dug a 14-3 hole.
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill pulled starting quarterback Wayne Madkin late in the
second quarter after the redshirt freshman went 3 of 12 with one
interception and 29 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Madkin was back in to start the third quarter, but the offensive
troubles grew.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State's first two drives of the second half went
three plays and a punt. The Bulldogs' third possession included two
sacks and a punt after only four plays.
</P>
<P>
   Texas scored three touchdowns to make it 24-3 with 6:30 left in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame it all on the passing game, but that certainly
had a lot to do with it,'' Mississippi State center Eric Allen
said. ``Texas did a good job in the third quarter of making their
reads and getting to the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Buried at their own 19-yard line in the closing seconds of the
third quarter, Mississippi State called Johnson's number on
fourth-and-1.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson ran into Texas senior linebacker Dusty Renfro behind he
line of scrimmage for a 1-yard loss. Texas put the game away, 38-3,
one play later on an 18-yard pass from Major Applewhite to Kwame
Cavil.
</P>
<P>
   Renfro was wearing No. 60 in honor of former Texas defensive
coach Mike Campbell, who died on June 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel the spirit moving through our defense,'' Renfro
said. ``We wanted to show people that Texas not only has a great
offense, but a great defense, too. We knew that running the ball is
the strength of their team. We wanted to take that away.''

INVESTORS HOPE FOR ANOTHER VIAGRA

<TEXT>
<P>
   The successful introduction last year of Pfizer Inc.'s Viagra,
the impotence pill, delivered huge returns to investors who bought
shares in the company. The windfall _ Pfizer's stock zoomed about
69 percent in the year _ has encouraged investors to study the
current pipelines of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies,
hoping to spot the next boom drug.
</P>
<P>
   They, as well as analysts, are betting that at least one of the
medications scheduled for introduction this year will also produce
impressive gains.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting the next blockbuster drug is never easy, because
pharmaceutical executives are loath to forecast the sales of their
wares. But some compounds clearly have a better chance than others
of achieving $1 billion in annual sales, the benchmark for a
blockbuster drug.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agree that top-selling drugs share two traits: They
have to be prescribed by more than one type of doctor, ideally a
general practitioner and a specialist, and treat a condition that
is sorely lacking in new remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Viagra prescribed by several types of doctors,
including urologists and psychiatrists, but it was offered in pill
form, making it a popular alternative to the invasive shots of
other impotence medications.
</P>
<P>
   That formula for a winning drug should work this year as well,
but with one major twist. Many of last year's hot new remedies _
Viagra and Detrol, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc.'s pill for incontinence
_ were so-called lifestyle drugs, designed to relieve afflictions
that damage self-esteem. This year's top-selling new medications
are expected to treat several chronic or life-threatening
conditions, including diabetes and organ-transplant rejection.
</P>
<P>
   The two most anticipated introductions this year are Monsanto
Co.'s Celebrex, which Pfizer is helping to market, and Vioxx by
Merck &AMP; Co. Both drugs will treat the pain and inflammation of
arthritis and are expected to be free of the gastrointestinal side
effects of other medications.
</P>
<P>
   This market is projected to be enormous, rivaling the $7.4
billion in anti-depressant sales. About 13,000 Americans take
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs each year, according to Merck.
Yet these drugs are not always safe; according to arthritis experts
at Stanford University, they cause 20,000 hospitalizations and
2,600 deaths each year.
</P>
<P>
   While the first product to market usually gets the largest
market share _ in this case, that will most likely be Celebrex _
both drugs are expected to record strong sales. Analysts predict
that Celebrex will have $3 billion in annual sales and Vioxx $2
billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peak sales of these drugs may not happen quickly,'' said
Neil Sweig, a pharmaceuticals analyst with Southeast Research
Partners. ``It could take four to five years after the drugs are
introduced in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   As a supplement to the search for blockbusters, and in an effort
to maintain annual earnings gains of 16 percent or more, many
pharmaceutical companies are introducing drugs for markets that
have been profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the industry's cash machines are ulcer drugs,
which can easily bring in annual sales of $1.5 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products Corp. and Johnson &AMP; Johnson are expected
to roll out their respective ulcer drugs, Protonix and Aciphex.
Even though the ulcer market already has several players, including
Astra AB's Prilosec, with $2.3 billion in annual sales, both new
entrants are expected to be very successful. Analysts expect
Protonix to bring in an annual $400 million in 2002, when Aciphex
is expected to have sales of $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   The market for diabetes drugs, which has long been competitive,
should be vicious by the end of the year. SmithKline Beecham PLC is
expected to release Avandia, a drug that may siphon sales from the
three leading medications, Glucophage by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,
Glucotrol XL by Pfizer and Warner-Lambert Co.'s Rezulin.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect that Avandia will have annual sales of $755
million and that the sum could be higher if patients decided to
switch from the leading medications.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo Wellcome PLC will introduce Ziagen to treat HIV infection.
Analysts expect the drug to have $450 million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products is set to introduce Rapamune for
organ-transplant rejection, a use that should generate some $750
million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough Corp. and Zonagen, a tiny Texas biotechnology
company, are expected to begin marketing Vasomax, a competitor to
Pfizer's Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Viagra, which analysts predict will have $1 billion in
sales during its first year on the market, Vasomax is not expected
to surpass $500 million in annual sales during its first four years
on the market. But it may usher in this year's crop of drugs to
address everything from age spots to facial hair on women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really just beginning this phase of lifestyle drugs,''
said Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta Partners, a biopharmaceutical
investment research company in New York.

TO HANDLE SNAKE, COWBOYS MUST ALSO SHINE ON OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jake Plummer deserved better. But a fair shake for the Snake
this week was apparently too much to ask, at least around here.
</P>
<P>
   In the retelling of Plummer's magical moment of November against
the Cowboys, there was once again a media memory lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Nine-Toed Deion was at cornerback that day in Tempe _ not
for the entire second half, but for the Cardinals' final two
drives. Plummer rang up nearly 150 yards passing on those two
possessions, which included one touchdown, then a journey to the
5-yard line in the waning seconds.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Kevin Smith's end-zone play is still up for loud
debate, at least in the desert precincts.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Snake's miracle rally (after Arizona was down,
28-0), came up short, Plummer's performance certainly didn't. And
it shouldn't be cheapened by inaccurate local information that Jake
did it without having to deal with Deion.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Deion also started for the Cowboys the next week
against Seattle, and in the second quarter limped off the field
looking like a guy who had just stepped on a landmine. Nine-Toed
has not been seen in action since.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, call it justice for Plummer that today's wild-card
round playoff game is against the Cowboys. There is no question he
has some unfinished business from November, and since it's now a
sudden-elimination postseason format, Plummer will cause
uncomfortable moments for the local team and the local fans at
Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer,'' a smiling Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave
Campo said, ``that the outcome doesn't depend on stopping him for
one last drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Those kind of compliments are usually reserved for an
Elway-type, but Plummer is a young quarterback with a proven resume
for manufacturing last-second victories.
</P>
<P>
   How Plummer goes today, so goes the outcome. He is the focal
point for the Cardinals, making their first playoff appearance in
16 seasons. He is obviously the focal point for the Cowboys, who
missed the playoffs last season. To a Jerry Jones, that seemed like
a 16-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom on Plummer brings us to the usual football
tune about the best defense being a dominant offense. Let there
also be no argument on that count _ the less Plummer is on the
field, the better off the Cowboys. How sensible.
</P>
<P>
   But until more evidence is available, the Cowboys' offense
cannot be trusted to provide the clock management that chains
Plummer to the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   In the entire month of December, exactly one quarter of
high-octane offense has been on display, and that was last weekend
against Washington. If that positive trend expands this afternoon,
the Cowboys will win. If not, they could still win the hard way,
meaning a stout defensive performance. In fact, the December
reading on the Cowboys shows the defense is much more likely to
give a good account today, as opposed to the offense.
</P>
<P>
   This can be said even though pressure on opposing QBs is almost
nil, containment of scramblers like Plummer doesn't exist, and
coverage of Plummer's receivers is questionable since it will not
be determined until game time whether Deion will sit yet another
one out
</P>
<P>
   But with a reworked secondary, and with Campo using the normal
assortment of smoke and mirrors, the defense shut down hot passing
games in two of the regular season's final three games _ Kansas
City and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Mathis and Kevin Smith have settled in at cornerback,
while Campo has a better assortment of nickel-coverage defenders
than the last time Plummer faced the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   It is a secondary that lives on the edge with no pass rush ``but
we now know who we are defensively,'' said Campo, ``and without
Deion we've managed to move on and establish some continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   At times against Plummer in November, the Cowboys had to use
Kenny Wheaton and Charlie Williams at the corners. Deion and Kevin
Smith were injured, and Mathis didn't suit up for the game due to a
broken arm. In the following games against Seattle and Minnesota,
the cornerback combos even included Terry Billups, from the
practice squad, being teamed with Williams, who is a safety by
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overcoming adversity is part of it,'' shrugged Campo. ``But
where we are today is much better than it was there for a while
after we lost Deion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have had limited success running the ball, and if
that holds today, then Plummer is the warhead that must be defused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like pressure, containment and coverage,'' said Campo,
``but the most important is containment. On the perimeter,
\RPlummer\S does his most damage. Given the chance to be creative,
he will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Snake-handling is a postseason must today for the Cowboys. And
they have the bite-marks from November as a reminder. /

 NEW YORK: in return. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mostly, they were simply three people who took methadone to stop
wanting heroin. They couldn't possibly untangle all the arguments
about this peculiar elixir. But they could illustrate something of
the nuanced complexities of life on methadone, of what it can do
and what it can't. As for the policy debate, each of their lives,
it turns out, holds powerful arguments for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Their weeks revolve around 46 and 62 East Broadway, the
methadone treatment units of the Lower Eastside Service Center, a
nonprofit substance abuse and mental health agency.
</P>
<P>
   One of the better regarded methadone programs, it offers a full
array of counseling and detoxification services. And yet its
aspirations are limited by the vagaries of addiction and methadone
itself, by those who continue to take other drugs and who can't
find a new life.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic would like people to achieve abstinence, but it
imposes no time limit; many patients may be on methadone forever.
The emphasis is on avoiding heroin, not graduating from methadone,
which sometimes frustrates patients who dearly hope to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Every social class is represented on methadone, but those low on
the social index are predominant. About 30 percent of Lower
Eastside's 950 clients work, and pay $2 to $56 a week for their
methadone, depending on their income.
</P>
<P>
   The others, including Ms. Carlo, Ms. Griffin and Muhammad, are
covered by Medicaid. No private insurer pays for methadone. About
65 percent of the patients are men; about 20 percent are HIV
positive. Roughly a quarter leave in the first year because they
return to other drugs, are arrested or simply vanish.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of Ms. Carlo, Ms. Griffin and Muhammad intersect on
East Broadway and then radiate in very different directions.
Methadone punctuates their days; it goes down in a gulp but seeps
slowly into everything they do. Though they are not proud they are
on it, they are persuaded of its necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society has made methadone into an evil, and that's tragic,''
Ms. Carlo said. ``If Giuliani got rid of methadone, there would be
tens of thousands of people on the street with guns in their
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Methadone's effect lingers for 24 to 36 hours, and Pam Carlo
likes to take it soon after she awakens. Most patients do. Even
before the clinic opens, there is a line outside. This is methadone
rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   At first, she senses nothing. After about a half-hour, she feels
no actual high but a sort of warm glow that endures for 20 minutes.
Her speech slows. Otherwise, she is more or less her effusive,
chatty, insouciant self.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carlo is one of methadone's elder stateswomen. She is 54
years old, the last 28 on methadone. Even after all those years,
she still feels like a specimen under glass.
</P>
<P>
   All methadone patients take it every day. With few exceptions,
patients must go to a clinic to get it. At Lower Eastside, a
patient starts by visiting six days a week (the clinic is closed
Sunday) and receiving a take-home bottle on Saturday. This can be
reduced to as little as one pickup a week (and six take-home
bottles). Pam Carlo is a three-day-a-week patient.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are forbidden to drink alcohol or use any other
addictive drug. They are required to see a counselor at least once
a month. Group therapy is mandatory at first, then voluntary. (Ms.
Carlo skips it. ``I've heard it all,'' she said.)
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. Carlo's stop at the clinic, she and her fiance, Earl
Meares, headed east to his room in the Greenpoint section of
Brooklyn. The sky hung low over the city. Meares will be husband
No. 6. Ms. Carlo has had poor luck with husbands. One died of a
heart attack and two of AIDS (by sheer luck, she never got the
virus); the others were mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Back at his room, they made themselves comfortable. They got out
their artwork. She is a freelance commercial artist, and has been
illustrating a book on mice. Meares, who is on workfare, sweeping
up around the court buildings in TriBeCa, has been laboring on a
comic strip called ``Heroin Chic,'' based on Ms. Carlo's life.
</P>
<P>
   Meares has never had a drug habit. He doesn't fully understand
addiction. She does. Her vision of drugs is dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``See a sunny day like this?'' she said. ``I hated sunny days
when I was using. I thought everything was so black. I thought
there was no way out.''
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Jamaica, Queens, an only child. Her mother lived
off an inheritance. Her father, who was in the cemetery business,
abandoned her mother for his secretary before Ms. Carlo was born.
Growing up, she and her mother bickered constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother hated everything that wasn't high class,'' she said.
``And so I had to try everything that wasn't.''

 NEW YORK: that wasn't.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was smart, skipping two grades, starting college at 16 at
Texas Western in El Paso. She felt too young, and drifted into the
wrong crowd and into heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found heroin, I thought it was what I was searching for
my whole life,'' she said. ``It was like drowning in a big black
sea. And it was warm and comfortable and safe and nobody could
touch me. I thought I had found God.''
</P>
<P>
   A weekend thing evolved into a daily habit. She enrolled at
Cornell University Medical College, she said, and met a doctor who
was addicted to morphine. She moved in with him. She gave him sex;
he gave her morphine. A year and a half short of graduation, she
nodded out during a lab and collapsed onto a cadaver. She was
suspended for using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Furious, she sank into the shadows of the East Village.
Desperate to support her habit, she turned $10 tricks on the ``day
shift.'' She was a streetwalker for four years. She got just about
anything you could get, including syphilis and jaw cancer. She
shrank to 80 pounds and was less in demand.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless, she visited Woolworth's and bought a sign that read,
``Bathroom Out of Order.'' At night, she trooped to the Albert
Hotel in the West Village and affixed the sign to the door of a
hallway bathroom. She slipped inside, arranged her fur coat in the
bathtub, wiggled in and went to sleep. The next night, she selected
a different bathroom. She did this for six months.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, with no foreseeable future, she was drawn to a new
treatment that was all the talk: methadone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Methadone got me to feel again,'' she said. ``We used to hear
about the ring concept. People who are addicts, our lives are
rings. There is a link that is either missing or improperly
attached. With methadone, the ring is whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carlo drinks 66 milligrams a day. (The dose is determined by
the patient's physical characteristics and the quantity and
longevity of drug abuse.) Early on, her dosage was as high as 180.
``I was wasted,'' she said. ``I was walking into walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Meares' room, the sky had darkened. How did his
fiancee's being on methadone affect him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes she will take her dose and freeze in place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said quietly. ``We'll go to the coffee shop and
I'll reach for my tea and I'll just freeze in that position.
Methadone freeze. It's embarrassing to him. I realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   She does not like to discuss her condition. ``I don't tell
squares,'' she said. Once, visiting a friend of Meares', she
slipped. She said she was on methadone. ``His face froze,'' she
said. ``So did his wife's. Suddenly, disaster had struck. They had
a junkie in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The ones who understand are her friends from the program.
Methadone mornings, they get together at the Aten-Ra International
Gourmet Deli, walking distance from the clinic. She sometimes
refers to them by their names and doses: JoAnn, 60 milligrams; Tony
8; James 70, the size of the dose fixing them in the hierarchy of
methadone.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, a couple of former members of the klatch tried
to intrude but were ignored. They abused pills and were not
welcome. James uses pills, too, but was down to half a pill a day
from six, so he was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anxiety,'' he said in explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carlo said: ``Anxiety problems are common for people on
methadone. They have agoraphobia and claustrophobia. It's caused by
their life styles.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Carlo has taken methadone 18 years longer than she took
heroin. To an extent, she has made it a career. Chris DeLuca, the
clinic's assistant director, doubts she will ever retire. She hopes
he is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I die, I want to know what it feels like to be clean,''
she said. ``You see, I don't remember. Imagine that: forgetting
what it feels like to be straight. But I don't remember. And I want
to feel it. I really do want to feel it.''

 NEW YORK: feel it.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the landscape of methadone are many people who straddle the
world of drugs and the world of treatment, who continue to live by
their own rules rather than methadone's. Jamil Muhammad is one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   He is a lanky, hard-bitten man of 46, with a neatly trimmed
beard and mustache. He has his own story of a defeated life, and he
knows exactly where he stands. ``I'm not a prime example of an
addict who has gotten it together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Lower Eastside five years ago, and in every sense he
got off to a bad start. At first his concept of being on the
program meant to get his methadone and then take pills and shoot
cocaine. He robbed apartments. He sold his methadone on the street.
Several times, he ended up on Rikers Island. ``I was crazy,'' he
said. ``Maybe I had a death wish.''
</P>
<P>
   Addicts are used to being high, and once on methadone often
gravitate to a substitute for heroin, generally cocaine or pills.
Some pills combine with methadone to produce a euphoria. These
days, the pill of choice is the sedative Xanax. ``It makes you feel
better with your meth,'' Muhammad explained.
</P>
<P>
   Methadone stops the thirst for heroin, but nothing more. Escape
from addiction involves a protocol of methadone and counseling and
ambition. Lower Eastside offers counselors and weekly group
sessions to help resurrect aspirations, but patients take what they
want, and sometimes it isn't much. Muhammad goes to group meetings
with some regularity, but often sits there with a vacant look.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to deal with a lot of ignorance,'' he said. ``I don't
like it when someone starts running their mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a burger at Rokka's Coffee Shop near the clinic, Muhammad
gave a capsule version of his road to methadone.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Orange, N.J., and raised mostly by his
grandmother, who owned a prospering antique store. Talented at
basketball, he earned a scholarship to Providence College, but in
his third year was caught dealing marijuana and expelled.
</P>
<P>
   He became a Muslim. He married and moved to Brooklyn. He went to
Saudi Arabia and studied Arabic, hoping to teach it in American
mosques. He had two sons. Back in Brooklyn, he taught Arabic for a
while. He got hooked on pills and his marriage cracked apart. After
the divorce, his descent was fast. ``I was losing everybody,'' he
said. ``And so I turned to drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   He snorted heroin and then he shot it. He lived on the streets.
He dealt heroin to buy it. He used it steadily for five years, as
much as nine bags a day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, unable to support his habit, wanting to be useful
again, he sought out methadone.
</P>
<P>
   These days, he tends to follow a cycle of being clean for
several months, then taking cocaine or pills, then staying clean
for several more months. Between August and the end of October,
however, cocaine showed up in five consecutive urine samples. He
was punished by being required to show up five days a week instead
of four. Even so, he readily admits he continues to drink two or
three cans of beer a day, in violation of clinic rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have moments when I get frustrated at myself,'' he said.
``Sometimes it gets so bad in my mind I feel like screaming. When I
get disgusted, I'll go out and get high.''
</P>
<P>
   A flat, dull day. Muhammad was stacking books at the Angel
Street Thrift Shop on West 17th Street. The Lower Eastside Service
Center owns the shop and Muhammad works there three days a week, at
$6 an hour. Mostly he waits for some stroke of luck, some act of
legerdemain, to turn his world around. He had a lottery ticket in
his pocket, banking on ``587'' to return him $500. He has played
the same number for three years. It was the street address of a
high school friend who was killed in a car accident on her prom
night.
</P>
<P>
   His dosage is 100 milligrams, and it hasn't changed. Because of
the stigma, he doesn't tell people about being on methadone, he
says. ``People have heard the stories about selling methadone and
about still doing drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he still does drugs. Of course, he has sold his
methadone. When he is broke, which is fairly often, he is tempted
to sell it again. He can get $30 for a 100-milligram bottle, a lot
when your pockets are empty. ``I was tempted last week,'' he said.
He doesn't want to get arrested. ``If a friend of mine wanted some,
I'd sell it to him,'' he said. ``Not to a stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad has tumbled from Providence College to the Providence
Hotel, a $10-a-night flophouse on the Bowery. He put some books in
order and a doubtful look came across his face. He did not pretend
to have any answers. ``I'm not standing here and saying I'm outside
of the problem,'' he said. ``Maybe I'm the cause of the problem. I
don't know. Maybe I'm the cause of it.''

<P>
   The Power of Hope group therapy session began at 10 a.m. Jamie
Holder, the group leader, talked about the recovery process: ``It
is as complicated as the relapse process. Beth, you've spoken of
what pressure you're under from your mother and your brother _ `Are
you still on that thing?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Beth Griffin said. ``They want to know am I well yet.''
Her mother, she said, kept telling her, ``I hope you'll be off
methadone soon so I can put you back in my will.''
</P>
<P>
   When the hour was up, Ms. Griffin headed for the East Village.
She is 36, with frizzy blonde hair. There are scars on her face;
once when she was on speedballs she cut her face open with a razor
because she thought there were spiders and worms beneath her skin.
</P>
<P>
   She trudged up the three flights to a studio she shares on East
9th Street. She works on her art there, collages and paintings
built around words and numbers. After a while, she went over to the
Margaret Bodell gallery, where she had recently had a show and sold
some of her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to get a little following,'' she said. ``Most of
my life I've had really good jobs and stuff. More than anything
else, I want to support myself again.''
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in Laurence, S.C., where her father ran a gas
station and her mother was a secretary. She graduated from the
Ringling School of Art in Sarasota, Fla., and became an art
director at Dancer Fitzgerald Sample in New York, working on Luvs
diapers, Wranglers, Almond Joy. She said Advertising Age anointed
her one of the 10 brightest young people in advertising. She butted
heads with her boss and quit after nine months. Her resignation
letter said, ``Enough.'' She modeled for art students and
sculptors, and then did typography for ad agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, she went with a friend to the Mars Bar in the East
Village. Her boyfriend had just left her. She had had an abortion.
Her parents had just divorced. At the bar, her friend asked her,
``You want to do some?''
</P>
<P>
   In the bathroom, Ms. Griffin snorted half a bag of heroin. The
first thing she did the next day was go out to get more. In four
months, she knew the face of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly four years, she only snorted heroin because needles
terrified her. But in time, to get a better high, she began to
shoot. In the bathrooms of some of the city's best-known ad
agencies, she shot up.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister, Laura, a drug- and alcohol-abuse therapist in South
Carolina, tried hard to get her off. Heroin was more persuasive.
She quit three times, but it didn't last. Her life traced the
familiar downward path. In December 1993, she looked to methadone
and hoped it would be a lamp to another life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to the clinic I felt about as bad about myself as
you could feel without killing yourself,'' she said. She kept
taking Valium and Xanax. Even without pills, her dose of 90
milligrams a day knocked her out. Mainly, she slept, often 18 or 19
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, her sister was killed by a car while jogging.
The driver was a lawyer high on drugs and alcohol. Ms. Griffin
contemplated taking her own life. She sought therapy and took
sedatives. The world moved on, while she slept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a zombie for like four years,'' she said. ``That is the
dirty secret of methadone _ a lot of people stay zombies for a long
time, for years. Not until you get below a certain dose does the
fog lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Methadone, she said, has saved her, but the drill has grown old.
``I'm sick of being a slave to methadone,'' she said. ``I'm sick of
going down there and seeing all the same old faces.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Griffin has a criticism of the program, it is that no one
ever pushed her to get off methadone. ``I know a lot of people who
told them they wanted to come down in their dose, and they would
say, we don't think you're ready,'' she said. DeLuca, at the Lower
Eastside methadone clinic, said perhaps 20 people a year get off
methadone there, though patients say far fewer truly do.Ms. Griffin
said it took her own initiative for the clinic to start reducing
her dose a milligram or two a week in pursuit of getting off. By
Thanksgiving, she was down to 3 milligrams a day. She was feeling
some withdrawal symptoms, but with her dose so low, it was as if
she had been rebuilt. ``It's like I'm on a faster speed setting,''
she said. ``I do in a day what I did in a month.''
</P>
<P>
   She lives with a cat named Amtrak in the Times Square Hotel, a
single room occupancy hotel. She plays the piano in the lobby
almost every morning. She was on welfare for about two years and is
on S.S.I. now because she was classified with a psychiatric
disability after her sister's death. She has been painting a lot,
and hopes one day to live off her art.
</P>
<P>
   Soon she was planning to drink the red liquid for what she hoped
would be the last time. She was going home for the holidays and
would be gone a good three weeks. She didn't want the methadone
rope pulling her back.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Dec. 2, Ms. Griffin drank a 1-milligram bottle of
methadone. It was her final dose. The removal of methadone from her
life led to a nightmarish week. She found herself waking up by 4
a.m. She was achy and twitchy. Every second seemed like an hour.
She felt old yearnings for heroin. On Sunday, she dragged herself
down to the Museum of Modern Art. She stayed exactly 17 minutes.
``I had no attention span,'' she said. ``I felt I had to lay
down.''
</P>
<P>
   As the days passed, she perked up somewhat, though she remained
jittery and restless. ``There are times I feel I can't get through
this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When they go off methadone, ex-addicts often feel a profound
sense of loss. State rules allow six months of post-methadone care
at the clinic. And so she will continue to go there. She will give
her weekly urine sample and see her counselor, the determination to
be straight driving her on.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, she wrote down some ramblings about methadone.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it was impossible to jump from dope life to straight
life,'' she wrote. ``I needed the grey shades of methadone in
between. Dope life and straight life are as different as animals
being in a cage or out in the jungle. I'm not sure which one is
really `free' but it takes a while to switch from one to the other.
Without methadone, chances are I would be dead now.''

SEDATE MERRYMAKING IN TIMES SQUARE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New Year's Eve here was a cold, crowded and _ at one
point _ smoky, but largely peaceful trial run for the
century-ending celebration planned for next year, according to
police officials, who arrested only a handful of the half-million
revelers who squeezed into Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000 police officers who patrolled the party _ one of the
largest police details in history _ made fewer arrests than the
year before, 23 versus 30, officials said. Most of those arrested
were people who took the spirit of celebration too far and were
charged with disorderly conduct, the police said, but there were
also two arrests for robbery and three for assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went super,'' said Lt. Stephen Biegel. ``The majority of
the crowd acted orderly and had a great time. It bodes well for
next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular disruption of the night occurred as the
crowd filed home and confetti that had blown onto a rooftop of a
four-story building caught fire, sending flames and smoke into the
frigid night air at 12:42 a.m. They said the fire probably started
when someone in a nearby building dropped a cigarette onto the
confetti-covered roof.
</P>
<P>
   Despite public warnings, a number of people tried to bring the
bar with them to Times Square for the celebration; the police
issued 72 summonses to people with open containers of alcohol, a
jump from the 19 issued the year before. Alcohol or illegal drugs
were confiscated from an additional 140 people, the police said,
and 27 people were given summonses for possession of marijuana, up
one from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Another discordant note in midtown was the stabbing of a hot dog
vendor, Sayed Hussein, 34, outside Pennsylvania Station as groups
of vendors vied for the business of revelers streaming in for the
train ride home. The police charged Felah Hussein, 20, a fellow
vendor who is not related to the victim, in the 3 a.m. assault. The
stabbing was one of a rash of violent incidents, including three
killings, that marred the new year before it was five hours old.
</P>
<P>
   Sharone Glenn, 17, the son of Nathaniel Boyd, a professional
boxing manager, was fatally shot in the head at 3:40 a.m. after a
dispute in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The two other slaying victims, both of whom were killed before
dawn, also were men under the age of 30. One man, who was not
identified by the police by Friday night, was found shot to death
in the Morrisania section of the Bronx. The second, identified as
Bromley Walcott, 21, was beaten with a brick during a fight at a
party in Laurelton, N.Y., in Queens County. He later died of his
injuries at Franklin Hospital Medical Center, in Valley Stream,
N.Y., the police said.

GIULIANI-PATAKI RIFT STALLS HOUSING FOR MENTALLY-ILL HOMELESS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By MIKE WINERIP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki are at
odds over the second phase of a housing program for mentally ill
homeless people in the city, arguing over the scope of the program
and the size of the state's contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has left plans to expand the program in limbo, with
neither city nor state officials willing to estimate when
construction might begin.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the program, known as ``New York/New York,''
has been widely credited with moving almost 4,000 mentally ill
people off the streets of the city. That phase began in 1990, when
Mario Cuomo was governor and David Dinkins was mayor, and provided
3,814 housing units. The state paid for two-thirds of the building
cost and the city the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration has proposed 1,350 units of housing
for the second phase, with the state underwriting 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, a strong proponent of the program, last year earmarked
$51 million for the city's share and asked Pataki to provide double
that amount _ $100 million _ for the state's share, the rate of
support Cuomo provided. That would have paid for 2,500 units. City
officials hoped the $40 million appropriated by the state last
spring would be the first installment of the state's contribution.
</P>
<P>
   But as negotiations have progressed, state officials have made
it clear they do not want to go beyond that $40 million, and the
city has reduced its request in recent months to 1,750 units from
2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``For months, the city's been begging the state to help out
more,'' said James Brennan, a Democrat from Brooklyn who heads the
state Assembly's committee on mental health. ``But the state won't
budge.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Giuliani would say little publicly about Pataki, who
controls the state purse strings. But in off-the-record interviews,
they made it clear they were very discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal Cohen, the city's mental health commissioner, would say
only that he hoped the two sides could work things out. ``We've
been playing catchup with decades of deinstitutionalization,'' he
said. ``We can't afford to set the clock back now.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the governor was concerned about
controlling social welfare spending. Roger Klingman, a spokesman
for the state Office of Mental Health, said that rather than
financing new housing programs, the governor had emphasized
``managing the beds we already have.'' He would not comment on the
talks except to say, ``We will continue to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the nonprofit agencies that provide the housing for
the homeless complain that the Pataki administration is not
sufficiently interested in the mentally ill or the problems they
can cause on city streets. There has been a marked drop in
financing levels for such housing under Pataki statewide.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Pataki administration has provided no new
financing to build supervised housing for the mentally ill in the
last two years, and in its first two years of its term it
essentially finished projects Cuomo had started.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the money the state has appropriated in recent years
has gone toward rent subsidies that can be used in any apartment
building, providing housing for mentally ill people with the least
serious problems. The type of housing built under the first New
York/New York agreement includes counselors who provide 24-hour
supervision, including monitoring whether residents take their
medication.
</P>
<P>
   The rent subsidy program costs the state $9,000 a year per
person; supervised housing with counselors costs $30,000 a year per
person.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown in negotiations comes as the state is striving to
discharge the last 6,500 patients at state psychiatric hospitals,
many with more complex problems than the patients released in the
1980s at the height of deinstitutionalization.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them also have criminal records. In 1986, 16 percent of
state psychiatric patients had a criminal conviction; by 1996, that
had climbed to 24 percent. Mental health professionals say that the
more troubled a patient, the more he or she needs supervised
housing programs.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say that Manhattan State Psychiatric Center now
has a majority of patients with a criminal history. In 1993,
according to state documents, 7 percent of new admissions at the
center were from jails and prisons. By 1997, 70 percent of new
admissions were, and today almost all admissions come from
correctional institutions.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, the Pataki administration has said it hopes to reduce
the state's mental hospital census by 2,000 patients.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say they do not discharge patients unless there
is appropriate housing for them. Klingman says that most of the
patients with criminal backgrounds committed misdemeanors and are
therefore not dangerous to the community.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Culhane, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania
who has worked with the Giuliani administration in monitoring the
city's homeless shelters, said the 1990 agreement was a major
factor in reducing the shelter population. When the agreement was
signed, there were 9,300 single adults in city shelters, a record;
that was reduced to 6,100 by 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other city in the country experienced this kind of drop _
that was New York/New York working,'' Culhane said. ``During that
same period, Philadelphia's shelter population actually climbed 35
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But beginning in 1995, as most of the New York/New York beds
were filled, the adult shelter population began creeping up again,
and now stands at 7,200. Culhane estimates that 3,000 of the adults
are mentally ill.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Europe made history on Friday, but there
will not be much time for self-congratulation.
</P>
<P>
   After years of political squabbling, arduous negotiations and
painful economic preparation, 11 European nations opened for
business on Friday with a new common currency: the euro.
</P>
<P>
   It is a political and economic achievement that seemed
impossible and even quixotic as recently as three years ago. Yet
suddenly the euro is here. And in a testimony to the euro's
remarkably smooth start, the economic debates within Europe have
already moved on to other topics.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no one worries about whether the euro can establish its
credibility as a strong currency in world markets. Now the big
issue is whether the euro will be a bit too strong, so highly
valued that it hinders European growth by making exports more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, almost nobody fears an imminent resurgence of
inflation _ not even the famously austere German central bank, the
Bundesbank. Now the debate is whether Europe faces a danger from
deflation and declining prices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, European business is reinventing itself both at home
and in the global marketplace. Much of that is a simple response to
global competition, but the euro is accelerating the change by
bringing Europe closer to the ideal of a single market as big as
that of North America.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the stock exchanges in Frankfurt and London, European
bourses are moving rapidly toward becoming cross-border equities
markets. Corporations, which traditionally financed themselves
through their own reserves or through bank loans, are now raising
billions in global stock and bond offerings. Junk bonds and
American-style leveraged buyouts are on the increase. Banks and
insurance companies are searching for mergers and partnerships
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   And Europe's bewildering patchwork of consumer pricing _ where
the price of a Volkswagen Golf or a bottle of Chanel perfume can be
25 percent higher in Paris than in Madrid, Spain _ is under new
challenge as the euro strips away the camouflage of currency
differences.
</P>
<P>
   The euro will still seem like a phantom currency to many
consumers for some time. The new bills and coins will not enter
circulation until Jan. 1, 2002, and companies are allowed to keep
doing business in their national currencies until then.
</P>
<P>
   But as an economic entity, the euro is now more real than the
German marks or French francs that people keep in their wallets.
European monetary policy and interest rates are under the control
of the new European Central Bank. And when European finance
ministers locked in the exchange rates between their national
currencies and the euro on New Year's Eve, the old currencies
became nothing more than different ways to print euros.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Friday, the securities exchanges in all member
countries are conducting their business in euros. All interbank
transfers, even those within the same country, will be in euros.
Consumers now have the choice of keeping their bank accounts in
euros or their national currencies. During the next year, many
stores and companies plan to convert credit-card and other
electronic transactions into euros.
</P>
<P>
   As Europeans enter this new era, the ground beneath them is
shifting. Economists and government officials are much more worried
about an economic slowdown this year than they were just six months
ago. Having argued somewhat smugly that Europe would be only mildly
affected by the financial crises sweeping through Asia, Russia and
Latin America, government officials now admit they are troubled.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists have cut their aggregate growth estimates for
the 11 countries in Euroland from more than 3 percent to about 2.5
percent or lower. In Germany, which accounts for nearly a quarter
of the region's economic activity, some economists predict that
growth will drop from about 3 percent in 1998 to just 1.7 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing companies are considerably more pessimistic.
German engineering and machine-tool companies have slashed their
predictions for export growth from 7 percent to 4 percent. Chemical
companies such as BASF and Hoechst are all reeling from lower
prices and lower demand, mostly as a result of the problems in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the United States, Europe is flooded with low-cost
imports as a result of currency devaluations from Asia and Latin
America. While Europe still has a big trade surplus with the rest
of the world, a rising tide of imports is cutting into local
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together with the U.S., Euroland is turning into the global
importer of last resort,'' wrote Holger Schmieding, European
economist for Merrill Lynch in London, in a recent report. He
predicts that the shift in trade will reduce Europe's growth by
about one-half of a percentage point, and bring it down to about 2
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   That would not be catastrophic. Most economists expect that the
United States, which has grown faster than Europe since the early
1990s, will not do much better.
</P>
<P>
   But even a modest slowdown will put more pressure on the
fledgling European Central Bank, with Wim Duisenberg as its
president. Formerly the president of the central bank of the
Netherlands, Duisenberg has cast himself as an unflinching hawk on
monetary policy whose only interest is preventing inflation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Long after the Federal Reserve Board began cutting U.S. interest
rates last fall, hoping to head off a possible recession,
Duisenberg argued against similar measures in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But as the signs of a European slowdown continued to multiply,
Duisenberg and his mentors at the Bundesbank changed course and
surprised almost everybody last month by cutting nearly all
benchmark rates to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether that will be enough to shield
Europe against the chill winds from Asia or Latin America. But the
rate cut is bigger than it looks, because it came on top of even
more radical reductions in European countries like Italy, Spain and
Ireland, which have traditionally had higher inflation and interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Because countries adopting the same currency have to have the
same general level of inflation and interest rates, central banks
in these poorer periphery countries had already slashed their rates
to 4 percent from more than 6 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, baseline interest rates are now mostly at 3 percent
from Madrid to Frankfurt for the first time in European history. As
recently as a year ago, most economists assumed that this process
of convergence would head in the opposite direction, with countries
like Germany nudging their rates up to about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The lower interest rates could lead to economic tensions within
Europe. For Ireland, Spain and Portugal, which were already growing
much more rapidly than their bigger and wealthier neighbors, the
latest cuts simply add more rocket fuel to the mixture and could
ignite inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But that hardly settles the matter. With last fall's election
victory in Germany by Gerhard Schroeder and the Social Democratic
Party, most countries in Europe are now controlled by
left-of-center governments that are more interested in reducing
unemployment than in adhering to orthodox inflation-fighting
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those political leaders are hinting at a readiness to
run higher budget deficits, especially if European unemployment
rises beyond its current level of about 10 percent. If budget
deficits do begin to swell, Duisenberg will be under pressure to
counterattack with tighter monetary policy _ an unpopular job.

UNION OFFERS A NEW PLAN THROUGH THE NEWS MEDIA
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association owners finally got a glimpse
of the union's latest proposal Friday. The only problem was that
they found out about the players' compromises through the news
media.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the union gave the media a sample of the
concessions it hopes may end the lockout, now in its 186th day,
league officials had not seen a copy of the proposal. What is
amounting to the final preliminary fight before next week's
expected last round of bargaining, neither the union nor the league
is budging.
</P>
<P>
   The players have requested a meeting to formally submit their
proposal, and the league has said only that it would forward it to
its labor relations committee with no guarantee of a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no comment on a proposal that has not been made to the
NBA,'' Jeffrey Mishkin, the league's chief legal officer, said
Friday. ``They can give us their proposal by any means they choose.
If they want to deliver it in person, fine. If want to mail it or
fax it, great. When they deliver it to us, we'll respond to it, but
not until then.''
</P>
<P>
   The league's stance was hardened on Thursday when Jeffrey
Kessler, the union's chief outside counsel, telephoned Mishkin to
request a meeting at which the proposal would be presented. When
Mishkin said he would forward it to the committee and its members
would then decide whether to schedule a meeting, Kessler called
back to say the union would not formally submit the proposal until
a meeting was scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked when he said we weren't going to meet,'' Kessler
said. ``It's not their offer, but there is definitely going to be
some movement in their direction. I just hope we get a chance to
present it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest skirmish, the lawyers were merely the conduits for
David Stern, the league's commissioner, and Billy Hunter, the
union's executive director. Both seem entrenched in their positions
and have only until Thursday to resuscitate the season, at which
time Stern and his deputy, Russ Granik, are expected to recommend
canceling the season if a new collective bargaining agreement has
not been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter portrayed the union's revised offer Thursday as
``unprecedented,'' saying that the players had agreed to an
absolute limit on maximum salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The players have proposed that the most a player with 10 years
or more experience could earn would be $15 million a year, though
only three players currently average higher than that salary. The
league wants that number to be $12.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The union has also lowered its desired revenue percentage in the
critical fourth year of a proposed six-year deal to 55 percent. The
league wants the figure to be 53 percent in that year.
</P>
<P>
   A laundry list of other economic issues needs to be sorted
through before the two sides work on putting together an
abbreviated season of 40 to 50 games that could start no sooner
than the last week of January.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get a deal, it's simply because David Stern
doesn't want to do a deal,'' Hunter said.

SENATOR FAULTS GORE ON ETHICS BEFORE RACE BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)  (lb) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who took formal steps on
Wednesday to run for president, wasted no time Friday in signaling
that he would make Vice President Al Gore's fund-raising techniques
a major part of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, speaking to a gathering of conservative activists here
in his first appearance since filing papers on Wednesday to start a
presidential exploratory committee, said that the vice president
was a part of what McCain said were broad-based ethical lapses of
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you proud when monks and nuns abandon their vows of
poverty and pay tens of thousands of dollars to have spiritual
communion with the vice president?'' McCain said, referring to a
fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple that Gore attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you proud of an administration that spends all of its time
worrying about `controlling legal authorities' but cannot abide a
controlling ethical authority?'' McCain added, referring to a
phrase Gore used to deflect criticism of his fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has not formally declared his candidacy but is already
perceived as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who said he would not leave the Senate to run for
president, is the first Republican to take formal steps toward the
2000 nomination, but others are expected to follow shortly.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief sidewalk news conference before his speech, McCain
discussed some of his apparent political liabilities. He was asked
whether he looked forward to the personal scrutiny that goes with
being a presidential candidate, particularly at a time when the
private lives of politicians are being exposed. McCain long ago
acknowledged that he had an affair during his first marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't,'' he said. ``And it's well known that I've had a
very colorful life and career, so that's obviously something that
obviously we have to seriously consider. At the same time, you have
to appreciate that that goes with the territory.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain hedged when asked how he thought the Senate should deal
with articles of impeachment against President Clinton. He said he
had not yet spoken with Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
Republican leader, who has proposed a speedy Senate trial that
would be over by Jan. 22.

7 KILLED, 7 HURT IN NEW YORK-AREA CAR WRECKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.C.)  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In three and a half hours on New Year's Eve, seven
lives were lost and others were forever altered in car wrecks in
the New York metropolitan region, and in each case police said a
drunken driver might have been to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The three accidents in New York and Connecticut, between 9 p.m.
Thursday and 12:30 a.m. Friday, also left seven people hurt, at
least one of them with life-threatening injuries. In two of the
crashes, drivers were arrested on drunken-driving charges; in the
other, a driver was killed, but police said they were awaiting a
toxicology report and that they suspected alcohol played a part.
</P>
<P>
   In the deadliest crash, an Army private was killed with his wife
and her child almost in the blink of an eye shortly after midnight
as he drove on Interstate 95 in Connecticut on his way to North
Carolina. State police said the private, Charles Flaherty, 20, was
driving with his wife, Josephine, 22, and her 3-year-old daughter,
when their car was hit head on by a car driving the wrong way in
the southbound lane in Stratford.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of that car, Silverstre Bonilla, 41, also died at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they were awaiting results from an autopsy, but
Sgt. Daniel Semosky of the Connecticut State Police in Bridgeport
said, ``Thinking about the time of day and what he was doing, we
are checking for drugs and alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty had enlisted in the Army six months ago and was
stationed at Fort Bragg, N.C. He was with the 82nd Airborne
Division.
</P>
<P>
   In another crash, 20 minutes before midnight on the Long Island
Expressway, three young people were killed when an off-duty New
York City corrections officer, Edwin Rodriguez, rammed into their
car as it traveled east in Holtsville, police said. Police said
Rodriguez had been drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevrolet Chevette that police said was hit by Rodriguez
soon exploded. The driver, Angelette Coffey, 19, managed to flee,
police said, but three passengers were killed. They were identified
as Matthew Marcotrigiano, 21, of Wading River, N.Y., and Norma
Vestal, 17, and Lee Trent, 16, both of Riverhead, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Coffey was listed Friday in stable condition at Stony Brook
Hospital, as was Rodriguez. He was charged with driving while
intoxicated, and will be under watch by a police officer until he
is released from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The first accident of the three-hour period occurred at about 9
p.m. in Hollis, Queens, as Pernell Hanton drove his 1988 Chevrolet
Corsica filled with children and another adult west on 109th
Avenue. Police said Paul Wachter, who was driving alone in his 1991
Chevrolet Blazer north along Farmers Boulevard, collided with
Hanton's car with such force that everyone in the Corsica was
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Wachter, who police said was from Westbury, N.Y., was taken to
Queens General Hospital, but was soon released and charged with
driving while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   Hanton was taken to Mary Immaculate Hospital in Queens, where he
was listed in very critical condition, police said. They added that
a 9-year-old girl, Lanelle Hanton, was also in critical condition
in the hospital's intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Three other passengers were hospitalized: Laquaisa Simpkins, 11,
Maudine Hanton, 14, and Aytasha Hanton, 25. A relative said that
Laquaisa, Maudine and Lanelle were all daughters of Hanton.
Aytasha's relationship to the others could not be learned.

Tennessee's Wilson exudes leadership, dismisses pain
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TEMPE, Ariz. _ It only hurts when he rolls over in bed. Or when he
turns the wrong way. Or when he inadvertently tries to lift
something at the wrong angle.
</P>
<P>
   It hurts a whole lot more when instinct dictates that he lean
that battered right shoulder into a running back or receiver to
deliver the appropriate hit, but Al Wilson doesn't want anyone to
dwell on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had time to rehab it,'' he said. ``It's not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   John Chavis knows better, of course. Tennessee's defensive
coordinator marvels at what Wilson has been able to do in a season
that has been almost equal parts elation and agony. With each hit,
with each time the heart and soul of the Volunteers' defense gets
up slowly, Chavis feels the pain, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts to know that even though he's playing so well, he's
not at his best because of that shoulder,'' Chavis said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, the senior middle linebacker of the nation's No.
1-ranked team, prefers not to ponder the might-have-beens.
Tennessee is 12-0 for the first time in school history. A national
championship is just 60 minutes away in Monday night's Fiesta Bowl
matchup with Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   That's what matters, he will tell you.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wilson conceded there have been a few dark moments along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely depressing,'' he said the other day. ``But
it was something I just had to push on through.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has done just that, and in remarkable style. He
missed the Auburn game with the shoulder injury, and the Kentucky
and Vanderbilt games when a groin strain further complicated
matters. Still, he managed to earn consensus All-Southeastern
Conference honors and a first-team All-American spot from the
American Football Coaches Association and the Football Writers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   He also impressed some more important observers along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see him play injured the whole year like he did was a great
inspiration for our team,'' Tennessee wide receiver Peerless Price
said. ``Even when he couldn't play, we all wanted to win for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always upbeat and cheering. He was into what the
offense was doing. Seeing the way he handled things gave us a lot
of motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who weighed the merits of NFL money after last season
before deciding to stay in school, takes his role seriously.
Forcing three fumbles in the watershed victory over Florida was an
obvious way to lead, as were the four sacks, six tackles for
losses, two fumble recoveries and an interception he managed in the
nine games he was able to play.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining quality control in the less public moments, however,
is part of the job, too.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, for instance, Vols coach Phillip Fulmer
spent 20 minutes delivering a motivational speech. When Fulmer was
done, Wilson stepped up and uttered two words:
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the message that stuck, becoming a team motto.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm a so-called leader, I have to be vocally into it,'' he
said. ``I have to take charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I feel like a guy is slipping a little bit, I might say,
`Let's pick it up, baby.' And those guys take it to heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State coach Bobby Bowden evidently has taken Wilson's
efforts to heart as well. Sizing up Monday's Fiesta Bowl
national-championship matchup, Bowden cited two Tennessee players
he feared.
</P>
<P>
   One was quarterback Tee Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The other: ``No. 27.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nice, but one guy can't win the game,'' Wilson said. ''
I can go out and have a great football game, but I can't focus all
the attention on myself. I can't cause 10 turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean he won't try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen guys with as much ability who never, ever got
anything done with it,'' Chavis said. ``His will to win and desire
to be the best are what set him apart.''
</P>
<P>
   That drive has helped carry Tennessee from preseason
afterthought to the cusp of a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to set an example for the young guys down the road, when
it's their turn to be leaders,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   That turn will come soon enough. For 60 more minutes on Monday
night, Al Wilson will offer a final primer.

Price boasts of Peerless Tennessee
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Tennessee receiver Peerless Price finally had to
say what his body language and facial expressions have said all
week.
</P>
<P>
   He has none _ a peer, that is. At least not in the Florida State
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   It was refreshing to see such resolution on New Year's Day, for
Price to say what he really thought and remind the world there's
something of a tradition at Tennessee, too.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was all that televised college football Friday. Maybe
Price realized that while so many other big games were being
played, there were three days of only talking about football left
before Monday night's national-championship Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the desert weather, which Price said has been
playing with his mind as much as all the hype the Seminoles have
been getting here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 70 degrees in the daytime and 30 degrees at night, that's
the weirdest thing I've ever seen,'' Price said. ``Where I'm from,
when it's cold it's cold and when it's hot it's hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Price is from is Tennessee, where they've been known to
catch a few passes. Much of the hypesters for Monday night's game
seem to have forgotten and Price no longer could just sit there and
take it, as he has throughout a month's worth of functions,
banquets and news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   He tried, sure. He crossed his arms, squirmed in his chair and
tried not to roll his eyes and scream every time the focus of this
Fiesta Bowl was put on the No. 2 Seminoles rather than the No. 1
Vols.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good team and a good defense,'' Price said of the
'Noles. ``They've accomplished a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the way to giving the Seminoles all the necessary
compliments and pats on the back before Monday night's
national-championship game, something finally got the better of
Price.
</P>
<P>
   A tough, smart stare crossed Price's face when another reference
to the Seminoles' defense was made Friday. Someone talked about the
physical way the Seminoles traditionally have treated opposing
receivers. Someone mentioned the confidence the FSU corners have
shown this week. Someone mentioned the Seminoles' long line of
secondary standouts _ players such as Deion Sanders and Terrell
Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of it hearing what they're going to do in the
ballgame,'' Price said. ``I'm tired of hearing about everything
they've done and this and that. Let's just play and find out.
They're the No. 1-ranked secondary in the country? I haven't seen
it. We think we can beat them in the passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be the most significant matchup of Monday's
national-championship game. FSU's run defense will be huge, of
course. Tennessee's pursuit against the speedy Seminoles will be
important. Decision-making by both quarterbacks, as always, will
have to be good.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe nothing will determine the champion more than what
FSU's No. 1-ranked defensive secondary will do against Tennessee's
hugely explosive group of receivers led by Price. It also will be
the most hotly contested of the matchups, because both sides
represent past heroes that built these traditions of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you sign with Tennessee you expect to be the next in
line,'' Price said. ``You expect to have success against anyone you
play. I've heard (from former Tennessee players) and they've all
told me not to take anything; not to back down, to uphold the
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Players such as Willie Gault, Tim McGee, Joey Kent and Marcus
Nash were but a few of the great Tennessee receivers over the
years. Many of them have called Price in recent days and told him
to attack the Seminoles at their strength. They have told Price to
show Tennessee pride and prove it on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the (FSU) secondary is going to be at a
disadvantage,'' Price said. ``They're good, but they're not unlike
what we've already seen this year. We can make plays against them.
They talk trash, but we hear it all in our own conference. And it's
better trash talk in the SEC because there are more good teams and
better players in our conference than the (Atlantic Coast
Conference).''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the emotional temperature for Monday night's game began
to rise Friday. Price certainly realized the skill and tradition
the Vols will face.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles' secondary of Dexter Jackson, Derrick Gibson, Tay
Cody and Mario Edwards did indeed lead the nation. It limited six
teams to 100 yards of passing or less, a remarkable statistic in
this age of college football. It is the latest star-studded group
of athletes charged with upholding a terrific Florida State
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   But Price and the Vols receivers have a tradition to uphold,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've played a lot of great football over there,'' Price
said of Florida State. ``People kind of have forgotten what we're
capable of doing over here.''

 By LESLIE EATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As if more evidence were needed that Manhattan is not
really part of America, consider this: The Hooters here is
bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Hooters, for those who have never ventured west of Hoboken, is a
popular and fast-growing chain of restaurants known almost entirely
for their waitresses, whom the company calls Hooters Girls. This is
not because they look like owls.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year ago, the first Hooters in Manhattan
opened in a prime tourist area, on 56th Street between Seventh
Avenue and Broadway, a block away from the Hard Rock Cafe and
Planet Hollywood. There was a bit of a splash at the time; David
Letterman featured the new restaurant on his show, ordering chicken
wings to go for his studio audience one night.
</P>
<P>
   But in November, the restaurant filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, which means all the people to whom it owes more than $1
million are on hold while the management tries to figure out how to
stop the red ink. The restaurant is not closed, but it is in
financial peril, losing something like $30,000 a month, according
to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what went wrong? Richard Yudenfriend, the local
businessman who owns this particular Hooters restaurant, is
tight-lipped, to say the least. ``We intend to be around for a long
time, and are hopeful this is a temporary situation,'' he said last
week, adding only that he did not think the Hooters ``concept,'' as
they say in the restaurant business, was wrong for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is the case is arguable, considering the scantily
clad _ or not clad at all _ competition nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, New York can be a tough town for anyone who wants to
open a restaurant, no matter what the concept. Persnickety
customers, temperamental chefs, high rents, lots of regulations,
nettlesome neighbors and loads of competition make restaurants
among the most frequent visitors to the bankruptcy court at Bowling
Green.
</P>
<P>
   As for chain restaurants, which offer middle-of-the-road food at
middling prices, New York probably has fewer per capita than any
other big city in the United States, industry experts say. Even
some of the more expensive theme restaurants, like the Hard Rock
Cafe and Planet Hollywood, have been faring poorly here.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Hooters, court documents and interviews with
people involved in the restaurant tell a tale that hits all of
those New York hot buttons: sex, food, money and real estate (not
necessarily in that order).
</P>
<P>
   Start with sex _ Hooters does. It has fought off government
efforts to force it to hire male waiters, arguing that feminine,
er, pulchritude is crucial to its business plan. This seems to be
working elsewhere: the chain now has 232 restaurants, including 18
that opened in the last year. It is the sixth largest ``casual
dining'' chain in the country, according to Technomic Inc., a
leading restaurant consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Hooters Girls wear scooped-neck tank tops, push-up bras, very
short orange shorts, white socks and sneakers (and flesh-toned
tights, but don't tell the guys). The company describes the ideal
Hooters Girl as a ``cheerleader, surfer girl next door,'' though
the ones featured in the company's calendars look more like Miss
February.
</P>
<P>
   The waitresses at the Hooters in Manhattan, however, do not.
They are pretty and pleasant, but more Jones Beach than
``Baywatch.'' At lunchtime recently, a table of young men clearly
enjoyed flirting with their waitress. (Hooters Girls make most of
their money from tips, and are encouraged to sit down with
customers and chat.) But the smirking men became slack-jawed only
when one of the many televisions ran a video of very buxom babes in
bikinis.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, men who are mainly interested in seeing female flesh
can see a lot more of it at Flash Dancers (Topless Entertainment),
say, or Legz Diamond's (All Nude), both of which are mere blocks
away down Broadway. But Edward Droste, one of the men who founded
Hooters in Florida in the 1980s, said such joints are not
competitors. ``Hooters has never crossed over into that kind of
arena,'' he said, adding that the restaurant is ``a little safe
haven.''
</P>
<P>
   The place looks like a combination fern bar and fraternity
house: the blond paneled walls are covered with beer signs, pinup
posters and fake traffic signs bearing slogans like ``Double
Curves.''
</P>
<P>
   As befits a restaurant whose slogan is, ``Delightfully tacky,
yet unrefined,'' the menu is written in a hokey, jokey style, as if
the author were simultaneously channeling Hugh Hefner and Walt
Disney. It boasts about the food, especially the ``nearly world
famous'' chicken wings.
</P>
<P>
   But customers do not seem convinced. In a recent survey for the
magazine Restaurants and Institutions, consumers ranked Hooters
78th out of 90 chains in quality of food. As for what New Yorkers
think, well, here's the 1999 Zagat Survey review: `` `Look but
don't touch' applies both to the skimpily costumed staff and to the
fried chain grub at the recent cholesterol-and-Lycra import; it's
`everything you've heard and less.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, food is not likely to be the primary draw for the men
who frequent Hooters _ and they are almost entirely men. Michael
McNeil, vice president for marketing at Hooters of America, based
in Atlanta, reports that nationally, 70 percent of the customers at
Hooters are men, though it depends on the location and time of day.
(Some Hooters have a children's menu.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, almost all of the customers appear to be local men
in their 20s rather than tourists. On a recent evening, they
streamed into the place, paying a $3 cover charge to watch the
waitresses compete in a bikini contest.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, however, things seem a lot slower. While nearby
restaurants like the Brooklyn Diner and the Redeye Grill were
jammed on a recent Thursday, only 50 or so people rattled around in
Hooters, which seats 250.
</P>
<P>
   That presents a particular problem for such a place, restaurant
experts suggest, because its costs are high and its revenues are
relatively low. Most of its entrees go for less than $10, and it
serves only beer and wine, not hard liquor, which is more
profitable. In court papers, Yudenfriend estimated that the
restaurant would take in about $140,000 in December.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is a big nut to cover: The rent is almost
$30,000 a month. And, because it is a franchise _ locally owned but
part of a chain _ the restaurant must also pay about $10,000 a
month in royalties to the mother ship in Atlanta. And all of that
is before the payroll, food, taxes, insurance and interest payments
on its loans. Total costs for December, Yudenfriend estimated,
would be almost $173,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most franchises are still a volume business,'' said Jeffrey
Bradach, a professor at Harvard Business School who has written a
book called ``Franchise Organizations'' (Harvard Business School
Press, 1998), which focuses on restaurants. ``Because they don't
have huge margins, they need people moving through the doors every
hour of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most important thing for a franchise, Bradach said, is
to match the concept of the restaurant to the demographics of the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Child-towing tourists do not seem to be flocking to Hooters. As
for the locals, well, New York's service economy is unusually
mixed, in terms of men and women working together, said Mitchell
Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University.
``I don't want to be harsh,'' he said, ``but there are too many
successful women in New York for men to be public about this. No
professional male can come home and say, `I went to Hooters.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hooters executives say that the biggest problem for the
Manhattan restaurant has been its location. The entrance and awning
are in a little courtyard on the north side of 56th Street, and its
signs are not very visible to anyone driving down Broadway or
Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The interior of the restaurant needed a lot of work, said
Droste, the Hooters founder, and ``the operator got very much
involved.'' As a result, he said, Yudenfriend may not have
concentrated on ``the promotional aspect we are famous for.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Yudenfriend's backers, however, suggest that he did not
get as much support from the home office as he might have expected,
given that the Manhattan restaurant was supposed to be Hooters'
marquee property. While Yudenfriend did have experience running a
Hooters _ he took over the one on Staten Island in 1996 _ Manhattan
is clearly a different market (for starters, the local Corvette
club is not likely to hold meetings in the parking lot).
</P>
<P>
   He has suffered some recent setbacks, according to papers his
lawyer filed in court early last month. A manager resigned
unexpectedly, the document says, and `` Yudenfriend was mugged
outside the Manhattan restaurant in the early morning of Dec. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hooters of America does pull Yudenfriend's franchise, as it
has threatened to do, that will not be the end of the restaurant
chain's efforts here, McNeil said, adding, ``Ultimately, we believe
Manhattan needs, wants and deserves a Hooters restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   But desire may not be enough. Expanding a chain from Atlanta to
Birmingham is one thing, said Ron Paul, president of Technomic, the
restaurant consulting firm. But New York City, he said, is
something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be offended, but we tell clients that it's like going
into an international location, in terms of culture, real estate,
laws,'' Paul said. ``It's very high risk to go into Manhattan.''

Florida State's Edwards maximizes final chance
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TEMPE, Ariz. _ Mario Edwards took a moment to soak it all in.
</P>
<P>
   The late-morning desert sunshine. The green grass below. The
colorful banners adorning Sun Devil Stadium as Monday night's
Fiesta Bowl game draws near.
</P>
<P>
   All of that was nice, the Florida State cornerback said, but the
cause of the smile on his face was something entirely different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most satisfying thing for me this year was just making it
back,'' he said. ``I told my mom and my brother that if I ever got
another chance, I'd make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Edwards had to wonder if that chance would come.
Worst of all, he knew he had no one to blame but himself if it
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   He was kicked out of school shortly before the 1997 opener after
a woman alleged that he had slapped and choked her. The incident
came on the heels of an arrest that same summer when he failed to
appear in court to answer petty theft charges from his use of a
cellular phone he found on a bus.
</P>
<P>
   Not a pretty picture, by any means.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I let a lot of people down,'' he says. ``When you're
young, you're going to make mistakes. The main thing is to learn
from them, and I think I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleading no contest in the phone matter, he got probation and
community service. The woman, in turn, never actually pressed
charges, but FSU's student judicial committee still suspended
Edwards for two semesters.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, then, he was in Tallahassee while the Seminoles
traveled to New Orleans to play Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl. The
road to Tempe would begin with a modest goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I was thinking about,'' Edwards said, ``was doing whatever
I could to get back to Florida State.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, he passed 10 hours of classes at Tallahassee
Community College in the spring. He added eight more in the summer
to regain his eligibility, convincing coach Bobby Bowden to give
him another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Omitted from the 1998 media guide and depth chart, Edwards
nevertheless reclaimed his starting job early in the season and has
been a big part of the Seminoles' No. 1-rated defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incident made me a better person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to be a decent player, too. In the course of
redeeming himself, he set a school record with four interceptions
against Wake Forest and narrowly missed a fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe they kept throwing at me,'' he said with a
smile. ``It wasn't Christmas yet, but it felt like it.''
</P>
<P>
   After helping the Seminoles bottle up Florida in the game that
proved to be the springboard for this national title run, Edwards
faces yet another challenge Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's Tee Martin has emerged as a credible passing threat
in the season's second half. Wide receiver Peerless Price (10
touchdowns) has been the Vols' big-play man in complementing a
strong running game. In what is expected to be a low-scoring game,
a big play in the passing game _ either way _ could make the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good, but I think our defense has proven that we can
stop anyone,'' Edwards said. ``Our secondary was a problem the last
couple of years, but I think we're a strength now.''
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight beckons. Even as it does, though, this participant
on college football's biggest stage already has plenty to
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't realize how much you miss something until it's taken
away,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Edwards understands. In case you didn't know, it's written
all over his face.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Not since the 1920s has the sunlight glinted so
brightly from San Francisco's City Hall dome, a shapely structure
taller than the 90-foot dome of the capitol in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The gold leaf shining when the building opened in 1915 simply
washed away over those first two decades, undone by wet winters and
questionable early-century technology.
</P>
<P>
   But the glow is back on the landmark building and its dome,
which were closed for more than three years of renovation.
Beginning at noon on Tuesday, San Franciscans will once again be
able to step inside their Beaux-Arts seat of government to dispute
a water bill, pay taxes, get married or buy a dog license.
</P>
<P>
   The $500,000 spent on regilding the dome is a fraction of the
$293 million total cost of the project. The building received $207
million in structural improvements, made necessary by a deadly
earthquake in 1989, and another $85 million went into fixtures and
paint, furniture and lights, and computer and communication systems
ready for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation cost $100 million more than originally planned,
and controversy swirled for years over what City Hall should be _ a
functional, workaday civic hub, or an imposing public space in the
European tradition. San Franciscans will see both.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown drew public and political ire when he
proposed to reshape the ground floor as a near-regal setting for
welcoming dignitaries and throwing elaborate parties. Local
politicians reined him in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Brown wanted more ceremonial space,'' said Susan Leal,
the city treasurer and former city supervisor, noting that the
mayor wanted only 700 of 1,300 workers to return when the building
reopened, with the other 600 working in space rented in commercial
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Board of Supervisors insisted that every department
with citizen interaction should be back in the building,'' Ms. Leal
said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 city workers will have returned by Tuesday, and
300 municipal court employees have moved to a new building across
the street.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor could not be reached for comment on the renovation.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the carping and political skirmishes, the results of
the renovation seem likely to please even the most demanding
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Temko, one of San Francisco's most respected architecture
critics, praised the renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Temko said. ``I love the gold, the old oak
furniture, the elegant spaces, the restored light courts with their
skylights. But the real triumph is in the strengthening of the
building seismically and structurally.''
</P>
<P>
   The building's seismic undoing came in an the fall of 1989, with
the Loma Prieta earthquake. That rolling temblor killed more than
50 people, stopped a World Series game before it started and
destroyed or damaged buildings throughout the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall was one of the quake's more visible victims, safe
enough for interim habitation but clearly cracked. Corridors shrank
with the installation of temporary bracing, and the elegant dome
inspired more fear than awe. After the earthquake, people raced
across the patterned limestone of the rotunda floor on their way to
the grand staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Irons, a city architect and the project manager for the
renovation, told visitors that the real beauty of the building lies
in what is not seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ultimate goal has been to make City Hall look as though no
architect had been involved in the rebuilding,'' Irons said.
</P>
<P>
   Working from the original blueprints, contractors stripped away
acres of Vermont marble to get at the steel core, then installed
giant rubber and steel shock absorbers under each of nearly 600
beams and columns at the base of the building. The result: a steel
building clad in its original marble, limestone and Sierra granite,
and resting on high-tech cushions that will keep it from moving
when the next ``big one'' comes.
</P>
<P>
   The building's status as a national landmark dictated that every
lamp and railing and bit of carved wood had to be kept as it was,
refinished or repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Gladys Hansen, the city's archivist emeritus and director of the
Museum of the City of San Francisco, said San Francisco needed
something new to brag about. ``We've lived too long on the
reputation of our bridges,'' she said.

FORECASTERS SEE BLUE-CHIPS CONTINUING TO RALLY  
(FOR RELEASE ON MONDAY, JAN.4.)
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen did not flinch in August when the stock market
sank. Instead, Ms. Cohen, the chief investment strategist at
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., telephoned her clients and told them the same
thing she told them a year earlier when the market seemed to be in
free fall: ``Stay the course.''
</P>
<P>
   It has become a familiar refrain for Ms. Cohen, who has remained
steadfast in her bullishness even when others have turned bearish.
And what should investors expect this year?
</P>
<P>
   ``When we do a retrospective of 1999 we'll be saying, `It wasn't
so bad after all,''' she said in a telephone interview late last
year. ``We see profits continuing to grow in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   After combing through an array of charts and graphs, her
statistical crystal ball, Ms. Cohen predicted an unprecedented
fifth consecutive year of solid gains for blue-chip stocks, even
though profit growth will continue to moderate. By the end of the
year, she said, the Dow Jones industrial average could reach 9,850
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index could climb to 1,275.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ms. Cohen said that the Dow, one of the most widely
followed market barometers, would end the year at 9,300. (It ended
at 9,181.43.) She also predicted that the S&AMP;P 500, which most index
funds track, would finish the year at 1,200. (It ended at
1,229.23.)
</P>
<P>
   She has not been alone in forecasting a prolonged bull market.
Edward M. Kerschner, the chief investment strategist at Paine
Webber, has also had relatively accurate predictions, bucking the
trend toward pessimism when the Asian economic crisis appeared. He,
too, was projecting modest gains for stocks this year, noting that
the big shift of cash into equities (spurred by baby boomers) could
continue for the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Another prescient Wall Street forecaster is Laszlo Birinyi, a
former Salomon Brothers technician, who now heads his own research
and money management firm in Greenwich, Conn. By following the
amount of cash rushing into certain stocks, Birinyi has been able
to discern trends in buying sentiment _ trends that have made him
an unrepentant bull, even during sharp downturns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still very positive,'' Birinyi said, adding that the
blue chips would continue to lead the rallies. ``When the market
goes down, people continue to buy stocks, you see investors
manifesting their views about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who see nothing impressive in the actions of these
bulls, consider this: Almost every other Wall Street strategist has
forecast that the sharp increase in stock prices that began in
October 1990, with the Dow at 2,365.10, would surely collapse into
a bear market. Valuations, they said, were too high. They said it
in 1995. 1996. 1997. And 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, for example, Barton M. Biggs, the chief global
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said: ``If this has been
a year of moonlight and roses, next year, I expect, is going to be
sackcloth and ashes. In other words, the huge brutal hug of a bear
market will squeeze some.''
</P>
<P>
   The same year Ralph J. Acampora, the widely followed technician
at Prudential Securities, predicted a Dow 10,000 by 1998, and then
had a change of heart in August, after the Dow passed 9,300,
declaring himself a bear and warning that the Dow could fall 20
percent. ``It was the toughest call I've ever made, but I didn't
flip-flop,'' Acampora said. ``I market-time, that's my job. I saved
my clients a lot of agony.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, concerns about a global economic crisis caused the Dow
to fall 19 percent from its all-time high in August and September,
before it roared back in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   During the downturn, Ms. Cohen was resolute. She moved swiftly
to calm investors' fears, calling the decline a short-term ``market
event'' and not a real threat to the economy or the thriving bull
market in equities.
</P>
<P>
   That most strategists would expect a sharp and prolonged
downturn is only natural. Few other bull markets have roared so
fast for so long. And if one listens to Ms. Cohen, that run is not
over yet. ``Where our forecast ends, there is no recession in
sight,'' she said. ``The U.S. economy is strong. I believe in
business cycles; I just don't think this cycle is ending in the
next 12 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen said she expected more of the same this year: steady
earnings growth, with profits up about 5 percent from a year
earlier; a steady economy, and stable interest rates _ a recipe for
the strong rise of share prices.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Ms. Cohen said that investors should be comforted by
the nation's economy, which she likened to a ``supertanker'': It
wasn't the fastest or most colorful ship at sea, but it was the
strongest and the steadiest. This year's metaphor? ``Supertanker
revisited,'' she said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be much more comfortable this year, she
contended, having worked off a great deal of anxiety during the
downturn in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   How exactly does Ms. Cohen forecast what will happen 3, 6 or 12
months out? Ms. Cohen said she had developed statistical and
intellectual models, models that weigh economic trends, cash flows
into mutual funds, corporate earnings and other variables that
could propel or eventually upset the apple cart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing we do is deciding which of the things
we look at are the most important, the critical variable,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, every Wall Street strategist has a model, but Ms.
Cohen said she sweated all the details. She creates her own
measurement of corporate earnings growth, and tries to identify the
variables that may eventually undermine her projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do is a combination of science and art,'' she said.
``Many investors believe if they only have the numbers they can get
all the answers, but there are also critical variables.''
</P>
<P>
   Such variables, she says, could include earnings, the global
economy, wage growth _ almost any statistic or trend in business
and the economy. The real trick, she says, is in learning how to
use those details to construct a forecast.
</P>
<P>
   An important and early lesson came when Ms. Cohen was working at
the Federal Reserve Board in the 1970s. Some of the best
econometricians had devised an enormously successful forecasting
model that suddenly did not work. Ms. Cohen helped try to find out
why. The reason, she and other staff members later determined, was
that the forecast was based on a particular inflationary
environment, and when that environment changed, the model failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great lessons I learned is that you can have
sophisticated models and they might not work,'' she said. ``I view
our work as: Let's try this disciplined scientific approach, and
then let's try intellectual approaches as to why it won't work.''

 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You would think that after last year's more than $2.4 trillion
in announced mergers worldwide _ the largest on record _ corporate
executives might take 1999 off. Think again.
</P>
<P>
   With the stock market for the most part continuing its upward
march, investors can expect even more mergers in the next 12
months. But unlike last year, when mergers were concentrated
primarily in the telecommunications, banking and insurance
industries, the frenzy this year will spread to other industries as
well, merger professionals say.
</P>
<P>
   Even more international combinations are expected in the months
ahead, along with a shift in activity to include industrial
companies as well as increased activity in the burgeoning
high-technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you assume a reasonably stable market environment for a
good part of the year, it will be good for the merger market,''
said Stephen Volk, a senior partner at the New York law firm of
Shearman &AMP; Sterling. ``Chief-executive confidence is quite high
now, and it is a major predictor of deals getting done.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of what has driven the megamerger boom in the United States
is the effort by corporations to fend off competition from larger
rivals by combining. As a result, regional companies will continue
to turn their attention away from their home market in the hopes of
quickly establishing a national, if not international, presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing becomes important,'' said Steven Wolitzer, head of
global mergers and acquisitions at Lehman Brothers. ``The ability
to build your business first becomes important to really create the
winners. It's a mad scramble to get there quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Witness the flurry of activity after Nationsbank bought and
merged into BankAmerica in a $60 billion stock deal or after SBC
Communications announced its intent to acquire Ameritech for $62
billion in stock, a deal the Federal Communications Commission is
reviewing.
</P>
<P>
   Investors can expect even more activity, particularly in
pharmaceuticals, health care, utilities and energy _ the latter
recently evidenced by the $80 billion planned merger of Exxon and
Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our themes has been the everyday nature of this
activity,'' said Mac Heller, co-chief operating officer of the
investment banking division and head of global mergers and
acquisitions at Goldman, Sachs. ``Yes, the numbers are spectacular,
but it is no more spectacular to have a $70 billion deal in 1998
than it was to have a $10 billion deal in 1984.''
</P>
<P>
   More U.S. executives are expected to turn their attention to
foreign concerns. That's in part because more European companies
have set their sights on the United States as well as on their
next-door neighbors, in an effort to extend beyond national borders
_ a trend that will only grow as Europe moves closer to a common
market.
</P>
<P>
   A unified Europe ``requires companies to look at themselves and
become larger and more competitive,'' said John Studzinski, head of
European investment banking at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``There
will be more profound consolidation in the midsize sector.''
</P>
<P>
   The courtship has already begun, for companies of all sizes.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a spate of recently announced pharmaceutical
combinations in Europe, including the $35 billion planned
acquisition of Astra of Sweden by the London-based Zeneca Group,
and the agreement to combine the drug and agricultural units of
Hoechst of Germany and Rhone-Poulenc of France.
</P>
<P>
   And while European companies have always been attracted to U.S.
targets, they are finally going after them in a big way. In
December for instance, Scottish Power announced its intent to
acquire Pacificorp, which operates in the Pacific Northwest and is
one of the United States' biggest power companies, for $7.9
billion. If approved it would be the first purchase of a U.S.
utility by a foreign company. And Deutsche Bank said it would buy
Bankers Trust for $10.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Such cross-border combinations will be anything but easy to pull
off as companies grapple with inconsistent accounting, legal and
regulatory rules in the home countries. And there are sure to be
social and political ramifications as foreign workers and their
bosses alike become accustomed to the American-style corporate
reorganizations of the 1980s, which turned many companies into
leaner operations _ but only after major cost-cutting and huge
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Technology will continue to be an active area for mergers, too,
but these combinations present their own complications, industry
experts say. For one thing, technology stocks are quite volatile,
and anyone seeking a merger partner is subject to unpredictable
downside risk because of the often short life span of technology
products. That is why activity in the industry has mostly consisted
of weaker companies being acquired by stronger concerns. This is
likely to change as the industry matures.

FOR LADY VOLS' HOLDSCLAW, A HOMECOMING OF SORTS AT THE GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She knows it would make for a nice, romantic story,
but Chamique Holdsclaw cannot tell a lie. She did not grow up
dreaming about playing basketball in Madison Square Garden, did not
go to Knicks games often as a child and will not feel jitters,
tingles or any other manifestation of awe when she steps onto the
famed court for the first time in her career.
</P>
<P>
   Although she is excited about playing in the Garden, Holdsclaw
has been too many places and done too many things to be overwhelmed
by the setting. So the heralded senior from Astoria, Queens, said
there will be no pressure to put on a show for the hometown crowd
when Tennessee plays Rutgers on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I play the worst game of my life, life goes on,'' said
Holdsclaw, who will play in New York for only the second time since
joining the Lady Vols nearly four years ago. ``I know what I can
do, everybody knows what I can do, they know what this team can do.
So it's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's no stretch to assume that, pressure or not, Holdsclaw
will put on a show, one that will leave the more than 11,000 fans
who have already purchased tickets begging for the Liberty to find
a way to snag the three-time all-American in the next Women's
National Basketball Association draft.
</P>
<P>
   The game between second-ranked Tennessee (10-1) and 15th-ranked
Rutgers (10-2) will be the first women's collegiate basketball game
at the Garden since December 1981. It is fitting that the event is
being billed as ``Holdsclaw's Homecoming,'' for Holdsclaw is the
reason for the game.
</P>
<P>
   While recruiting the former Christ the King High School star,
Tennessee coach Pat Summitt promised she would schedule at least
one game in New York before Holdsclaw graduated. Last year, Summitt
fulfilled that promise when Tennessee rolled over host Manhattan by
50 points en route to posting its 39-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   But while the game, played before a sparse crowd in a middling
gymnasium, satisfied Holdsclaw, it was not enough for Summitt.
Holdsclaw had traveled south to help her win three national titles,
and the coach wanted to do something big for her star. So she began
attempting to secure a date at the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chamique truly deserves to play at the Garden,'' said Summitt,
whose teams have won 110 of 125 games since Holdsclaw joined the
program. ``For what she's meant to women's basketball, to our
program, to the kids here in New York City. She's been a terrific
role model. And what better place for Chamique to play in her
senior season?''
</P>
<P>
   Summitt likes Holdsclaw's casual approach toward playing in the
Garden _ such an attitude is more conducive to her star playing
well against Rutgers _ and admits that the biggest thrill may
belong to Holdsclaw's nearly 100 friends and family members who
will be in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she came south to Tennessee, a lot of people probably
thought they would never see her play again,'' Summitt said. ``It's
like she was going to the end of the earth. So a lot of the people
that care about her will enjoy getting to see her play again.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who sees Holdsclaw play enjoys it. At 6 feet 2 inches,
she is the torchbearer for a new type of women's player. With the
size of a forward and the skill and athleticism of a guard, she can
dominate from any spot on the court.
</P>
<P>
   After a few seasons of watching Holdsclaw bring the ball upcourt
like a point guard, sink mid-range jumpers like a small forward,
rebound like a power forward and post up like a center, the people
who put together Tennessee's media guide decided to list her as a
``guard/forward/center.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She can play and defend any position on the court,'' said Nell
Fortner, who coached Holdsclaw the past two summers on the United
States National team and will coach the Olympic team in 2000.
``She's 6-2 and runs the floor like a gazelle. She works the
baseline of a zone offense beautifully. She's very fluid and very
sound fundamentally. She can get a shot whenever she wants to.''
</P>
<P>
   Already Tennessee's career rebounding leader with 1,114,
Holdsclaw needs to average only 10 points a game the rest of the
season to surpass Allan Houston's career scoring mark of 2,801
points. She enters Sunday's game averaging 21.9 points and 8.7
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw's most impressive number, however, is seven, for the
seven consecutive championships she has won dating back to high
school. She led Christ the King to four state championships and one
mythical national title in USA Today. She has never ended her
season with a loss.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, she spread her name throughout the rest
of the basketball-playing world by leading the United States
National team to a silver medal in the World Qualifying Tournament.
The only collegiate player on the team, she averaged team highs in
scoring (13.1) and rebounding (6.5). Last summer, she again joined
a group of professionals in helping the United States win the gold
medal at the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Fortner, who watched the Lady Vols practice Saturday at the New
York Athletic Club, said Holdsclaw is a strong candidate for the
next Olympic team, one of the top two or three players in the
history of women's college basketball, and a future star in the
WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   While Holdsclaw tempered her enthusiasm about playing in the
Garden tomorrow, she admitted that playing there on a regular basis
as a member of the Liberty would get her blood rushing. ``I would
love to play here in New York,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And New York would love to have her.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 2:
</P>
<P>
   All 700 hotel rooms in Tonga are booked for next New Year's Eve.
This is unhappy news for people who had toyed with the idea of
being right on the spot when the new millennium crosses the
international date line. Many New York City residents, having heard
that 46 percent of all American pleasure travelers would like to
celebrate the great event in Times Square, have undoubtedly also
started thinking that Tonga would be a very nice place to be. Too
late.
</P>
<P>
   This week's spate of reports on hotels and cruises that are
booked for Dec. 31, 1999, have created a sort of pre-millennial
panic among those of us who have failed to plan. Not a minute to
waste _ the Imperial Ball in Vienna is almost sold out, and Machu
Picchu is going fast. People who have not ventured outside on New
Year's Eve since they graduated from college are suddenly worrying
about being excluded from the festivities at the Great Pyramid. New
Yorkers who would rather be flayed than spend the evening in Times
Square with several hundred thousand strangers somehow find the
idea more attractive when the number threatens to be 17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Millennial anxiety disorder (is somebody going to name it MAD?)
will become worse as the date draws nearer and we are forced to
confront additional examples of the great time in store for people
who thought ahead, like Edward Woodyard. Woodyard, a writer who
lives in the New York suburbs, reserved his family's room at the
Marriott Hotel overlooking Times Square in 1983. The move was
particularly prescient since the hotel had not yet been built. Yes,
friends laughed at Woodyard 16 years ago, but now they are sending
him Christmas cards congratulating him on his good fortune and
dropping hints about their availability.
</P>
<P>
   The next public opinion poll will probably reveal that 37
percent of all Americans think the best place to be on New Year's
Eve is in the Woodyard suite.

A TRICKY TIME FOR OIL-INDUSTRY FORECASTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 4)  
(mk) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the oil industry, it was the year of the unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought that crude oil would plunge below $11 a
barrel? That Exxon Corp. would agree to acquire Mobil Corp. for $80
billion, reuniting the two biggest pieces of the Standard Oil
Trust? That the crown prince of Saudi Arabia would court Western
oil companies, seeking new investments in his country? That a new
alliance between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
and nonmember nations like Mexico would emerge to try to push
through cuts in oil production?
</P>
<P>
   Whether these developments will lead to more surprises depends,
of course, on the price of oil.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey of 31 analysts by First Call Corp., the
average price projection for 1999 is $15.05 a barrel, slightly
above the average of about $14.40 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ann-Louise Hittle, director of world oil at Cambridge Energy
Associates, a consulting group, sees prices remaining under more
pressure than Wall Street's consensus estimate. She has projected
an average price of about $13 a barrel for light sweet crude oil
for the coming year if OPEC decides at its meeting in March to keep
production at the currently reduced levels.
</P>
<P>
   But if OPEC members cannot agree to keep these cutbacks in
effect, she said, then the price could fall below $10 a barrel _ a
further economic shock to the oil-producing countries. If OPEC and
other producers decide, however, to cut production more, making
even less oil available, then Ms. Hittle expects the average to go
above $14 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   With the oil market in turmoil, some analysts say forecasts
about prices and the industry are difficult to make _ especially
since many 1998 forecasts were far off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``If next year is anything like this year, we should look for
the opposite on every one of these issues,'' said John Hervey, an
analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in London.
</P>
<P>
   If that contrarian view is the case, here are some
possibilities, seemingly as unthinkable as the events of 1998:
</P>
<P>
   Despite predictions, other big companies may wait before rushing
into huge mergers like the Exxon-Mobil deal. The Saudis may open up
more of their industry to investment than most top industry
executives now expect. OPEC may be replaced by a stronger new group
that includes major new producers like Mexico, Norway and Russia.
And prices may recover faster than expected, and the industry may
have to scramble to keep up with surging demand.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, most of the industry is still trying to survive in a
world of sustained low prices and only modest growth in demand.
</P>
<P>
   The largest private oil company, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, said
last month that it would sell 40 percent of its chemical business,
cut some of its 105,000 employees and take charges of $4.5 billion
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, thousands of jobs will be cut by Texaco, Conoco,
Shell and Chevron. British Petroleum and Amoco, whose merger was
approved on Wednesday by the Federal Trade Commission, plan to shed
6,000 jobs. Exxon and Mobil anticipate cutting 9,000 jobs after
their merger and saving about $2.8 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts and consultants wonder whether such severe
cutbacks will leave the companies unprepared when demand picks up.
</P>
<P>
   It was only last spring that the industry was worried that not
enough sophisticated drilling rigs and skilled crews would be
available to meet their exploration programs.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, most major companies have announced plans to spend
less on exploration this year by stretching out the completion of
projects already begun. Accordingly, they have laid off skilled
workers, some of whom had gone through expensive retraining.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Everybody is pulling in their horns and lowering their costs
just as quickly as they can,'' said David Moore, a partner at
Andersen Consulting who specializes in energy. ``The big danger is
losing people to other industries. If Asia got back on a
fast-growth track, it's very hard to recover human talent when it
disappears into other industries.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a danger that the oil service industry, which had
finally decided to build new equipment, will again pull back and
dismiss welders and other skilled workers it has spent the last two
years bringing back into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fleet of offshore supply boats is between 15 to 20 years
old,'' Moore said. ``There are no new boats being built, and there
will be shortages of certain types of equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the past is any guide, such warnings will be ignored by
industry executives, many of whom are preoccupied with cutting
costs for short-term gains rather than focusing on long-term
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   J. Robin West, chairman of Petroleum Finance Co. Ltd., a
consulting group, said companies had little choice but to cut
expenses since crude oil prices could stay low well into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added: ``You have to take risks in the process. The
people who will make the money are the ones that take the risk
now.'' Keeping a company growing for the long term while cutting
back in the short term is ``extremely difficult to do,'' he said.
``There are very few who can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard times for the industry have been a boon to consumers
because of cheaper gasoline prices, which are averaging less than
$1 a gallon in many parts of the country. Adjusted for inflation,
gasoline is as cheap as it was in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   As always, political developments in the Middle East and Russia
could send oil prices sharply higher.
</P>
<P>
   With the average fuel economy of all vehicles dropping in recent
years because of the growing popularity of sport utility vehicles
and with energy use rising despite advances in technology, the U.S.
economy is becoming more vulnerable to such spikes in the price of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, as Merribel Ayres, president of Lighthouse Energy
Group, another consulting group, put it, is that ``people will get
in the habit of enjoying the glut.''

-- Sen. John McCain, who is putting together a committee to assess
his chances as a Republican presidential candidate, talks to
reporters at a gathering of conservatives on Friday. The gathering
was dubbed the Dark Ages when it began three years ago, but the
organizers, conscious of the signals that the name sent, dropped
the parody this year in an attempt to give themselves an identity
that is not Clinton-dependent. (Jeff Topping/New York Times Photo)

Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, looks on
as President Clinton addresses reporters about operations in
Bosnia-Herzegovina in December 1997. Heeding warnings from the
nation's military chiefs, including the need to address increased
operations from Bosnia to Iraq, President Clinton has decided to
propose the first real increase in the Pentagon's budget in nearly
a decade and the largest since the Cold War buildup of the
mid-1980s, administration and defense officials said. At center is
former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles. (Todd

field which is now rarely in use. Throughout the Caspian region,
both the promise and the looming dangers of the Caspian oil bonanza
are palpable. Many promises of a better society are being made by
regional leaders. But they acknowledge that no plans are in place
to assure such hopes. (Staton R. Winter/New York Times Photo)

Tuck Donnelly, of Northwest Food Strategies, standing near a

1-1 -- A fertilizer loading station in Nebraska City sits near the
Missouri River. Big changes are coming to America's longest river.
The fracas over its future is fierce as environmentalists, farmers,
barge operators, recreation boosters, hydroelectric utilities,
Indian tribes and municipal leaders are all trying to make sure the
river stays-- or becomes -- what they want it to be. (Fred R.

Methadone is a bridge to a new life, but there are many other
rivers to cross. All of which goes a long way toward explaining why
methadone has long been caught in the cross-currents of social

NY-BRITISH, 1-1 -- Myers of Keswick serves pork pie along with
other British favorites. The alienation felt by British ex-pats,
made into a hit song by the performer Sting 10 years ago in a song
called ``Englishman in New York,'' is no longer the case. These
days, downtown New York is also known by some as ``Little London.''

PRINCE-WILLIAM-FANS, 1-1 -- Dana Lautin, 15, has her room filled
with reminders of Britain's Prince William, the 16-year-old heir to
England's throne. Prince William crept into the consciousness of
American girls, many of them not yet teen- agers, shortly after the
death of his mother, Diana, the Princess of Wales. His stoic
suffering touched their hearts. (Marilyn K. Yee/New York Times

Texas erases bitter memories
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DALLAS _ For Texas fans, Friday's Southwestern Bell Cotton Bowl was
as good as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades of bad memories that have haunted the Longhorns were
erased in a 38-11 triumph over Mississippi State, the biggest
margin of victory for Texas in its 20 Cotton Bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that 46-3 loss to Miami in the 1991 Cotton Bowl? Forget
it. Or how about those seven consecutive victories by longtime
Texas nemesis Jackie Sherrill? Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   It was a damp and dreary day in Dallas, but it was almost
perfect as far as the Longhorns (9-3) were concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous finish to a great year for us,'' said UT
coach Mack Brown. ``I think we have become one of the best teams in
the country, and I hope the rankings will reflect it.''
</P>
<P>
   The first season of the Brown era and the final season for
Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams and receiver Wane McGarity
ended in style in front of 72,611 wet spectators. Williams rushed
for 203 yards and two touchdowns, and McGarity had TD catches of 59
and 52 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was voted the Offensive Player of the Game, and Texas
linebacker Aaron Babino, who led the team with nine tackles, was
the Defensive Player of the Game.
</P>
<P>
   It also was a day that showed the promise of a bright future in
a baby-faced redshirt freshman who played like a seasoned veteran.
Texas quarterback Major Applewhite completed 15 of 26 passes for
225 yards and three TDs without an interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big step for our team,'' Applewhite said. ``If I had
to put a word on this season, it would be historic. It has been
historical and magical. This is a great moment for Texas football,
especially going 9-3 coming off of last year's 4-7 season.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which entered the game ranked No. 20 in the nation,
dominated the 25th-ranked Bulldogs (8-5) in every phase of the
game. The UT defense, which started the year as the team's weak
point, held MSU to 87 yards rushing and kept the Bulldogs out of
the end zone until late in the fourth quarter, long after the
outcome had been decided.
</P>
<P>
   It also was a day when the Longhorns ended their long drought
against teams coached by Sherrill, who had defeated Texas in seven
consecutive meetings _ five with Texas A&AMP;M and two with MSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I just need to soothe and heal some feelings of our
players,'' Sherrill said. ``The only thing I didn't like was (the
UT fans) singing at the end, saying, `Poor Aggies.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill was mistaken. The fans were chanting, ``Poor Jackie.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas led 14-3 at halftime, thanks to McGarity's two long TD
receptions. But the game was decided in the third quarter when UT
outscored MSU 24-0 while Williams rushed for 104 yards and scored
both of his touchdowns _ on a 37-yard run and a two-yard plunge.
</P>
<P>
   McGarity set the tone of the day with two big plays in the first
half when the Longhorns burned Mississippi State's blitz.
</P>
<P>
   On a first-and-10 at the Texas 41, Applewhite found McGarity
open on a deep post pattern. McGarity caught the pass in full
stride at the MSU 20 and was two steps ahead of MSU cornerback
Kendall Roberson, who was expecting deep help from safety Anthony
Derricks. But Derricks was a step too late to get McGarity, who
sprinted to the end zone to make it 7-0 with 2:17 to go in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   McGarity burned the Bulldogs again in the second quarter,
turning a short pass into a 52-yard TD.
</P>
<P>
   On second-and-13 at the Texas 48, he caught a quick out for what
looked like a five-yard gain. But McGarity broke the attempted
tackle of cornerback Kendall Roberson, turned inside and scooted
past two other MSU defenders for clear sailing to the end zone,
giving the Longhorns a 14-0 lead with 5:11 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play a defense that takes lot of chances with blitzing,''
McGarity said. ``We took advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Applewhite was making all the right decisions, MSU
freshman quarterback Wayne Madkin was struggling. Madkin, who was
replaced by Matt Wyatt in the second and fourth quarters, finished
4-of-16 passing for 49 yards and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said all along that the freshman quarterback who played the
best would give his team the best chance to win,'' Sherrill said.
``Wayne struggled with his third-down conversions today, and Major
had a great game. But Major also has a lot of help around him out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt was in the game both times MSU scored _ on a 39-yard field
goal by Brian Hazelwood late in the second quarter and a five-yard
TD pass to Lahitia Grant with 5:07 to play.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas was in control from start to finish. The Longhorns did
not have turnover on a day when they amassed 463 yards of offense.
</P>
<P>
   And with Applewhite and McGarity beating the MSU blitz in the
first half when the Bulldogs were stacking the line of scrimmage,
things opened up for Williams in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the two TDs by Williams, Texas also scored
third-quarter points on a 47-yard field goal by Kris Stockton and
an 18-yard TD pass from Applewhite to Kwame Cavil after the defense
held MSU on a fourth-and-one play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mississippi State wanted to intimidate us,'' said UT guard Ben
Adams. ``They started the game doing a lot of talking, but we
decided we would just shut our mouths and go right at them. In the
second half, we just came out and mashed them. When you have our
310-pound guys going against their 250-pound defensive linemen, it
happens that way eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday marked the last game for 23 Texas seniors, including
seven starters on offense and two on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first day I arrived on campus, I heard about the
great history Texas has at the Cotton Bowl,'' Adams said. ``To
finally get back here in our last game and to win like this is
something all the seniors will cherish.''

ON BRINK OF MILLENNIUM, IT'S JUST ANOTHER DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nothing ages faster than the ephemera of New Year's
Eve. The discarded funny hats by dawn seem like ancient relics, the
sequined gowns as odd as the discarded styles of some justifiably
forgotten decade.
</P>
<P>
   But even as friends put their heads on each other's shoulders
and fell asleep on the subway, and others talked too fast so they
could stay awake for just a few more minutes, the world moved
ahead. The night before became nothing more than another night
before.
</P>
<P>
   At the brink of day on Friday, if you asked just about anybody
what they thought of being on the brink of a new century and
millennium, they said it seemed pretty much like any other year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the next 100 years will be any different than
the 100 years that came before,'' said John Bajrami, 41, who was
fishing on the Coney Island Pier.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bajrami appeared to change tacks. He said he thought that
technology would do amazing things, but that there would continue
to be fewer and fewer fish. Once, he supported himself by selling
fish he caught. His catch on Friday: ``three lousy herring.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the kind of thing one heard again and again Friday.
People profess not to care about time's passage, and then give
clear evidence that they see their own lives as a voyage through
time. Some think the world will become a crazier place as the
millennium nears. Some foresee awesome improvements.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the pier stood Ron Rogers, a 28-year-old
unemployed actor. He held a video camera, and was waiting for
sunrise. It was cold and clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``After such a terrible year, I wanted to see the first
sunrise,'' he said. ``Things still look pure. I feel some type of
hope.'' The millennium?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is so worried that the world is going to end. The
question is: What if it doesn't? What will you have done with your
life?''
</P>
<P>
   On the beach were five Buddhists, who had come to pray. They
brought wine and food to give to their ancestors. ``I am looking
back on my life and where I have been,'' said Man Hee, a
34-year-old artist who lives in Greenwich Village. ``I'm also
looking ahead to where I'm going.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two blocks away, on 15th Street, more than a half-dozen
fire trucks could be seen. Victor Estrada, 58, watched his
apartment burn. He told of his cat, Simon, going under the bed. An
asthmatic, Estrada could not breathe. He dived through a window and
got out down the fire escape, leaving the cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about me or where I live,'' Estrada said. ``Man,
what do I say to my cat?''
</P>
<P>
   Four blocks to the east, there is a luncheonette called The
Islander. It is the kind of place where waitresses remember exactly
what customers want. Jokes are familiar enough that they no longer
need punch lines.
</P>
<P>
   A customer told Wanda Feliciano, a waitress, about the fire. She
hurried to the phone to call a friend who lived there. The friend
was fine.
</P>
<P>
   A subway conductor shuffled in, rubbing his eyes. ``What a
train,'' he said. ``Everybody who could have vomited did.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feliciano preferred to talk about her hopes for the new
year. ``The new year has got to bring peace,'' she said. ``We've
got to get rid of all the bombs and stop destroying people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this year they'll find a cure for AIDS and cancer and
all those diseases,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and one more thing. ``I hate this job,'' she said, smiling
mischievously at her boss.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the counter were two discarded glittery top hats, as old as
time.
</P>
<P>
   In Times Square, little bits of confetti remained, though the
mountains of it had disappeared. The shattered glass of a cheap
wine bottle was next to a champagne magnum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a lot of unexpected things happening this
year,'' said Kenny Lever, 21, a student at Dowling College.
</P>
<P>
   In 1899, Rutherford discovered alpha and beta waves, Freud wrote
``The Interpretation of Dreams'' and the Philippines demanded
independence from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And 1999? ``Last night marked the beginning of an era,'' said
Kristy Bemis, 20, a college student from Utah in the Times Square
subway station. ``But we don't know what era.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Pommelle, who was in the same station, stressed the
uncertainty. ``I'll be honest with you,'' he said. ``No one knows
where we're headed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, people seemed anxious to keep on keeping on. A visit to
the Cub Room, a restaurant in SoHo, found a number of employees who
had worked until 3 or 4 a.m. at Thursday night's celebration, and
were back at work Friday by 9 a.m. Perhaps a bit bleary-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got three hours of sleep, and I feel great,'' said Cicely
Brooks, 21, a waitress who had had ridden four trains between the
restaurant and her home in the Bronx within a six-hour span.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got one hour, and I feel wonderful,'' said Billy Johnson, a
36-year-old waiter.
</P>
<P>
   Their boss, Gary Koenigsberg, was less Pollyanna-ish. ``It's
obviously not the most fun day of the year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it beats living in Central Park in Friday's frigid weather.
At the park's lagoon, where Holden Caulfield in ``The Catcher in
the Rye'' worried about what would happen to the ducks in the cold
weather, a homeless man threw them bread.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his name was Khanbais Wadu and that he and his
friends lived on a hill they called Holy Rock. He was waiting for a
church group to bring him a sandwich and juice. He said he had
hoped to hitch a ride to Florida with somebody coming here for the
celebration, but he had slept through it.
</P>
<P>
   Wadu said 1999 was going to be a year of abundant opportunity.
``It's like a threshold of a different beginning,'' he said.

FROM GOV. PATAKI'S INAUGURAL SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: With NY-INAUG) 
(rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the second inaugural address that
Gov. George Pataki gave Friday in Albany:
</P>
<P>
   On the Spirit of the State
</P>
<P>
   There's a spirit in New York today, and it runs strong.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same spirit of courage that prompted Colonial farmers
to lay down their plows and take up arms to confront and conquer
the forces of tyranny on a farm near Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same spirit of hope that inspired immigrants, like my
grandparents, to leave their homelands and endure the seas, knowing
that the shadow of adversity would give way to a light that glows
from a beacon hand in New York Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same spirit of liberty that drove New Yorkers like
Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass to dedicate their lives to
the pursuit of justice. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, seeking to renew that spirit, we charted a bold
new course for this state, a course driven by our determination to
see that government remains the people's servant and not their
master. Now we must commit ourselves to taking the next bold step
in the direction of New York's destiny, which _ as one New Yorker
expressed it _ was to create an atmosphere that is ``responsive to
every need of the people, and to the highest demands of that spirit
which drives us onward and upward.''
</P>
<P>
   That New Yorker was Gov. Theodore Roosevelt, and he spoke those
words 100 years ago to this very day as he delivered his inaugural
address to the people of this great state.
</P>
<P>
   On the Future
</P>
<P>
   As we march boldly into the next century, we will confront new
challenges and new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Our ability to meet those challenges and seize those
opportunities requires only that we believe in ourselves and the
capacity for greatness that lies within each and every New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   If we have the courage to believe that, and we do, then New York
is going to lead America, not just into a new millennium, but into
a new age of discovery, innovation and prosperity, into a future
brighter than even the most glorious days of our past.
</P>
<P>
   That is New York's destiny. Today, we renew our claim to it.
</P>
<P>
   A Statement of Beliefs
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, we said: ``Cut taxes and return economic freedom
to working families and they will strengthen our economy.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, we said: ``Rein in the long arm of government,
and the men and women of our business community will create jobs.''
. . .
</P>
<P>
   In four years, we have done well. We have rekindled the spirit
of New York. And for that we can be proud. But the progress that
guides our destiny has only just begun.
</P>
<P>
   Six days from now, I will ask the Legislature to build on that
progress by reaffirming our allegiance to deeply held, core
principles.
</P>
<P>
   We believe in people, not bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   We believe in raising hopes, not taxes.
</P>
<P>
   We believe in protecting the rights of victims, not the rights
of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   We believe in big opportunities, not big government. . . .
</P>
<P>
   With a century of opportunity on the horizon, we the people of
New York must light the way to a brighter future for the nation and
the world.

ONLY 361 DAYS TO SOLVE THE Y2K PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.C., Mass., Conn. Ariz.)  (For release Monday, Jan. 4) 
(DW) 
By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Information technology companies are spending heavily to avoid
the chaos that could be caused around the world by computers,
software programs and electronically controlled machinery being
confused by the transition to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the spending on Y2K, as the industry calls it, will go
toward heading off the problems that could come after Jan. 1, 2000.
Some companies and government agencies may also be forced to lay
out millions of dollars toward recovering from malfunctions this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Those unplanned outlays will pop up, Year 2000 consultants
predict, because many forward-looking scheduling, purchase order
and budget programs will trip up this month, or around April 1,
July 1 and Sept. 1, dates when most companies and governments open
the books on the fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for global trouble stems from the once-common
practice of using just two digits to refer to the year in dates,
like 99 for 1999. Many computers read 00 as 1900 instead of 2000.
Others cannot process 00 in the date field at all and reset their
clocks to 1980, the dawn of the personal computer age, or some
other date. Some simply freeze.
</P>
<P>
   The year may also be marred by the rollover to 0 this summer of
the calendars used in satellites that pinpoint the location of
mobile equipment, called global positioning satellites. The
satellite network's longest time unit is a week, not a year, and
the highest number it recognizes as a valid week will be reached in
August. The transition to week 0 could disrupt industries and
military systems that use the satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 9, 1999, is another possible land mine because many
computer programs treat a data entry of 9999 as a shorthand for end
of file or date unknown. Thus, office clerks, sales representatives
and other workers innocently entering orders and other information
for Sept. 9 may end up deleting huge amounts of data or causing
programs to crash.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom-line question for anyone in the information
technology business is how much of the spending on Year 2000 and
other date problems will come at the expense of other information
technology projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not expecting the bottom to fall out, but it will be a
definite speed bump for many I.T. products,'' said Louis E.
Marcoccio, global director for Year 2000 research at the Gartner
Group, an information technology consulting firm in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of information technology spending tend to vary widely
because of differences in sampling techniques and in what is
included.
</P>
<P>
   The International Data Corp., a market research firm based in
Framingham, Mass., projects that centralized corporate spending on
information technology will decline to just under 2 percent of
revenue but that strong growth in other areas, including home
offices, will lift total worldwide spending nearly 9.4 percent, to
$720.4 billion from $658.6 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Economics Inc., a smaller research firm based in
Carlsbad, Calif., which does not count home offices in its
estimates, expects just 3 percent growth, but puts the projected
total this year at $987 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner's Dataquest subsidiary estimates that information
technology spending by governments and businesses will climb more
than 14 percent from 1998, to about $1.27 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   There is general agreement, though, that the portion of the
corporate information technology budget going to solve Year 2000
problems rose rapidly last year and will peak somewhere between 20
percent and 40 percent of information technology spending this
year.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Gartner of 65,000 companies around the world
suggests that many of them will meet Year 2000 needs by postponing
purchases of new e-mail packages, software that generates data
supporting sales programs and similar decision-support
applications, investments in new telephone service centers and
logistics applications.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner expects large servers to continue to sell well
throughout 1999, along with information storage devices, which
could benefit from a rush to back up data. Companies in the midst
of deploying large enterprise software packages to link and
automate many activities may accelerate some investments to beat
the year 2000 deadline. But the slowdown in the growth of new
orders for such software, which began last year, should continue
for at least several quarters, Gartner said.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner also expects orders for mainframe computers and desktops
to weaken, then rebound next year.
</P>
<P>
   Others foresee an even tougher spending climate. ``About the
only thing we are not seeing postponed for next year is
E-commerce,'' said Kazim S. Isfahani, an analyst at Giga
Information Group in Cambridge, Mass., referring to applications
that allow companies to do business with suppliers and customers
over the Internet. Rapid investment in such software is widely seen
as strategically essential, Isfahani said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most optimistic view for vendors popped up in a
Gallup poll for Computer Reseller News, a trade publication, which
concluded that nearly four out of five large companies planned to
increase information technology spending to deal with the Year 2000
problem rather than cut back on new investments.
</P>
<P>
   That was probably wishful thinking. Information technology
spending accounts for just 2.3 percent of corporate revenue on
average, and many companies are budgeting for an increase in that
figure. But that does not mean they want to authorize a spending
spree just when recession in Asia and other uncertainties threaten
growth and profitability. And it would take a huge jump in
information technology budgets to keep all new projects on track,
given the projections by Gartner and others of the huge share that
will go to fix Year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   Cost pressures aside, companies are also reining in new
information technology investment because they do not have enough
skilled managers and technical workers to handle new projects on
top of the Year 2000 challenge and the usual load of maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Others are worried that new projects could introduce bugs that
compromise the reliability of the Year 2000 work they have
completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick for vendors will be to single out customers who are
ahead of the curve and point out which investments they can safely
go ahead with,'' Isfahani said.
</P>
<P>
   That could include the early stages of a wide variety of
enterprise and E-commerce projects that would not be deployed until
the year 2000 or later, agreed Thomas D. Oleson, chief researcher
for the corporate advisory service at International Data.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 distortions in spending patterns actually began to
show up in 1997 in the form of surging orders for enterprise
software _ packages that coordinate major business functions. Many
customers decided to attack their Year 2000 problem by replacing as
many older programs as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, though, it became too late to get enterprise software
up and running before the year 2000. Growth in new orders _ and
stock prices _ slumped for several vendors, including Peoplesoft
and J.D. Edwards &AMP; Company.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Dell Computer, Compaq Computer and other
makers of desktop computers enjoyed stronger-than-expected orders
last year from companies upgrading their computer networks as part
of Year 2000 preparations. That trend is expected to continue, at
least until the last few months of this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 impact will be felt most directly, of course, by
companies that have made remediation software and services a major
part of their business. Many, like Viasoft Inc. of Phoenix and the
Alydaar Software Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., saw their stock
prices tumble last fall as investors concluded that the best growth
prospects of the companies were over.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue, though, will be how successfully these companies
respond to the strategic challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Some have reconfigured the software programs they developed to
look for Year 2000 bugs into packages that can be used to verify
that repairs have been successful, a market that is likely to boom
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, companies that prospered on outsourced Year 2000
repair work are leveraging those contacts into other technical
support deals. Outsourcing mundane tasks like the maintenance of
existing programs may help pace-setting companies with the majority
of their Year 2000 investment behind them to accelerate other
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see an opportunity to get a year or two ahead of
competitors they think will have trouble with Y2K,'' said Michael
Erbschloe, director of research at Computer Economics. ``After
diverting so much attention to Y2K, management is hungry for
applications that will add to revenue.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
Malone Jr. granted release from Houston
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEAL FARMER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Clyde Drexler has gone through his first crisis as the University
of Houston's basketball coach and agreed to allow Moses Malone Jr.
to seek a scholarship elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone was concerned about his future,'' said
Drexler, who met on Thursday with Malone and his mother. ``We want
nothing but the best for him and want him to succeed. It was a
mutual parting, and we wish him nothing but the best. I think
things always turn out for the best. This is in his best interest,
I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone was unhappy with his playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was given a chance to show what I could do,''
said Malone, a guard who had a season-high 13 points at California.
``I didn't get an opportunity to play. And I don't think they were
interested in me for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone was benched against Sam Houston State early in the
season, supposedly because of his lack of defense. However, he
started against Portland State on Dec. 28 in the Lobo Invitational
at the University of New Mexico. But he did not play in the
championship game against the Lobos the following night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another reason to leave,'' Malone said. ``It was
unpredictable when you would play. I'm disappointed it came down to
this. I wanted to stay. I still love the school, but the decision
is best for me for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Drexler said Malone simply walked into a situation that was not
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything went wrong,'' Drexler said. ``I just
think there may have been some unfair expectations. When you get an
opportunity, you have to make the most of it. If you don't, you
have to learn. It's a learning process.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to have is a fair system. If you play well, you
play. If you don't play well, you sit. That's the system. The fact
that you are not happy with it, the door is always open. But there
is nothing but opportunity, and that's the only system that is
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he first thought of leaving after Houston lost at
Cincinnati 115-78 on Dec. 22. He decided to take his time and make
sure it was the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   Moses Malone Sr. said his son asked him some questions, but he
was not sure Malone Jr. would leave UH.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an 18-year-old son, all you can do is advise
him,'' said Malone Sr., a one-time Houston Rocket who declined a
scholarship at Maryland and jumped to professional basketball from
high school. ``It was his decision to go to UH and his decision on
the other part. He just wanted to showcase his talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not trying to influence him one way or the other. It was
his decision. Most young guys _ if they are players _ they want to
play. My son felt he was a good player. It's nothing against the UH
coaches or the school. I just want him to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone Jr. signed with UH out of Friendswood High School last
year when Alvin Brooks was the Cougars' head coach, and Drexler had
to convince him to keep his commitment after Brooks was fired.
Malone said he received his release at 1 p.m. Friday and already
has had contact with other programs in regard to transferring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I could decide by the end of the weekend,'' said
Malone, who would be eligible to play for his new school in
December 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler and his staff hope Malone's departure won't hurt team
chemistry. The Cougars (5-6) today play at DePaul at 4 p.m. and
will be attempting to end a 15-game road losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that everyone on our team liked Moses, for the
most part, and wishes him well,'' Drexler said. ``I just think a
lot of guys on the team are thinking, `Hey, I have a chance to get
the 10 minutes a game that he was getting.' For the most part, we
are going to miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said forward Kenny Younger, ``It will affect the chemistry a
little bit. Moses was getting some time, so we need to find someone
to fill in that spot and hopefully keep the chemistry going. He
came out here and gave 100 percent every day. He felt like the
situation wasn't good for him, so he decided to leave.''

WILLIAMS PROVES AWARDS TRAVELS NOT TOO DISTRACTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Ricky Williams admitted that his postseason revelry
might have left him out of shape going into preparations for the
Cotton Bowl. There was a trip to New York to pick up the Heisman
Trophy and another to Orlando, Fla., for a televised awards show.
</P>
<P>
   But he was his old self when the game started, rushing for 203
yards and two touchdowns in the Texas Longhorns' 38-11 victory
against Mississippi State yesterday. His performance earned him the
offensive player-of-the- game award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard on a radio show he was fat and out of shape,''
Longhorns coach Mack Brown said. ``I thought he looked pretty good
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Williams, ``Coming in here, I was hoping my pants still
fit. Luckily they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams also caught five passes for 45 yards, prompting someone
to ask Brown if there was anything his senior running back couldn't
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't come back next year; we already checked on that,''
Brown said. ``He can't sing either. I asked him to sing at a pep
rally and that was a mistake.'' Heisman winners Williams was the
seventh Heisman Trophy winner to play in the Cotton Bowl but only
the third to be on the winning side. Doak Walker led SMU to a 19-3
victory against Oregon in 1949, and Doug Flutie helped Boston
College defeat Houston, 45-28, in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Navy quarterback Roger Staubach, Texas running back Earl
Campbell, Auburn running back Bo Jackson and Notre Dame wide
receiver Tim Brown all lost in the Cotton Bowl. Offensive plan
Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis said the Longhorns' plan
yesterday was to come out passing and open things up for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We threw 20 passes in the first half because we wanted to
establish the fact we were two-dimensional and slow down their
blitzes,'' Davis said. ``We felt if we could do that, we could turn
the big boy loose behind that offensive line.'' Political football
Two former cheerleaders turned U.S. senators _ Sen. Trent Lott,
R-Miss., and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas _ participated in
the coin toss yesterday. Lott, now the head yell leader for the
anti-Clinton forces in Washington, was a cheerleader for the
University of Mississippi in the 1962 Cotton Bowl, and Hutchison
was a cheerleader for the University of Texas in the 1964 Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said they had a bet on the game, a bulldog puppy against a
Longhorn steer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part of a steer,'' Hutchison said. ``I want the whole
steer,'' Lott said. ``She's already trying to welch on the bet.'']
Walker honored Gov. George W. Bush declared yesterday Doak Walker
Day in Texas in honor of the former SMU Heisman Trophy winner who
died on Sept. 27. Yesterday marked the 50th anniversary of Walker's
final appearance in the Cotton Bowl, and it also would have been
his 72nd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's four children _ Russ, Scott, Kris Walcott and Laurie
Hunt _ attended the game and served as grand marshals of Thursday's
Cotton Bowl parade. The Cotton Bowl also painted Walker's No. 37 on
both 37-yard lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I crossed the 37-yard line I thought of him,'' said
Williams. Briefly Williams rushed for 104 yards in the third
quarter, marking the fifth time this season he's rushed for at
least 100 yards in a quarter. His 203 yards rushing are the most
ever by a Longhorns player in a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   Major Applewhite's 225 yards passing are the third-most by a
Longhorns player in a bowl game. He has thrown for at least 200
yards in 10 consecutive games, a school record.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns' 24 points in the third quarter are a Cotton Bowl
record.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns are 10-9-1 in the Cotton Bowl and 18-18-2 in bowls
overall. This was their first Cotton Bowl victory since beating
Alabama in 1982, and they are the first Texas team to win here
since Texas A&AMP;M defeated Notre Dame in 1988.

1990S MANTRA: BULL MARKET WILL CARRY ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Monday, Jan. 4)  
(ms) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The economy will probably cool and corporate profits will
probably slow, but stocks will stay in the stratosphere. That is
the dichotomy that market strategists believe is in store for
investors in the United States stock market this year.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of disconnect _ falling profit growth but rising stock
prices _ is familiar. After all, it was in the midst of last year's
disastrous third quarter, when corporate profits at America's
largest companies wound up falling an average of 3.2 percent, that
stocks shook off the bear-market blues and started soaring again.
The big-capitalization shares that make up both the Dow Jones
industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index took
off on Oct. 8 and by the end of the year had risen 18.7 percent and
28 percent, respectively, from their lows.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, the Dow Jones rose 16 percent and the S&AMP;P returned
nearly 26.7 percent. The biggest mover of them all was the Nasdaq
composite index, which gained a monumental 39.6 percent, largely on
the fortunes of technology stocks like Dell Computer, Intel and
Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Although the market has recovered nicely from its brush with the
bear last fall, corporate earnings have not rebounded nearly as
much. The final calculations for the fourth quarter will not be
tallied until February, but expectations are that full-year
earnings for S&AMP;P 500 companies averaged 5 percent, according to
Charles Hill, research director for the First Call Corporation,
which tracks earnings estimates. Many analysts and economists are
guessing that the rate of growth will be lower this year, an
average of 4.2 percent for stocks in the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings this tepid are obviously not enough on their own to
keep stock prices at or near current levels. But many strategists
think stock prices will remain high this year. After all, it is
that kind of market: Internet stocks such as Amazon.com and Ebay
Inc. have scant earnings, but they are the hottest issues around.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, something other than earnings has been propelling
equity prices for years. Consider this: Earnings for stocks in the
S&AMP;P 500 have been flat since early 1997, but during that time the
index has risen nearly 67 percent, from 737.01 to 1,229.01. Since
1995, the S&AMP;P has almost doubled, while average earnings are
expected to have advanced only 28 percent for the period.
</P>
<P>
   The factors other than earnings that have driven stocks to
historically high valuations will keep them aloft this year,
strategists say. The most significant factors are barrels of cash
on the sidelines earmarked for stocks, a continued explosion in the
growth of the nation's money supply and more corporate megamergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Astonishingly, after yet another good year in stocks, the
outlook going into next year is still pretty favorable,'' Byron R.
Wien, chief domestic investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter in New York, said late last year. ``My view is we'll have
another up year _ not a 20 percent year, but maybe a 10 percent
year'' for the S&AMP;P stocks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most market predictions are barely worth the paper
they're printed on. But Wien has proved fairly prescient on stock
movements recently. A year ago he predicted, among other things,
that technology stocks would re-emerge as market leaders and that
the Dow would roar to 9,000 in the spring, only to fall to 7,000
later in the year. Although he was wrong about the reason for the
decline in the Dow _ he thought inflation and rising interest rates
would be the culprits _ his numbers were pretty close. The Dow was
at 9,211.84 on May 13 and fell to 7,539.07 on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Wien thinks stocks will rise again this year for two reasons.
One is that central banks around the world are expanding their
money supply, and that is usually good for equities. Even more
important, ``It doesn't look like we're going to have a
recession,'' he said. ``The economy didn't do as badly in the third
and fourth quarter as everybody thought it would.'' As a result, he
predicts that average earnings of companies on the S&AMP;P could rise 7
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Still, all is not rosy on the economic front. The nation's trade
deficit will almost certainly worsen as Asian economies begin to
recover and flood American shores with cheap products. Furthermore,
the ability of corporations to raise prices in the new deflationary
world is nonexistent, a factor that pushes down profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   This is unlikely to change. James Paulsen, chief investment
officer at Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis says that
both the supply of goods and the capacity to make them have been
growing faster than demand for the last four years. This imbalance
cannot go on forever without some unhappy consequences, like plant
closings and ensuing layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, sluggish profit growth is likely to decrease
capital spending, which has been the jet propellant behind many
stocks recently. And as layoffs rise, consumer confidence may fall,
putting pressure on stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But as the bulls correctly point out, stocks have climbed this
wall of worry before, and admirably. So another good, if not great,
year for stocks may be in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   A big push for stocks will very likely come from the billions of
dollars currently sitting on the sidelines waiting to be invested,
according to Christine A. Callies, equity strategist at Credit
Suisse First Boston. She said that the year-over-year growth of
assets held in retail money market mutual funds hit 24.8 percent in
October, the most recent data available and the highest rate since
1990. ``There was one growth rate of 23 percent in 1996, but it's
quite rare,'' Ms. Callies said. ``This year, the growth rate really
started to sprint over the course of the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Callies thinks that this money is headed for equities.
``Because employment is reasonably good and wages are rising, we
doubt that this money is being piled up to support consumer life
styles,'' she said. ``This appears to be recycled from other
sources and stored there with intent of putting it to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Another force that will continue to be positive for stocks is
merger mania. Edward M. Kerschner, chief strategist at Paine
Webber, expects that record levels of merger and acquisition
activity seen in 1998 will extend into 1999. Kerschner pointed to
some factors that would drive deals this year: Mergers will appeal
to companies trying to gain economies of scale and scope _ for
example, by offering consumers one-stop shopping _ and to those
looking to acquire new technology or assets that would be
impossible to build quickly. Corporate combinations are also the
answer for companies that want to expand internationally, move into
higher-margin businesses or respond to deregulation, according to
Kerschner. All in all, a pretty compelling case for lots more
mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   But while some aspects of the market may look familiar in 1999,
there will also be significant differences. For example, index-fund
investing may no longer produce results superior to those obtained
by seasoned stock pickers.
</P>
<P>
   It may be just a straw in the wind, but according to Lipper
Inc., the mutual-fund research firm in Summit, N.J., funds in two
of the most popular stock fund categories were beating the return
of the S&AMP;P 500 index during the last months of 1998. From the end
of October to mid-December, the average capital appreciation fund
gained 8.86 percent and the average growth fund returned 7.69
percent. The S&AMP;P returned 7.63 percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the market may shift to reward stock picking over
basket picking, a reverse of the trend throughout the decade.
</P>
<P>
   And even though high-priced growth stocks, particularly those in
the technology sector, have been the place to be in recent months,
more defensive issues might be the favorites this year. Strategists
who question the market's ability to make 1999 the fifth
consecutive year of returns of 20 percent or more suggest that
investors focus on high-yielding stocks of good-quality companies,
such as utilities, consumer goods manufacturers or integrated oil
concerns. With inflation nowhere to be seen and the possibility of
future credit loosening by the Federal Reserve Board, shares in
these kinds of companies would seem to be a safe but profitable
place for investors to stash some cash.

U.S. ROLE AS WORLD SAVIOR: A DELICATE BALANCING ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Jan. 4)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Markets and governments around the world operated
under an unshakable assumption throughout the economic turmoil last
year: If things really got bad, the United States would be there to
engineer a bailout.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as everyone from President Clinton to Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin kept declaring, the future of the United
States was inextricably linked to the fate of the troubled emerging
economies.
</P>
<P>
   That was how Washington justified its $5 billion commitment to
the bailout of South Korea led by the International Monetary Fund.
It was why Treasury persuaded America's allies to pony up $17
billion in additional aid for Russia in July _ money that failed to
stabilize the country but made it a lot easier for some rich
oligarchs to convert their fast-falling rubles into dollars, which
were immediately parked in Europe. And it was the justification for
the American commitment to aid Brazil, an effort whose success is
still an open question.
</P>
<P>
   But the unstated assumption that the United States will always
be ready to step in is a risky one. The failure of the Russian
bailout was a searing experience, opening the Clinton
administration to the criticism that it had wasted billions on a
government that was never as committed to change and capitalism as
Clinton contended. And if the instability around the world
continues, a likely bet in the minds of many in the administration,
the question of whether America should serve as the savior of last
resort seems likely to come under increasing scrutiny from all
sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia was the turning point,'' conceded one senior
administration official who has been an advocate of aggressive
economic intervention by Washington. ``When it went bad, and it
became clear that the U.S. and its allies were not about to pour
more money into the place, it led to the two scariest months we
have seen in markets around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the official noted, ``the political tolerance for
continued American contributions, particularly in countries that
are resisting major reform programs, clearly has some limits.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is one of the most complex in modern American
foreign policy. On the one hand, the United States feels a mounting
obligation to help stabilize the world economy, to act as what
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright calls ``the indispensable
nation.'' That urge reached its zenith this fall, when the United
States engineered a series of steps to calm world markets, starting
with three interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But many economists still warn of the so-called moral hazard
problem: If investors know that Washington and the IMF will
ultimately step in to prevent the worst, they will not consider the
potential risks of lending their money abroad. And that can distort
investment decisions, leading to a flood of money into markets when
times seem good _ exactly what happened in Russia _ and a
devastating rush to get that money out after investors decide that
no amount of outside help will keep the country afloat.
</P>
<P>
   So Washington is caught in the middle, fearful of doing too much
or two little. The problem is that American participation in huge
bailouts is considered a key to restoring what is gingerly termed
``market confidence,'' building an aura of stability around a
country in chaos. The creation of that aura starts with
confident-sounding predictions from the Treasury or the IMF that a
country is on the right track and that the world's major powers are
there to provide support.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such declarations worked quite well for months in Brazil, as the
IMF and the Clinton administration slowly put together a $41.5
billion package of aid _ a package that was meant to signal
investors that they should not bet on a falling Brazilian currency
because Brazil's allies were ready with a huge war chest to prop it
up.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the war chest works only if the markets are
convinced that the fundamental economic problems are being
addressed. In Brazil's case, that means bringing down a huge budget
deficit and putting limits on very generous pensions and other
social programs that Brazilians had come to expect from their
government. Naturally, politicians balk at such moves. And as the
Brazilian Congress has delayed compliance with some of the toughest
commitments it made in return for the huge loan, investors are
again nervous and money is continuing to flow out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a balancing act you can only keep up for so long,'' said
Allen Sinai, chief global economist for Primark Decision Economics,
a consulting firm in Boston. ``Sooner or later, you have to show
that you are willing to make the changes, or even the biggest
bailout will not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin puts it more diplomatically. ``These programs work in
countries that are willing to internalize the need for change,'' he
said, pointing to places like Thailand and South Korea, where the
reforms have come slowly but still seem on track. ``Without that
commitment, success is limited.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Rubin has been lucky. Of the big bailouts, only Russia's
has blown up in his hands. He tends to view these things with a
trader's equanimity, arguing that Russia was a risky but reasonable
bet in July, a bet worth taking if a loan from the West gave
Russian politicians the time to stabilize their economy, collect
taxes and come up with a reasonable budget.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's Parliament rebelled, and the effort collapsed.
Remarkably, there was relatively muted criticism on Capitol Hill,
largely because Russia's economic collapse in mid-August led to a
market panic around the world.
</P>
<P>
   With the stock market plunging in the fall, a reaction to
Russia's troubles and fear of a global recession, even the
politicians who attacked the 1995 American-led bailout of Mexico
kept silent. After all, who wanted to be blamed for fueling the
international market chaos at a moment when Boeing was laying off
24,000 workers and farmers throughout the Midwest were suffering
because their export markets had collapsed?
</P>
<P>
   But this year could easily be different. The market is back, at
least for now, and once again there is a sense, perhaps a false
one, that the United States is more insulated from the worst
effects of the global chaos than many feared a few months ago. If
that remains unchanged, one or two more Russia-like failures may
call the American role into question.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Heeding warnings from the nation's military chiefs,
President Clinton has decided to propose the first real increase in
the Pentagon's budget in nearly a decade and the largest since the
Cold War buildup of the mid-1980s, administration and defense
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal, only the first step in a drawn-out process
with Congress, would reverse years of dwindling defense resources
after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It would address growing
strains, the officials said, caused by aging weapons and increasing
operations overseas, from Bosnia to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal represents a significant political shift for
Clinton. A Democrat who has often had an uneasy relationship with
the military, he came into office in the wake of the Cold War,
focused more on his domestic initiatives than on defense.
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of growing complaints about military readiness,
both from within the military and from Republicans, he was
persuaded to seek an increase of more than $4 billion in the
defense budget for fiscal 2000 and about $100 billion over the next
six years. That is the first increase, discounting inflation, since
1991, when spending spiked slightly for the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to announce the increase in his weekly radio
address on Saturday, and the early word of his plans appeared to be
an effort to blunt new criticism. It is unclear, however, how he
would pay for his proposals, setting the stage for what is sure to
be an intense fight with the new Congress over defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   In the budget he will submit to Congress in a month, Clinton
plans to propose increasing spending for the Department of Defense
to nearly $269 billion, the officials said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also agreed to let the department keep another $8
billion freed up as a result of lower-than-expected inflation and
fuel prices, money that normally would be returned to the Treasury,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the Pentagon would have $12 billion in new funds
to spend on everything from new equipment to spare parts to raises
for the nation's military personnel in the fiscal year that begins
in October.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six years, Clinton's budget would propose
additional spending of slightly more than $100 billion. That would
represent the most significant rise in military spending since the
buildup by President Reagan in the early 1980s, although it is only
two-thirds of what the military chiefs had said they would want in
an ideal world.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry
H. Shelton, and the chiefs of the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine
Corps are scheduled to appear before the Senate's Committee on
Armed Services.
</P>
<P>
   When they last testified before the committee in September, they
faced unusually hostile questioning over the military's readiness
problems from Republicans who accused them of having sugar-coated
issues like pilot shortages and training cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is considering a
presidential run in 2000, said then that the chiefs were ``not
candid to this member in the problems and challenges that we
faced.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite strict spending caps set by the Balanced Budget Act of
1997, many Republicans have called for much larger increases in the
Pentagon's budget, accusing Clinton of having let the military
become ``hollow'' and the generals and admirals of not blowing the
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James M. Inhofe, R.-Okla., who leads the Senate's
subcommittee on military readiness, reacted strongly when asked
about Clinton's plan to increase spending now, saying the president
was belatedly trying to head off Republican criticism that he has
skimped on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's personally responsible for the defamation of our defense
system and our hollow forces,'' the senator said. ``The president
is going to try to make it look like he's a pro-defense president.
It's an outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials dismiss the accusations. In interviews
this week, they said Clinton's proposals reflected the reality of
today's military. The armed services are doing more _ from flying
over Kosovo to bombing Iraq _ while the jets, ships and other
equipment bought during Reagan's buildup have become old and need
replacements or at least spare parts.
</P>
<P>
   The officials refused to say exactly how Clinton would propose
paying for the increase in defense spending. He has already vowed
not to spend the recent federal surplus until he and Congress agree
on a way to shore up the Social Security system, which is lurching
toward insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   And the Balanced Budget Act has placed strict caps on total
discretionary spending, requiring that any increases be offset by
reductions elsewhere. Clinton could propose to pay for new defense
spending by cutting other domestic programs, although he has not
done so in the past and seems unlikely to now.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the administration is expected to find or create new
pots of money that could be used for new increases. One
administration official said Clinton would call for increases in
both defense and domestic programs when he outlines his budget
priorities, beginning with the State of the Union address later
this month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For much of the last year, Defense Secretary William Cohen and
the service chiefs have been steadily trying to build a case for an
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Even though no threat on the scale of the Soviet Union has
emerged to challenge U.S. supremacy, they have argued that the
declining or flat budgets since the Reagan years have left the
country spending less on defense as a portion of the total federal
budget _ now just under 15 percent _ than at any time since World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   When Cohen asked the chiefs to list their budget priorities,
they came back with requests for personnel and equipment that
totaled $148 billion over the next six years. Cohen cut the
requests back to $112 billion. Negotiations with Clinton's budget
aides have since whittled that down to roughly $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still short of what we needed,'' one uniformed officer
grumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most Pentagon officials interviewed this week
sounded pleased. One senior officer said that $12 billion in the
coming fiscal year and more than $100 billion over six years would
go a long way toward shoring up the areas of the budget under the
most strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their most critical needs could be covered with something over
$100 billion,'' the officer said.

COMMENTARY: STARTING ANEW TO LIBERATE YOUNG MINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four preschoolers clung to Ned O'Gorman on Columbus
Avenue near Lincoln Center, when a stranger in the crowd nudged
him. ``Excuse me,'' she said impatiently. As O'Gorman carefully
shepherded the four youngsters to the other side, he looked over
his shoulder at the woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax, dear,'' he said. ``Life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   That it does. Six months ago O'Gorman was angry and depressed
after he was ousted by the trustees of the Children's Storefront
School, a Harlem academy he founded and had led since 1966. The
trustees, intent on strengthening the curriculum and ensuring a
smooth transition of leadership, had grown impatient with his
unkept promises to retire. Their decision plunged him into a
despair he had not felt since his son, Ricardo, died a few years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fired from the place I had spent almost 33 years in,''
he said. ``I exploded in rage, but I knew that it would be
ultimately absurd to continue that, because it would possess you.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he took possession of a ground-floor brownstone
apartment barely two blocks from the Children's Storefront on West
129th Street, and opened a preschool. The space has been
transformed, with little chairs, lots of books and a half-dozen
children. So, too, has O'Gorman's mood, as he enters the new year
with an old idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the happiest I've ever been in my life,'' he said. ``When
the children come here and I watch them grow, it's astonishing for
me. At this point in my life, I'm beginning again this task of
liberation, healing and teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Those last three words pop up often in his conversation. People
who hear that O'Gorman is a poet might dismiss those words as
romantic notions unrelated to the mundane tasks of reading and
writing. Worse, they might sound like anachronistic 1960s slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet O'Gorman still holds on to those ideas, as well as his
ideals, which he says are just as valid now as they were when he
started his original school, with little more than a handful of
books and students at a storefront on Madison Avenue. Public
schools, he said, are still failing to educate children in poor and
minority neighborhoods. The gap between rich and poor, if not the
distance between black and white, grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always want to see change,'' he said. ``They say, `Oh,
Ned, you certainly see changes in Harlem over the last 32 years.'
Changes in race relations? No. I see some people rising to the top
pretty fast, and they would have anyway because they're bright,
ambitious or ruthless. But the poor are still oppressed and shunted
aside. They still get the leavings from the table.''
</P>
<P>
   At his new one-room school _ named the Ricardo O'Gorman Library
and School, after his son _ the children receive a Montessori-style
program that develops practical learning skills. It's amazing
stuff, he said, that echoes the days when the method was started to
teach poor children in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were children who had absolutely no formal structure to
their lives,'' he said. ``It was built on their own angelic spirits
that had to be snatched away from the oppression of their
environments.''
</P>
<P>
   There he goes again, talking about oppression. He knows that
word makes Americans uncomfortable. That's why he uses it when he
talks about the failings of politicians, institutions and even
others in the community. ``That word is not very well liked even
when you talk to liberals in America,'' he said. ``There are no
oppressed people in America.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no dire dogma when he sits among his students,
hunched over in a tiny chair so he can look them in the eye. He is
encouraging and playful, yet stern and firm when he has to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moose,'' he chided one boy who was playing with his food.
``Stop acting like you're from Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracie McCord, who helps him at the school, nodded in approval.
``They need that discipline,'' she said. ``That direct `No, this is
not acceptable.' When you're little, you need somebody to say no.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as they need somebody to say yes. A few days before the
school's holiday break, O'Gorman took the students on their weekly
field trip: a visit to Lincoln Center, with a break for cookies and
juice at a friend's store off Columbus Avenue. The youngsters
scrambled onto the wide plaza outside the Metropolitan Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, guys,'' O'Gorman said. ``You want to run, run. Run!''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled as he watched them take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're liberated children already,'' he said. He relaxed.
Life went on.

THE FIRST BABY OF '99 DEBUTS IN BOSTON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pregnant women have been known to schedule their
surgical deliveries for New Year's Eve to get a chance at having
the first baby of the year. Others try to slow their labor as
midnight approaches, even getting a helping hand from the
obstetrician to start a new life on an auspicious note.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Heidi Slayton, whose daughter Alanna dropped
into this world at Brigham and Women's Hospital just as the New
Year's ball dropped over Times Square, making her perhaps the first
baby born in the United States in 1999. Only a 12:01 a.m. New
Year's baby born in Jacksonville, Fla., has so far emerged to
compare to Slayton's achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think anything about it. I just gave birth.
... I couldn't hold her in,'' said Heidi Slayton, 29, of
Dorchester, now a mother of five, at a press conference  &UR; yesterday &LR; 
with her husband, Wayne. ``I know (the dropping ball) was on TV,
but I could not describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alanna's extraordinary timing _ judged to be two seconds
into the new year by hospital officials _ made the Slaytons the
star players in the closest thing to a New Year's Day bowl game for
hospitals as Brigham and Women's grabbed Boston's first baby
bragging rights for the third time in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had joked a lot with her due date being Dec. 30'' about
having a New Year's baby, ``but I never thought it would happen,''
said Dr. Dorothy Dowling, the Slaytons' obstetrician.
</P>
<P>
   Obstetricians and other delivery room personnel freely admit to
a friendly competition among hospitals over delivering the year's
first baby. Though few would speed up or slow down a delivery to
win, they are quite aware of one another as the magic hour
approaches, sometimes calling other Boston hospitals to scope out
the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Massachusetts General Hospital, whose first baby of
the new year lagged the Slaytons' baby by 40 minutes, put on a
brave face at their showing, noting the hospital has not delivered
the New Year's baby since officials revived its maternity ward
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that we have healthy babies and healthy
moms and families,'' said Mass. General spokeswoman Georgia Peirce.
But she said hospital staff are quite aware of the coup a New
Year's first would bring ``because it's kind of an annual event
that everyone waits for.''
</P>
<P>
   And Peirce marveled at the apparently efficient timing that
Mass. General is up against in the Boston New Year's baby
competition, noting that Brigham and Women's had marked the exact
second that the Slaytons' child emerged from the womb. ``I'm not
sure we have a synchronized timer or a photo finish,'' said Peirce,
whose hospital tracks births down only to the minute.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, first baby of the year is not exactly an official
record. Government statistics include no such category, leaving it
to the news media to keep track, and there are few rules governing
first-baby claims.
</P>
<P>
   In the Slaytons' case, Dowling had to estimate the time because
of a slight difference between the hospital room's clock and the
official New Year's clock in New York City. Ultimately, she timed
the baby's birth based on the falling ball in Times Square and the
room clock's second hand.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Brigham and Women's officials did not claim that
Alanna Naomi Slayton was America's first 1999 baby; that fell to
reporters. But Friday, officials at Baptist Medical Center in
Jacksonville, Fla., seemed to concede Brigham's supremacy, revising
the birth time of their first baby from one second after midnight
to 12:01 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   But the imprecision in the Slaytons' case is small stuff
compared to other deliveries where parents are determined to have a
New Year's baby even though they lose a tax deduction for the
preceding year if the baby is born after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Jenelle Macaskill recalls that she ``stopped pushing'' at around
11:30 p.m. on New Year's Eve 1996 when she realized she had a
chance to deliver a New Year's baby at Melrose-Wakefield Hospital.
Little Collin Macaskill entered this world at 20 seconds past the
stroke of midnight as a nurse conveyed news of the blessed event by
telephone to a reporter from a Boston TV station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started up as a joke,'' recalled Macaskill, who was almost
three weeks overdue and desperate to deliver on New Year's Eve. But
as midnight approached, both she and her doctor worked together to
produce the first baby in the state of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When Collin's head emerged just before midnight, Macaskill said
her doctor ``held the head for a couple of minutes. That's why he
was out exactly at midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Other parents plan ahead to get a New Year's baby by scheduling
caesarean section deliveries on New Year's Eve. Dr. Toni Beth
Walzer of Brigham and Women's delivered the first baby in Richmond,
Va., a few years ago by performing a caesarean section just after
midnight, which is ``sort of cheating,'' she told the Globe in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the Slaytons more or less let nature take its
course. Heidi Slayton was given medication to induce stronger
contractions during her labor as well as an epidural to ease the
pain, but Alanna decided when to come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 10, I turned to Dr. Dowling and said, `We're shooting for
midnight,' '' recalled Heidi, but the labor was going so slowly
that it seemed unrealistic. Then, with a sudden spurt, Alanna, at 7
pounds 3 ounces, 20 inches, emerged, to the applause of hospital
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she came fully out, that's when we heard the crowd shout,
`Happy New Year,' '' said Wayne Slayton, 29, a youth counselor for
the city of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the baby sweepstakes is a numbers game, and Brigham
and Women's has a distinct advantage because it delivers by far the
most babies, accounting for more than 10 percent of the births in
the entire state in 1996. This is the fourth time in the last eight
years for which records are available that Brigham and Women's has
landed Boston's first baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deliver more than 10,000 babies. There's a good chance our
number will come up,'' said Brigham and Women's spokeswoman
Christine A. Baratta.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Don Taylor, a film actor of the 1940s and '50s who later turned
to directing, died on Tuesday at the UCLA Medical Center in Los
Angeles. He was 78 and lived in Santa Monica, Calif.
 &HT;    The cause was heart failure, his family said.
 &HT;    Taylor, who was born in Pittsburgh, began acting while attending
Penn State University, appearing in college presentations and more
than 80 summer stock productions. In his senior year, while playing
the lead in ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' he attracted the attention
of two Penn State alumni, Julius and Phil Epstein, the
screenwriters of ``Casablanca,'' who invited him to Hollywood.
 &HT;    He hitchhiked to California after graduation, and after several
unsuccessful screen tests was eventually signed to a seven-year
contract by MGM. While serving in the Air Force in World War II he
was recruited by Irving ``Swifty'' Lazar for a lead role in Moss
Hart's production of ``Winged Victory'' for the armed forces, and
later reprised his role in the film version.
 &HT;    After his discharge, he starred in the movie ``Naked City'' and
then won the role of Elizabeth Taylor's bridegroom in ``Father of
the Bride.'' He appeared in numerous war movies, including
``Battleground,'' with Ricardo Montalban and James Whitmore;
``Flying Leathernecks,'' with John Wayne; ``Submarine Command'' and
``Stalag 17,'' with William Holden, and ``Destination Gobi,'' with
Richard Widmark.
 &HT;    After moving behind the camera in the late 1950s, Taylor
directed 15 movies, among them ``Escape From the Planet of the
Apes,'' ``Tom Sawyer,'' ``The Island of Dr. Moreau,'' ``Damien:
Omen II,'' ``The Final Countdown'' and ``Echoes of a Summer,'' as
well as more than 400 television dramas.
 &HT;    He was also a writer, and was nominated for an Emmy award for
his script for an NBC television show, ``The Night They Tore Down
Riley's Bar.''
 &HT;    He is survived by his wife, Hazel Court Taylor, an actress; two
daughters, Avery Taylor Moore of San Francisco and Anne Taylor
Fleming of Los Angeles; a son, Jonathan of Los Angeles; a
stepdaughter, Sally Walsh of Los Angeles; a sister, Janet Tuttle of
Cape May, N.J., and a granddaughter.

BANKING: FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS GO ONE-STOP-SHOPPING ROUTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Monday, Jan. 4) 
(bl) 
By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Banking is dead. Long live banking.
</P>
<P>
   If a slew of big bank mergers over the last few years was not
reminder enough, then the losses banks took in 1998 by lending to
risky hedge funds like Long-Term Capital Management and by trading
in exotic overseas markets may be proof enough that banking as we
once knew it is firmly passe.
</P>
<P>
   In its place, America now has a high-octane form of banking that
our grandparents would not recognize. Many banks now proffer a
financial cornucopia that includes credit cards, stocks, bonds,
mutual funds, mortgages, auto loans, brokerage services and
insurance. And the really big banks also offer investment banking
advice, private banking and asset management services, derivatives
and large corporate loans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, banks, brokerage firms, mutual fund companies and
insurers are so eager to invade one another's turf that those neat
little categories they inhabit do not adequately describe all of
the services they engage in or want to provide. All of this goes to
show that as banking ceases to be a useful way to describe a broad
range of America's money-changers, a handy replacement term for
what all of them are doing seems to be financial services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said before that banking is dead and we should bury it,''
said Richard M. Kovacevich, the chief executive of Wells Fargo &AMP;
Co., a bank _ oops, financial services concern _ formed last year
through Norwest Corp.'s acquisition of Wells Fargo. ``A lot of
these businesses were segmented, not because that's the way
consumers wanted it, but because that's what the regulations
mandated. And those regulations are breaking down now.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is still not much of a consensus on the wisdom
of combining the staid workings of plain vanilla banking with the
riskier mechanics of investment banking _ especially when the nest
eggs of individual depositors could be at stake. And there is not a
consensus on how adequately these new high-fliers will meet the
financial needs of low-income communities.
</P>
<P>
   But financial services are clearly heading in the direction of
once-unheard of combinations. Over the next year, and in years to
come, the financial services industry will continue to evolve,
albeit in fits and starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convergence between commercial and investment banking is
sure to be one of the great themes in 1999,'' a group of Merrill
Lynch analysts noted in a recent research report. ``However, few
companies, to date, have effectively blended a securities and
commercial banking model.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a continuing tale in 1999 and beyond will be how well
some of the big financial services mergers play out. The two
book-end deals in this regard are last year's combination of
Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc. to form Citigroup and the German
banking giant Deutsche Bank AG's planned acquisition of Bankers
Trust Corp. Citigroup has already had plenty of trouble knitting
together its unwieldy investment and corporate banking operations,
while many analysts and industry observers see the Deutsche Bank
deal as doomed from the start given the problems the German company
has encountered trying to break into investment banking in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   All of America's big, multinational banks could face substantial
headaches if ill-considered loans go sour in a slowing domestic
economy. Financial turmoil abroad, perhaps the most significant
business development of last year, also promises to pose continuing
hurdles for big banks.
</P>
<P>
   On the consumer side of the ledger, another landmark deal last
year was Nationsbank's acquisition of BankAmerica to form a new
national behemoth named, surprise, surprise, BankAmerica. The new
BankAmerica Corp. is the first truly coast-to-coast national bank,
complete with a brokerage operation and an appetite to enter other
lines of business. Its size and diversity will increase the
pressure on smaller banks to eat or be eaten in the merger game.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller banks, those that rely heavily on traditional
deposit-taking and lending, face tough sledding this year. While
the Year 2000 computer problem is a well-known bugaboo, there are
other problems lurking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to be in a world where interest rates are going lower,
and that's not a friendly environment for a deposit-taking bank,''
said David Berry, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods Inc.
``That's because they can't bring deposit rates much lower than
they already are and they will have to charge less for the money
they are lending out because interest rates are dropping. That
means profits are going to go lower, too.''
</P>
<P>
   To make up for declining profits on loans, traditional banks can
be expected to try to get more fees from products like checking and
savings accounts. While consumers can expect to encounter sticker
shock if banks get more fee-happy, banks no longer have as much
wiggle room to charge fees because competition has grown more
intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the real issue is going to be revenue generation,''
said H. Rodgin Cohen, a banking lawyer with the New York law firm
of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell. ``And competition remains extremely intense
so there's going to be a lot of pressure on banks to figure out
where earnings are going to come from.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, many big insurers, like Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co., are converting to stock ownership so they have more
ways to pay for growth as the financial services industry
consolidates. Mutual fund titans like Fidelity Investments have to
worry about how easy it will be to keep growing and are already
offering financial services beyond fund management. Midsized
brokerage firms like Paine Webber will have to struggle to remain
competitive with giants like Merrill Lynch, while securities firms
of all sizes are concerned about the possible setback from a
slowing economy and continuing economic uncertainty abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, uncertainty about the big economic picture will loom
over financial services firms this year and may produce unpleasant
earnings surprises at some companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be like popcorn,'' Berry said. ``There will be just
enough popping to keep you on edge.''

   William A. Lee, whose exploits in Nicaragua between the two
world wars earned him three Navy Crosses, the nickname Ironman and
a lasting place in Marine Corps legend, died last Sunday at Mary
Washington Hospital in Fredericksburg, Va. He was 98 and lived in
the nearby town of Ferry Farms.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, whose 32-year career with the Marines included nearly four
years as a prisoner of the Japanese during World War II, was one of
the last ``of the old corps that fought in the banana wars between
World War I and World War II in Central America and the
Caribbean,'' said Robert Moskin, an authority on the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hand-to-hand combat, small-unit combat,'' Moskin said.
``And people like Bill Lee were courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   That much was evident from what he wore on his chest. For
sailors and Marines, the Navy Cross is second only to the Medal of
Honor among decorations for combat heroism. To win it three times,
as he did while an enlisted man fighting in Nicaragua, was
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   William Andrew Lee was born in Ward Hill, Mass., and enlisted in
the Marine Corps as a teen-ager in 1918. He saw service in France
near the end of World War I.
</P>
<P>
   In 1926, when Washington feared that a rebellion then under way
in Nicaragua might bring leftists to power there, the Marines were
dispatched with the ostensible mission of safeguarding U.S.
property and citizens. In fact, they were soon in action against
the rebels, who were led by Augusto Cesar Sandino.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a crack shot and skilled knife fighter, won two Navy
Crosses for actions there from March 20 to Aug. 19, 1930, and again
from Dec. 11 to Dec. 20. But his finest hours appear to have been
those he shared with the famed Marine Chesty Puller between Sept.
20 and Oct. 1, 1932, after the rebels had ambushed Nicaraguan
National Guard contingents commanded by two Marine lieutenants,
both of whom were killed. He and Puller were then leading a
Nicaraguan Guard company.
</P>
<P>
   Moskin recounted the events of those weeks in ``The Story of the
U.S. Marine Corps'' (Little, Brown, 1979).
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sept. 20,'' he wrote, ``Lieutenant Puller set out from
Jinotega with Company M, his special mobile patrol of about 40 men.
While crossing a mountain stream on the 26th, they were ambushed by
rebels firing machine guns and Browning automatic rifles from
cover. Guardia Lt. William A. Lee, Puller's second in command, was
wounded in the head and right arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Marine gunnery sergeant, Lee was an expert shot. While
Puller directed the attack, Lee was able to pin down the enemy with
a light shoulder-fired Lewis machine gun until the Guardia had
climbed the ridges above the trail and could fire on the rebels.
The patrol killed 16 guerrillas and suffered two dead and three
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``To save his wounded, Puller headed back to Jinotega, some 75
miles away. Company M fought through two ambushes and arrived at
base safely on the 30th.''
</P>
<P>
   For that patrol, Lt. Puller received the second of his five Navy
Crosses, Sgt. Lee his third.
</P>
<P>
   By now carrying his nickname, given him by Puller, Ironman Lee
was sent to China in 1939, after the outbreak of World War II, and
was stationed in Qinhuangdao, a port on the coast east of Beijing.
There, in August 1941, he was commissioned a chief Marine gunner.
</P>
<P>
   He was captured four months later after he and a group of 20
other Marines received a message from superiors telling them to
offer no resistance to a cordon of Japanese forces that had
surrounded them.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next 44 months as a prisoner of war. In an obituary
this week, The Free Lance-Star of Fredericksburg said: ``Lee and
200 other Marines in north China were `herded like animals into
boats and trains,' he wrote in a 1995 column'' for that newspaper.
``They were taken to a mountainside stockade in Japan, where they
were beaten, burned with cigarettes and starved.''
</P>
<P>
   In August 1945, the United States dropped the two atomic bombs
that ended the war. Half a century later, Lee recalled: ``One day
in August, we noticed the guards and the people outside the
stockade were running around in a panic and it appeared they were
scared to death. The next morning there was not a guard in sight;
all the Japanese had left overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   In the following years, Lee held various positions with the
Marines in Quantico, Va., and rose through the officers' ranks. He
retired as a colonel in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife, Helen Lloyd Lee, died. He is survived by his
second, Anne Bradbury Lee; four daughters, Edith L. McMillan of
Plano, Texas; Nancy M. Lee of Fajardo, Puerto Rico; Linda L. Sutton
of Roan Mountain, Tenn., and Beverly L. Karras of Falmouth, Va.;
three stepsons, William E. Shelton of Falmouth, Va.; Thomas C.
Shelton of Blacksburg, Va., and Edwin C. Shelton of of Hartwood,
Va.; a brother, Joseph O. Lee of Rough and Ready, Calif.; 11
grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren.

Cowboys pit experience vs. Cardinals' resilience
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IRVING _ The Arizona Cardinals had one last chance to get into
field-goal position and win the game without going into overtime.
The postseason depended on another fourth-quarter rally, and though
less than 20 seconds remained, quarterback Jake Plummer didn't
disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   With one pass, Plummer put the Cardinals in Chris Jacke's range,
then watched Jacke's 52-yard field goal soar through the uprights
as time expired, pushing Arizona past the San Diego Chargers on
Sunday and giving the Cardinals the NFC's final wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals will need to draw on that stick-to-itiveness when
they face the Dallas Cowboys at 3:05 today at Texas Stadium in a
first-round playoff game. The Cowboys have won the last nine times
the Cardinals have come to Dallas and taken 16 of the last 17
matchups overall.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Cardinals are making their first postseason
appearance since 1982, the Cowboys are accustomed to elimination
games. Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman owns three Super Bowl rings,
a testament to his poise under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But Plummer is quickly earning his own reputation. A master of
the comeback, he guided the Cards to seven victories by three
points or less this season, an NFL record.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been in a lot of games they had to win to get into the
playoffs, and I'm sure it felt like a playoff game to them,''
Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer led the first fourth-quarter rally in Week 3, when the
Cardinals scored 17 points for a 17-3 victory over Philadelphia.
The Cardinals later scored in the final minutes to beat St. Louis,
Detroit, Washington, Philadelphia again (in overtime) and San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   And they almost added Dallas to that list of victims when
Plummer threw for 314 second-half yards and saw what would have
been a game-tying touchdown pass fall incomplete in the end zone on
the final play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You love that situation,'' Plummer said of last-second
heroics. ``We've been in it too many times, but we're never going
to give up. We've got a new team out there. We've got a new
attitude and a new ballclub that goes out and gives everything
every single game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same playoff-type mentality for which Aikman is known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the finality of a playoff game,'' said Aikman, who is
11-2 in the postseason. ``You have to get the job done. There are
no excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   But as much as the Cardinals have been winning under pressure,
they haven't done it in the postseason. Few of them were even in
grade school in 1975, the last time the Cardinals went to the
playoffs in a non-strike season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact the Cowboys have a lot of experience could work in
their favor, but I hope it won't make any difference,'' said
Plummer, who signed a $29 million contract extension less than two
weeks ago. ``It will be a fun first-time experience. We'll just try
to stay cool.''
</P>
<P>
   When the season began, Plummer and his offensive line struggled
against the blitz. The fleet-footed quarterback often stumbled,
throwing more interceptions (20) than touchdowns (17). But his
performance against Dallas in that last meeting Nov. 15 showed the
Cowboys he's maturing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake is a good young player,'' Aikman said. ``He's very
athletic and does a good job giving them a spark. He will be a
great player at some point. He'll get better as his supporting cast
gets better.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, his support isn't bad. Frank Sanders led the
NFC with 89 receptions and was fifth with 1,145 receiving yards.
Rob Moore had 892 yards in receptions, and fullback Larry Centers
caught 69 passes for 559 yards. In all, the Cardinals ranked eighth
in the NFL with 217.6 yards passing per game.
</P>
<P>
   Their ground game, behind Adrian Murrell, averaged 101.7 yards
per contest. Murrell had his third consecutive 1,000-yard season,
carrying 274 times for 1,042 yards and eight touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've become more resilient,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   As have the Cowboys, who surprised many with their 10-6
turnaround after last year's 6-10 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough the way the whole season went last year,'' Aikman
said. ``It was a relief for all of us when it was over. We had been
accustomed to being in the playoffs. I'm proud of the way we
handled all the adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll be counting on that experience today.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them (the Cardinals) haven't been in the playoffs, so
they'll be excited,'' Dallas defensive back Kevin Smith said.
``Most of us have been in the playoffs and know how to handle it.''

WALKER HANCOCK, 97, SCULPTOR OF WAR MEMORIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Mo., Pa.)  (rl) 
 By HUBERT B. HERRING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walker Kirtland Hancock, a sculptor known for his monumental war
memorials, celebratory depictions of presidents and works with
religious themes, died Wednesday at his home in Gloucester, Mass.
He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   In his long career, Hancock produced hundreds of realistic
works, ranging from a 39-foot bronze angel in the 30th Street
Station in Philadelphia, which honors railroad employees killed in
action in World War II, to a bust of former President Bush in the
Capitol, a statue of James Madison in the Library of Congress, and
a Christ figure in the National Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock taught at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts from
1929 to 1967. He earned a variety of honors, including the Prix de
Rome and the George D. Widener Memorial Gold Medal from the
Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, both in 1925, the Herbert Adams
Medal of Honor from the National Sculpture Society in 1954, the
National Medal of Art, conferred by the president in 1989, and the
Medal of Freedom in 1990. At the American Academy in Rome, there is
a sculpture studio named in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, who was born in 1901 in St. Louis, knew by grade school
that creating sculpture ``was to become my consuming interest,'' he
wrote in his 1997 autobiography, ``A Sculptor's Fortunes.'' Never
enthusiastic about sports, he wrote, he ``preferred to model the
players rather than to be one of them.'' A worried teacher told
him, ``I hope you are intelligent enough to realize that you could
never make a living as a sculptor.'' He knew better.
</P>
<P>
   He spent a year at the School of Fine Arts at Washington
University, then moved on to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts,
where he studied closely with Charles Grafly, long considered the
premier portrait sculptor in America. During and after World War
II, as a captain in the Army, he led an effort to protect national
treasures and monuments and to identify and reclaim art stolen by
the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, he married the former Saima Natti. He first visited
Gloucester, where Grafly had a summer studio, in 1921, and in 1930,
he built his own studio there, traveling regularly to Philadelphia.
He later moved to Gloucester full time, and continued to work in
his studio there until a year or so before his death. His last big
project was a flight memorial for the U.S. Military Academy at West
Point.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition called America's Sculptural Heritage, now at City
Hall in Gloucester, features work by Hancock and his contemporaries
at the National Sculpture Society.
</P>
<P>
   His wife died in 1984. He is survived by a daughter, Deane
French of Buckland, Mass., and two grandchildren.

FISET'S GOAL IS TO PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It's not exactly the sort of thing one can
make a New Year's resolution about, but Kings goalie Stephane Fiset
definitely is hoping 1999 will bring with it better health than did
1998.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time this season, he has been deemed fit to play
after rehabilitating a groin injury, though Coach Larry Robinson
said Friday that Fiset will serve tonight as Jamie Storr's backup
when the Kings play host to the Colorado Avalanche. With Fiset
healthy, the Kings assigned Manny Legace to the Long Beach Ice
Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie's playing good right now,'' Fiset said of Storr, who has
allowed two goals or less in each of the last five games, four of
them victories by the Kings (12-21-3). ``The most important thing
is to win some games. Everybody knows I like to play against
Colorado. But it doesn't matter who plays. We need some wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado traded Fiset to the Kings in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still have so many guys I played with, and they're all
good friends,'' Fiset said. ``I have good memories there. It's
always fun to play against them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he had chosen to play Storr tonight rather than Fiset,
Coach Larry Robinson said, ``He's playing well. He deserves to be
in there. What's the old saying? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Right now, there's no justification for changing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   STILL SORE
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Doug Bodger is expected to miss his second game since
suffering cervical and shoulder strains and bruises when checked
into the boards from behind by Dallas Drake during the Kings' 4-2
victory at Phoenix on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Drake received a four-game suspension from the NHL for the play,
prompting Bodger to say, ``If it doesn't get any better, I may miss
more games than him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodger added, ``It's not getting any better. It feels good in
the evening and in the afternoon. But when I wake up in the
morning, it's not good. I thought I was going to skate (Friday),
but there's no sense going out there feeling like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson made it clear he was puzzled Drake didn't receive a
longer suspension, considering defenseman Rob Blake received a
three-game sentence last month for a slash to the arm that didn't
even cause Vancouver's Harry York to miss a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to make his decisions,'' Robinson said, referring to
NHL vice president Colin Campbell, the judge and jury in cases of
supplementary discipline. ``My feeling is, it's a little different
if you slash somebody on the arm. In (Bodger's) case, you're
talking about (a hit that could have resulted in) paralysis if he'd
been hit the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   SAKIC QUESTIONABLE
</P>
<P>
   Colorado center Joe Sakic, who has missed the last seven games
with a sprained right shoulder, may return to the lineup tonight.
If he does, he'll probably center a line with Peter Forsberg and
rookie Milan Hejduk.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic (12 goals, 32 points) took part in the pregame skate
before Colorado's 6-3 loss to the New York Rangers on Thursday
night, but opted not to play because he said he wasn't 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure we don't take a hit and take a setback,''
Sakic said.
</P>
<P>
   COACHING CONFRONTATION
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Colorado's game Thursday, Rangers coach John
Muckler confronted Avalanche coach Bob Hartley and criticized him
for playing tough guys Scott Parker and Jeff Odgers against Wayne
Gretzky's line at the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
   `That's a minor-league move,` Muckler told the Rocky Mountain
News. `I don't mind if the game's within reach, but it's over with.
I just took it as a cheap shot, which it was.`
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Muckler said to him, Hartley replied, ``He wished me
a happy New Year.''
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, he said, `Why double-shift a guy like Peter
Forsberg when we have a game in two days and I can keep a kid like
Scotty who needs to play on the ice?`
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky said, `I don't think he tried to goon it up. (But) let's
put it this way: The matchup got a little interesting in the last
eight minutes. John took exception to that.`
</P>
<P>
   LOOSE PUCKS
</P>
<P>
   Winger Eric Lacroix has been cleared to play (though not
activated), three weeks after suffering a fractured sternum in a
3-0 victory over Vancouver. Winger Sandy Moger, who has played only
once since Oct. 30 because of a strained lower back, also is close
to being ready to play. The Kings have only one roster spot open,
and wingers Steve McKenna and Russ Courtnall also are expected back
in the next few weeks, which will create some decisions for General
Manager Dave Taylor. ... Winger Dan Bylsma's wife, Mary Beth, is
scheduled to enter the hospital at 10 tonight to give birth to the
couple's first child. The plan is for doctors to induce labor.
Bylsma will join his wife at the hospital after the game. Asked if
he'd be distracted if he's in the lineup tonight, Bylsma said,
``When you're out there on the ice, it's tough to think about
anything other than the people coming at you.''

COMMODITIES: BAD NEWS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Jan. 4)  
(mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oil is about $12 a barrel, near its lowest level in 12 years.
Copper is 66 cents a pound, its lowest price in 11 years. Aluminum
is $1,241 a metric ton, the least expensive it has been in almost
five years, and, like other commodities, still falling in price.
The major commodity indexes are at or near their lowest levels in
more than two decades. And analysts are not predicting a turnaround
soon.
</P>
<P>
   That's great for consumers. Gasoline prices, adjusted for
inflation, are the lowest they have been since the 1950s. Those low
prices are even better than a tax cut at stimulating spending,
economists say, and they have been a major contributor to the
continuing decline in inflation here and in other developed
economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt, the collapse of commodity prices provided an
important spur to U.S. disinflation,'' said John Lipsky, chief
economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. He is forecasting an inflation
rate of just 1 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   But low commodity prices are bad for much of the developing
world _ for Russia, Chile, Mexico, Indonesia, Malaysia and Zambia.
And they are not so good for some major developed nations,
including Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   These countries depend on commodity sales to spur economic
growth, and many of them also count on the revenue to pay for a
major portion of their government spending. The price declines mean
they have less of both.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and Latin America will be especially hard hit. About 60
percent of Russia's export earnings are from oil, natural gas and
precious and base metals. And a major portion of the revenue for
the Russian budget comes from these sales and taxes on them. In
Latin America, 50 percent of Venezuela's government revenue, 30
percent of Mexico's and 25 percent of Ecuador's come from oil.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse in commodity prices since October 1997 has been
dramatic and has been one of the major ways the Asian financial
crisis, which began in Thailand in July 1997, has spread around the
world. The collapse of the economies in Asia, whose people had been
major consumers of oil, copper, timber, cotton, textiles and other
commodities, sent prices tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Since autumn 1997, prices have plunged 45 percent for oil, 44
percent for natural gas and 30 percent for copper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no optimism about the demand for industrial commodities
in the first half of 1999,'' said William O'Neill, director of
futures research at Merrill Lynch. And, he added, the recovery will
be ``a long, slow process.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal Shear, head of commodities trading at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, is even more pessimistic. He said commodity prices will be
``in a flat to lower trend'' this year. His reason: He does not
expect demand to recover.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the economies in Europe will be flat and growth in the
United States will slow, and he adds, ``Asia will not recover in
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   He also worries that there is a chance commodities may fall
further if market psychology leads to the kind of overselling that
often occurs when prices are on a long decline.
</P>
<P>
   What also could help delay a recovery in commodity prices is a
rebound in the strength of the dollar, which fell 7.1 percent
against the German mark and 12.8 percent against the Japanese yen
last year. Most of those declines came in the last five months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Major commodities, like oil, are priced in dollars. This means,
for one thing, that when the dollar weakens against the yen, oil
prices in yen are lower for the Japanese. If the dollar rebounds,
commodity prices are likely to rise for those spending yen and
other Asian currencies, slowing the revival of demand in Asia that
is ultimately crucial to any commodity rebound.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The cutting of interest rates by the Federal Reserve, in an
effort to stabilize financial markets and prevent the American
economy from falling into a recession, helped weaken the dollar at
the end last year. The unwinding of special hedge fund trades
involving the yen, as investors panicked in the wake of the
collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, also sent the dollar
sharply lower against the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
   But the dollar has not lost value against all foreign
currencies, which means commodity prices will get less of a boost
than might be apparent from looking only at the mark and the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar has remained strong against the currencies of two of
America's biggest trading partners, Canada and Mexico. Overall, the
trade-weighted dollar _ computed by measuring the strength of the
American currency in relation to currencies of the country's chief
trading partners _ still rose last year. According to the Federal
Reserve Bank of Dallas, the trade-weighted dollar was up almost 1
percent through October.
</P>
<P>
   And although most analysts expect further rate cuts by the Fed,
some economists expect the dollar to stay at current levels or
rally this year. One reason is that the United States will still be
attractive to investors because it will be performing well in
comparison to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is full of dollar bears right now,'' said Karen
Parker, the currency strategist at Chase Securities. ``But the U.S.
economy is in a relatively good position. Asia is not recovering,
Japan is in a recession and the recovery in Europe is more fragile

not get an assist from the dollar.

STRIVING TO KEEP A LOOSE HOLD ON A TIGHT SHIP
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Mass., Pa.) 
(For release Monday, Jan. 4) 
 (nk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Managing people is hard. And it's going to get even harder.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what the average boss is up against these days. Rapid
growth and mergers and acquisitions are roiling corporate America,
creating management headaches that must be handled with some
old-fashioned command-and-control leadership. After all, to wring
out inefficiencies and cut costs, companies have to make sure
things are done a certain way. And that means lots of memorandums,
policies and rules.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, managers are increasingly expected to
accommodate the particular work styles of their employees.
Otherwise, they are reminded over and over, their valued workers
may leave for a competitor that better understands the intangible
side of running a business.
</P>
<P>
   In an age of so-called talent shortages, on top of an overall
employee shortage, many productive workers see themselves
increasingly as free agents who can take advantage of the seller's
market for their skills.
</P>
<P>
   It is a point that Scott Adams, creator of the Dilbert cartoon
strip, tries to capture in his latest book, ``The Joy of Work'':
``The balance of power has changed. Now it's even safe to make
insulting jokes at the expense of your boss. You'll be amazed at
how much whimsical insolence your boss is willing to tolerate. Take
full advantage of this situation while it lasts.''
</P>
<P>
   These pressures on managers _ to run a tight ship but keep
things loose _ are reflected on the shelves of business sections of
most bookstores, where textbook-like volumes about growth
strategies share space with people-management offerings, like
``Contented Cows Give Better Milk,'' ``Your People Are Your
Product'' and ``Work &AMP; Rewards in the Virtual Workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right recipe for managing is not easy. ``It is a
moving target,'' said Adrian W. Zackheim, publisher of the News
Corp.'s Harper Business book unit. ``I think that most of what's
going on in the world degrades the command-and-control model, but
it certainly isn't dead. There are a lot of forces dragging it this
way and that.''
</P>
<P>
   Effective management is not only a moving target; it is also a
bar that is being raised.
</P>
<P>
   The message of one of the most successful business books of the
year, ``Working With Emotional Intelligence,'' by Daniel Goleman,
offers one illustration. Goleman, who has a doctorate in psychology
from Harvard, writes that certain IQ levels and technical skills
have become ``threshold capabilities,'' or entry-level requirements
for executive positions. The most successful leaders generally also
have emotional intelligence, he writes, such as self-awareness,
empathy and social skills.
</P>
<P>
   Goleman studied 188 companies and determined that among the
ingredients for excellent performance, emotional intelligence was
twice as important as IQ and technical skills. He writes that these
skills can be learned, although doing so takes a great deal of time
and commitment.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of employers _ especially in Silicon Valley
_ are taking such broader approaches to management, in large part
to stem the job-hopping tide.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the
Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, ``At many
companies, the gap is huge between what they are saying and
doing.''

NBA union heads withhold final counterproposal
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The NBA and the National Basketball Players Association have put a
new spin on the phrase, ``New Year's resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides hope to have a happy resolution to the 186-day
lockout, looking to hammer out a new collective-bargaining
agreement before NBA commissioner David Stern's Jan. 7 deadline.
Stern said unless he thinks there is significant progress toward an
agreement, he will recommend canceling the season at the Board of
Governors meeting on that date.
</P>
<P>
   But neither side seems to have progressed beyond the silly games
they have played throughout the lockout. The players have worked up
their ``final'' collective-bargaining offer, but have refused to
present it to the owners.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the owners refuse to sit down with the players for
a negotiating session. And with no sessions scheduled, union
attorney Jeffrey Kessler (again) accused the NBA of stalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to delay the process of meeting so they can
keep trying to put pressure on the players,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, said Jeffrey Mishkin, the NBA's chief legal officer.
Mishkin said meeting would be pointless because the league's final
offer, presented Sunday, stands and will not be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union can call us names and characterize it any way they
want,'' said Mishkin, adding that as soon as the owners receive the
union's proposal, it will be presented to the negotiating committee
and then to the Board of Governors for a vote. ``They may find our
offer unsatisfactory, but it is our final offer.''
</P>
<P>
   So the union will keep its offer to itself _ for now, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process will start on their timing, and when they're ready
we'll give them our proposal,'' Kessler said. ``We are doing what
we think will most further the process to increase the chances of
getting a deal done, not to decrease the chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern probably will return to New York from Aspen, Colo., on
Sunday; union executive director Billy Hunter, who spent New Year's
Eve in Philadelphia, likely will return to New York today.
</P>
<P>
   The sides have until Thursday to reach an agreement, and many
think an agreement could be close because the union's new proposal
contains one of the biggest concessions the owners have sought, a
cap on the salary any player can receive. It includes a demand for
55 percent of revenues in the fourth year of the agreement, close
to the league's offer of 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only the owners can get a look at the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way a deal can be made is to get the people in the
room, and they'll conclude that,'' Kessler said. ``I don't think
the owners want to lose the season any more than the players do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about pride and it isn't about relationships. This
is about the process, and when you're trying to engage in a final
negotiation to bring a deal home, both sides have to get there,
work out the details and do the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the owners have a New Year's resolution to get serious
and negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sideshows continue. Keith Van Horn became the latest
player to demand a union vote on the owners' proposal, even though
Hunter has refused to put the offer up before the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn's stance is noteworthy considering he is represented by
agent David Falk, whom Stern accuses of working behind the scenes
to block efforts to reach an agreement that would limit what his
superstar clients could earn.
</P>
<P>
   Falk represents high-priced players such as Michael Jordan,
union president Patrick Ewing, union vice presidents Alonzo
Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo as well as future high-earners Allen
Iverson and Stephon Marbury as well as Van Horn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think we should have a vote,'' Van Horn said.
``Even though you have 19 guys representing the players, it may not
necessarily be accurate or representative of how the other guys
feel. And if 65 to 70 percent of the players want to play and feel
that the deal is satisfactory, you have to take that into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a vote, I really couldn't tell you which way I
would go right now. But the owners' proposal is pretty good. I
think it is as close to a fair deal as we're going to get.''

HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES SET FOR HURRICANE DAMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Ala., La.)   (For release Monday, Jan. 4)  
(lb) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a hurricane battered his home on the Mississippi coast,
Eugene Arnold got a big surprise that may prove instructive to tens
of thousands of coastal residents as they renew their homeowners
insurance this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Arnold had just paid his annual premium of $2,700,
he discovered that he would have to pay the first $11,400 in
damages out of his own pocket. His deductible, it turned out, was
not the $1,000 he had been carrying for years, but 2 percent of the
$570,000 policy on his sprawling Mediterranean-style home near
Pascagoula.
</P>
<P>
   Higher deductibles for wind damage started quietly going into
effect all along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic last year. And
by the end of this year, industry experts say, there will be few _
if any _ eastern and southern coastal states without them. Higher
deductibles have also been introduced for coverage in earthquake
zones.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, who runs several franchised weight-loss centers, said he
had no quarrel with insurers' setting deductibles and premiums as
they chose. His complaint is that he was not adequately informed of
the change.
</P>
<P>
   Other homeowners in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana as well
as in Puerto Rico _ all of which were hit hard by Hurricane Georges
in September _ said the higher deductibles came as a shock to them,
too. Many complained to insurance regulators. Some, like Arnold,
joined in a class-action suit demanding that their original, lower
deductibles be used in calculating their Hurricane Georges claims.
</P>
<P>
   The higher deductibles, which amount to a reduction in coverage,
are another manifestation of the ways in which insurers have been
cutting back on the protection they provide for coastal residents
as well as increasing prices.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance companies blame increasing costs. Not only have
hurricanes become more frequent and more powerful, they say, but
more houses and condominiums have been built along the shoreline,
creating more valuable targets for storms. So when the wind gets
roaring, the actuaries say, expensive claims are sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
   As business people committed to maintaining profits, the
insurers say, they saw only two ways they could continue to offer
coverage: raise premiums drastically and risk driving customers to
competitors that might seek less profit, or raise deductibles so
that customers would shoulder more of the costs of damages.
</P>
<P>
   The giants in the business, State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Co. and Allstate Corp., went for the higher deductibles _
combined, in some cases, with rate increases of more than 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but insurance companies aren't like they
used to be,'' said George Dale, the insurance commissioner in
Mississippi. ``They don't have the social soul they once had. Now
they are only concerned with their bottom lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale, who is an elected official, had gotten himself into a bit
of a pickle. Months before Hurricane Georges struck, he approved
the 2 percent deductible for three insurers, including State Farm
and Allstate, the two biggest in Mississippi, and USF&AMP;G, a unit of
St. Paul Cos. But he received many complaints after the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   So he backtracked a bit, urging the insurers to treat the damage
from Hurricane Georges as if their policies had been written with
the old deductibles, which for most people had been $250 or $500.
</P>
<P>
   USF&AMP;G said fine, but State Farm and Allstate refused. Dale
ordered independent auditors to look at the financial records of
both companies to determine whether the increases were warranted
and whether policyholders were adequately notified of the higher
deductibles.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the uproars in their states, Dale and the
insurance commissioners in Alabama and Louisiana have begun working
together, hoping their combined voices will give them greater
leverage in trying to steady premiums and deductibles and make sure
that insurers do not simply abandon the coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm and Allstate have sharply curtailed sales of new
policies in Florida and Nationwide Financial Services Inc. has done
the same all along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to remember that they are in business to make money,''
Dale said. ``We can't order them to write insurance here if they
don't want to.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robert Hunter, the insurance director for the Consumer
Federation of America, said that the fair thing with deductibles
was to permit customers to choose what level they want, recognizing
that lower deductibles will mean higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   That's what South Carolina's officials said when State Farm
tried to impose deductibles as high as 5 percent of the value of
the policy on homeowners there in November. So State Farm said its
customers could decide on either a $500 deductible or one of as
much as 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In December, State Farm said it would begin letting
policyholders in Mississippi choose between a $500 deductible _
with premiums increased by 15 percent _ or the 2 percent deductible
that has drawn such protests.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Mintel, a lawyer for State Farm, said the company
expected to eventually offer the same alternatives in other coastal
states.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Hurricane Georges hit, Arnold said, a friend
mentioned the 2 percent deductible. Arnold said he was sure he was
not one of the unfortunates who would be digging into his pockets.
Still, he decided to check his State Farm policy. And there it was,
he said, on a page summarizing his coverage, under the deductibles
section, the words ``hurricane'' and ``2 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no dollar figure, though, and Arnold said, ``You don't
pay much attention to something like that.'' His State Farm agent
should have told him about the change, Arnold contends, and there
should have been newspaper and television advertisements announcing
it.
</P>
<P>
   There were, in fact, some newspaper reports about the deductible
change. But Arnold said he did not see them.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mintel said State Farm sent out three notices to customers
on the changes, including the information on the summary page in
each policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my book, three separate mailings are quite a lot of
notification,'' she said. ``But the fact that so many people are
expressing surprise makes you kind of relook at how you
communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, at least in Mississippi, it is going to be up to a
state court to determine whether there was a failure to
communicate. Or, as often happens, the two sides might decide it
makes more sense to reach a compromise on their own.

TURNING FINANCIAL DIALECTS INTO A COMMON LANGUAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Monday, Jan. 4) 
 (nk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life would be simpler if all companies, whether in Thailand,
Tanzania or Tennessee, spoke the same financial language.
</P>
<P>
   But each country now sets its own accounting rules, and what may
look like profits at a bank in Kuala Lumpur may turn into losses at
a bank in Kansas City with the same numbers but using American
accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
   The International Accounting Standards Committee, a group of
accountants and executives from around the world, has set out to
change that. And, after more than two decades of work, the
committee is ready to present a core set of 15 universal accounting
standards.
</P>
<P>
   This year, world securities regulators, including the Securities
and Exchange Commission in the United States, will review the
proposed rules and decide whether they are strong enough to
recommend to all countries. These would not be the first
international rules to be devised, but the goal is to have one set
that applies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the year,'' said James L. Cochrane, the chief
economist at the New York Stock Exchange. ``Investors and analysts
are crying out for a common language, a common set of accounting
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of critics, many of them in this country,
say that the global rules written by the London-based committee are
weak and full of loopholes. The critics, including members of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting rules
in the United States, have also raised questions about the inner
workings of the committee, which has been holding its meetings in
private and has some members with close ties to companies that
would follow the rules.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of the proposed international rules, Patricia A.
McConnell, an analyst at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. and the International
Accounting Standards Committee's vice chairwoman, said that they
``look and smell'' like the American rules. ``They are far superior
to most things you would get outside of the U.S.,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Trevor S. Harris, a professor of accounting at Columbia
University and a consultant for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said
that while the U.S. accounting rules are more detailed, the broad
differences between the American and the proposed global rules are
small. ``In my mind there are few differences that are significant
from an investor's point of view,'' Harris said. ``Sometimes the
extra detail does not lead to more informative information.''
</P>
<P>
   Many financial experts and executives are clamoring for a
worldwide set of accounting rules. They contend that universal
rules are necessary in a world where investors regularly struggle
to compare companies that operate across several time zones and
under very different governments.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries, like South Korea, Poland and Russia, now have
few accounting rules or do not enforce the rules they have, leaving
executives to decide on their own what investors should and should
not know.
</P>
<P>
   While such countries may seem distant enough not to worry most
of this nation's investors, even now anyone can go on the Internet
and invest in foreign companies in countries that lack
well-enforced accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of countries have already adopted existing international
rules as an alternative to writing their own, and the World Bank,
which provides loans to poor countries, recommends the existing
standards as a condition of its loan agreements. But the aim of the
new effort is full global standardization.
</P>
<P>
   Global rules have widespread appeal in Europe, where 11
countries are now using a common currency, the euro, but have not
yet knitted together their accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
   Many European countries now allow foreign companies wanting to
sell stock on their exchanges to use the existing international
rules rather than to conform to their own. One of these is Britain,
and many companies that would like to sell their stock on the
American exchanges, where strict American rules apply, have gone to
the London Stock Exchange instead.
</P>
<P>
   Cochrane at the New York Stock Exchange said that many foreign
companies now turn away from American markets because they do not
want to reconcile their financial statements to United States
accounting rules, as required by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   American regulators say they understand the need for having one
set of accounting rules, and they have agreed to review the
international committee's rules and decide whether to allow their
use in this country.
</P>
<P>
   And in a recent speech to the World Congress of Accountants, the
president of the World Bank, James D. Wolfensohn, said: ``In a
world that is growing more and more like a single economic
household, it makes no sense to be speaking in different voices. We
urgently need a unified global language of business.''

MISSISSIPPI STATE PAYS FOR GAMBLING BLITZES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mississippi State's defense packed the line of
scrimmage and made no secret of its intention to blitz in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Texas quarterback Major Applewhite made the Bulldogs pay with
two touchdown passes to Wane McGarity for a 14-3 halftime lead.
Applewhite finished the first half with 11 completions for 163
yards.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been even worse for Mississippi State, but left
tackle John Hilliard made a shoestring tackle on Kwame Cavil after
a reception early in the second quarter. Applewhite threw the
screen pass over blitzing defenders, and Cavil caught it at the
Texas 42-yard line with a wide-open field in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question he did a great job, but you can't give
Major all the credit because he had some help,'' Mississippi State
coach Jackie Sherrill said. ``He did a great job of getting the
ball where it was supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs can also blame aggressive play for the first
Longhorns touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Texas faced a third-and-six when Mississippi State attacked too
early at the line of scrimmage and received an offside penalty.
Texas converted on third-and-1 and scored a touchdown four plays
later. Hobbling Bulldogs Mississippi State senior return specialist
Kevin Prentiss had one punt return for 28 yards before leaving the
game because of a pinched nerve in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Prentiss was one of four Bulldogs players to suffer first-half
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman tailback Dicenzo Miller left the game because of a
dislocated left shoulder. Backup quarterback Matt Wyatt twisted his
hip on the Bulldogs' final drive of the first half. Wyatt returned
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Starting guard Kenwoynne Smith suffered a right-leg injury early
in the first quarter. Near miss The Bulldogs missed by inches on
what might have been their best touchdown chance early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   On second-and-22 from the Texas 47-yard line, quarterback Wayne
Madkin rolled right and overthrew Kevin Cooper on a lob pass near
the right sideline. The closest Texas defender was nearly 10 yards
away.
HE STILL WOULDN'T LIKE IT
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill's seven-game winning streak against the Longhorns,
dating back to 1984, ended.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State is winless in four bowl appearances during the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that many teams have been able to beat Texas
seven times in a row,'' Sherrill said. ``Only thing I didn't like
was the crowd singing `Poor Aggies' at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans were actually chanting ``Poor Jackie.''
IN PRAISE OF BACKUP
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs were 3-of-14 on third-down conversions, which is
one reason Sherrill said he pulled starting quarterback Madkin from
the game in favor of Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wyatt played well,'' Sherrill said. ``You have to give Matt a
lot of credit because, mentally, he stayed in the game the whole
year.''

DAYNE LEADS WISCONSIN PAST UCLA
</HEADLINE>

By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Thanks for playing, UCLA Bruins. We have some
lovely parting gifts for you.
</P>
<P>
   It was little comfort for UCLA that it ended its season in the
Rose Bowl, which is typically its year-end mecca. After spending
the season chasing the national championship, the Rose was a
consolation prize.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a paltry prize at that. Just like in the
season-ending loss at Miami that squashed their championship hopes,
the Bruins' defense was AWOL. Wisconsin ran its way to a 38-31
victory yesterday before 93,872. The Badgers finished 11-1 and
continued a solid postseason for the Big Ten Conference. UCLA is
10-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing for our season to end this way,'' UCLA
quarterback Cade McNown said. ``We weren't as crisp as we need to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin junior running back Ron Dayne, who announced before
Christmas that he would return for his senior season, is first in
line for the 1999 Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot, 10-inch, 253-pound Dayne gobbled up 246 yards and a
Rose Bowl record-tying four touchdowns on 27 carries for the
Badgers. Wisconsin rushed for 343 yards against UCLA's defense,
which has had all the characteristics of LA smog this season. The
Bruins finished the season allowing 28 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first couple of plays, I knew our offensive line was
going to be opening holes,'' Dayne said, whose rushing total was
one short of the Rose Bowl record. ``I went up to my linemen before
the game and told them it's time to do what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne, who played despite a torn muscle in his shoulder,
approached the record for most rushing yards in a bowl game. The
record had been 280 by Texas Tech's James Gray in the 1989
All-American Bowl. His four TDs tied the Rose Bowl record held by
USC's Sam Cunningham in 1973 and UCLA's Eric Ball in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel one man beat us or one play cost us the game,''
UCLA coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's offense, which had left defenses breathless all season,
was again potent. But the Bruins' offensive line had trouble
holding Wisconsin. Check that. UCLA held fine. Four times,
including twice on the first series.
</P>
<P>
   And while that meant there was more yards for the offense to
gain, it also made it easier for the Badgers to pressure McNown.
The senior finished with 340 yards and two touchdowns, completing
19 of 34 pass attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, Wisconsin had few answers for the Bruins'
breathtaking pass offense. The Badgers, who entered the game with
the nation's fourth-ranked defense (270 yards per game), had not
seen the likes of UCLA's attack in the Big Ten Conference. UCLA
threw for 418 yards, making the Badgers look like they couldn't
cover statues.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers' pressure produced two key plays. Early in the
fourth quarter, facing a third-and-nine, McNown was pressured into
throwing an interception. Freshman corner back Jamar Fletcher
returned it 46 yards for a touchdown that made it 38-28.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get pressure on the quarterback like we did, it makes
my job easier,'' Fletcher said. ``On that play, I was in man
coverage and the ball just came right to me. From there, it was
just daylight.''
</P>
<P>
   And UCLA's final chance ended when reserve defensive tackle
Wendell Bryant sacked McNown with 59 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers took control late in the first half. Matt
Davenport's 40-yard field goal gave Wisconsin the lead for good,
24-21, 17 seconds before halftime. Dayne scored on a 22-yard run to
make it 31-21 early in the third quarter.

IN THE NFL, CASE FOR THE DEFENSE IS WEAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ This is not your father's football league.
</P>
<P>
   No Steel Curtain. No Doomsday. No Purple People Eaters.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever first said, ``Defense wins championships,'' never heard
of the West Coast offense or five-wide receiver sets. The timeworn
credo about defense slowly began losing significance with the
breakup of the 1985 Bears. It finally faded for good last season
when the Denver Broncos won the Super Bowl despite finishing last
in the National Football League in average rushing yards allowed
per attempt.
</P>
<P>
   As the league begins postseason play today, the game is much
more about touchdowns, not tackles; post patterns, not prevent
defenses. Denver showed us last season that a playmaking
quarterback, a strong rushing attack and gamebreaking wide
receivers can overcome even the ugliest of defensive blemishes.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Cowboys and Cardinals will exchange touchdowns at
Texas Stadium today in a wild-card game that underscores the NFL's
offensive-minded landscape, which has benefited from rule changes
which have led to more pass-interference penalties and more liberal
pass blocking. Both clubs rank considerably higher on offense than
on defense (Dallas 8 to 18 out of 30, Arizona 13 to 21). Troy
Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irvin fuel the Cowboys' title
hopes. Jake Plummer is the hope for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   And the top teams in both conferences share this unbalanced
makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's defense (13th overall, 19th against the pass) is far
from championship caliber. But the Vikings are the NFC favorites
because of a Randall Cunningham-Randy Moss-led offensive attack
that helped set an NFL record with 556 points in 16 games. For
that, Vikings offensive coordinator Brian Billick has emerged as
one of the hot candidates to fill one of the seven head coaching
vacancies and has already interviewed with the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Denver leans toward offense as much as the Vikings. The Broncos
defense, ranked 11th overall and 26th against the pass, hardly
resembles the Orange Crush of the late 1970s. But with 2,000-yard
rusher Terrell Davis and veteran quarterback John Elway, the
Broncos won 13 consecutive games to start the season and are
favored to become the first repeat AFC champion in five years. Like
Billick, Broncos quarterbacks coach/offensive coordinator Gary
Kubiak interviewed for the Cleveland job as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a fallacy to think that you just go out there
and outscore people all the time,'' Aikman said. ``But in this
league, it is hard to expect a defense to hold teams down to 10, 13
points. And if they do, and on offense if you don't score 21, I
don't know how many teams expect to win if they can't score 21
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the salary cap, I think the league is watered
down,'' he continued. ``You've got to pick and choose where the
money goes. The decision has been made in today's game that the
offensive players are going to get that money. It becomes very
difficult to have a good defense and try to provide the team with
some offensive guys that can score for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones clinged to that philosophy when he
hired an ``offensive guy,'' to replace Barry Switzer as head coach
last winter. Feeling that his defense would, ``always be able to
hem them in,'' Jones employed former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive
coordinator Chan Gailey to resurrect an offensive unit whose
starters account for the major portion of the Cowboys payroll.
</P>
<P>
   With Aikman as the career postseason leader in passing
percentage, Smith as the second-leading postseason rusher, and
Irvin as the second-leading postseason receiver, the Cowboys are
confident that they have the pieces in place to claim an
unprecedented sixth Super Bowl title.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, 11 other teams think they have the firepower to
share the same confidence. The pass word is ... Aikman In this
landscape of offensive-minded football, the Cowboys have the one
player whose singular efforts can lead them on an extended playoff
run: Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   He is 11-2 as a starter in the playoffs. He has completed a
postseason record 66.3 percent of his passes. His postseason passer
rating of 96.0 trails only Packers great Bart Starr (104.8).
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we have a healthy Troy Aikman, I'll always feel we
have a chance,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The players around Aikman are not as good as they were in 1992,
1993, and perhaps even 1995. And so Aikman may have to make
game-saving plays by scrambling in the pocket or by throwing on the
run. But do not expect Aikman to try to win games by himself. He'll
stand tall in the pocket and let his receivers carry out their
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Scrambling quarterbacks Brett Favre of Green Bay and Steve Young
of San Francisco do things one way. Aikman, the only active
quarterback with three Super Bowl titles, does things another way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing you want to do is go out and think you've got
to carry the football team or pick up more than your share of the
load,'' Aikman said. ``I don't think that mentality really works.''
The big bang theory Big passing plays have as much of an effect on
a game as a sack or a tackle for loss. The Vikings (14-1) achieved
the league's best record with more pass plays of 25 yards or longer
(44) than sacks (38). Playoff qualifiers San Francisco and New
England finished tied for second in the regular season with 39 pass
plays of 25 yards or longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were next with 37 such plays, led by Irvin, whose 12
receptions of 25 yards or longer was seven behind league leaders
Moss of Minnesota and Eric Moulds of Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make big plays, you are not going to have to fight
every way down the field to score,'' Gailey said. ``Big plays pick
up the whole team, they help morale. When you get one, it changes
field position. If you get two or three big plays you can turn the
ball game around.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the Cowboys trail offensive powerhouses Minnesota and
Denver is that Irvin has emerged as the club's only consistent
big-play threat. Irvin had 74 receptions for 1,057 yards and one
touchdown. The Cowboys player with the second-most receptions,
Billy Davis, finished with 39 catches for 691 yards and three
touchdowns. Patrick Jeffers, filling in for the injured Ernie
Mills, had 18 receptions for 330 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFC, Minnesota's Randy Moss and Cris Carter each finished
with at least 1,000 yards receiving. The same is true for Atlanta's
Tony Martin and Terance Mathis, as well as San Francisco's Jerry
Rice and Terrell Owens.
</P>
<P>
   All of these receivers have made their biggest plays after
catching the ball. In terms of receiving yards made after the
catch, the Green Bay receivers are first in the NFL with 1,855
yards, followed by San Francisco (1,854), the Jets (1,798),
Minnesota (1,638), Atlanta (1,478), and Arizona (1,448).
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys receivers are 10th among the 12 playoff teams with
1,281 yards made after the catch, and 21st overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big plays kill the defense,'' Irvin said. ``Have we made
enough? I don't know. The object for us in the playoffs is to make
big plays on offense and prevent them on defense. You can't go
wrong with that combination.'' Power ball The power running game
remains the last link to the glory days of the 1960s and 1970s. You
keep the other team from scoring by keeping the ball yourself. You
do that with a ball control running back who chews up the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, with Smith, have such capabilities, although they
have struggled at times this season. They finished the season with
the league's eighth-ranked rushing attack, averaging 125.9 yards
per game.
</P>
<P>
   A late, three-game slide that included a 58-yard rushing game
against Minnesota, an eight-yard rushing game in New Orleans, and a
51-yard rushing game in Kansas City knocked the Cowboys average
down from 144.4 yards per game to 125.9 and their ranking from
second in the NFL to eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But for the season, the Cowboys still ran for more yards than
Minnesota (2,014 to 1,936). With Smith leading the way with 1,332
yards, the Cowboys ran the ball as well as any team, except for
top-ranked San Francisco (159 yards per game) and Denver (154.3
yards per game).
</P>
<P>
   ``The best defense is keeping the ball yourself and trying to
wear the other team down,'' Smith said. ``You can't win in this
league if you don't run the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Though grinding out 10- and 12-play drives with the running game
will be key in the playoffs, the Cowboys have shown an ability to
break big plays via the rush.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six NFC teams, only the 49ers have more runs longer than
10 yards (74) than the Cowboys (57). Smith is third among playoff
running backs with 40 carries this season for 10 or more yards
behind Denver's Terrell Davis (50) and Atlanta's Jamal Anderson
(45).
</P>
<P>
   Smith, Irvin and Aikman know success is impossible without an
efficient offensive line. The Cowboys have two Pro Bowlers in left
guard Nate Newton and left tackle Larry Allen, and a 1997 Pro
Bowler in right tackle Erik Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive line drives our football team, and most any
team,'' Aikman said. ``If you are getting good play up front, the
rest will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Even victory without great play from the defense.

`DEFENSE WINS TITLES' KEPT ALIVE BY A CONSPIRACY OF OLD-TIMERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Mike Fisher 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Defense wins championships,'' said one expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got that right,'' said the other expert. ``You can't lose
if the other team can't score.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Darn right,'' chimed in a third expert, apparently confident
that the simple regurgitation of an ancient football platitude was
enough to make it so. ``Defense wins championships!''
</P>
<P>
   So the Pro Player Stadium security guard, the TV cameraman and
the Miami cab driver had it all figured out _ and lest you think
I'm patronizing blue-collar football fans, let it be known that
such a conversation would seem no less banal to me had it been
conducted by, say, Bill Parcells, Jimmy Johnson and Mike Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of dominating on defense being the only way to win a
title likely came from two now passe facts:
</P>
<P>
   1) Back in the days when the ball was fatter and late-season
games were all played outdoors, offensive finesse was generally
inappropriate; and
</P>
<P>
   2) Coaches are liars.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of coast-to-coast football (all teams aren't in
the Rust Belt anymore, you know), indoor football (the two best
teams in the NFC play under domes in Minnesota and Atlanta) and a
streamlined ball, three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust offense still has
its place. But its place isn't at the focus of an offense, where
rules changes _ from blockers being able to extend their arms to
receivers being able to run untouched beyond 5 yards of the line of
scrimmage _ have made playing offense easier than playing defense.
</P>
<P>
   Want to get better fast? Which is easier, finding a cover corner
or a dangerous receiver? Which is easier, finding a pass-rusher or
a hog who can hang onto to him? If you want to get better fast,
score.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the top-ranked offensive teams during the NFL regular
season: 1) San Francisco, 2) Minnesota, 3) Denver, 4) the Jets, 5)
Green Bay, 6) Buffalo, 7) Atlanta, 8) Dallas. Guess what? They're
all in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now look at the two top-ranked defensive clubs: 1) San Diego and
2) Tampa Bay. Guess what? They're playing golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense wins championships'' is a lie now. And it might have
always been. Most prospective football players want to be stars.
They want to score touchdowns. They want to experience glory. They
want to meet cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy that exists between old-timers will prevent this
from ever blossoming beyond theory-dom. But I believe the ``defense
wins championships'' credo was created in part because it was the
only way coaches could trick 11 of their guys to take on the
crummiest jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Is Denver's defense great? Not at great as its offense. Is
Minnesota's defense great? Same story. Meanwhile, ask Jimmy Johnson
about his defense, and he'll say, ``Other people around the league
believe we have the best defense in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   But how far are the Dolphins going unless Dan Marino and company
start putting up 28 a game?
</P>
<P>
   I've said it before, I'll say it forever, and this Super Bowl
Tournament is destined to prove me right: Every single little
aspect of a football team is a building block in a house of cards.
Every single draft pick, every single play called, every single
block delivered, every single word spoken, maybe even the detergent
the team equipment managers use to launder the locker-room towels,
are part of the equation. Remove one card, and the whole thing
might come crashing down.
</P>
<P>
   See, there are no how-to-win formulas, only bumper stickers
disguised as formulas. It's all like something out of the
best-selling book, ``The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People'',
in which author Stephen Covey instructs us to ``Seek First To
Understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that's how you become effective? Seeking to understand?
</P>
<P>
   No kidding, Sherlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta control the clock.'' ``It takes depth.'' ``You gotta
grind it out.'' ``Home teams win.'' ``Experience wins.'' ``Defense
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosh, they all sound great. But there is only one great truth,
and it establishes that scoring 35 points a game is as valuable a
game-winning gift as allowing 16 points a game. That one great
truth:
</P>
<P>
   ``Champions'' win championships.
AFC PLAYOFF BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback situation in Jacksonville has such a history
that it'll probably never devolve into a quarterback controversy.
Hanging inside Mark Brunell's locker at Jaguars headquarters is the
cover of the 1987 ``Santa Maria (Calif.) Times'' 1987 Pigskin
Preview. The cover photo shows Brunell, the senior star at St.
Joseph High School, standing alongside Jamie Martin, the senior
star from rival Arroyo Grande High. It might not have been so clear
back then, but it's clear now: Brunell is the standout; Martin is
the (injured) backup. And the Jags hope elevated third-stringer
Jonathan Quinn never enters the picture. ... The Patriots have lost
two of their last three, and visit Jacksonville preparing to start
Scott Zolak at QB. Don't expect sympathy from the Jaguars, who have
labored in recent weeks without Brunell, who wants to play in order
to give Jacksonville a chance to avenge the Jags' three losses to
the Patriots in the last four seasons. ``We owe them something,''
Brunell says. ... Miami is 7-1 at home this year, allowing just
10.6 points per game at Pro Player Stadium. ... Buffalo is laying
the groundwork to get some help from the officials in their meeting
with the Dolphins. ``If the officials throw their flags, it's big
for us,'' says QB Doug Flutie, adding that Miami cornerbacks
Terrell Buckley and Sam Madison can be expected to be ``tugging and
pulling as usual. You can't cover Eric Moulds one-on-one. You can't
cover Andre Reed one-on-one.'' ... Buffalo's Thurman Thomas is tied
with Emmitt Smith for most postseason touchdowns (20) and points
(120) in NFL history ... Folks in Denver are suggesting offensive
coordinator Gary Kubiak, who has already interviewed in Cleveland,
might be attracted to the top job in San Diego, where he'd work
under Bobby Beathard and over Ryan Leaf. . ... A little-noticed
fact: While Miami's defense earned headlines for leading the NFL in
not allowing points, the Jets were within one point of permitting
the same number. Meanwhile, New York scored more than 400 points
for only the second time in franchise history. That's balance.
NFC BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   Earning a bye this week is huge for the Vikings, who expect four
injured starters to return for their playoff debut next weekend.
Linebackers Dixon Edwards and Ed McDaniel and tackle Korey Stringer
have been ailing but will be ready to go next week. Most important,
though, is the expected return of Pro Bowl receiver Jake Reed, a
forgotten man in the Randy Moss frenzy. Without Reed, Minnesota has
often used a standard-set offense. With him, they return to a
three-receiver set as much as 50 percent of the time. ... The
Vikings are the first dome team ever to earn home-field advantage
throughout the playoffs. ... Kicker Ryan Longwell is the first
Packer since Paul Hornung in 1960-61 to post consecutive 100-point
seasons. ... Coach Dan Reeves, recovering from quadruple bypass
surgery, nevertheless visited his Falcons last Sunday morning for a
pregame pep talk. Here's hoping his team pays more attention to his
advice than he pays to his doctor's. ... The 49ers have defeated
only two teams with winning records: the Jets in Week 1 and Atlanta
in Week 3. ... Cardinals coach Vince Tobin is smart enough to
understand the subtle problem with winning close games. ``That's
not the way you like to play football games because eventually it's
going to catch up with you and bite you,'' Tobin says. ``You've got
to be able to put games away early when you have the opportunity.''
... Key to the Packers' five-game wining streak against the 49ers?
Green Bay always jumps out in front. In those five meetings, the
Packers have surged to early leads of 21-0, 6-0, 21-0, 10-0 and
16-0. ... You'll hear all about it during Super Bowl Week, so hear
it now: Yes, Vikings third-string QB Jay Fiedler is related to
Arthur Fiedler of the Boston Pops. Jay's grandfather is Arthur's
third cousin.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYOFF QUICK HITS
NUMBERS GAME
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970 merger, five teams have finished the regular
season with one loss or fewer. Minnesota, 15-1, is hoping to become
the fifth of the group to win the Super Bowl: Team Record Finish
1972 Miam Dolphins 14-0 won Super Bowl 1976 Oakland Raiders 13-1
won Super Bowl 1984 San Francisco 49ers 15-1 won Super Bowl 1985
Chicago Bears 15-1 won Super Bowl 1998 Minnesota Vikings 15-1 To be
determined Trivial pursuit There is no doubting the greatness of
Dan Marino and John Elway, the two still-productive stars from the
vaunted Class of '83 quarterback crop. But weirdly, Denver's Elway
and Miami's Marino haven't fared especially well against the other
top quarterbacks in their class. Lifetime against Todd Blackledge,
Tony Eason, Ken O'Brien and Jim Kelly, Elway is 7-7 and Marino is
19-21.
CHECK OUT
</P>
<P>
   A possible Chan Gailey-vs.-Dan Reeves second-round playoff
matchup. Don't get the wrong idea; Gailey's team cannot afford for
him to be anything less than 100 percent committed to the Cowboys'
cause: the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   But can you blame him if has room in his heart, his head, and
maybe in his vision, for an occasional consideration of Atlanta's
Reeves?
</P>
<P>
   You know the well-chronicled Gailey-Reeves relationship: Reeves
was everybody's All-American in Americus, Ga., and was an idol and
mentor to a young Gailey, who got his first lesson in how to coach
a team when he played for a Reeves-coached Little League baseball
team.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship is a Cowboys' win away from going through a
transformation. If Dallas wins its first-round game, Gailey's team
advances to Atlanta for a second-round meeting with Reeves'
Falcons. Considering their brotherly relationship, Reeves' recent
bypass surgery and the high stakes, story lines will be almost
endless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played them two years ago when I was in Pittsburgh,'' says
Gailey, but, of course, that was different. Gailey was the
Steelers' offensive coordinator. Reeves had left the Broncos and
then the Giants to take over a sad-sack program. ``We barely beat
them. They had the nucleus of a good football team, but they needed
to add some other people around them. That's what Dan's done. If
ever there was a perfect guy for a perfect situation, Dan in
Atlanta is it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Reeves' Falcons started 1-7. The pre-Gailey Cowboys
finished 6-10. Does Gailey see similarities in the turnarounds?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things we do that are similar,'' Gailey says.
``There's an emphasis on the run, although they're more of a power
running game and with Emmitt \RSmith\S, we let the back sort of
pick his holes. But spreading out the passing game, that's the
same. A few trick plays and solid defense, we both rely on that. So
there are some parallels you can draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gailey could've never dreamed of this. Could he have?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right when I got here,'' Gailey says, ``there were questions
asked of both Dan and me about the possibility of a Dallas-Atlanta
\Rplayoff game\S. We both kind of laughed.''

DAYNE NEEDS WILLIAMS-TYPE FINALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ 1,928. That's the number of yards Ricky
Williams needed to break Tony Dorsett's career rushing record of
6,082.
</P>
<P>
   1,717. That's the number of yards Ron Dayne needs to break
Williams' career rushing record of 6,279.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky, don't lose that number.
</P>
<P>
   When he announced he was returning for his senior season, Dayne
immediately put Williams' ``unbreakable'' record in danger.
Yesterday at the Rose Bowl, Dayne put himself at the top of the
1999 Heisman Trophy list with 246 yards in the Badgers' 38-31 Rose
Bowl victory against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne tied a Rose Bowl record with four touchdowns and he came
within a yard of the Rose single-game rushing record. That is how
Heisman Trophy campaigns begin. Fortunately for Williams, yardage
in bowl games doesn't count in NCAA career statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10, 253-pound Dayne has averaged 5.7 yards a carry in
three seasons. That means if he maintains that pace, he'll need 302
carries to pass Williams. Dayne has averaged 270 carries in his
first three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne is capable of a huge season. He set an NCAA freshman
record with 2,109 total yards _ and he didn't become a starter
until the fifth game. However, Dayne's rushing totals have declined
each season _ from 1,863 to 1,421 to 1,279 yards this season. He
played in the Rose Bowl despite a torn muscle in his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Williams benefited from the emergence of Texas' passing game
under quarterback Major Applewhite. Opposing defenses had to worry
about the pass ``and'' Williams. Those conundrums keep defensive
coordinators from sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a passing threat, Dayne needs to be more durable.
Williams played nearly every significant play for Texas. Yesterday
in the Rose Bowl, Dayne carried on the Badgers' first three plays,
gaining 24 yards. Then, strangely, he sat for the next two plays.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne, though, is a load. His thighs make Earl Campbell's look
like a runway model's. It's been said that being hit by Dayne is
like being run over by a small car. And he's got speed; he scored
Wisconsin's first touchdown on 38-yard off-tackle burst where he
was untouched.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Williams made the right choice of not entering the
NFL draft after his junior season. He risked serious injury and
gambled that the Longhorns would improve under first-yard coach
Mack Brown. All bets were winners: He broke Dorsett's record, won
the Heisman, helped the Longhorns to a 9-3 season and a Cotton Bowl
victory. Dayne hopes to create similar memories in Madison this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was 37th in career rushing yards before this season;
Dayne is 19th. Dayne's three-year total of 4,563 yards is the
third-highest for players after their junior year, behind the 5,259
rushing yards Herschel Walker had for Georgia and the 4,589
Marshall Faulk compiled for San Diego State. Both Walker and Faulk
passed up their senior seasons to turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne said his decision to return ``wasn't about the money.''
Maybe, for once, that's true. Dayne wants to be close to his
13-month-old daughter, Jada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a lot of fun in college and I wasn't ready to leave
my daughter yet,'' Dayne said. ``Her mother is staying for her
senior year and I wanted to see my daughter and her mother.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dayne knew he was unlikely to be a first-round NFL draft
pick. If he duplicates Williams' season, that should change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he made the right decision,'' Wisconsin coach Barry
Alvarez said. ``I think it will help him in the long run. It will
pay huge dividends, and obviously it will make us a better football
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy that deflects attention. Awards and records and all
those things have no meaning for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Those echo words uttered about Williams by Texas coach Mack
Brown. Williams applied that attitude to fashion one of the most
exalted seasons in college football history. Dayne appears poised
to follow his footsteps.

JAKE PLUMMER HAS A MAGIC TOUCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are a believer in Jake Plummer, you see he is part Fran
Tarkenton and part Joe Montana and part Michael Jordan and part
Bret Maverick, the impudent rascal gambler played by James Garner
on the old ``Maverick'' TV western.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a go-getter,'' Plummer said.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a believer in Jake Plummer, you marveled at his
last-minute football escapades at Arizona State and you saw this
pro career coming: Last week in a must-win situation against San
Diego, for the ninth time in 26 career games, second-year man
Plummer quarterbacked the Cardinals to a fourth-quarter comeback.
It's three consecutive weeks now that Plummer and the Cardinals
have won on the final play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find a way to get it done,'' Plummer said. ``There is
something special about this team.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are a believer in Jake Plummer, you are Cardinals
management, which rewarded him with a four-year, $29.7 million
contract extension featuring an NFL-record $15 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been concerned too much about money,'' Plummer
said. ``I'm not going to let that change the way I play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are a believer in Jake Plummer, you are tackle Lomas
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seven seconds left,'' Brown recalls saying in the
huddle last Sunday, Arizona needing a win over San Diego to qualify
for the playoffs. ``Seven seconds is too many.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are a believer in Jake Plummer, you are all-time
offensive guru Bill Walsh, who said before the season, ``He will
need some help from his teammates, but if the Cardinals turn it
around in 1998 _ and that's not as far-fetched as it seems _ I
wouldn't be surprised if Jake Plummer is the league's most valuable
player. He's that good.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are not a believer in Jake Plummer. ... well, you haven't
been paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Plummer's 1998 numbers (a 75.0 QB rating, with 17
touchdowns to 20 interceptions) are less than impressive. But the
Cardinals boast a historic number with a maturing Plummer under
center: Arizona is an unprecedented 7-1 this year in games decided
by three points or less _ and Plummer's talent, leadership and
panache is the reason for it. Never was that more the case than
last Sunday when Plummer led his team to a game-winning field goal
in the final seven seconds that put the Cardinals in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake Plummer is a guy,'' said Cardinals cornerback Aeneas
Williams, ``who creates an aura.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who challenge the Cowboys in an NFL wild-card
game today, have long had a aura _ an unsavory one. There remain
questions about how ready this team and this franchise are for the
big time. They haven't defeated the Cowboys at Texas Stadium since
1989. They haven't beaten a team with a winning record all season.
They haven't participated in a nonstrike playoff game in the past
two decades and haven't won a postseason game since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   But the questions about Plummer's readiness are fading. It's
ridiculous to compare him to basketball legend Jordan, though
that's not stopping overzealous Cardinals officials. It's also
premature to compare him to Tarkenton, the smallish Minnesota
Vikings legend who was a scrambler before scrambling was cool. And
it's premature to compare him to a very unusual Joe, Montana, the
former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who has Plummer's same
slight build, knack for last-moment magic and jersey No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   But it's only off the field where Plummer seems to be an
ordinary Joe. Plummer, 24, is heralded in Arizona as an unassuming
team-first guy, a kid from Idaho who apparently favors a bowl
haircut, who spent his college years tooling around in the desert
in a Mazda without air conditioning, who purchased his first suit
in 1996 only because his mom convinced him it would be unbecoming
to attend the Heisman Trophy ceremony in New York wearing khaki
pants.
</P>
<P>
   And when asked what sort of suit he bought for the occasion,
Plummer responded:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. The top matches the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer was only a second-round pick of the Cardinals last year,
and started th 1997 season inactive for the first six weeks as the
third-stringer behind Kent Graham and Stoney Case. But Arizona
coach Vince Tobin says the 6-foot-2, 197-pound quarterback's
intangible assets were overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always players who have special leadership qualities
that can't be measured,'' Tobin said. ``Jake showed that starting
four years at ASU. We saw those same qualities last year as a
rookie. And we only expect him to keep improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in losses, Plummer has established his ability to overcome.
The most statistically stunning example of such savvy came in a
35-28 loss to the Cowboys on Nov. 15, when the Cardinals trailed
28-7 at halftime but stormed back to a near-win as Plummer threw
for 314 of his 465 yards in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had times this year,'' said Cowboys defensive coordinator
Dave Campo: ``when he's walked on water.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds backup quarterback Dave Brown, reflecting on the times when
Plummer comebacks fall short: ``Some guys have it, and some guys
don't. But what impresses me most is that he feels like he should
do it every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week at Sun Devil Stadium, after Plummer had engineered
another unlikely buzzer-beating victory, fireworks exploded. Many
of the 51,000 in attendance rushed the field. And as Plummer
trotted into the locker-room tunnel, tapping his heart and blowing
kisses to his faithful, banners were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the eighth day, God created Jake,'' read one.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Plummer 3:16,'' read another.
</P>
<P>
   And the most simple, and most telling:
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe.''

By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Cuba _ It has been 40 years since Fidel Castro marched
into this seaside colonial city at the head of a column of rebels
and declared the end of the Batista dictatorship from the balcony
of city hall. For residents here, it has been 40 years of
socialism, economic sacrifice and endless maneuvering in a cold war
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But as the city prepared Friday for Castro's return Friday night
to give a speech commemorating the anniversary of the revolution,
it was hard to find anyone on the streets here who would openly
criticize the 72-year-old Cuban leader or his policies.
</P>
<P>
   The town was dressed in propaganda. Cuban flags flew from
balconies, and signs celebrating the ``triumph of the revolution''
could be seen in all the shop windows. ``To be Cuban is a privilege
and a pact with Fidel,'' said one sign.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech here, Castro described the moment of victory on
Jan. 1, 1959, saying that ``I felt for a moment a strange sense of
emptiness'' to leave behind the ``hard, pure and healthy'' life of
a guerrilla to take over the leadership of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I lead are not the same people of that January
first,'' he said, noting that 7 million of Cuba's 11 million
inhabitants were born after the revolution. He said he was ``not
exactly the same man of that day, either.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he still thought the same way and predicted that the
capitalist system would fall. Referring to financial speculators,
he said, ``They have turned the planet into a giant casino.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews earlier, several working-class people and veterans
of the rebel army said they still supported Castro's long
experiment with socialism, despite the economic hardships they have
had to endure. Even with the economy in tatters, many said they
have more opportunity now than they did before 1959, when a good
education was out of reach for most poor people, especially those
with black skin. Castro's supporters also blame the U.S. trade
embargo and not the Castro government for their economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blockade is a crime against Cuba _ Cubans never deserved
this,'' said Ibrahim Salazar, a 63-year-old retired bus driver, who
was waiting with friends near the main plaza where workers were
setting the stage for Castro's speech.
</P>
<P>
   He wore a frayed T-shirt commemorating the revolution's 30th
anniversary. Salazar said he believed the revolution's major goals,
like free education and health care, had been met. His son had
become an engineer, something unthinkable for poor people 40 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't lose faith,'' he said. ``We have problems, but we are
going to conquer them.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
country's economic fabric had been slowly unraveling since 1991,
when the Soviet Union stopped subsidizing the economy with more
than $4 billion in aid. Since then, Cuba has become a country where
doctors make less than $30 a month and must moonlight as cab
drivers for tourists to make ends meet and where some educated
women with professional skills choose prostitution at resort hotels
as a way out of poverty. The average monthly salary is 207 pesos,
or about $10.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a country that more than 1 million people have fled
since Castro took over. Just last year, more than 450,000 applied
for visas to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sort of Titanic,'' said a one resident of Santiago,
who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared arrest.
``Everyone is trying to get a boat to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The system doesn't work. At this moment money is the
principle problem for everyone here. You need money to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   After four decades of Castro's socialist experiment, Cuba has
become a paradox. With free education and health care, it has the
highest literacy rate and the lowest infant mortality rate in Latin
America. The average life expectancy is now 75.3 years, far above
the 60 years in 1959. The number of university graduates per capita
has quadrupled, and Cuban doctors have broken new ground in
biotechnology and vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Castro has failed to break the island's dependency on the
sugar crop and tourism for most of its hard-currency earnings _
twin factors that were blamed before the revolution for making Cuba
an economic vassal of the United States. And the country is no more
democratic than it was under Fulgencio Batista, the dictator who
fled on Jan. 1, 1959.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Castro has reluctantly
undertaken some market-oriented reforms. He has legalized the
dollar and allowed some small-scale private business: farmers'
markets, plumbing enterprises, hairdressers, language schools. He
has also decentralized some of the state-owned industries.
</P>
<P>
   But professionals like doctors, who continue to work are not
doing it for the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The living is not much, but we manage,'' said Dr. Juan
Fernandez, a general practitioner, who says he makes about $30 a
month. ``I like my profession, and I'm dedicated to my work.''
</P>
<P>
   To his supporters here in Santiago, Castro remains the best hope
for the working-class people in Cuba. Even if he is an autocrat,
several said, he is their autocrat, looking out for their
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his appeal is rooted in history and nostalgia. Some of
the older residents remember the New Year's Day morning in 1959
when Castro and his troops marched into town and announced the end
of Batista's rule. There was jubilation in the streets, people
singing and cheering for the end of the regime, which had used
increasingly repressive measures in an effort to stanch the
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lived through many assassinations, many tortures, and
the life was impossible here,'' recalled Rafael Guillen, an
accountant. ``When Fidel came, it was as if we had been in great
pain and someone had given us a painkiller.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The new generation who didn't live through it cannot
understand it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Others continue to support Castro because he has advanced
equality for blacks and women. Fermin Reynoso, a 40-year-old
driver, who is black, said that before Castro's takeover, blacks of
his father's generation never had a chance of rising in society.
Racism was pervasive then, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But under Castro, Reynoso could have a military career. He
served for nine years, fighting in Angola and Ethiopia, and retired
as a lieutenant. Now he has a relatively good job, and his children
have a chance at a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The socialist system has given a lot of opportunities to all
the blacks here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rolando Segui, 83, is typical of many of the older people here
who still support Castro. Like his father before him, Segui was a
butcher in the 1950s. There was no chance of going to college, he
said, nor of becoming something other than a butcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to become a butcher because there was no other work,''
he said. ``I never had the opportunity to study.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined Castro's rebellion, the July 26 Movement, because he
was appalled at the political assassinations that Batista's
operatives were carrying out in the streets of Santiago,
eliminating young people on unproven charges that they sympathized
with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   After Castro's victory, Segui was rewarded with government jobs,
first as a health inspector and later a housing inspector. He
retired 10 years ago. Segui says he is still optimistic about the
future. The abject poverty, illiteracy and sickness he witnessed in
his youth no longer exists. Most important, he said, his
grandchildren have a chance of rising in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we fought for,'' he said. ``If you want to be a
doctor, and you have the capacity to be a doctor, you can be a
doctor.''

 CLINTON PREFERS GOLF TO TALK AT RENAISSANCE WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS penultimate graf before optional add to delete reference

(mk) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILTON HEAD, S.C. _ President Clinton rang out his most unusual
of years in his usual, if peculiar, way: in very earnest policy
discussion with more than a thousand acquaintances and fans _ and a
few old friends and unimpressed strangers _ assembled at the annual
Renaissance Weekend here.
</P>
<P>
   For more than an hour as midnight approached on Thursday, the
president and Hillary Rodham Clinton fielded questions selected by
the event's organizers. In all the talk about Africa, Social
Security and health care, impeachment and Monica Lewinsky went
unmentioned. At midnight the president kissed his wife, then joined
in a toast and sang along to ``Auld Lang Syne.''
</P>
<P>
   To some guests, the Clintons appeared solemn, far less spirited
and engaged than in the past. Indeed, after a year in which he
admitted adultery before his family and the world, launched his
biggest military assault, and became the second president ever
impeached, Clinton seems in particular need of renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   But if so, he did not seek it in the organized doings here. He
spent more time on the golf course and with his Labrador retriever
on the beach during his three days at this studious gathering, a
kind of ``Big Chill'' retreat for Baby Boomers who didn't inhale.
``This is sort of paradise if you're a C-Span junkie,'' enthused
Bob Richardson, winner of a Nobel Prize in physics for discovering
superfluidity in liquid helium 3.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not attend any of the chin-stroking seminars that,
like bran flakes in a retirement community, are a staple of the
official fare. He passed up the half-day ``academy'' devoted to
``Character: What is it? Does is it count?'' He also skipped
``Spiritual Life in a Secular Society,'' and a session on the
meaning of the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   In some seminars, Clinton's trying year was an unavoidable, if
delicate, subject for the businessmen, politicians, scientists and
journalists. ``I don't think anyone here is quite so gauche as to
directly address'' Clinton's problems, said Walt Cunningham, the
Apollo 7 astronaut and conservative radio talk show host, though he
said the subject had been debated in a ``genteel way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentility is the reigning principle of this privileged, even
precious conclave, and guests bemoan what they regard as the
baffling failure of political discourse at large to mimic
Renaissance Weekend's lonely model. So far, the only ones to take
up the challenge are the conservatives who set out to mock it by
creating the rival Dark Ages conference, now known as the Weekend,
which is focused more tightly on politics.
</P>
<P>
   The throng here leans distinctly to the left, but there are some
notable Republicans, including Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., who voted
to impeach the president. He told The Associated Press that he
intended to avoid any talk of that with Clinton. ``They'd probably
be fairly unproductive conversations, to say the least,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford said he would encourage Clinton to achieve ``a legacy''
by fixing Social Security _ apparently not expecting the president
to be removed any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave the same impression, appearing as cheerful and
confident in public as ever. But those who spent private time with
him here described him as clearly in need of recreation and
preoccupied with maneuvering in the Senate over his upcoming trial.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a question-and-answer session with young people
Thursday evening, followed by the banquet and exchange later that
night, Clinton did not attend any Renaissance Weekend events. On
Friday, he spent more than four hours on the golf course _ on top
of almost six on Thursday _ before returning to the beachfront
estate he is using here. There, he watched his beloved Arkansas
Razorbacks lose a heartbreaker to Michigan in the Florida Citrus
Bowl before flying back to Washington late Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons have been regulars at Renaissance Weekend for 15
years, almost since its founding in 1981. Their detachment this
year contrasted sharply with past appearances, particularly with
the exuberant touch football games and job-seeking of 1992, after
Clinton's first election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Participants still gush about the breadth of the discussion and
the vigor of the networking. Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster,
rhapsodized about spending 90 minutes on Thursday walking the beach
with Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the sex expert, and Alan Blinder, the
Princeton economist. ``Al Franken's wife is helping me decorate my
new home!'' he added, referring to the comedian.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz's question was the last one read to Clinton on Thursday
night. After noting that he had got rich helping to write the House
Republicans' Contract with America, he asked, ``What advice would
you give to the Republican party? I need the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton replied that the Contract with America had helped
Republicans in 1994, when they won control of the House, and the
Democrats in 1996, alluding to his re-election, the White House and
participants said. He called for a partisanship devoted to debates
over worthy subjects like Social Security. And in his only, oblique
reference to his difficult 1998, he said he hoped the country would
``move away from the politics of personal destruction.''

Texas' defense comes full circle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS _ True, Major Applewhite was a college freshman with the
face of an eighth-grader. But everyone knew the kid had a serious
arm, Jackie Sherrill included. Nobody wanted Major more than Jackie
did.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ricky Williams, he returned to Texas as the odds-on
Heisman Trophy favorite. You couldn't screw up an offense with
Williams anchoring it. And the 'Horns had a bit of speed at
receiver, too. Wane McGarity runs faster, cleaner pass routes
despite a bionic knee than almost everybody in the country, the NFL
types included.
</P>
<P>
   That UT would generate 38 points in a Southwestern Bell Cotton
Bowl rout of Mississippi State on Friday should have shocked not a
soul.
</P>
<P>
   As Sherrill himself said, ``They've got a few weapons over
there, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Longhorns' defense had been allowed in recent years to
lose its teeth, horns and perhaps other significant manly body
parts. Mack Brown's milquetoast predecessor, the fired John
Mackovic, gave the strong impression defense bored him.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it would come to pass that a program made famous by
the hard-nosed likes of D.X. Bible and Darrell K Royal could reach
the point where it could conjure up a way to lose a home game to
UCLA 66-3.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and his defensive coordinator, the crusty old Carl Reese,
found out quickly last spring what they were up against.
</P>
<P>
   ``After our first contact drill,'' Reese said, ``I went home and
threw up.''
</P>
<P>
   Then things turned really ugly. Inevitably, the season came
around and New Mexico State _ New Mexico State! _ rammed the ball
down the 'Horns' gullets. Reese called Brown on the sideline and
conceded he was open to suggestions, that he had run out of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Next, picking up where they had left off in Austin, the Bruins
moved the ball so willfully at Texas' expense Reese said he didn't
have the slightest idea where to point fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really couldn't tell who was supposed to be covering
who,'' he said. ``UCLA's receivers were so open I didn't know who
to yell at.''
</P>
<P>
   At halftime that night in the Rose Bowl, Brown had had enough.
Furious _ and furious doesn't come easily for him _ he told his
starters they step up and show something or there would be a
different lineup on the field in their place the following week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drew a line in the dirt for them,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   And through a good portion of the defensive playbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We greatly simplified what we were trying to do,'' Mack said.
``We weren't executing all that other stuff anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, something registered. With the lone senior in the
bunch, Dusty Renfro, taking the requisite lead, Reese's pieces
began to come together in fits and spurts. Oklahoma would be held
to three points. More remarkably, the vaunted Nebraska running game
would be squeezed lifeless as UT ended the 'Huskers' home winning
streak at 47.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there have been the occasional setbacks, such as the
relapse against Texas Tech, but the culmination of the 'Horns'
refurbished spirit was on display for all to see at Fair Park on
Friday, a thick early fog notwithstanding. Old nemesis Sherrill
probably didn't recognize the team of erstwhile ``powderpuffs'' _
Reese's word _ he had whipped up on seven times in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Late third quarter. Fourth-and-one. Texas leading 31-3.
Desperate, Jackie goes for the first down at his 19. Middle
linebacker Renfro, wearing the No. 60 Tommy Nobis made
unforgettable to honor the memory of Nobis' renowned defensive
coordinator, the late Mike Campbell, pile-drives James Johnson into
reverse for a one-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the 'Horns are in the end zone again. It's 38-3.
It's over. Final score: Texas 38, Sherrill 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poooor Jackie,'' the Orangebloods in the stadium could chant.
Boy, had they waited a long time to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the spirit of the '60s in me today,'' Renfro said.
``And that play is the one I'll remember the most. We've come a
long way.''
</P>
<P>
   So did he believe he was leaving the Texas defense in good
hands?
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' Renfro said. ``I just wish I had three more
years of eligibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Every other Longhorns starter returns. Come spring, Reese will
reinsert the fancy gimmicks he had scrapped out of frustration
weeks ago. He is plotting improvements. He expects his defense to
progress to a higher plane in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there yet,'' he argues. ``We've got a bunch to
improve on.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt. After all, the Bulldogs did rush for a whopping 87
yards. And Wayne Madkin, Applewhite's freshman counterpart at
quarterback for MSU, was permitted to complete 25 percent of his
passes before Sherrill, showing pity, sent in Matt Wyatt. Shame,
shame, Carl.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of losing Williams to the NFL can't be overestimated.
A player of Ricky's special stature makes everybody several notches
better simply by association Without him, Applewhite figures to
take a step backward before he takes another, uh, major step
forward. And Brown surely will have days when he doesn't look
nearly as smart as he appears right now, with the 9-3 'Horns, in
his words ``back in the national picture.''
</P>
<P>
   But defense, like love, tends to conquer all. If Renfro can be
replaced _ spiritually perhaps more importantly than physically _
Mack will have the knife with which he can win. It's nice to see
Texas being Texas again.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Mike Campbell should be smiling.
</P>

Williams goes out in style for UT
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DALLAS _ Throughout all four years of his brilliant college career,
Ricky Williams had humbly handed the football to an official
whenever he scored a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams decided he would make a one-time exception in his
final college game. When he scored on a 37-yard run in the third
quarter of Texas' 38-11 Cotton Bowl victory over Mississippi State
on Friday, it was time to thrill his teammates and the fans by
hamming it up a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   Williams stood in the end zone and broke into the Heisman Trophy
pose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something the guys have tried to get me to do all year,''
he said. ``I didn't want to do it until after I won the award. I
knew when I did it today we were far enough ahead (21-3) that the
penalty wouldn't hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas was penalized 15 yards on the kickoff, but it wasn't for
taunting by Williams. The whistle came on the extra point when a UT
player was flagged for a personal foul. After all, what official
could blame a guy for showing off once in a career of amazing
moments?
</P>
<P>
   Williams ended his record-setting career with another
record-setting day, rushing for 203 yards on 30 carries and scoring
two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most rushing yards ever for a UT player in a bowl and
the third-most in the 63-year history of the Cotton Bowl. Williams
also had 45 yards receiving on five catches to give him a Cotton
Bowl record 248 tandem yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were all the questions about whether you can play with
focus after winning the Heisman Trophy because of all the
distractions,'' said Texas coach Mack Brown. ``There was even a
rumor that Ricky had gotten fat, but I thought he looked pretty
good today.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Williams surprised many people by opting to return
for his senior year when he likely would have been a first-round
draft choice in the NFL. But it turned into a dream season for the
talented running back. He won the Heisman and became Division I's
career rushing leader with 6,279 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely was worth it,'' Williams said. ``I'm a much
stronger and smarter football player after this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that made Friday's game special for Williams was
the fact it came on Doak Walker Day in Texas. Walker, who won the
1948 Heisman at SMU, died in September at 71.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was so special on Doak Walker Day for Ricky to
play so well on Doak's birthday in the house that Doak built,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who would have turned 72 on Friday, also played in the
Cotton Bowl in his Heisman season 50 years ago. To honor him, his
No. 37 was painted at the 37-yard line on each side of the field
for Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Walker had become friends in the last year before
Walker's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely was on my mind,'' Williams said. ``I was looking
for his number every time I crossed the 37-yard line. I wanted to
give him a great birthday present. Then I found out one of my
touchdowns was 37 yards, which I thought was kind of neat.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching Williams reach every goal he set out to achieve
this season, Brown was asked if there was anything he can't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. He can't come back next year,'' quipped Brown. ``We
already have checked.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he can't sing. I asked him at a pep rally to sing, and
that was an awful mistake. Those are the only two things I know he
can't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I learned that Ricky Williams is a lot more than a great
football player. He's a young man that does things right and does
things with a lot of class. When you challenge him with something,
he steps up to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State safety Anthony Derricks admitted after that
game that he never had faced an opponent like Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky certainly deserves the Heisman,'' Derricks said. ``He is
the best running back I have ever played against. I've played
against some great ones, but he's the best.''

N.Y. PHILHARMONIC: A NEW YEAR'S EVE GALA WITH A BIT OF NEWNESS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By   ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You'll get no complaints here about the waltzes of
Johann Strauss Jr., which are absolutely perfect pieces. No less a
formidable composer than Brahms was an enormous admirer of the
waltz king's work, and having tried his own hand at waltz writing,
he knew it wasn't as easy as it looked. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, why is it that when something festive is wanted for a New
Year's Eve Gala program, symphony orchestras seldom come up with
anything other than Strauss? Surely there are other candidates,
some of them American. My choice would be Leroy Anderson, the
overlooked master of the short, skillfully rendered orchestral
novelty piece. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But credit Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic with the
good idea of adding Richard Strauss (no relation) to their New
Year's Eve Gala of Johann Strauss on Thursday night, specifically,
excerpts from the former's ``Rosenkavalier.'' Three splendid
singers were on hand as soloists: the sopranos Deborah Voigt and
Heidi Grant Murphy, and, in her New York Philharmonic debut, the
Austrian mezzo-soprano Angelika Kirchschlager.
</P>
<P>
   Actually ``Der Rosenkavalier'' is a most appropriate piece for
reflecting on the past and preparing for the future. In the
love-at-first-sight duets for Sophie and Octavian, we experience
the impetuous ecstasy of adolescence. And in the Marschallin's
teary yet graceful exit from her affair with young Octavian, which
she knew was bound to end but not, as she says in her most moving
line, so quickly, we learn to cherish the present while we can, but
not cling when the time comes to let go. Pretty good advice for New
Year's Eve. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As has been the custom, Avery Fisher Hall was decked with swaths
of gold, orange, aquamarine, purple and rose-red fabrics, some of
them stretched across the entire hall like crepe paper streamers.
The women in the orchestra wore festive dresses, a refreshing
change from the requisite formal black. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murphy was replacing on short notice the soprano Noemi
Nadelmann. But this young American soprano is a veteran Sophie, and
her luminous, creamy voice sounded lovely in the transfixing ``Rose
Duet,'' as it is often called. Ms. Kirchschlager, with her rich,
dusky-toned mezzo-soprano voice, projected young count Octavian's
hormonal passions, but also his awed confusion in the face of
Sophie's disarming beauty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then Ms. Voigt joined the duo for the opera's great final trio
and showed again that she can rein in her powerhouse voice to sing
with affecting tenderness. Ms. Murphy and Ms. Kirchschlager also
performed the subsequent duet that concludes the opera, which left
Ms. Voigt somewhat underutilized in the program's first half. She
might, for instance, have been asked to sing something else by
Richard Strauss (an orchestral song, an operatic scene) in place of
the rather ineffective arrangement of waltzes from ``Der
Rosenkavalier'' with which Masur began the concert. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A conductor has to be careful in this opera not to overly milk
the music's opulent lyricism. But Masur went too much to the other
extreme: his tempos were somewhat brisk; phrases were clipped, and
some of the most heavenly moments had no time to register. You
would have thought Masur was determined above all to end the
program, which was being televised live, at the scheduled 10 p.m.
Still, he drew lush, attentive and texturally transparent playing
from the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The works by Johann Strauss that Masur turned to in the second
half included the popular ``Pizzicato-Polka'' (actually composed by
Johann with his brother Josef), the witty ``Perpetuum Mobile,'' the
exotic Egyptian March and, of course, the Blue Danube Waltz, all
winningly done.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's soloists returned, having changed into more
glamorous gowns (which I believe they would want acknowledged), to
sing one additional work each. Ms. Kirchschlager brought ardor and
elegance to ``Wiener Blut,'' though Masur let the orchestra
overpower her somewhat; Ms. Murphy sang ``Draussen in Sievering''
liltingly, and Ms. Voigt poured out her voice excitingly in the
``Csardas'' from ``Die Fledermaus,'' which was something to hear:
imagine Sieglinde trying to cheer up Siegmund with a little
Hungarian number.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were encores, of course: more dances and polkas, for which
Masur dapperly wore a Fred Astaire top hat, and the audience
clapped along to a rousing march. The guest vocalists returned for
the inevitable ``Auld Lang Syne,'' and those concertgoers not
staying for the fancy post-concert dinner, a benefit for the
orchestra's pension fund, bundled up to face the chilly weather. &QL;

DAYNE'S 4 TOUCHDOWNS AND 246 YARDS HUMBLE UCLA 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By KEN GURNICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Now UCLA will not have to wonder about the
national championship that could have been.
</P>
<P>
   Not after Friday, when Wisconsin beat the Bruins, 38-31, in the
85th Rose Bowl. The Badgers were powered by four touchdowns from
the running back Ron Dayne and a clinching 46-yard interception
return for a touchdown by a freshman cornerback, Jamar Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   The victory provided the Badgers with a measure of pride after
being disrespected nationwide, most notably by CBS analyst Craig
James, who called them ``the worst team ever to play in the Rose
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what does that make UCLA? After being abused for 689 yards
by Miami in the Dec. 5 loss that canceled their Fiesta Bowl
invitation to play for the national championship, the Bruins (10-2)
allowed Wisconsin 497 yards, including 246 by Dayne, 1 yard short
of the Rose Bowl record.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin (11-1) ended the season with the most victories in
school history, but UCLA quarterback Cade McNown, a Heisman Trophy
finalist, passed easily through its top-rated defense.The Badgers,
however, came up with big plays repeatedly in the fourth quarter to
make Dayne's remarkable performance hold up. The clincher was
freshman Wendell Bryant's sack of McNown on fourth-and-3 at the
Wisconsin 47 with 59 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA made too many careless mistakes in a game the Bruins were
supposedly motivated to win as redemption for their loss to Miami.
Instead, the Bruins offense kept putting points on the board, but
the defense was no match for the opposing running game, namely
Dayne.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder UCLA coach Bob Toledo teased earlier in the week that
the Bruins' defense practiced defending Dayne by tackling pickup
trucks. By the second quarter it seemed to be a contest as to who
would collapse first _ Dayne from running up and down the Rose Bowl
field or the Bruins defense from chasing him.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10-inch, 253-pound back had 173 yards and three
touchdowns by halftime. His favorite direction was right, behind
368-pound tackle Aaron Gibson, one of the biggest players in
college football.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers were supposed to be too small, too slow and not
athletic enough to compete with the Bruins, who were favored by 10
points. But both teams were good enough to be seeking their 11th
victory this season, and the first half was an entertaining
offensive dogfight, with Wisconsin leading, 24-21, and outgaining
UCLA in yardage, 333-305.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had had their sights set on Monday's Fiesta Bowl
until their debacle in Miami in the last game of the season, and
the Badgers were picked for the Rose Bowl as tri-champions of the
Big 10 Conference because they had not played in the bowl for the
longest time.
</P>
<P>
   The game was supposed to be a test of UCLA's defense, after
Miami's Edgerrin Jones had run wild for 299 yards, as well as a
test of Wisconsin's defense, ranked No. 1 in the nation. As the
score indicated, both defenses will want to burn the game films.
</P>
<P>
   With UCLA's maligned group further hampered by injuries,
Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez set the tone immediately, calling
Dayne's number on Wisconsin's first three plays of the game. Dayne
churned out gains of 10, 7 and 7 yards, carrying Bruins defenders
on his back until he could be gang tackled. That drive fizzled when
the Badgers started mixing in pass plays, but they went back to the
big man on their next possession.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne's brute strength, though, had nothing to do with his first
touchdown run. On first down, he took a simple handoff, jumped
outside to the left and no Bruin put a hand on him as he powered
down the sideline 54 yards for his longest rush of the season on
way to a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's offense, at least, accepted the challenge. A seven-play
drive that included McNown completions of 22 and 16 yards ended
with a 38-yard touchdown catch-and-run by tailback Jermaine Lewis,
who slipped up the middle, took McNown's flip to the right, eluded
linebacker Donnel Thompson's tackle and sprinted down the sideline
behind a perfect block from wide receiver Brian Poli-Dixon to tie
it at 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   quarterback Mike Samuel set up Dayne's second touchdown with a
52-yard run down the sideline on an option play. Two plays later
Dayne patiently followed the blocks of Casey Rabach and Eric Grams
around right end for a 7-yard score that led to a 14-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo came right back with a perfectly executed gimmick play
featuring Freddie Mitchell. On second-and-6 from his 39, McNown
rolled left and shoveled to Mitchell on a reverse. Mitchell pulled
up and launched a bomb that Durell Price ran under, catching the
ball at the 20 and running in for the 61-yard touchdown and a 14-14
tie.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA took a 21-14 lead on McNown's arm, a 41-yard post-pattern
to Danny Farmer, who beat freshman Jamar Fletcher, then used his
volleyball jumping skills to reach back for the pass McNown
underthrew.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne's third score, a 5-yard touchdown capping a drive that
included runs of 20 and 36 yards, tied it at 21-21.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Davenport's 40-yard field goal with 17 seconds left in the
half gave Wisconsin a 24-21 lead, and the Bruins narrowly escaped
disaster when they could not handle Vitaly Pisetskys squib kickoff.
But Randy Hakes recovered for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne appeared refreshed after halftime, carrying four times on
his team's first series of the third quarter. His final rush was
his fourth touchdown, a 22-yarder to help give the Badgers a 31-21
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins could have climbed right back but for a devastating
communication mixup between McNown and a freshman running back,
DeShaun Foster. A 44-yard completion to Farmer set up the Bruins at
the Wisconsin 6 . Even after McNown called a timeout, confusion
reigned on the ensuing audible as McNown pitched to Foster, who was
expecting a handoff and the ball bounced off his chest, recovered
by the Badgers.
</P>
<P>
   Although playing in their home stadium, the Bruins were
overwhelmed by the noise the predominantly Wisconsin crowd produced
when they neared the end zone. McNown was forced to burn a second
time out the next time the Bruins reached the red zone.

LITTLE PAGEANTRY, MUCH SPECULATION ABOUT PATAKI'S PRESIDENTIAL
PLANS
</HEADLINE>
   (See also NY-INAUG, NY-INAUG-EXCERPT) 
(DW) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ George E. Pataki's inaugural celebration four
years ago had the trappings of a coronation _ a pageant replete
with marching bands, celebrities, a laser show, confetti and a
black-tie gala for 13,000 guests.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, as Pataki was sworn in for a second term, he and his
supporters shunned the sort of lavishness and pomp that made his
first inaugural party one of the most extravagant in the state's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's 1999 swearing-in was celebrated at a modest reception
in a ballroom at the Omni Hotel in downtown Albany, where about 300
people gathered to sample plates of chicken and beef, dance to the
music of a six-piece jazz band and chat from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. The
nearest thing approaching extravagance was a 180-pound cake baked
in the shape of the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   So why was there so much temperance this time around?
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides explained that his re-election victory did not
call for the kind of three-day bash thrown back in January 1995,
after he defeated Mario M. Cuomo, a three-term Democrat, and became
New York's first Republican Governor in more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   That may very well be. But Pataki also drew a lot of political
and legal heat as a result of the way his aides financed his 1995
inaugural. That time, his advisers created two private committees
to raise money for the inaugural and transition.
</P>
<P>
   The aides refused to disclose who made donations to the
committees, even after Democrats sued, seeking the information.
When Pataki's aides released the list of donors to comply with a
court order, it showed that many donations were from corporations
doing business with the state.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's inauguration came a few weeks after Pataki announced
that he would spend part of his second term traveling around the
country, speaking out on issues that he has said are important to
New York state and the nation. That announcement reignited
speculation that Pataki was flirting with the notion of running for
national office. The governor and his aides have said that his
travel plans do not reflect any ambitions beyond Albany. But both
supporters and detractors who watched him being sworn in Friday
could not resist offering their thoughts about the governor's
national prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is heading in the right direction under this
governor,'' said Thomas Libous, a Republican state senator from
Binghamton. ``If people around the nation see the kind of
leadership he has provided here, he'll definitely be a national
contender.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of his most ardent Democratic rivals conceded that the
folksy image Pataki has carefully tailored may play well
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Weprin, a Democratic assemblyman from Queens, said he found
the governor's speech rather humdrum and filled with platitudes but
few specifics. But he grudgingly acknowledged that what he found
dull might attract a scandal-weary electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had to pick a flavor to describe this governor, it
would be vanilla,'' Weprin said. ``But the thing is that many
people like vanilla. If he has any chance as a presidential
candidate, it's because people like his folksy image. He's got this
Jimmy Stewart style.''

OFFENSIVE LINE SHOULDERS BLAME FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER   
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ UCLA's offensive line is considered the best
in the Pac-10, but the Bruins met their match in Wisconsin's
defensive line, led by All-American Tom Burke.
</P>
<P>
   For UCLA, the collision in the trenches was a draw, at best.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins averaged a mere 3.2 yards per rush, they were called
for several drive-killing holding penalties and they struggled to
protect quarterback Cade McNown, who was sacked three times _
including the final play _ and pressured throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had allowed just 10 sacks all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an offensive line, we take a lot of the blame,'' guard Andy
Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The line was not to blame for every sack or hurry, however. On
several plays, McNown had time to throw but couldn't find an open
receiver. Without Brian Poli-Dixon, who missed most of the game
with a hamstring injury, the Bruins had few downfield options other
than Danny Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The receivers had some trouble getting off the corners,''
Meyers said, ``but we had the most trouble on rollout plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Going, going . . . Did junior offensive tackle Kris Farris play
his last game for UCLA?
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Farris said he would make a decision about jumping to
the NFL after facing Burke, one of the best lineman in the nation.
When the Rose Bowl ended, Farris talked like someone who had played
his last college game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make a decision over the weekend, but I think I played
the game of my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he added: ``I was very nervous all week because this game
was going to set up any decision I made, and I'm !ital!very
pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   There's little doubt among his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he's been talking, he's gone,'' one Bruin said.
</P>
<P>
   High Price: Sylmar native Durell Price played one of the best
games of his career with three catches for 102 yards and a
touchdown on a trick pass by receiver Freddie Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the second read,'' Price said. ``If the cornerbacks went
with Farmer, which was likely, he was going to me. They forgot
about the little old fullback.''
</P>
<P>
   A candidate? According to published reports out of Seattle, UCLA
offensive coordinator Al Borges is a secondary candidate for the
vacant Washington coaching position.
</P>
<P>
   Borges is well-respected but lacks two important qualities: He
does not have head-coaching experience, and he does not have ties
to the Washington program.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source, Borges spoke briefly with ex-Washington
coach Don James several weeks ago but has not been contacted by the
Husky administration. James is an unofficial member of the search
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Borges declined to comment. &QL;

GEORGE JACKSON EDER, 98, LAWYER AND ECONOMIST
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla.)   (ms) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Jackson Eder, a lawyer and economist active in Latin
American affairs, died Dec. 23 &UR;  &LR;  in Shands Hospital in Gainesville,
Fla. He had collapsed the previous evening while Christmas shopping
at Wal-Mart, his son Richard said. He was 98.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in New York City, Eder served in the Cavalry
during World War I in France. After studying law and accounting, he
served as a coffee buyer for several years in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   In 1926, Eder was appointed to head the Latin American section
of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce. It was a period in
which the United States was superceding the major European
countries as the leading trading partner of South and Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, Eder was dismissed after publishing a feisty attack on
British efforts to promote their exports to Argentina. In a
175-page pamphlet published by the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, Eder wrote that a recent visit by the prince
of Wales to open a British trade fair in Argentina was to ``attack
American mercantile supremacy.'' And he wrote that British
merchants and diplomats were making ``veiled attacks on
Argentine-American friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   After working at an investment firm, Eder joined the
International Telephone and Telegraph Co. in 1939 as a deputy
counsel. He was sent to work in ITT's Argentine subsidiary in 1940,
which operated that country's telephone system. After negotiating
the sale of the telephone company to the Argentine government, Eder
moved back to ITT's New York headquarters in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Eder took a leave from ITT to head an economic mission
to help the Bolivian government cope with spiraling inflation. He
helped concoct a plan that included balancing the budget and
eliminating currency exchange limits, followed by a one-year freeze
on wages. A key element of the plan was to repay debt the country
owed to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The plan had critics on the Bolivian left. In June 1957, Nuflo
Chaves, the labor-backed vice president of Bolivia, resigned after
a public dispute with Eder. But in a speech before Congress two
months later, President Hernan Siles Zuazo said that the plan
created by Eder had ``saved the country from disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Eder left ITT in 1961 and spent several years teaching, first at
Harvard Law School and then at the business school of the
University of Michigan, where he specialized in tax policy. He
retired to Washington, D.C., and moved to Gainesville in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Eder's wife, Marceline Gray Eder, died in 1971. He is survived
by four children: Donald Eder, a teacher in Norwalk, Conn.; Richard
Eder, a book critic in Milton, Mass.; Luli Gray, a writer in Chapel
Hill, N.C., and Elizabeth McCulloch, a lawyer in Gainesville. He is
also survived by eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

GAY CHARITY EVENT SEEN AS SENDING WRONG MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The news that organizers had canceled the Morning
Party on Fire Island did not surprise Michael Ruggiero. He has
attended the annual AIDS fund-raising event and social gathering
for the last three years, and while he described it as ``a very
spiritual thing,'' he also recognized that ``it was meant to die.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the positive emotion of standing on the beach,
dancing and remembering those lost to AIDS. But he also
acknowledged the illegal drug use and unsafe sex that have brought
the event increased scrutiny, including that from the police
officers who were standing by last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It progressively got more restrained, so it wasn't like a
party,'' said Ruggiero, 37, sipping coffee on Friday at the Big
Cup, a coffee shop in the Chelsea section of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the lack of restraint at the Morning Party _ at
1998's event, for instance, a man overdosed and died before the
party began _ and the bad publicity that resulted, that prompted
the Gay Men's Health Crisis to cancel what had been an event
memorializing AIDS victims as well as the organization's
second-largest fund-raiser after its AIDS Walk.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the United States' leading AIDS service group, the GMHC
had come under intense pressure from gay critics, who derided the
organization as hypocritical for sponsoring a fund-raising event
where illegal drug use and unsafe sex flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with about 20 men on Friday in Chelsea revealed a
widely held sense that the GMHC was correct to cancel the event,
which many said had come to send the wrong message. Several men
also said the publicity might provoke discussion about what they
called the prevalence of drugs in a growing number of similar
parties around the nation, known as ``circuit parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Rawhide, a gay nightclub, the party from New Year's
Eve was still under way at noon Friday. Shirtless and playing a
video game, Dan Reaume, 36, called the Morning Party a hypocritical
event for a gay elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the pretentious crowd,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, who identified himself only as Jim, stood nearby,
drinking a beer and smoking a cigarette. He said he attended the
Morning Party in 1996 and predicted it would continue without GMHC
sponsorship. ``There's enough money at Fire Island until something
stronger happens,'' said Jim, who is 33. But even if the party goes
on, he said, the spirit and the purpose of it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hypocritical,'' he said. ``They were fund raising for
AIDS, and the behavior at the party was contributing to it at the
same time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Walking arm-in-arm up Eighth Avenue in Chelsea, Henry Hodges and
Craig Hibbard, both 34, said they were startled that the party had
been canceled, though not surprised. Hodges said GMHC's decision
might force a healthy discussion of what he called excessive drug
use in the gay club scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of taken for granted that if you're gay, it's all
about drugs and partying,'' he said. Hodges said the prevalence of
drugs is rarely questioned or condemned and that some regulars in
the nightclub scene consider it a ``God-given right to do all the
drugs you want without interference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to question the whole way the scene is set up,''
Hodges said of the circuit-party phenomenon. ``It could be
healthier.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, another couple, Carlos Otero and Larry
Isaacson, disagreed about the party. Otero, 32, said, ``Everybody
knows it's a drug party.'' He said he attended two years ago and
enjoyed himself, but he questioned a health organization's fund
raising at such an event. ``What's the message?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacson, however, said he regretted the party's demise and
called it ``an introduction to a charity for a lot of people who
otherwise wouldn't be attracted to charitable events.'' He said
that the party's growth paralleled the GMHC's growth and that the
organization should not be held responsible for the poor behavior
of some guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that some people who couldn't control
themselves or act appropriately have basically forced the GMHC to
cancel the event,'' said Isaacson, 35. ``A few people have ruined
it for everybody else.''

PATRIOTS TO PLAY JAGUARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Nick Cafardo 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ A week of practice ended with the usual rhetoric:
``We had a great week out there,'' was the common theme. Sentiments
that are shallow until they're transferred to performance in
Sunday's wild-card game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot going on around Foxborough these days.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a coach being fired. Talk of leaders rising up. Talk of
a team that normally plays well after adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we responded really well,'' said Chad Eaton. ``I
think everybody went out there this week all business and prepared
like we were supposed to for a game of this magnitude. We're going
to put out a game we're going to be proud of (Sunday). I think
everybody wants that more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   There are players who said things they regretted, who want to
prove something.
</P>
<P>
   There are players who are pro-Pete, who want to make sure
there's no doubt whom their coach is next year.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Jefferson, Henry Thomas, Ferric Collons, and Eaton all
spoke up to the team this week, showing signs of leadership that
the coach appreciated and made note of at his daily press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that (saving Carroll's job) is going to be a big
motivator,'' said Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   There's motivation for Willie McGinest, who has missed seven
games with a groin pull, to play hard, especially against Tony
Boselli.
</P>
<P>
   There's motivation for Scott Zolak to win the respect and
admiration of the fans by winning a playoff game as a starting
quarterback. There's also personal gain at stake, as Zolak is an
unrestricted free agent and his value could be enhanced with a
solid performance.
</P>
<P>
   There's motivation for Jefferson, who has to assume the No. 1
receiver duties in his hometown with family watching.
</P>
<P>
   There's motivation for Ty Law to keep showing he's worthy of
being considered one of the best cornerbacks in football. Though he
has a year remaining on his contract, it becomes more evident every
day that Law soon will command Deion Sanders money (about $5
million a year).
</P>
<P>
   There's motivation for Robert Edwards, who would like nothing
better than to outgain fellow rookie Fred Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   There's motivation for Vernon Crawford, who crunched
Jacksonville return man Reggie Barlow in the first quarter of a
26-20 win last season, dislodged the ball, and recovered the fumble
at the Jaguars' 27-yard line. That led to a 13-0 first-quarter
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go down there, I don't want it to be a one-time
thing,'' said Crawford. ``I feel I can make it happen again.
Offensively, defensively, and special teams, we all have to go
above and beyond this week.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the theory espoused by big-play receiver Troy Brown, who
has been limited by a severely sprained left ankle. He has gone
virtually unnoticed since returning to the lineup Dec. 6 at
Pittsburgh, catching only two passes for 42 yards. He's returned
four punts during that time, the longest for 14 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wake up in the morning and feel great, and then I wake up
the next day I don't feel so great,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need complete rest in the offseason, but I don't have time
for that right now. I have to go out there and go all out. This is
playoff time, and hopefully they're depending on me to make some
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said it's do or die, and he's ``not ready to go home
yet.'' Brown said he's ready to break a play, whether it's a punt
or a big reception. He said everybody needs to have that attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he hopes Zolak can find him. He said the plays are
still the same, but he didn't line up much with the regular offense
(maybe three third-down plays).
</P>
<P>
   It was a motivating week. A hectic week.
</P>
<P>
   A lot was said, good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about what we do on the field now,'' said Eaton.

 JOHN McDONALD, WROTE MEMOIR OF GM'S ALFRED P. SLOAN  
(rl) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John D. McDonald, who with Alfred P. Sloan Jr. wrote ``My Years
With General Motors,'' a classic volume on business strategy that
has been used as a college text for 35 years, died Dec. 23 of
respiratory failure, his daughter Joan McDonald Miller said Friday.
He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald was visiting his other daughter, Christie, at her
vacation home in Berkshire, Vt., when he died, Mrs. Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald was a dedicated Trotskyite in the 1930s but became a
chronicler of capitalism when Fortune magazine hired him as a staff
writer in 1945. He wrote about a wide range of subjects for the
magazine, including business strategies, fly-fishing and horse
racing.
</P>
<P>
   His best-known work was the 1964 memoir of Sloan, the visionary
executive who ran GM from 1923 to 1956. McDonald was listed as the
editor of the book, which was based partly on tape-recorded
interviews with Sloan, but he actually wrote it, Jason Epstein, the
editor who acquired it for Doubleday, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before he died, McDonald was shopping a 70,000-word
manuscript, ``A Ghost's Memoir,'' in which he told how GM tried to
suppress the book because the company believed it could be used by
the Justice Department to launch an antitrust case against it.
</P>
<P>
   For five years McDonald and Sloan worked to hone the book's
story of how Sloan melded a gaggle of car companies and parts
makers into the biggest industrial corporation in the world. But on
March 4, 1959, according to a recent article in Forbes by Dan
Seligman, who helped McDonald research the book, Sloan told
McDonald, ``John, we are not publishing.'' McDonald then began a
five-year struggle to get the book published.
</P>
<P>
   Seligman, a contributing editor at Forbes, said Friday that
McDonald ``was a terribly serious guy, so even when he wrote about
fishing and horse racing there was a real scholarly tone to his
work.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's other business books included ``Strategy in Poker,
Business and War'' in 1950, and ``The Game of Business,'' about
game theory and business strategy, in 1975. He also wrote three
books on fly-fishing: ``The Complete Fly Fisherman'' (1947), ``The
Origins of Angling'' (1963) and ``Quill Gordon'' (1972).
</P>
<P>
   He retired from Fortune in 1971. Five years later he received
the Gerald Loeb Memorial Award, one of the highest honors in
financial journalism.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald worked in his father's Detroit pharmacy and became a
licensed pharmacist. He then moved into radical politics, becoming
a prominent follower of Leon Trotsky in the 1930s when the Russian
revolutionary was being denounced by Stalin as a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to Lorraine Oven in 1928, ended in divorce.
He married Dorothy Eisner in 1936. She died in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his daughters, Joan McDonald Miller of
Manhattan and Christie McDonald of Cambridge, Mass., and three
grandsons.

TEE TIME IS NEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Mark Blaudschun 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The calls would come at all hours of the day and
night. Did you hear what happened? None of it made sense, of
course. How could it?
</P>
<P>
   How could you rationalize going to school with your buddy one
day, and you come to class the next day and he would be gone _ a
victim of some foolish act, something to do with drugs or money or
some other slight that caused an argument to flare into a major
confrontation?
</P>
<P>
   Tee Martin didn't understand that day in Birmingham, Ala., a few
years back when he was having a water balloon fight with his friend
Gary Simmons, went into his house to get more ammunition for the
battle, and heard the shots.
</P>
<P>
   By then Tee's instincts told him the worst. Another incident,
another friend dead.
</P>
<P>
   He was just 17, and he had already been to more funerals than
proms. He was already wise beyond his years. ``I learned not to be
close to anybody,'' Tee Martin was saying the other day on a warm,
sunny winter day, surrounded by people with minicams, tape
recorders, and note pads who were picking at old wounds that are
just beginning to heal. ``I took the attitude that if I allowed
myself to get close to anybody, they might die.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who will be the starting quarterback for the University
of Tennessee in the biggest game of his life _ Monday night's
Fiesta Bowl national championship game against Florida State _
already has a post-graduate degree in the study of whether life is
fair at times.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his college years, Tamaurice Martin knows this:
</P>
<P>
   At least 12 of his friends have died since he came to Tennessee
three years ago as a hotshot quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   His father is Pierre Maurice Marshall, a onetime high school
football star whose main claim to fame is that he played on the
same team at Mississippi Valley State as legendary wide receiver
Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   His father has been a ghost in his life, showing up only
sporadically, yet he remains forever linked, simply because of his
name: TaMaurice, or as Marie Martin said with affection on July 25,
1978, after her son was born: To Maurice. Taumaurice. Tee.
</P>
<P>
   Martin talks about his past the way he talks about the present
or the future, with a smile, looking you in the eye. He got up and
made the speech the other day in front of hundreds of strangers and
absolutely dazzled them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most poised, confident talk I've ever heard,'' said
Tennessee football coach Phil Fulmer, who knowing that there would
be life after Peyton Manning, went out three years ago and won the
battle for Martin over schools such as Auburn, Florida, Florida
State, and Miami. ``But that's just the way Tee is.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin knows that Tennessee might not win Monday night. Despite
being unbeaten and ranked No. 1 in the country, despite a magical
season that has been highlighted by 26 touchdowns (19 passing, 6
running) and only six interceptions, Tee Martin might walk away
from Sun Devil Stadium with a sense of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   It will bother him, not destroy him. ``I've always felt that
something good will come out of bad situations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over as the starter this season following Manning's
record-setting four-year career as the Vols' quarterback, Martin
has proven that he is a good quarterback. And he has done something
Manning never did: take the Vols to the threshold of a national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates have noticed. ``Look at all he has accomplished,''
said wide receiver Cedric Wilson. ``He has to have had the best
season any quarterback at Tennessee has ever had. He beat Florida.
He won another (Southeastern Conference) title. Now we're playing
for the national championship. Name another QB that has done that
for this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peyton had a lot of pressure on him. He always wanted to make
the big play. Everything he did was to `Go get it.' But it cost us.
He threw a lot of interceptions in difficult situations. Tee wil
throw the ball away to save an interception.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has fought the perception that he is a quarterback who
would prefer to run. ``Ever since I've been a quarterback, all I've
wanted to do was throw the ball,'' he said. ``In high school, the
only running plays we had were when I ran a quarterback draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Martin doesn't like to run. He will take off if you
give him an opening. But his instincts are that of a pure dropback
passer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the projects of Mobile, Ala., Martin grew up
quickly. After his birth, it was clear that his 18-year-old mother
was not ready to handle being a full-time mother. His
great-grandmother, Mary Posley, took a full-time role in that area,
setting parameters about behavior and lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Sports was the outlet Martin used to stay out of trouble, or as
far away from it as he could. Baseball, basketball, and football
were his priorities _ in that order.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his father, football became a factor. Although Pierre
Maurice was more of an occasional influence, Tee idolized him. In
high school, he wanted to wear the same No. 17 his father had worn.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was freshman at Williamson High School, he was a
starter. By the time he left, he was a two-time all-state
quarterback and a Parade All-American.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had colleges from all over the country calling and
offering him things. Mary Posley told him to try and look people in
the eye and make judgments. Be careful, she said. People who offer
you things have their own self-interests first.
</P>
<P>
   So Martin worked his way through the process. He was not naive,
not with all the violence at his doorstep, acts that had prompted
him to take a ``When-it's-your-time-to-go,-it's-your-time-to-go''
attitude toward life.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Tennessee after Tim Couch made a last-minute switch
to his home state of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   For two years he sat and watched Manning. ``I was his vice
president,'' Martin said. ``I learned a lot. We talk all the time
about a lot of things, not just football.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin looks at you and talks about all of this with a smile. He
knows things. He has said that he has learned lessons. He has been
the eyewitness to three killings, which has made it almost
impossible for him to cry anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the anger is still inside of him. The unfairness of it
all. The senselessness of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that keeping my family around me is important,''
says Martin, who still stays in touch with his father. ``I've also
learned that football is just a game.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Tee Martin fully expects to play the game of
his life.

BONDS, NOT BAD IN '98, MAY DO BETTER THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Monday, Jan. 4) 
(rl) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What was one of the best kept secrets of 1998? That being in
bonds was not such a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the selloff in December, the total return from an
investment in the 30-year Treasury bond was 17.6 percent. A bet on
the 10-year note brought home 12.7 percent. And while corporate,
junk and municipal bonds have not done as well, it was not a
terrible year for them. The return on a AA 10-year industrial
corporate was about 11.5 percent, while a 10-year municipal bond
had a total return, including the capital gain, of 6.8 percent. And
of that, 5.3 percentage points were tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that being in bonds this year will be an
even better idea, especially if investors venture out of Treasuries
and into the corporate, mortgage and municipal sectors.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem hard to believe, given the selloff in the
fixed-income world in August, September and October.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, you could not find anyone who wanted a corporate
bond, a junk bond, emerging market debt or mortgage-backed bonds.
Those parts of the bond market were frozen as the effective default
of Russia and the near collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital
Management sent investors to the safety of the Treasury market.
</P>
<P>
   The investor rush pushed the yield on the 30-year bond to 4.72
percent, the lowest rate on long-term debt in more than 30 years.
As the new year begins, the yield, at 5.09 percent, is not far
above the 1998 low.
</P>
<P>
   But the atmosphere has changed since the fall. The Federal
Reserve has cut its interest-rate target three times. European
central banks have made one cut. Brazil has a bailout package in
place and is working on budget reform. Those changes have made
corporates and other non-Treasury bonds look attractive again,
although there is still a lot more than the usual risk attached.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction of these non-Treasury bond markets is twofold.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of it is that these bonds sold off sharply and
have not recovered much of what they lost. In other words, they are
relatively cheap. For example, the spread, or difference, between
the yield on 10-year Treasuries and the yield on a 10-year AA
corporate bond grew to 1.65 percentage points in October. The
spread has narrowed only to around 1.4 percentage points, which
means there is still room for enough further narrowing to lead to
nice capital gains. As the yield on a corporate bond falls, the
price rises.
</P>
<P>
   The second attraction, also the result of wider-than-normal
spreads, is that yields on non-Treasury bonds are much higher than
they would normally be. ``You start out with such a big yield
advantage that you have a cushion there,'' said Martin Mauro, a
fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Fixed-income fund managers are really interested in tax-exempt
municipal bonds. A 10-year, AA rated muni bond is offering a tax
equivalent yield for someone in the 31 percent federal tax bracket
of 6.16 percent, compared with 4.64 percent on a 10-year Treasury
note. The yield is even more attractive on longer-term municipals.
The after-tax yield on a 30-year, AA-rated municipal bond, for
example, is 7.46 percent, compared with the 5.09 percent yield on
the 30-year Treasury bond.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term municipals are ``as cheap as we have seen in our
experience,'' said William Reynolds, director of the fixed-income
division at T. Rowe Price Associates. They were an even better
bargain in October, when investors were ignoring all bond markets
but the Treasury market. At that time, the yield on a tax-exempt
30-year AAA municipal bond was actually slightly higher than the
yield on a taxable 30-year Treasury bond.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate bonds, high-yield junk bonds, mortgage-backed
securities and, for those who like more risk, some emerging market
bonds, also look good, according to many analysts at mutual fund
companies and Wall Street firms. ``High-yield, corporate bonds,
municipals and mortgages are cheap,'' said Les Nanberg, chief
fixed-income officer at MFS Investment Management.
</P>
<P>
   But while analysts think non-Treasuries will do better, they
still worry about the risk of another wave of financial
uncertainty. The outlook for some is also tempered by the fact that
the U.S. economy is expected to slow down and corporate earnings
could decline, putting downward pressure on the prices of corporate
bonds and some other bonds.
</P>
<P>
   That is why some analysts are staying away from the high-yield,
junk bond market, which would suffer the most if the economy slows
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bet is going to be in the higher end of investment grade
bonds,'' said Tracy Eccles, a bond portfolio manager at the
Hartford Investment Management Co. She argues that the yield on
lower investment-grade bonds, like those rated BBB, is not great
enough to warrant the extra risk. ``In this environment I would not
buy a bond just for the yield,'' she said. She wants ``good-quality
names'' and issues that were underwritten by more than one dealer
so there is a better chance to trade them if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a decline of just half a percentage point from current
interest rates on corporates, Treasuries and other bonds could
produce some acceptable returns this year. Mauro of Merrill Lynch
predicts that the total return on a 10-year corporate bond,
including capital gains, would be 9.4 percent, while a
half-percentage point interest rate decline for a muni bond would
earn 8 percent, with 4.2 percentage points of that tax-free. And on
a 10-year Treasury note, the return would be 8.2 percent.

KRAFT HEARING A FARCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Will McDonough 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrew Zimbalist wasn't thrilled about doing it, but in the end,
he agreed to testify before the Connecticut Legislature Dec. 9, the
day it heard Bob Kraft's plans to move the Patriots to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asked to testify, and it was a busy day for me,'' said
Zimbalist, a noted professor of economics at Smith College. ``But I
had to be back at a seminar before 7:30. And I told them I wanted
to speak for at least 15 minutes, because I have been to these
things before and they give you two minutes, and say thanks. You
really can't say what you want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimbalist is considered an expert in sports economics. He has
testified before Congress, and in many lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably going to be the only one to testify that wasn't
going to be all for it,'' he said. ``I was going to tell them that
if they were going to do this because they were going to get a big
bang economically, they were wrong. It just wasn't going to happen.
I was told I would speak somewhere around 4 o'clock. I told them I
had to leave at 6:30 to get back. I never had a chance to speak.
But I heard what was said by Kraft and his people and a lot of it
was bald-face lies and bull. The whole hearing was a travesty.''
</P>
<P>
   So Zimbalist, in turn, wrote an article for this week's Street &AMP;
Smith's Sportsbusiness Journal. Under the headline ``Thanks to
Kraft and governor, Connecticut gains a team and loses its shirt''
Zimbalist paints this interesting picture of what happened that
day.
</P>
<P>
   He writes: ``For starters, (Connecticut governor John) Rowland's
close friend and political adviser, Jay Malcynsky, was hired by
Kraft to be his chief lobbyist in the deal. Another of Malcynsky's
clients owns the land on which the project was to be built.
Malcynsky's ability to manipulate the Connecticut political process
was demonstrated when he arranged for Kraft to wire the public
commentary at the legislative hearing, which began at 3 p.m. and
ended at 7 p.m., on Dec. 9th, without ever hearing a critical
voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of the public had to wait in line to have the
opportunity to address the legislators. It turned out that Kraft
paid at least the first 15 people to stand in line, so the initial
public commentary would be all pro-stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by this reporter how he could say Kraft paid the people to
stand in line and speak on his behalf, Zimbalist responded: ``I
don't think he took the money out of his pocket (that day). I think
Malcynsky is the one who took care of those people. I talked with a
reporter from Tom Brokaw's show that day, and she said she spoke
with the people in the line, and that they were being paid by
Kraft.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufpibox &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It Ain't Over Yet, Part II:
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Connecticut seems to be in the tank on the Kraft
deal, but Ralph Nader is not. Nader, in the last few days, has
spoken to Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger about
joining his mission to overturn what Connecticut and Kraft are
trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nader is going to bring a suit down there, about the way this
whole thing has happened,'' said Harshbarger. ``And he has some
serious questions about the way this whole thing took place in
Connecticut. We have some issues here, but they are not the same.
My office is still reviewing whether we are going to take some
action here or not. I personally don't like the idea of the
Patriots walking out of here and costing Massachusetts millions of
dollars over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, like Zimbalist, feels the process in Connecticut was a
farce. The usual timetables and legal hurdles to be overcome in
moving legislation of this magnitude were thrown aside. In fact, as
of this writing, the actual legislation _ which was changed _ and
would reveal the givebacks by the Patriots, still has not appeared
in public.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufpibox &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Whether Pete Carroll will be back next year has not been
decided. Kraft is not happy about what has happened with his team
the last two years. After the bitter defeat to the Jets in Giants
Stadium last Sunday, he went into the dressing room immediately
afterward and had a private meeting with Carroll. You can guess
what was said.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft will decide which way to go after the season ends, whether
that's Sunday in Jacksonville or later. It says here that Chris
Palmer, offensive coordinator of the Jacksonville Jaguars, will be
the No. 1 candidate to replace Carroll, not Bill Belichick of the
Jets. Belichick already has it written into his contract that he
will be the next head coach of the Jets when Bill Parcells steps
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer coached with the Parcells staff when the team went to the
Super Bowl and was well liked by the players on the team,
especially Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufpibox &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a rundown on the NFL playoff games this weekend from
some of the coaches and general managers who have played against
the teams this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New England at Jacksonville: &LR;  From Bills coach Wade Phillips,
who split with New England, and beat Jacksonville at home:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very difficult for the Patriots to win down
there. No Bledsoe. No (Terry) Glenn. Those are big weapons. From
what I have seen of New England (on tape) lately, they are not the
same team we played against twice. The whole story could really be
(Mark) Brunell. If he plays, and he can play like he has, I see
Jacksonville winning. If he doesn't play, then Jacksonville, I
think, will play a conservative game and try to run the ball with
this kid (Fred) Taylor. He is quite a back. I see New England
having a tough time moving the ball on offense. Jacksonville is one
of those teams that is much tougher at home than they are on the
road. That's their history. They are tough to beat on their home
field.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Arizona at Dallas:  &LR; From Redskins general manager Charley
Casserly, who played both teams twice this year:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas has one of the most impressive stats in football this
year. Just 15 giveaways (fumbles and interceptions) in 16 games.
Dallas is plus-11 in turnover ratio. Arizona is plus-1, so the
Cowboys have done a better job protecting the ball, and turnovers
are critical factors in playoff games. Dallas should have the edge
in experience. They have veteran players who are used to winning
Super Bowls, so it is not a big deal psychologically for them to be
in the playoffs. They also have a great home record during playoffs
(undefeated in the 1990s). Arizona is inexperienced in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major factor in the game could be the absence of Deion
Sanders. The Dallas secondary is more vulnerable when he is not
playing. If the Cardinals are going to win, they will have to take
advantage of some of the matchups they are going to have in the
passing game. Both Rob Moore and Frankie Sanders are big, and good.
Jake Plummer (Arizona QB) could hurt the Dallas defense with his
mobility, and his ability to improvise. He can make things happen
when he starts to move around. I think Dallas will try to run the
ball a lot to their left behind Larry Allen and Nate Newton. Emmitt
Smith is on a roll. He is running very well, and the Arizona run
defense is not as strong as it was when (Eric) Swann was in the
lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   From Giants coach Jim Fassel, who has played both teams twice
this season:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dallas offensive line is really doing a good job. I see
the Dallas offense trying to move the ball very systematically down
the field, not turning it over, taking time off the clock, and
trying to control the game. The Dallas defense pretty much operates
the same way. They bend, but they don't break often. They try to
eliminate the big play. This game will go to the team that can get
its way. Arizona should play for the big play, both on offense and
defense. Dallas will go for control. It really hurts Dallas that
Deion will not play. When he is in there on pass defense, he takes
away one side of the field. Now you can attack the entire
secondary. And of course, he is a great returner. He is the most
dangerous returner around.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Green Bay at San Francisco:  &LR; From Giants general manager Ernie
Accorsi:
</P>
<P>
   ``We played both teams this year and they beat us. We were just
never in it against Green Bay. We got them when we were going
through a tough period. We played better against San Francisco, and
they still beat us. These two quarterbacks, (Steve) Young and
(Brett) Favre, are exceptional. To me, they are both first ballot,
Hall of Famers. I know Green Bay has had good luck against these
guys in the recent past (5-0) and beat them out there twice in the
playoffs, which is impressive. Green Bay is also getting back some
guys from injury. Dorsey Levens will help their running attack a
great deal, and he is also an excellent pass receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the San Francisco matchup on offense, where they have
those three big wide receivers (Jerry Rice, Terrell Owens, J.J.
Stokes). Young is having a great year getting them the ball, and
(Garrison) Hearst has given their offense another dimension. The
key for Green Bay will be getting some pressure on Young, and
avoiding bad matchups with those big receivers. Favre is a great
money player. I don't think it will bother the Packers that they
are playing in San Francisco. They know they have won there in the
past. I think it's going to be a wide-open, very exciting football
game, and the quarterback that has the better day will be the
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Buffalo at Miami: &LR;  From Jets coach Bill Parcells, who has
played both teams twice this season:
</P>
<P>
   ``(Pass rusher) Jason Taylor being out of the lineup will hurt
Miami. He's the best they have. He's a force; he is always around
the ball. They don't have anyone else like him. He can chase some
quarterbacks down. Miami beat Buffalo in Miami early in the year,
and then had them by 10 points in the fourth quarter in Buffalo and
let them come back to win. That game is a big plus for Buffalo.
They know they can beat Miami. They know they can come from behind
and win on them. Miami's biggest problem will be dealing with
(Doug) Flutie's improvisation. Some of the big guys they have
aren't that fast. I think Miami will try to attack the Buffalo
secondary on the outside. Since last year, Buffalo has lost its
three best coverage corners. (Jeff) Burris went to Indy; Thomas
Smith and (Marlon) Kerner are both injured. (Dan) Marino has been
throwing the ball well lately. I give the Dolphins the edge on
special teams. I think they do a better job there.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufpibox &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The NBA owners must be trying to ``smoke out'' the players with
their latest offer. According to an ESPN report this week, one of
the offers from the owners in their last and ``final'' proposal is
a promise to drug-test veteran players for marijuana only in
training camp. They didn't say whether the players would also be
told the time and date of the test so they could be ready for it.
What a joke. This is the new tough drug policy we heard about?
