<HEADLINE> UNEP Calls for Proper Trade Solutions on Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) has asked the World Trade Organization (WTO) to
address possible conflicts between environmental agreements and
international trade rules.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, the UNEP and the secretariats of over 15
international environmental agreements are speaking today with one
voice on the issue of trade and environment," UNEP Executive
Director Klaus Topfer said Thursday, in a statement to the WTO's
Committee on Trade and Environment.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP statement emphasized that it is time to move from
discussions to concrete action on the relationship between
environmental agreements and international trade rules.
</P>
<P>
It has been over seven years since the WTO and its predecessor,
the GATT, began to have discussions on certain conventions, but
none has been pressed.
</P>
<P>
To move from discussion to action, the UNEP asked the WTO to
clarify what is meant by "trade measures;" which trade measures
are WTO consistent, and what the WTO views as being "sustainable
trade policies."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerned over Iran's Medium-Range Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The White House Thursday
confirmed newspaper reports that Iran had successfully test-fired
a medium-range missile and expressed its "concern" over the
development of Iran's missile.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the test, detected by
U.S. spy satellites Wednesday, involved a missile known as the
Shehab-3, which has a range of about 800 miles (1,300 km).
</P>
<P>
"We detected the launch," McCurry told reporters, noting that
the United States is "actively monitoring their military
capacity."
</P>
<P>
As the range of the Iranian medium-range missile could cover
all of Israel, Saudi Arabia and part of Turkey, McCurry said, "It
is a source of concern to us."
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said it was a significant development in Iran's
missile "because it puts U.S. forces in the region at risk."
</P>
<P>
Data on the missile test are being evaluated by U.S.
intelligence agencies to determine in more detail its estimated
range, payload capacity and other characteristics, another U.S.
official said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Maintain "Non-intervention" policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreed here
Thursday night that "non-intervention" will be maintained as the
cardinal policy of the group but interactions will be allowed on
certain issues which have trans-boundary effects.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here Thursday night, Philippine
Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said that at an informal working
dinner, ASEAN foreign ministers exchanged views on the proposed
change of ASEAN's policy from "non-intervention" to "flexible
engagement."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the ministers agreed that "in the conduct of
relations among states, the principle of non-intervention in the
domestic affairs of states should be respected."
</P>
<P>
But in view of the changing situation, globalization and
"growing interdependence among nations, particularly among ASEAN
countries, the rule or principle of non-intervention in domestic
affairs of others should not be absolute, but should be relative
particularly on the issues which have trans-boundary effects. And
the ASEAN members should be able to express their views clearly
and timely and openly," Siazon said.
</P>
<P>
"And they (ministers) suggested that this be considered as a
policy of ASEAN," he added.
</P>
<P>
Siazon further explained that on certain issues, such as
transnational crimes and forest fires, other ASEAN members can
express their views.
</P>
<P>
The policy change proposal was made by Thai Foreign Minister
Surin Pitsuwan in a letter sent to Philippine Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon last week. The proposal was backed by the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said earlier that since domestic developments in any
ASEAN member country would have positive or adverse effects on
other members, he and the Thai foreign minister called for "a
change in ASEAN's policy from constructive engagement to flexible
engagement, suggesting a more proactive policy in the affairs of
other ASEAN countries."
</P>
<P>
But most of the ASEAN members are strongly opposed to the
policy change.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN ministers are here to attend the annual ministerial
meeting which starts Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, and the
Philippines is the chairman of this year's ASEAN ministerial
meeting.
</P>
<P>
This year's ASEAN ministerial meeting is expected to discuss
topics including the financial turmoil in the region, ASEAN unity
and cooperation in face of the turmoil, Cambodia, nuclear
proliferation in South Asia and transnational crime.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho High Court Thursday
ordered the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to allow three
main opposition parties to inspect election documents.
</P>
<P>
The order was issued two months after the conclusion of the
Lesotho general elections on May 23, the third since the country
gained independence in 1966.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said the Basotholand Congress Party (BCP),
the Basotho National Party (BNP) and the Marematlou Freedom Party
have alleged serious irregularities in the outcome of the
elections which they claimed the ruling Lesotho Congress for
Democracy rigged.
</P>
<P>
The order directed Chairman of the IEC, Sejkara Mafisa,
and the director of elections to make relevant documents
available to an individual upon the completion of inspection
forms.
</P>
<P>
It was also ordered that an individual may be assisted in his
inspection by other persons who may be present with him at the
offices designated by the director of elections.
</P>
<P>
The number of persons inspecting election documents at any one
time must be limited to six, the order said.

<HEADLINE> 4thld Writethru: Tehran Mayor Sentenced to 5 Years' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Tehran's mayor was found guilty of
corruption and sentenced to five years' imprisonment Thursday, an
event widely seen as the spinoff of an intense political struggle.
</P>
<P>
A public court announced that Gholamhussein Karbaschi was
guilty of embezzlement and misappropriation of public fund, also
sentencing him to 60 lashes with a probation of four years.
</P>
<P>
The mayor was banned from holding public office for 20 years
and fined 1 billion rials (about 180,000 U.S. dollars at market
rate).
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was convicted on collaboration in the sale of a
printing house and machinery and misappropriation of 35,911
million rials (about 6.5 million dollars) of the Tehran
municipality's funds. He was asked to return the unpaid fund of
17,646 million rials (3.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Judge Mohseni Ejaei said that Karbaschi can appeal within 20
days after the verdict was pronounced. He told reporters that
Karbaschi will remain free on bail until the appeal.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi's lawyer Bahman Keshavarz announced on Thursday that
Karbaschi will appeal against the court verdict,
</P>
<P>
Keshavarz said that the court decision was not a surprise and
the defense team had "expected such a verdict," the official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi did not appear before the court and was represented
by Keshavarz. More than 200 people, including some 40 domestic and
foreign reporters and photographers crammed the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
In a 39-page ruling read out in more than an hour, the court
repeated all the charges against the mayor and refuted each and
every of his defense.
</P>
<P>
The mayor, a famous reformist and a close ally of President
Mohammad Khatami, was the highest-ranking official charged for
corruption since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The open trial of the mayor, which started on June 7,
highlighted the political struggle between the moderates and
conservatives, pushing political groups and even the media in the
country to line up against each other.
</P>
<P>
The moderates believed the case was politically motivated with
an aim to weaken the government of Khatami, who enjoyed strong
support from Karbaschi and his followers since the presidential
elections in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi financed Khatami's presidential campaign, which
brought about a landslide victory over the conservative candidate,
Majlis (Parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
On April 4, Karbaschi was temporally detained by the
conservative judiciary, but was released 11 days later following
direct interference of the top Iranian leadership.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives vowed to punish any one violating
the country's law and attacked the moderates for abusing freedom
and democracy proposed by Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The new president is trying to push forward social reforms and
has promised to bring changes to people's lives.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Price Control to Thwart IMF Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government's
re-introduction of price controls could thwart the release of
further financial aid by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a
major bankroller of Zimbabwe's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
An IMF official, Michael Nowak Thursday told the Zimbabwe News
Agency in an telephone interview from Washington that officials
from the financial institution would visit Harare early next
month to discuss the issue and the release of 18 million U.S.
Dollars to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The IMF in June released the 53 million U.S. Dollar part of four
tranches to be disbursed under a 176 million U.S. Dollar stand-by
credit facility aimed at improving Zimbabwe' balance of payments
position and kickstart the second phase of economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, the second tranche of 18 million U.S. Dollars
scheduled for releasing mid-August and subsequent tranches were to
be released subject to the targets set by a government meeting
at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the country had met the targets, Nowak said,
"There is the issue relating to price controls which we would
need to discuss with the government."
</P>
<P>
The government last month reintroduced price controls, saying
this would stop producers of basic food commodities from using
price rises to stir social unrest.
</P>
<P>
The government last January unleashed troops to quell violent
riots sparked by an increase in the price of the staple maize
meal.
</P>
<P>
However, the move has been criticized by economists and
western donors who say it is a negation of economic reforms the
country embarked upon in 1991.

Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of
the island in 1974 with a claimed aim to protect the Turkish
Cypriots there in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot spokesman said it would be better if the
U.S. official had contacted American citizens, relatives of
missing persons or other victims of the Turkish invasion, "to
realize the difference between an invasion and a conflict."
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned by the American diplomacy and positions
because they appear contradictory in many cases and far from
being objective to what the real facts are," he said.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the U.S. important role in seeking a
solution to the Cyprus issue, he said, "we should on every
occasion point out the faux pas of American diplomacy and policy."
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides also expressed indignation
at the statements made by U.S. State Department spokesman James
Rubin, who said Tuesday that no Turkish combat aircraft overflew
Nicosia last Monday during the celebrations held in the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled north to mark the 24th anniversary of Turkish
military intervention.
</P>
<P>
Rubin only added that Turkish Cypriot Cessnas and helicopters
might have done so and a Turkish air force acrobatics team staged
an air show near northern coastal town of Kyrenia.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the U.S. should be aware that "the airspace of
the Republic of Cyprus, which covers the whole of the island, is
continuously violated and there could be no excuse that the
aircrafts flew here for an air show."
</P>
<P>
Clerides pointed out that "if any aircraft enters the national
airspace of a country without prior permission from the
government, it is violating this airspace."

<HEADLINE> Israel Expresses Concern Over Reported Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai Thursday expressed concern over a New York
Times report that Iran had tested a medium-range missile.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Mordechai as saying that it is very
serious that Iran could have very fast tested such a weapon.
</P>
<P>
New York Times reported that a U.S. spy satellite detected the
test launch in Iran on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report alleged that Iran bought the missile, which is
capable of reaching Israel, from the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Mordechai noted that the Iranian missile
test does not pose an immediate threat to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said he doubted that such a missile could
reach Israel, saying a war is unlikely for the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky
told Israel Radio that although the missile tested in Iran might
be brought in from the DPRK, the main source of missile technology
for Iran is in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky said that Israel would take immediate measures to
prevent Iran from developing missiles capable of striking Israel.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Coalition Whip Calls for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel's coalition whip Meir
Shetrit Thursday called for an Israeli-Palestinian summit to
discuss some "new ideas" he has proposed to Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Arafat in Gaza Thursday, Shetrit raised
the ideas, of which he said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is aware, Israel Radio reported. Shetrit, the Likud
Member of the Knesset (Parliament) refused to elaborate the ideas,
but he said Arafat promised to study them seriously.
</P>
<P>
He called for a summit meeting between Arafat and Netanyahu
during which his ideas will be discussed. He said disputes between
the Israelis and the Palestinians over the American proposal
calling on Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West Bank
can not be resolved by mediators. "I do hope that (the summit)
will happen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Planning and International Cooperation Minister
Nabil Shaath expressed his appreciation for the "sincere attempt"
of Shetrit to revive the talks, saying the Palestinians will "look
and study seriously" his new ideas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has also called for
an Israeli-Palestinian summit since he met Sunday with Arafat's
deputy Mahmoud Abbas in the first direct talks between the two
sides in months. He said they had gone as far as they could.
</P>
<P>
Following two rounds of negotiations, the Israeli-Palestinian
talks ended abruptly Wednesday. The Palestinians complained that
the Israelis brought no new proposals and the Israelis appealed
for fresh American diplomatic intervention to resume the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians kept the Israelis in the dark Thursday by
saying that they would give an answer in the next 48 hours
as to whether they agree to continue the talks.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Israeli delegation was proposing to
carry out a 10 percent withdrawal and turn the additional 3
percent into "nature reserves," where no construction will be
permitted. But the Palestinians have stressed that the percentages
in the American pullback initiative were "nonnegotiable."
</P>
<P>
Israel has been seeking for a Netanyahu-Arafat summit for
months. The Palestinians have repeatedly rejected the idea, saying
what is needed is Israel's acceptance of the American proposal,
not summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Canada on Thursday called on
Israel to reconsider its policy so to push forward the Mideast
peace process, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Gagliano, Canadian Minister of Public Works and
Government Service, was quoted as saying that Canadian
government's stance over the peace process was clear.
</P>
<P>
"It urged Israel to review its policy in a bid to reactivate
the stalled peace process," he told reporters at the end of a
visit to Lebanon's northern port city of Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Asked Canadian government's stance over the Palestinian
refugees, the minister said that Canada was willing to give
them humanitarian support in order to ease their suffering.
</P>
<P>
But he ruled out any Canadian role in solving the political
status of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 360,000 Palestinians living in some 12
refugee camps in Lebanon. The refugees were mostly dislocated by
the repeated wars that the Arabs have fought with Israel in the
past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon refuses to settle them down in the country and only
allows them to work in professions shunned by local Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Gagliano came to Lebanon on Wednesday to sign a cooperation
agreement on postal service with Lebanon.

MOSCOW, July 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice-President Al Gore arrived
here Thursday on a two-day working visit that will include
meetings with Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and a
telephone conversation with President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko, who welcomed Gore at the Vnukovo-2 Airport, said
Russian-U.S. relations have significantly advanced in recent
years. "We have a basis, now we need to move forward," he added.

<HEADLINE> McCurry to Step Down as White House Press Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
announced Thursday that his press secretary Mike McCurry would
leave in the fall and be replaced by deputy spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
"Much to my regret but with my full understanding and support
Mike McCurry will be leaving us in the fall," Clinton said during
a surprise appearance in the White House press briefing room. "I
have also determined to appoint Joe Lockhart as his successor."
</P>
<P>
The announcement ended months of speculation that McCurry would
depart. He and Lockhart flanked the president as the announcement
was made.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said McCurry "has set the standard" for future
presidential press secretaries.
</P>
<P>
"In an age where Washington has come to be governed by a
24-hour news cycle and endless cable channels with their special
niche audiences, Mike has redefined the job as press secretary in
a new and more challenging ear," Clinton said. "Few could match
his intelligence and wit from the podium."
</P>
<P>
McCurry did not reveal his future plans. He said he would like
to teach and explore options that don't involve being a spokesman,
a duty has has performed in Washington for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
Before coming to the White House, McCurry was spokesman at the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said he would remain at the White House until Congress
adjourns this year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he considered Lockhart "the ideal replacement" for
McCurry. "Joe knows you well and you know him well, and that's
probably half the battle," Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart has worked extensively in political campaigns. Before
joining the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign, Lockhart was a
consultant at the Washington firm Robinson Lerer Sawyer Miller
Inc. He also has worked in broadcasting at ABC and CNN. He left
CNN in 1988 to work for Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.

MAPUTO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano urged the world to keep an open eye on possible harms on
offshore areas by human activities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Pan-Africa Conference
on Integration of the Coastal Areas and Sustainable Management,
Chissano said that most of the coastal countries are under the
pressure of population over-growth and environmental
deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said that technical, financial and human resources
must be mobilized to face the challenges of deteriorating
environment.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government is greatly concerned with the
fragility of its offshore areas, Chissano said, adding that
Mozambique's offshore areas are endangered by erosion, accidents
on the seas, seashore pollution and illegal fishing by
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government is trying to set up a central
institution to protect the natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government is also mapping out plan for a
sustainable development of the offshore resources, Chissano said.
</P>
<P>
The conference is co-sponsored by Finnish government, the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
and the United Nations Environment Program and Mozambican
government.

This is the 11th festival since 1965 and the second since the

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Postal Service
(NIPOST) and its United States counterpart have begun cooperation
in an effort to curb mail frauds, which have caused the two
organizations millions of dollars in losses.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the two agencies had resulted in the
arrest of more than 100 persons suspected of involvement in
advance fee fraud, the News Agency of Nigeria reported Thursday,
quoting James Pairot, an official of the U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had found out that frauds engaged in the mail scam
were also involved in money laundering in the drug business and
other dirty deals, Pairot said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, cooperation between Nigeria and the U.S. had
become necessary because of the trans-border nature of the crime,
and the Nigerian police, customs service, INTERPOL and both
postal services had to find ways of assisting each other to rid
the nations of postal crimes.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the U.S. Postal Service would soon commence
training of some NIPOST officials on ways of checking mail fraud
as well as improving their skills.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Renews Peace Efforts on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A visiting U.S. envoy said here
Thursday that he has brought new ideas to help reach a settlement
to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival, Thomas Miller, U.S. State
Department Coordinator for Cyprus, said his visit is part of the
effort to find a solution for the divided island.
</P>
<P>
"I bring ideas but prefer to keep them within the realm of our
close discussions," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, the U.S. envoy is expected to have
separate meetings with the two leaders of the rival Greek and
Turkish communities, Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Rauf
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece. The Turkish Cypriots set up a breakaway republic in 1983,
but only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy stressed that the only way to make progress is
through direct negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the U.S. support for the demilitarization of
Cyprus, that "will take into account the security concerns of all
the people of the island."
</P>
<P>
Referring to attempts to resume the stalled peace effort,
Miller said "when a door is locked, a window is opened and we have
to find that window."
</P>
<P>
The peace talks hit a snag last August after Denktash walked
out of the U.N.-sponsored peace talks with Clerides to protest
against the European Union's decision to start accession talks
with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
However, Miller said that the preconditions the Turkish Cypriot
side set to return to the negotiating table could not be met,
saying they are untenable.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has said he would not participate the peace talks
unless his breakaway entity in northern Cyprus is recognized and
Cyprus withdraws its application for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Richard Holbrooke, former U.S. Presidential Emissary for
Cyprus, and Miller visited Cyprus last May, but they failed to
bring the two community leaders back to the negotiating table.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF: Only Prolonged Peace Will Save Sudan's Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- If mass starvation of
children and women is to be averted in south Sudan, the cease-fire
must be adhered to and expanded to ensure that urgent humanitarian
relief can reach people most in need, Carol Bellamy, executive
director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF chief visited famine-stricken towns in south Sudan
to take a first-hand look at the humanitarian situation on the
ground just days after a cease-fire was announced by the
government of Sudan and the Sudan People's liberation Movement.
</P>
<P>
"The suffering I witnessed in these famine-stricken areas was
horrific. Children, who should be running and playing, have become
mere skeletal figures, too weak to stand and barely able to feed
themselves," Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
"Most shocking of all were the rows of freshly dug graves in
the areas, where I was told that 51 children and adults had died
only hours earlier," she said.
</P>
<P>
While the three-month cease-fire is a welcome start, Bellamy
said, what children and their families need most is prolonged
peace encompassing the entire area of southern Sudan. This should
include western Upper Nile where insecurity is having devastating
effects on the delivery of humanitarian assistance as well as on
the lives of the people who live there.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy applauded the efforts of the World Food Program, which
is in the midst of the largest airdrop in its history. She
appealed to the international community to redouble efforts to
help facilitate an urgently-needed political solution.

<HEADLINE> New Plant to Provide Enough Power for Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bujagali power plant on the
Nile River, expected to be commissioned in July 2003, will be the
biggest source of power in Uganda and is projected to produce
enough electricity for the developing country, Radio Uganda
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a power official as saying the same day at a
forum on the future of electric power supply that the new plant,
to be located some 80 kilometers east of Kampala, is to produce
270 megawatts of power, one and a half times that of the Owen
Falls Dam.
</P>
<P>
On the choice of site for the power project, the official said
that the dam will be the cheapest and most environmentally
suitable.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Owen power plant supplies Uganda with
two-thirds of power it needs. It also sells power to the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Previously, there was heated debate on whether the Bujagali
Falls should be developed into a tourist site or a power plant.
Some argued that the place is the best choice for white water
rafting which will not spoil the beautiful environment.
</P>
<P>
Others, however, said Uganda, which is gaining momentum on its
way to development, needs more power. The place was finally
chosen as a site for the country's biggest power plant at the end
of May.

WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday ordered the release of 100 million dollars in emergency
federal funds to help people pay for air conditioners, fans and
other means of relief.
</P>
<P>
"In times of human crisis we have an obligation to act,"

</P>
<P>
Clinton said the money would go to people in 11 Southern and
Western states where temperature extremes have been greatest this

</P>
<P>
They are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee
and Texas. In each of these 11 states, temperatures from June 1 to
July 18 were between 16 percent and 26 percent higher than normal.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Export Large Quantity of Crops to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will export crops worth about
7.7 million U.S. dollars to Iraq under agreements struck in line
with the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food deal, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture has signed five contracts
with Egyptian private sector and investment companies within the
framework of the fourth phase of the oil-for-food deal starting
from July.
</P>
<P>
In addition to crops, the contracts also involve pumps, power
generators and animal feed, head of the Egyptian Trade Bureau in
Baghdad Ahmed Hosni told the Egyptian news agency Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The contracts are the fruit of a successful visit to Iraq on
June 16 by Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili
and the talks he had with senior Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
During Gowaili's visit, the two sides signed a memo of economic
and trade cooperation with a view to boosting the volume of
bilateral trade to 250 million U.S. dollars in the coming six
months.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of Egyptian businessmen will visit Iraq early next
month for talks with Iraqi officials on the implementation of a
joint venture to manufacture irrigation and drainage pipes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Iraq have signed contracts worth 200 million dollars
over the last three phases of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal struck in 1996, Iraq is permitted to sell a
limited amount of oil every six months to buy food, medicine and
other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The program is an exception of the crippling economic sanctions
the U.N. Security Council imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Maskhadov Accuses Moscow of Attempt to Assassinate Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 23 (Xinhua) -- President Aslan Maskhadov of
Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya said late Thursday that
Russian secret services were behind the assassination attempt on
him early in the day.
</P>
<P>
"The attempt on my life was organized by Russian secret
services. Executors are local traitors, destructive forces," the
Itar-Tass news agency quoted him as speaking on local television.
</P>
<P>
A parked car exploded when the presidential motorcade was
driving by. Maskhadov's car caught fire but he survived because
the vehicle was armored.
</P>
<P>
So far, two of Maskhadov's bodyguards have died as a result of
the blast. Three others are still listed as in critical condition,
Tass said.
</P>
<P>
In the televised address, Maskhadov vowed to continue his cause
for an "independent Islamic Chechen state."
</P>
<P>
"I cannot die now, there is a lot of work ahead," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Those who seek to fill the post of president should fear
popular wrath," Maskhadov said, without naming his opponents.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been running high in Chechnya, where Maskhadov
declared a state of emergency one month ago to stem rampant crime
and violence by various forces in the breakaway Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya has witnessed rising internal strife between rival
factions following the departure of Russian troops in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached earlier that year between Maskhadov
and the then national security adviser to President Boris Yeltsin,
a decision on Chechyna's status would be postponed until 2001.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Goodwill Ambassador on 1st Trip to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Internationally acclaimed
actor and long-time social activist Danny Glover completed
Thursday his first mission to Namibia and South Africa as goodwill
ambassador of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
</P>
<P>
"This position gives me not only the opportunity to make a
statement about what needs to be done in the world, but also to
understand how people take what are often limited resources to
build and sustain their community," Glover, who was appointed as
UNDP's first goodwill ambassador last March, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of my trip was to witness the kind of impact
programs sponsored by UNDP are having on the ground and within the
national context in which they operate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are stories of hope in Namibia and South Africa. I saw
individuals successfully working collectively from the grassroots
level to the policy level to eradicate poverty in their community
and country. Their determination and hard work made me even more
determined to use my position as UNDP goodwill ambassador to tell
the world that they just need the international community to
assist them with additional human and financial resources," Glover
said.
</P>
<P>
"In both Namibia and South Africa, it is truly a miracle that
so much is being done effectively in such short periods of time.
These are the stories of hope that are alive and well around the
world but never appeared in the media," he added.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Talks Making Headway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Burundi peace talks
have made headway after three days of intense negotiations, with
the conflicting parties at Thursday's plenary session adopting a
three-point agenda for discussion.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the international mediator on Burundi Julius
Nyerere, Hashim Mbita, said that the 19 parties at the talks in
Arusha in north Tanzania on Thursday morning agreed to the agenda
of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The parties have formally accepted the agenda for discussions
on Thursday," reports reaching here quoted Mbita as saying.
</P>
<P>
The accepted agenda, aimed at giving a boost to face-to-face
talks, includes rules of a procedure for the talks, general
debate on the root cause of Burundi conflict and setting up of
sub-committees.
</P>
<P>
The talks bring the government of Pierre Buyoya, who took
power in a July 1996 coup, face to face with Hutu rebels who are
fighting the country's Tutsi-dominated army.
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that things will move as agreed tomorrow," Mbita
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the warring parties have been consulting
each other for the past two days on starting a dialog to end
ethnic violence in the tiny central African nation which has
claimed at least 150,000 lives in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Mbita, however, admitted no thorough agreement has been
reached among the warring parties, but he hoped that the
Burundians will be of one mind to end the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, the former president of Tanzania, has asked each
party to nominate one member to help prepare Friday's plenary,
Mbita said.
</P>
<P>
The second round of the plenary session was adjourned twice on
Tuesday and Wednesday, after delegates of warring parties
disagreed on the agenda for the talks and requested Nyerere more
time for consultations among themselves.
</P>
<P>
The major point of disagreement was whether the issue of the
root cause of Burundi conflict should be discussed at the plenary
or at a sub-committee level.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere has been conducting informal consultations with all
the parties and special envoys since the resumption of the second
round of talks on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Burundi has been embroiled in a civil war since 1993 when
Tutsi troops murdered the country's Hutu president, Melchoir
Ndadaye, three months after he was elected.
</P>
<P>
The international mediator on Burundi, Nyerere, last month
successfully brokered the first round of peace talks in Arusha
when all parties signed a declaration to end conflict
tentatively.

WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday declared all Texas counties eligible for disaster
assistance, making federal aid available to farmers whose crops
have been damaged by drought.
</P>
<P>
The White House announced Clinton's action as he prepared to
unveil a "rural action plan" designed to increase farm exports,
improve the safety net for farm incomes and strengthen the rural
infrastructure by improving transportation and modernizing rural
schools.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will send Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to Texas
and Oklahoma next week to survey the areas hardest hit by the
drought. They will report back on additional steps the
administration should take to help farmers, the White House said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. not to Rule out Military Option in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States is pressing
for a diplomatic solution for the fighting in Kosovo, but could
also resort to unilateral military force or participate in a
NATO plan for action to halt the fighting.
</P>
<P>
At a House International Relations Committee hearing,
Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Walter Slocombe said: "We're
prepared to act alone if necessary. We haven't ruled it out. But
there's a distinction between whether the United States believes
it has the legal authority to act alone and whether it would in
fact in a concrete situation actually do so."
</P>
<P>
Robert Gelbard, U.S. envoy to the Balkans, said the Clinton
administration doesn't believe it needs U.N. approval for any
military action because the United Nations charter and
international law give the United States broad authority in
cases of defense.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is quite clear that we do not need a U.N.
mandate and we have made that quite clear to all our allies,"
Gelbard said.
</P>
<P>
Slocombe told the committee that NATO contingency planning
for a military intervention in the Kosovo violent conflicts was
proceeding, but there had been not decision on use of force.
</P>
<P>
Whether the United States would participate in any NATO force
in the Kosovo area was a separate decision to be made later, if
necessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gelbard said the United States was consulting with allies
about possible action in the U.N. Security Council to reinforce
its demands on Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
These demands include a pullback of Serb security forces in
the region and the start of meaningful talks with Kosovo's
Albanian leadership designed to create a political settlement.

<HEADLINE> East African States Promote Cooperation on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 23 (Xinhua) - The three nations of the
East African Cooperation (EAC) have agreed to coordinate their
foreign policies in a bid to enhance their image in the world
arena.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretaries responsible for foreign affairs in
Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda agreed early this week in a draft
memorandum of understanding that they will take concrete measures
to promote their cooperation in the foreign policy, sources said
Thursday from Arusha, northern Tanzania where the EAC Secretariat
is based.
</P>
<P>
The member states will establish liaison offices in their
foreign ministries with attention on aspects relating to foreign
affairs, making joint briefings, and soliciting support for the
EAC regional projects.
</P>
<P>
"They will provide consular services on behalf of the other
member states where they do not have embassies and consulates,
including renewal of passports and any other necessary assistance
to nationals of member states," the memorandum said.
</P>
<P>
It further said that the EAC members should cooperate in
multilateral diplomacy with a view to harmonizing policies with
the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Abuja Treaty for
African Economic Community, the Nonaligned Movement, the Group of
77 and the (British) Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum also proposed collaboration among member states
in trade, investment, tourism as well as cultural activities.
</P>
<P>
In April, the three EAC member states approved a draft treaty
in a move to upgrade their cooperation into a treaty level to
help define in more clearer terms the shape and inclination of
the cooperation aimed at establishing a single market and
investment area in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
The EAC was founded on the basis of the defunct East African
Community which collapsed in 1977 due to reasons including the
divergence of economic policies then pursued by the member
states, the continued perception of disproportionate sharing of
benefits and lack of adequate compensation mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Since its foundation, the EAC has tried to address the
shortcomings inherent in the past cooperation initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns U.S. for "Hostile Measures" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohanmmed Saeed al-Sahaf Thursday condemned the United States for
"hostile measures" against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the United Nations Security Council, Sahaf said
that his nation was deeply concerned about the reports that the
Clinton administration was seeking authority from Congress to
plant and mount covert operations against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Iraq "condemns in the strongest terms the hostile measures and
actions that are being taken by the United States administration
against Iraq," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister said that U.S. State Department
officials had made such statements previously while pointing to a
recent article in the Wall Street Journal that says the U.S.
administration was seeking congressional approval to weaken and
possibly overthrow the Iraqi president.
</P>
<P>
Martin Indyk, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near and
North African Affairs, reportedly told a seminar last month that
the United States was working with 73 exiled groups of Iraq to
build up opposition to Saddam.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf called on the 15-member Security Council to tell the
Clinton administration to stop "its policy of conspiracy and
incitement" against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Borrow From Foreign Private Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
proceed in October with its plan to borrow some 750 million U.S.
dollars to make up for the expected nearly 70 billion pesos (1.75
billion dollars) budget deficit, a senior finance official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
During a briefing for senators on the government's
legislative-economic agenda, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu
said that the government is firming up its plan to borrow from
private sources abroad some 750 million dollars either in the form
of Eurobonds or Yankee bonds.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Department of Finance will make a decision on
July 31 on who would help underwrite the bond offering. The
proceeds of the bond issuance will serve as a buffer fund for the
government's budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said that the list has been narrowed down to six from
the original eight institutions that had submitted proposals for
the bond offering.
</P>
<P>
He said a roadshow for the bond offering would be undertaken in
October in Europe and the United States.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Eximbank President: Time Right to Attract U.S. Capital to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- James Harmon, chairman and
president of the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Eximbank) said today
that "it is a good time to attract U.S. capital to China."
</P>
<P>
"This is the message I learned here," he told Chinese
Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao after discussions with senior Chinese
economic officials on his on-going China visit.
</P>
<P>
Now the United States' official export credit provider,
Eximbank is interested in investing in China's massive
infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
His bank could also provide loans for China's small and
medium-sized enterprises via the Bank of China (BOC), China's top
foreign currency bank and Eximbank's prime partner in the country.
</P>
<P>
Eximbank may also provide technical assistance to China's
financial institutions who are now undergoing a profound
restructuring reform to cater to the market economy, a move that
may make the country's banking system "more competitive," as
Harmon put it. "This is more important than such measures as
taxation reduction," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said he appreciates China's policy of keeping its
currency stable, noting that such a decision is beneficial "for
the long-term development of China."
</P>
<P>
Established in 1934, Eximbank promotes the export of U.S. goods
by providing capital and credit guarantees for
U.S. enterprises. Its cooperation with the BOC began in 1981. The
bank is planning to set up a permanent office in China soon in a
bid to expand its China-related business.
</P>
<P>
Eximbank has joined hands with the BOC in 49 programs with a
total value of 1.5 billion U.S. dollars, either in direct
loans or export credit insurance.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also worked together to raise 2.6 billion
U.S. dollars for the import of 51 U.S.-made passenger airplanes
into China.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan said Friday that breakthrough on the Kashmir
dispute is not possible without third party mediation.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local news agency, the News Network
International, Ayub Khan said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his
Indian counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee are to meet on July 29 on
the sidelines of the 10th Summit of the South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled meeting between the two prime ministers will be
followed by a meeting of the foreign ministers of the two
countries, said Ayub Khan.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that no breakthrough is expected in the
scheduled meeting between Sharif and Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that for the last 50 years Pakistan
and India held several rounds of talks but the result has been
"nil" because of India's non-serious attitude.
</P>
<P>
Despite that, he said, Pakistan would continue talks with India
at every level.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), Ayub
Khan said that the recent talks in Islamabad between Pakistan and
the U.S. were satisfactory. Pakistan would continue talks on this
issue with the U.S. and other world powers.
</P>
<P>
He said that a Pakistani delegation will visit Washington next
month to hold the next round of talks.
</P>
<P>
"It is good that the Americans understand our point of view and
our position in the region," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's nuclear policy is no longer linked with that of
India, said Ayub Khan, adding that "we have our concerns...our
security concerns and in no way can we risk our security."

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- France's top daily Le Monde Friday
called for an end to the Tour de France 1998 cycling tournament,
plagued by widespread doping scandals.
</P>
<P>
"The Tour de France is finished. To say more exactly it has
never begun. Once for all, the show should not go on,,'' said Le
Monde in an editorial which rapped the doping scandals that broke
out one after another.
</P>
<P>
It blamed the organizers for pretending not to see "the strange
manners of the cyclists and the terrible affects of the doping."
</P>
<P>
"It is up to them to prevent the drowning of this competition
and to save and relaunch on good basis this prestigious match
between all," it said.
</P>
<P>
At least two professional cycling teams have been discovered to
have systematically resorted to drugs during this year's Tour de
France, which is still in the middle of its way.
</P>
<P>
"The cyclists should put their feet on the land and go for
examination of conscience. Police and justice should work to
shelter from pressure. Organizers, federal officials, medical
authorities and public powers should open debate they refused for
years out of fear or interests," said the daily.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the Tour de France should either face the
truth or die out completely.

BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Water levels of the middle and
lower Yangtze River have exceeded the warning line because of
continuous heavy and torrential rains over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
In Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, torrential
rains that have been pelting down for the past three days stopped

of water.
</P>
<P>
Buses have now resumed service on most major streets in Wuhan,
according to local sources. However, a total of 100,000 soldiers
of the People's Liberation Army and local residents are still on
watch at the river embarkments guarding against another flood peak.
</P>
<P>
Most shops in the city shut down by the flooding also reopened
today, many still with sandbags in front of their gates.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains also hit Nanchang, capital of east China's
Jiangxi Province today, with a total rainfall of 225 mm from 8:00
am to 8:00 pm. The water level of the Jiujiang River is expected
to reach 22.3 meters within two or three days, which would be the
highest level ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
Water levels in the Xiangjiang, Zishui, Yuanjiang and Lishui
rivers in central China's Hunan Province on the middle reaches of the
Yangtze also continue to rise, due to heavy rainfalls during the

<HEADLINE> No Museum Entry Fee in Britain in 2001, Says Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- British Cultural Secretary Chris
Smith announced details of 290 million pounds (478.5 million U.S.
dollars) extra funding for the arts, museums and galleries Friday,
which includes free entry to all museums and galleries next
century.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in the National Gallery in London, Smith
outlined how he would spend the extra funding for the cultural
sector over the next three years, saying 100 million pounds (165
million dollars) would be used to finance major national museums
and galleries to establish universal free entry in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"This represents a new beginning for the cultural life of this
country," Smith said. "It will give hundreds of thousands more
people the chance to enjoy the best of artistic activity, to learn
about our culture and to visit our great collections of our
nation."
</P>
<P>
Visual and performing arts get the biggest increase in funding
of 125 million pounds (206 million dollars), following a 17.5
percent cut over the last five years for which Smith himself was
partly responsible.
</P>
<P>
Smith also announced a radical overhaul of the structure of the
funding bodies that oversee the arts.
</P>
<P>
From next April a new independent watchdog will begin to
monitor efficiency and standards across the arts, and the plethora
of unelected administrative bodies, or quangos, will be
streamlined.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a radical restructuring of the landscape of
quangos we have inherited," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
 Friday spelled out his administration's three-pronged foreign
policy that centers on economic diplomacy, national security and
the welfare of Filipino overseas workers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the 31st Ministerial Meeting of the
Association of Southeast Asian (ASEAN) here, Estrada said the
continuity of Philippine foreign policy pursued by his
predecessor, former president Fidel Ramos, will be the primary
thrust of his administration.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that he had retained Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon in his cabinet to underscore this primary goal and reaffirm
the country's various commitments before the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The function is Estrada's first exposure before an
international forum as the country's president.
</P>
<P>
In defining his administration's foreign policy, Estrada cited
five major goals which the Philippines will pursue. These are:
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening the country's bilateral security arrangements
with its major allies, which include the United States and its
close neighbors in Asia; and pushing for multilateral security
cooperation in international forums such as the United Nations and
the ASEAN Regional Forum.
</P>
<P>
-- Calling for international cooperation in dealing with the
financial turmoil gripping Asia and supporting moves to peacefully
resolve long-festering security threats, including the current
conflicts in the South China Sea, Cambodia, Korean Peninsula,
South Asia and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
-- Establishing close links with other nations in combating
international terrorism, drug trafficking, the trafficking of
women and children, money laundering and other transnational
crimes.
</P>
<P>
-- Continuing support for a more open, freer and fairer global
trade and investment regime and reaffirming the commitment to the
goals of the ASEAN Free Trade Area, the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, the World Trade Organization and ASEAN's ties
with the European Community.
</P>
<P>
-- Seeking global cooperation in protecting the welfare and
rights of migrant workers, especially Filipinos working and living
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada stressed that his government will strongly
support the country's joint efforts with fellow ASEAN members
Indonesia and Thailand and other countries to help Cambodia regain
political stability.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to pursue the country's commitment to assisting
in the development of Myanmar and Laos and facilitate their entry
and adjustment in the ASEAN.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China has built one of "the most
modern and state-of-the-art" telecommunications networks in terms
of transmission speed, according to Gerald Butters, president of
the Optical Networking Group of Lucent Technologies Inc..
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, Butters said the Chinese
Government is obviously aware that maintaining powerful growth
momentum in the information industry is an essential element in
building an economic structure to serves sustained development
into the new century.
</P>
<P>
There are now 8.7 telephone lines for every 100 people in
China, and plans to raise the ratio to 10 to 100 by the
year 2000, and 40 to 100 by 2020.
</P>
<P>
This translates into a massive build-up of telecom
infrastructure, especially fiber optic networking over the next 22
years, Butters said.
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, Lucent Technologies has been awarded
more than 300 synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) optical
networking contracts in China, representing 650 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Butters spoke highly of the narrowing gap between China's
adoption of the latest technologies and the introduction of Lucent
Technologies' latest products in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China's networks are backed by dense
wave-length division multiplexing, the state-of-the-art technology
in fiber optic transmission. Negotiations are now underway on
technological transfer between Lucent Technologies' joint venture
in Shanghai and its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Lucent Technologies now has seven regional offices, six joint
ventures and two wholly-owned companies in China.

JOHANNESBURG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo said Friday that Malaysia has kept up
much-needed investment in South Africa despite its own economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said ties between the two countries had strengthened over
the past few years, partly due to a substantial amount of
Malaysian investment in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the opening of a new Malaysian High
Commission in Pretoria by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, who is on a two-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Malaysian High Commission is "furthermore
an indication that Malaysia tends to maintain a strong presence
here in South Africa in the years to come," Nzo noted.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was the second largest investor in South Africa in
1996, which has pumped 1.8 billion Rand (285 million U.S. Dollars)
mainly into property development and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Telkom Malaysia and the United States-based SBC
Communications acquired a 30 percent stake in Telkom South
Africa, the largest direct investment in South Africa to date
with an inflow of 1.26 billion U.S. Dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
 Friday pushed for the holding of an international conference on
globalization to overcome the "severe strain" caused by the
financial crisis sweeping across Asia and to speed up the recovery
of the regional economies.
</P>
<P>
Estrada made the call in his keynote address at the opening
ceremonies of the 31st Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) Ministerial Meeting here Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, however, called on ASEAN to take the "intellectual
leadership" in the proposed international conference to make sure
that the outcome will truly reflect the will of the 30-year-old
organization.
</P>
<P>
"Unless ASEAN does so, others will once again shape our
destiny," the Philippine president cautioned.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said one aspect of globalization that should be given
attention to in the proposed conference is the "phenomenon of
massive amounts of capital flowing across national boundaries at
lighting speed."
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the aspects of globalization that carry an
element of risk and peril. It is an aspect of globalization that
requires the most profound examination and the most delicate
handling," he told the ASEAN foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
As the new millennium approaches, Estrada said ASEAN should
move towards greater integration to attain economic recovery that
will lead to sustained growth, greater regional peace and
stability and a more prosperous Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers from the nine ASEAN member countries are
gathering here for a two-day annual meeting which is focusing on
the financial crisis and other major economic, security and
political issues facing the region.
</P>
<P>
They will also attend the 5th ASEAN Regional Forum and the Post
Ministerial Conference to be held after the ministerial meeting.

ASEAN currently groups the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore,
Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar and Brunei.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Government Urged to Drop Onlooker's Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government is being
urged to stop playing the onlooker's role and to take substantive
measure to save the country's export industries from total
collapse.
</P>
<P>
If South Korea's exports plunge in the second half of this
year, the nation's credit ratings will be brought down and another
economic crisis may erupt, said the Korea International Trade
Association (KITA), in a letter to the government Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The government should immediately drop its "wait-and-see"
stance and map out additional measures as soon as possible to
raise the competitiveness of the domestic export industries, and
help resolve the liquidity crunch of smaller exporters," the KITA
said.
</P>
<P>
Although the measures announced by the government on July 10
allow small domestic exporters to receive trade financing from the
banks by just presenting approval letters of purchase issued by
large enterprises, the banks are still refusing to extend
financing, said the association.
</P>
<P>
The KITA also attributed part of the problems to the political
circle. It said the approval of the supplementary budget bill had
been delayed amid the brawl among rival political parties over the
opening of the National Assembly (parliament) session.
</P>
<P>
"It will likely take a considerable period for domestic
businesses to benefit from the expanded credit guarantee of up to
500 billion won (389 million U.S. dollars) from related agencies,
due to the delay in the National Assembly opening," the KITA said.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the association also proposed the expansion of
trade financing to larger businesses, and an increase of import
duties on foreign light industrial goods, such as textiles and
footwear, in order to protect domestic producers.
</P>
<P>
If the present bleak export situations continue, it said, the
nation will probably register a minus growth of exports this year,
for the first time since it started to sell its goods abroad in
1960.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko met visiting U.S. Vice-President Al Gore Friday to
discuss bilateral cooperation in trade, nuclear matters and space.
</P>
<P>
After morning meetings, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny
Adamov said Washington had agreed to provide millions of dollars
in aid for Russia's closed nuclear towns like Sarov, the leading
Russian nuclear weapons research center.
</P>
<P>
Adamov said the United States was planning to allocate 25-30
million dollars next year for such towns.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, thousands in Sarov staged a three-hour warning
strike for back pay, fueling concern about safety at the nuclear
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The two also discussed the state of Russia's ailing economy,
hit by a financial crisis in June. Washington was a strong backer
for a 22.6 billion dollar bailout loan package for Russia.
</P>
<P>
On space cooperation issue, Russian Space Agency director
general Yuri Koptov was quoted as saying that Kiriyenko reaffirmed
Russia's pledge to continue its participation in construction of
the Alpha international space station,
</P>
<P>
The Kiriyenko-Gore meeting represents the 11th session of the
Russia-U.S. Joint Commission on Economic and Technological
Cooperation, which meets twice a year, alternately in the United
States and Russia. Kiriyenko and Gore are the co-chairmen of the
commission,
</P>
<P>
Gore, who arrived here Thursday from Ukraine, is also expected
to discuss with Russian officials the preparation for the
September visit to Russia by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Gore is scheduled to have a telephone conversation with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, who is now vacationing in Shuiskaya
Chupa, Karelia.
</P>
<P>
Gore was to leave Moscow later Friday after a joint press
conference with Kiriyenko.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan FM Says SAARC Summit to Focus on Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Foreign Minister
Lakshman Kadirgamar said here Friday that the upcoming summit of
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) would
focus on economic issues.
</P>
<P>
"The theme of this summit is the role of SAARC in a changing
world," he told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
South Asian leaders will discuss the region's "collective
responsibility towards global economic changes," he said, adding
that it was going to be an "economic summit."
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar said economic issues will be addressed at the summit
in a global context.
</P>
<P>
"So much is happening outside the region," and globalization is
taking place at a rapid pace, creating both advantages and
problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited the financial crisis in Southeast Asia as one of the
problems to be addressed. The crisis is happening so close to
South Asia that "it is a natural concern for all of us."
</P>
<P>
The 10th SAARC summit is scheduled for July 29-31 in Colombo.
Senior officials from the seven member countries -- Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, Pakistan, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka --
began preparatory work for the summit Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretaries of the member states will meet Saturday
for two days of discussion, to be followed by a two-day meeting of
the SAARC foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
As SAARC delegates and foreign journalists are arriving in
Colombo, Sri Lankan authorities are tightening security in the
capital. A total of 6,000 police officers, in addition to army
soldiers, will be deployed during the summit.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar also said SAARC leaders would provide direction to
the grouping's objective of creating the South Asian Free Trade
Area (SAFTA) by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
At their summit in Male, the Maldives, in May last year, the
South Asian leaders decided to move faster from the South Asian
Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) to SAFTA, bring forward
the timetable for establishing the free trade zone from 2005 to
2001.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Eminent Persons, set up at the Male summit with
the aim of developing a long-range vision and formulating a
perspective plan of action, will deliver a report to the Colombo
summit, Kadirgamar said, adding that some decisions would be made
based on the report.

<HEADLINE> China's Position on WTO Accession Reaffirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has adopted
a series of positive measures and made significant efforts to
promote the negotiations for further progress since the seventh
session of the Working Party meeting on China's accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation and
head of the Chinese delegation, Long Yongtu, made this point
Friday in a speech at the one-day meeting of the eighth session of
the Working Party. Long reaffirmed the position of the Chinese
government on its accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
-- The accession to the WTO is consistent with the China's
policy of reform and opening up and therefore it is in China's
interests. The positive attitude of China toward its WTO accession
has not changed.
</P>
<P>
China's accession is also in the interests of WTO
members. Without China's participation, the WTO would be an
incomplete global multilateral trade organization.
</P>
<P>
-- In opening up its market, China can only take a step-by-step
approach in line with its current level of economic
development. Excessive demands or hasty actions in this regard
will not only endanger China's economic development, but also
damage the interests of those countries which are willing to
develop economic and trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
-- After its accession to the WTO, China is prepared to fulfill
the obligations of a WTO member. At the same time, it should also
enjoy the due rights. The rights and obligations should be
balanced.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the above-mentioned principles, China is ready to
continue its cooperation with all WTO members in an effort to
conclude this protracted negotiation in the near future," Long
said.
</P>
<P>
Long made the statement at a time when recent news reports in
the Western media claimed that China had lost interest in joining
the organization and offered nothing new at negotiations.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the end of Friday's meeting, Long
dismissed the reports as "groundless."
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the reports, Long said, China has made many
substantial proposals on the opening up of telecommunications,
financial services, distribution and professional services on the
basis of the service schedule submitted last November.
</P>
<P>
"These are our major improvements in the previous months," Long
said. "On what ground did they say that there has been no progress
and we have come to Geneva empty-handed?" he asked.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Construction of an expressway
commenced today in the southwest China municipality of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The 87-km section of the Chongqing-Guizhou Expressway, funded
with loans from the Asian Development Bank, is part of an
ambitious road construction program in Chongqing, China's largest
municipality with a population of over 30 million people.
</P>
<P>
The mountainous city, which is divided by several major rivers,
including the Yangtze and the Jialing, has always faced a
difficult situation in terms of highway construction.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, related difficulties have failed to frighten
developers concerned with the city's future.
</P>
<P>
The four expressways currently under construction in the
municipality will link its major cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
The municipality has not only used loans of international
financial institutions and foreign governments, but also allowed
overseas investors to participate in highway construction.
</P>
<P>
Five major highway bridges over the Yangtze River were
completed during 1998. Substantial progress has also been recorded
in the construction of roads leading the municipality to the
massive Three Gorges Water Conservancy Project.
</P>
<P>
The municipality has decided to invest some 21.6 billion
yuan (2.6 billion US dollars) over the next five years in the
construction of a new expressway network.

BRUSSELS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Johan Cruyff is the Dutch
people's best choice to succeed Guus Hiddink as the national
soccer team coach, said a survey published Friday in Amsterdam,
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
One in three people interviewed for the poll picked Cruyff,
who captained the Dutch ``Clockwork Orange'' team that lost the
1974 World Cup final to West Germany, according to reports from
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
Cruyff, who has coached Ajax Amsterdam and Spanish giant
Barcelona, is currently working as a television soccer analyst.
</P>
<P>
Hiddink was hired as coach by Real Madrid after guiding the
Netherlands to a semifinal berth in the World Cup finals in France
and the Dutch soccer association is hunting for a successor,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The man regarded by the Dutch media as favorite for the job,
former Glasgow Celtic manager Wim Jansen, was picked by just 12
percent of the 1,000 people interviewed for the poll by market
research company NIPO.
</P>
<P>
Jansen and Cruyff are teammates in the 1974 World Cup.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government
encourages development of the fisheries sector, the major provider
of animal protein to the day-to-day meal of the ordinary people of
the country, the national BSS news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government will make efforts in five strategies --
extensive research, expansion, training, consulting service and
supervision in the overall fisheries sector, for implementing the
National Fisheries Policy designed to increase and develop fish
resources, alleviate poverty, raise export and preserve
environment and biodiversity, the BSS quoted officials as saying
Friday.
</P>
<P>
This has been the first fisheries policy of the country in the
past 21 years.
</P>
<P>
The government encourages the private sector in fish production
by providing training on improved technology and management,
supplying high variety of fish, fish health service and
fish-feeds, ensuring fair price and proper marketing.
</P>
<P>
The country's total domestic water bodies are 4.338 million
hectares, including 4.047 million hectares of open water bodies,
152,000 hectares of digging ponds and 138,000 hectares of coastal
shrimp farm, according to an official statement.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.492 million tons of fish were produced in the
just-ended 1997-98 fiscal year, 8.65 percent up from the
production level of the previous fiscal, officials said.
</P>
<P>
A special project, "Poverty Alleviation Through Coordinated
Fish Cultivation," during the last fiscal year helped nearly 7,000
youths employed, they said.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated 5,861.8 million taka (125 million
U.S. dollars) for the fisheries sector in the country during the
fifth five-year plan period, with fish production targeted at
2.075 million tons and export targeted at 95,000 tons earning some
38,045 million taka (809.5 million dollars) in the 2001-2002
fiscal year, the last year of the five-year period, the news
agency said.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Canada's biggest city Toronto has
replaced Vancouver in having the strongest economy in the country
and is expected to continue to lead Canadian cities into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board of Canada, in a new study of eight
metropolitan areas in the country, predicts strong growth this
year for all of them except Vancouver and Victoria.
</P>
<P>
With momentum building from record high levels in 1997, Toronto
is expected to lead the country this year, expanding its gross
domestic product by 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Montreal, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Calgary and Edmonton will be
nipping at their heels. Expansion of their economies is expected
to range from 3.2 percent in Winnipeg to 4.9 percent in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
But Vancouver is slowing after a decade of exuberant growth, a
victim of the Asian crisis. The city will post the weakest growth
of all at 1.8 percent this year, followed by Victoria at 1.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Toronto, backed by strong construction markets and surging
wholesale and retail trade, is growing almost three times as fast
as Vancouver this year, say Conference Board analysts.
</P>
<P>
They said the city's GDP should remain above four percent for
the next three years, as a result of relatively low interest rates
and good employment prospects.

WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- More residential building permits have been issued in the
Washington-Baltimore region this decade than in any other place in
the nation, eclipsing larger areas such as Los Angeles and
faster-growing areas as Phoenix, according to Census Bureau
statistics to be released Friday.
</P>
<P>
-- Michael McCurry announced Thursday that he will step down
this fall as White House press secretary.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Republican leaders in the Senate have decided it would be
futile to push for a big tax cut this year, infuriating
conservatives in the House and Senate who had hoped the prospect
of huge Federal budget surpluses would lead to swift passage of
sweeping tax reductions, members of Congress and aides said.
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton said that homeowners in 11 scorched
southern states would be eligible for 100 million U.S. dollars in
emergency Federal aid to buy fans and air-conditioners and pay
soaring electric bills.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- A veto of the Republican managed-care bill was threatened by
President Bill Clinton. He said it lacks protection such as
guaranteed access to specialists and a ban on financial
arrangements that push doctors to limit care. House leaders sought
moderates' support before a possible vote Friday.
</P>
<P>
USA Today:
</P>
<P>
-- In a move to stop an unregulated, fast growing, mostly
offshore business, the Senate voted 90-10 Thursday to pull the

Armin Meier, a Swiss cyclist for the Festina team, was the
first to publicly confess but he declined to speak for any other
rider.

being heard by Lyon police on Friday as well as two Festina

<HEADLINE> China Confident of Realizing 1998 Trade Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China is both confident and fully
capable of achieving its goal of a 345 billion U.S. dollar trade
volume for 1998, according to Hu Zhaoqing, spokesman for the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks at today's press conference and noted that
China faces major challenges in trade during the second half of
the year due to the worsening financial turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, the growing global economy and good domestic economic
environment will enable China to defy all odds and fulfill all
tasks, said Hu.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Intensified efforts will be made to implement the
market diversification strategy and epitomize the export
structure. Moreover, he added, China will require enterprises to
further develop their capacities, reduce costs and expenditures,
take emergency measures to cope with changing situation and reduce
market risks.
</P>
<P>
China's total import-export volume hit 325 billion U.S. dollars
last year, with year-on-year growth of 12.1 percent. The trade
volume of the first half of 1997 jumped 13 percent to 143.8
billion US dollars, with the volume for the first half of this
year growing by 5.2 percent to 151.4 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Conservatives Demand Execution of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian hard-liners Friday staged
a demonstration in downtown Tehran, demanding the execution of
moderate Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi who was sentenced to five
years in jail Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first reaction of the conservatives to the verdict
on Karbaschi, who was also banned from public office for 20 years
and fined about 180,000 U.S. dollars on charges of corruption.
</P>
<P>
Calling themselves as Hezbollah (Party of God), more than 100
protesters marched from Tehran University to the Enqelab
(Revolution) Square following the Friday prayers congregation.
</P>
<P>
Holding pictures of the Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the demonstrators shouted: "Death to Karbaschi,
Traitor Mayor."
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was marred by a short-lived clash occurring
near the main gate of Tehran University when a pro-moderate
student holding the picture of President Mohammad Khatami tried to
block the way of the group, which was led by a van mounted with
loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
The student shouted: "Support only for Khatami."
</P>
<P>
Several hard-liners dragged him out of the way and intended to
beat him, but they were prevented by a crowd nearby.
</P>
<P>
The sentence of Karbaschi was believed to be a setback to the
moderate camp led by Khatami, who has been trying to introduce
reformist policies since taking power in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, a well-known moderate technocrat and a close ally
of Khatami, was the highest-ranking Iranian official
charged for embezzlement since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The mayor's case has intensified the factional struggle
between the conservatives and moderates who believed the case was
politically motivated to weaken the Khatami-led government.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian public gave a mixed reaction to the verdict on
Karbaschi.
</P>
<P>
A conservative cleric from the headquarters of Friday Prayers
Congregations told Xinhua that Karbaschi was guilty of many
wrong-doings. "As a high-ranking official, Karbaschi should know
what to do and what not to do," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, a government employee shook his head while watching
the hard-line demonstration. He said that all the charges placed
by the conservatives on Karbaschi were "lies."
</P>
<P>
"He (Karbaschi) is a good man who devoted himself to the
country and the revolution," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Friday demonstration lasted for only about half an hour and
ended without violence. So far the moderate camp has been keeping
silence, in contrast to their violent reaction to the arrest of
Karbaschi in April.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Presents HK Library With Dictionaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong library Friday
received a rare copy of Chinese Literature Dictionary, which
carries the signatures by two literary giants of China -- Ba Jin
and Bing Xin, both in their 90s.
</P>
<P>
Li Weiguo, director of the Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing
House, presented the voluminous dictionary along with 11 other
thick reference books to Tuet Sun-fan, chief librarian of Hong
Kong Regional Council Public Library here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Li said at the presentation ceremony: "It is rare to have on
one book both signatures of China's two preeminent writers, and it
is particularly so considering the fact that both of them are
nearly 100 years old and have been confined to hospital for a long
period of time."
</P>
<P>
Ba Jin, born in 1904, enjoys a reputation for his novels such
as "Family", "Spring" and "Autumn", while Bing Xin, born in 1900,
is known for her children's literary works, essays and letters.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the two writers signed three copies of Chinese
Literature Dictionary, said Li, adding that one has been brought
to Hong Kong, another would be left in Shanghai and the third
would be kept in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The dictionary, which has 18,000 entries, collects the essence
of Chinese literary works throughout the past 3,000 years. The
5.5-million-word volume took more than 100 scholars 17 years to
compile.
</P>
<P>
Li mentioned another valuable book, Ci Hai, which, also
published by his publishing house, is a combination of a Chinese
dictionary and an encyclopedia. With 120,000 entries and 16
million words, Ci Hai is so far the largest comprehensive
dictionary ever published in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Li hoped that these books could be helpful to Hong Kong
readers.
</P>
<P>
Tuet, the chief librarian, said: "This is the first time that
her library received such a big donation of books from a mainland
publishing house." The Regional Council Public Library has a total
of 2.5 million books, and has planned to order 1.4 million copies
of books from the mainland in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1958, Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House is
China's leading publisher of dictionaries and reference books. At
the on-going 98 Hong Kong Book Fair, it exhibits books worth of
400,000 HK dollars (51,000 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Military Secret Maps of Japanese Invaders Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archivists have discovered
370 military secret maps left by Japanese invasion troops at
Laohekou City in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The maps, drawn between 1929 and 1938, were discovered by
staff members of the Laohekou Archives as they were checking
historical records.
</P>
<P>
The maps include cities, counties and townships stretching from
Hubei Province to Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, Henan, Shaanxi and Sichuan
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The words "military secret" are marked on many of the maps and
the scale of most of them is 1:50,000.
</P>
<P>
Laohekou City, located in northwest Hubei Province, is a key
junction for Hubei, Henan, Sichuan and Shaanxi Provinces. It was
the Headquarters of China's No.5 War Zone.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the discovery of the maps is of great importance
for the research on the history of the Japanese invasion of China.
</P>
<P>
In March 1945, Japanese troops launched an offensive against the
city, which was defended valiantly, resulting in the killing
and wounding of 1,680 Japanese soldiers and 1,600 Chinese
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The city was seized by the Japanese in that battle, but was
later retaken by the Chinese troops in August that year.
</P>
<P>
The War of Resistance Against Japan lasted from 1937 until
1945.

However, he admitted that unfair or illegal law-enforcement
activities such as the forced extortion of confessions, as well as
the misuse of police weapons, occur from time to time across the
country because of an imperfect supervisory system.
</P>
<P>
"Hence, the ministry has invited the special supervisors to
strengthen supervision from the outside," Bai said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister urged the police force to listen to the
supervisors' criticisms with an open mind and correct their
mistakes, and that they should not refuse to answer questions
raised by supervisors.
</P>
<P>
Among the special supervisors are Wang Yiming, vice chairman of
the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, renowned
artists Liu Changyu and Yin Xiumei, as well as reporters from
eight Beijing-based news organizations.

<HEADLINE> More Power Cuts Occur in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- There have been more power cuts
occurring across Myanmar in recent months, resulting from
inadequate natural gas and electric power supply.
</P>
<P>
According to the Myanmar Ministry of Electric Power, hydro and
gas power plants in the country are not operating at full capacity
due to water shortage at dams and reservoirs including major water
facilities of Moebye, Inlay and Lawpyita.
</P>
<P>
Frequent failure of underground power lines, which have been in
use for about 70 years, and frequent breakdown of transformers
when overloaded also led to increased power cuts in the country,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is taking temporary measures to ensure convenience
of local subscribers, asking them to reduce power consumption as
much as they can when power is being shared and supplied in turns
to townships especially in the capital city Yangon.
</P>
<P>
According to a report on the country's financial, economic and
social conditions, the installed generating capacity (IGC) of the
state-run Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE), the main
electricity supplier in the country accounting for 77 percent of
its total IGC, was 1,207 megawatts (mw) in 1997-98 fiscal year
which ended in March, compared with 1,031 mw in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The MEPE generated 4.2 billion kilowatt-hours (kwh) of
electricity in the 1997-98, 260 million kwh more than the year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Of the total generated power, 2.3 billion kwh or 55 percent was
produced by natural gas and 1.6 billion kwh or 39 percent by
hydropower.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase in power generation, electricity supply is
 still far from meeting the country's need as the economy is
developing with more involvement of the private sector and foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Electric Power, newly added in November last
year, is endeavoring to build more hydro and combined cycle power
plants in an effort to increase the country's installed generating
capacity, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, feasibility study on building more hydropower
stations  is underway by companies from Japan, the Republic of
Korea, China and some other muli-national developer groups.

JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Seven relatives of Indonesian
former president Soeharto were replaced Friday from the country's
highest legislative body, the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR), TV Indonesia reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision for the replacement was taken during a leadership
meeting of the ruling Golkar party (Functional Group) presided
over by its new chairman Akbar Tanjung on Wednesday night.

<P>
Reform of the MPR will be carried out by 500 lawmakers and 500
government appointees. It will be part of an agenda for democratic
change put in place by President B.J. Habibie, who assumed the
presidential office on May 21 after the resignation of Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Habibie has appointed 41 new members of MPR on July 1 to
replace members who had retired, resigned or passed away.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The metal seized Wednesday by
Indian Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) from a house in
Chennai, capital city of the southern State of Tamil Nadu, was not
uranium but illmenite, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The PTI said Thursday that the CBI seized 8 kilograms of
enriched uranium, which could be used in atomic energy processes,
from the house of an engineer and three people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
A scientific analysis of the samples of the metal had proved
that the it was not uranium but illmenite, the PTI said today.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Energy (IGCAE)
in Tamil Nadu Placid Rodriguez, who conducted the tests, said
Friday in a statement that quantitative analysis carried out by
emission spectroscopy showed the major constituents were iron and
titanium and the x-ray examination revealed the samples to be
illmenite.
</P>
<P>
He said the samples were also analyzed by inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometer for uranium and thorium. The
concentration of both these elements was found to be below the
detectable limit (20 ppm).

<P>
TOKYO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rebounded in Tokyo
Friday, ending a four-day streak of losses thanks to an afternoon
wave of buybacks by pension funds and foreign brokerages in a wide
range of issues.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 173.88
points, or 1.07 percent, from Thursday's close to end at 16,361.89.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, gained 8.14 points or 0.65 percent to
1,258.01.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section came to an estimated 400 million
shares, down from 422.75 million shares Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kawai Musical Instruments Mfg. was the day's most heavily
traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo market closed minutes before the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) elected Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi as
their new president to replace outgoing party chief and Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Many traders said the outcome of the election would have only a

pull Japan out of recession.

outnumbered decliners 648 to 453, with 184 issues ending

dropped on profit-taking and stayed at lower levels.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency was quoted at 140.53-55 yen at 5 p.m. (0800

<HEADLINE> Arafat Agrees to Continue Talks with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat agreed Friday to continue the
Israeli-Palestinians talks suspended after the first rounds of
negotiations earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the statement after he met with Israeli Public
Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani for one and a half hours in
the West Bank city Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference, Kahalani said the gap between the
two sides over the second stage of Israeli withdrawal from the
West Bank was "very small." He said that he believed an agreement
would be signed very soon.
</P>
<P>
No concrete date and place for the further talks were announced.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Kahalani meeting came amid doubts about in what
direction the newly-resumed Israeli-Palestinian talks will go --
to a total collapse or to be continued.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have kept the Israelis in the dark for two
days as to whether they agree to resume the talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks broke down abruptly Wednesday after two rounds of
discussions resulted in no progress. The PNA complained that the
Israelis had not brought any new proposals to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
At issue was the American proposal calling for a 13.1 percent
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. The Palestinians have
accepted the proposal, but Israeli rejected it on security
grounds.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erekat was quoted by Israeli
TV as saying that although the Palestinians agreed to resume
talks with the Israelis, they would not intend to negotiate, but
just to listen to the Israeli views on the U.S. initiative.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have made it clear that the U.S. plan was
nonnegotiable, and the only way to push forward the peace process
is for Israel to announce its acceptance of the plan.

<HEADLINE> Japanese LDP's New Chief pledges to Revive Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) President Keizo Obuchi pledged Friday to revitalize
the country's sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
"The pressing issue facing us is to reconstruct the Japanese
economy and get rid of the people's uncertainty," Obuchi, 61, who
is expected to become prime minister late this month, told a press
conference shortly after being elected president of the LDP.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese economy bears responsibility for Asia and the
whole world. We hope to convert the minus growth into plus
growth," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also vowed to cut income tax on high-income Japanese
people whose annual income is above 30 million yen (about 210,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives (lower house) is expected to make
Obuchi prime minister on July 30 to replace Ryutaro Hashimoto, who
resigned after the LDP's defeat in the July 12 House of
Councillors election.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said that he would form a powerful party leadership and
cabinet by putting the right people in the right posts.
</P>
<P>
He also said he would appoint a "competent and reliable" person
as finance minister.
</P>
<P>
He said his government hopes that the Diet (parliament) will
pass legislation "as soon as possible" to implement the "bridge
bank" plan to clean up bad debts of the country's failed financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
"The bridge bank scheme is the key to revitalizing the nation's
ailing economy," Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of bridge banks to take over failed financial
institutions is the centerpiece of the government's plans, which,
released on July 2, are aimed at salvaging Japan's financial
system from the bad-loan mess.

<HEADLINE> HK's Foreign Currency Reserves Rank Third in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's foreign currency
assets amounted to 96.5 billion U.S. dollars at the end of June
this year, the latest figure announced by the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) shows.
</P>
<P>
This means that in terms of foreign currency reserves, Hong
Kong remains the third largest in the world after Japan and the
Chinese mainland which were respectively 205.9 billion U.S.
dollars and 140.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the latest official figures released by the HKMA
also show that in the first half of this year, total assets of the
Exchange Fund rose by 3.6 percent from 636.7 billion HK dollars
(81.63 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of December 1997 to 659.5
billion HK dollars (84.55 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of June
this year.
</P>
<P>
The accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, including
minority interests, increased by 6.2 percent from 190.2 billion HK
dollars (24.38 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of December 1997
to 202 billion HK dollars (25.89 billion U.S. dollars) at the end
of June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the figures, Chief Executive of the HKMA Yoseph
Yam said: "The 6.2 percent increase in the accumulated surplus in
a period of volatility, with financial turmoil in Asia, is highly
encouraging."
</P>
<P>
The HKMA considers the investment outlook for the second half
of this year unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
However, it will continue its prudent management of the
Exchange Fund and achieve a fine balance in terms of return, risk
and liquidity, in full compliance with the guidelines set by the
Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, he said.

<P>
BRUSSELS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission Friday
approved the first two projects of the Joint European Venture
program for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

<P>
Key problematic areas were found in the increasing cost for
waste treatment, the lack of interest by some industries in
recycling materials and the lack of market transparency that leads
to low investment.
</P>
<P>
The commissioners proposed harmonizing the test methods and
specifications, analyzing product standards, exploring the
possibility of replacing those dangerous materials and studying
the feasibility of the marking system.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission attaches importance to recycling and
environment in its fifth Research and Development Program that
covers the period from 1999 to 2002 after earlier efforts
materialized in improved recycling in industries.
</P>
<P>
The biggest increase of use of recyclable energies and
materials was recorded by the non-ferrous metal industry with 57
percent, followed by the paper industry at 46 percent, the glass
industry at 45 percent and the ferrous metal industry at 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry, according to figures published by the
commission, posted significant progress in 1997 when its recycling
rate rose to around 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Recover on Stronger Asian Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares recovered from
a morning sell-off to close only marginally lower, thanks mainly
to stronger performance by Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index ended only 3.2 points lower at
2,745.5, well above its opening low of 2,705.3 points which was
struck in early trade following the two percent fall on the Dow
Jones Industrial Average overnight.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 196 points to
about 8,933.
</P>
<P>
But both Japan's Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng defied the
fall in the Dow, and the election of the reportedly market
unfriendly Keizo Obuchi to lead Japan's Liberal Democratic Party,
to close higher.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei closed 174.0 points higher at 16,362.0 and the Hang
Seng climbed off opening lows to an 81.2 point gain to 8,257.4.
</P>
<P>
"The reaction in Japan is promising as it means their local
market seems happy with the likely selection (by Japan's Liberal
Democratic Party) of Obuchi as leader," a Lodge and Partners
broker said.
</P>
<P>
He said the local market had been "saved by the resilience in
Asia today but we are still expecting a further softening on Wall
Street tonight".
</P>
<P>
Overall, 283.8 million shares changed hands worth 961.2 million
Australian dollars (595.94 million U.S. dollars). Falling stocks
outnumbered rising stocks by 617 to 426.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index softened 5.9 to 1,065.1 points and all
industrials index eased 0.8 to 4,826.6 points.
</P>
<P>
The better performers among the leaders included Telstra,
Foster's, National Australia Bank and retail stocks.
</P>
<P>
Telstra surged 10 cents as the market searched for defensive
stocks. Foster's Brewing added five cents after announcing
Thursday its acquisition of Brierley's Austotel chain for 186
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
All of the major banks were firmer apart from ANZ which dropped
44 cents or 3.9 percent, National Australia Bank ended 34 cents
firmer,  Commonwealth climbed 17 cents and Westpac climbed 3.1
cents.
</P>
<P>
The gold index ended steady with a 1.7 point rise to 1,100.5
after gold bullion recovered 80 U.S. cents to 293.60 U.S. dollars
in Sydney trade.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Wishes to See Free, Fair Elections in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) said here Friday
that they wish the forthcoming elections in Cambodia will be
"free, fair, credible and peaceful."
</P>
<P>
The ministers, in their respective statements at the 31st ASEAN
Ministerial Meeting (AMM), also welcomed Cambodia to join the
regional political, economic and security group, hopefully at the
end of this year or next year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nguyen
Manh Cam said that as Cambodia's close neighbor, Vietnam has
followed with keen interest in the developments in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam sincerely hopes that the elections will be successful
and Cambodia would enjoy peace and stability to develop itself and
would soon be admitted to the great ASEAN family," Nguyen said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is also Vietnam's hope that the Sixth ASEAN
Summit to be held at the end of this year in Hanoi, Vietnam, will
translate the ideal of an ASEAN-10 into reality with the admission
of Cambodia as a member.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said his
country wishes to commend all parties in Cambodia, the ASEAN
Troika including Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines and other
parties concerned for their efforts in making the elections
possible.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the successful outcome of a free and
fair election in Cambodia will facilitate the restoration of peace
and political stability in the country, and see Cambodia joining
ASEAN as the 10th member. With all Southeast Asian countries in
together in ASEAN, the vision of ASEAN-10 would be realized and
the whole of Southeast Asia would be marching in tandem into the
next millennium," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said ASEAN, through
the Troika, has helped the Cambodian to put in place a process
that "we all hope will lead to free, fair and credible elections
in Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
"Cambodia will then rightfully take its place as our tenth
member so that ASEAN will embrace all of Southeast Asia as one
single family of nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Indonesia is
watching very closely the political process in Cambodia that will
culminate in the general elections on July 26.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential for the credibility of this process that all
parties have equal access to media and that it is free, fair and
peaceful so that it will lead to the creation of a stable
government that can ensure lasting peace and stability for the
Cambodian people," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Indonesia hopes to welcome Cambodia as a member
of ASEAN this year, saying "this would fulfill our shared vision
of an ASEAN comprising all 10 Southeast Asian countries."
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, the chairman of
the 31st AMM, said ASEAN encourages the Cambodian brothers to take
hold of their future by uniting for a free, fair and credible
election, adding that "their success in that endeavor is success
for ASEAN too."
</P>
<P>
During the 31st AMM, Chem Widhya, Cambodia's permanent
secretary of the Foreign Ministry, introduced Cambodia's
preparations for the elections and the commitment to join ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
"Though not perfect, our preparations hereto have been credited
by a large and critical international audience as being fair," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also thanked all ASEAN member countries for
sending observers to Cambodia for the general elections.
</P>
<P>
This decision and the generous support given by numerous donor
countries to physically enable these elections to take place
constitute a great encouragement for the Cambodian people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"They are perceived as a vote of confidence in the capability
of the Cambodian authorities to hold their first national
elections organized on their own since the signature of the Paris
Peace Agreement in 1991," he said.
</P>
<P>
Laos and Myanmar joined ASEAN last year which then included
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam. ASEAN decided to delay Cambodia's admission due to
the newly-emerged political turmoil inside the country.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Holds Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar held its
ground Friday unfazed by confirmation that Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi had been elected the new leader of Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Despite some initial weakness in both the Japanese yen and the
domestic currency immediately following the announcement, traders
said Obuchi's election had been largely factored in.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed the local session at 61.92 U.S.
cents, from 61.93 here previously.
</P>
<P>
Financial markets had been poised for the news from Japan for
some days, but ANZ Investment Bank head of securities trading
Jeremy Colless said the actual event had provided no surprises.
</P>
<P>
"He was the favorite to win it even if he wasn't the favorite
of markets. Therefore his win has been pretty well priced in,"
Colless said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the Japanese announcement, the currency had spent the
session range-trading in a 61.95 to 62.30 U.S. cent band as it
tracked the yen.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of Obuchi's success pushed the U.S. dollar
back over 141.00 yen from around 140.50.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Australian dollar wobbled around 62 U.S. cents,
dipping to 61.95 and rebounding to 62.20 before settling just
below 62.
</P>
<P>
In the foreign exchange market, the Australian dollar closed at
87.47 yen, from 87.75, and at 1.1056 German marks, from 1.1081.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Government Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Great Hural (parliament) of
Mongolia Friday dismissed Prime Minister Tsakhya Elbegdorj's
government after a voting with 42 for and 33 against the motion,
said the information office of the Great Hural.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary group of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary
Party (MPRP) on July 10 submitted a bill to the Great Hural,
urging the government to resign.
</P>
<P>
They believed that the government's decision in May to merge the
state-owned Renovation Bank into the private Golomt Bank not only
violated the country's constitution and laws but also brought
threat to national economic security and financial policies.
</P>
<P>
MPRP MPs have since then boycotted Great Hural meetings,
paralyzing the parliament for more than 50 days.
</P>
<P>
On July 10, the government took some compromising steps by
making some amendments to the decision, but the MPRP members
rejected them and insisted on the government's resignation.
</P>
<P>
President Nachagyn Bagabandy said Friday that in order to
prevent social instability he would exercise his right as
president to dismiss the parliament and the government, if the
Great Hural could not solve the dispute on the merger.
</P>
<P>
The current cabinet, which was formed in April, is the
shortest-lived in Mongolia's history.

<HEADLINE> Largest Singapore Bank Becomes Larger Through Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Development Bank of
Singapore (DBS), the largest in the country, has acquired the Post
Office Saving Bank (POSBank), the fifth largest in the country, in
a bid to further strengthen its position as the largest Southeast
Asian bank and one of the largest banks in Asia.
</P>
<P>
S. Dhanabalan, Chairman of the DBS, told a press conference
Friday afternoon that the Government of Singapore has accepted the
proposal for the acquisition that combines the largest and the
fifth largest Singapore financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
POSBank's existing business undertakings, including all its
branches and its ATM network, and Credit POSB, will be transferred
as going concerns to DBS and staff of POSBank and its subsidiaries
will cross over to become DBS staff on existing terms of
employment, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the POSBank Tower (under construction) and some equity/bond
investments will be returned to the government, he added.
</P>
<P>
DBS is already Southeast Asia's largest and the 90th largest
bank in the World. The POSBank has been a leader in providing
retail banking services to the Singaporean public in its 26-year
history as a statutory board.
</P>
<P>
After the merger, the DBS and its subsidiaries will have assets
of approximately 93.4 billion Singapore dollars (about 54.94
billion U.S. dollars), customer deposits of approximately 59.3
billion Singapore dollars (about 34.88 billion U.S. dollars), and
shareholders' funds of approximately 9.4 billion Singapore dollars
(about 5.53 billion U.S. dollars), based on the position as at 31
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Following the privatization, the POSBank will operate as a
division within the DBS and continue to service its depositors and
customers without changing its brand.
</P>
<P>
Currently, interest earned on POSBank savings deposits is tax
exempt, the tax exemption will have to be withdrawn as POSBank
will now be part of a commercial entity.
</P>
<P>
S. Dhanabalan said the acquisition provides a number of key
advantages including:
</P>
<P>
-- to strengthen the position of the largest retail banking
business in Singapore;
</P>
<P>
-- to extend domestic market coverage;
</P>
<P>
-- to increase its distribution to over 170 branches and more
than 950 ATMs nationwide;
</P>
<P>
-- to enlarge and diversify its deposit base;
</P>
<P>
-- and to increase economies of scale with greater operational
efficiencies through the integration and rationalization of the
DBS Bank's business.
</P>
<P>
"We view this acquisition as a unique opportunity to strengthen
DBS Bank's market leadership in Singapore, particularly in retail
banking," Dhanabalan said. "The POSBank retail network and brand
are very well known and effective in mobilizing savings, and for
this reason we intend to retain and build on POSBank's established
identity," he added.
</P>
<P>
The merger is in line with Singapore government's policy to
encourage local banks to merge with each other so as to
consolidate the industry and create fewer, but larger and stronger
banks.

<P>
CHONGQING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers in Chongqing
have recovered 164 rare relics that came from the Three Gorges
area during a campaign to stop smuggling through the post office.
</P>
<P>
According to one customs officer, the items were discovered in
16 cases of mail smuggling cases. Some are highly protected items.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Dam is the world biggest water conservation
project and covers large parts of southwestern and central
China. The reservoir will mean inundating many areas along the
Yangtze River, so a search for relics was started.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale excavation work has also led to the discovery
of a large number of relics.
</P>
<P>
And, of course some people have managed to gain possession of
the relics and have tried to smuggle them out of China using
assumed names.
</P>
<P>
So, Customs officers in Chongqing, China's largest city which
is in the southwestern part of the country have tightened their
checks on the mail.

BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- This year's early rice yield is

</P>
<P>
"However, the drop will be marginal," he added.

<HEADLINE> hke072439 -"Flexible Engagement" Causes Controversy Inside ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Most foreign ministers attending
the 31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) expressed here Friday
their strong opposition to the proposed change in ASEAN's policy
from "non-interference" to "flexible engagement."
</P>
<P>
"Flexible engagement," raised by Thailand and supported by the
Philippines, means that when domestic developments in a country
have transboundary effects, other member countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) can give advice to
or press the country to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
"We need stronger engagement among ASEAN and we also need
equally to adapt ourselves to changing times. We must be flexible
in our approach to the tasks at hand while steadfastly adhering to
the long-standing principles for which ASEAN has stood and which
have truly served us well," Thailand Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan reiterated his stance on the "flexible engagement" at the
AMM.
</P>
<P>
However, most ASEAN members are "strongly opposed" to the idea.
</P>
<P>
The principle of non-intervention in each other's internal
affairs has served ASEAN well and should therefore not be
abandoned at this time when ASEAN stood at a cross roads of its
history, Singapore Foreign Minister Shunmugan Jayakumar said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Besides non-interference, other basic principles that shaped
ASEAN's success include sovereign equality and decisions by
consultation and consensus; avoidance of the use of force to
change established governments or an internationally recognized
political order; open economies; and making ASEAN the cornerstone
of each country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
These principles have been tried and proven sound and have
given the direction in which ASEAN should evolve, Jayakumar said,
adding that this is why the "ASEAN Way" was really driven by
process and not by outcome.
</P>
<P>
"They (these principles) have contributed to ASEAN's success in
the past, and will continue to do so in the future. Discarding
them will not make ASEAN stronger. To the contrary, to do so may
imperil ASEAN's future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Non-intervention, however, does not mean indifference to each
other's well-being, Jayakumar added.
</P>
<P>
"The growing web of functional, social, financial and economic
ties that link ASEAN members already impels us to work together,
advise each other and coordinate national policies in many areas.
We can do more of this without abandoning basic principle," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 31st AMM, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi said that non-intervention is the internationally
accepted principle governing relations between states and is
contained in all ASEAN agreements. The principle has served to
maintain the unity within the ASEAN diversity.
</P>
<P>
"To abandon this time-tested principle would set us on the path
towards eventual disintegration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said that the stable political environment and the
positive inter-state relations between ASEAN member countries have
much to the adherence to the principle of non-interference.
</P>
<P>
Under the non-intervention policy, the ASEAN countries have not
only commented and criticized, but also expressed reservations
when necessary, but "we do all this quietly," Badawi said, adding
that "criticizing loudly, posturing adversarially and
grandstanding bring less results and does more harm than good."
</P>
<P>
"I see little benefit in discussing this divisive issue of
interfering in each other's international affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nguyen
Manh Cam also expressed the similar opinion.
</P>
<P>
He said in his statement that in the context of the present
challenges, strengthening ASEAN's time-tested unity and
cooperation has become ever more essential.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's unity has been built upon the basic principles
including non-interference into the internal affairs of one
another and the settlement of differences and disputes by peaceful
means, Nguyen said.
</P>
<P>
He added that these principles have helped ASEAN alive and
thriving and contributed to enhancing relationship with outside
partners, especially dialogue partners.
</P>
<P>
The other ASEAN members -- Brunei, Laos, Indonesia and Myanmar
-- also voiced their opposition to "flexible engagement" before
the ministerial meeting which opened Friday and will close on
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministers Urge Unity to Overcome Economic Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers attending the
ongoing 31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) called for unity and
cooperation among member countries to overcome the economic woes
which have been plaguing the region since July last year.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the AMM open session here Friday, Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said the monetary and financial crisis
that erupted in July last year has led to widespread economic and
social turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis broke out not because of weak economic fundamentals
but because of a drastic slowdown in international trade,
excessive and unhedged private-sector borrowings and shortcomings
of the banking sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that Indonesia, which is one of the hardest-hit
countries in the region, has carried out "far-reaching economic
and financial reforms in order to stem the tide of these
adversities, soften their impact on the vulnerable segments of the
population and restore confidence."
</P>
<P>
Alatas noted that ASEAN countries have shown their solidarity
by providing assistance to one another.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the ASEAN economies will recover
soon enough "as the fundamentals that enabled them to achieve high
growth in the past are still generally in place."
</P>
<P>
"After reforms are implemented and confidence is restored,
ASEAN will emerge leaner, stronger, more open and more
competitive," he declared.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in Asia, touched off by Thailand's
devaluation of its currency, the baht, in early July last year,
has spread through a number of ASEAN member countries, resulting
in drastic devaluation of their currencies, throwing millions of
their people out of work and plunging into recession their
economies, which used to be the fastest growing in the world.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said, "During this crucial
juncture, it is ... vital for us to recommit ourselves to the
cause of ASEAN and to redouble our efforts to strengthen its
cohesiveness and cooperation while at the same time developing
innovative ideas to increase our organization's effectiveness."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Foreign Affairs Domingo Siazon of the Philippines,
which is the chairman of this year's ASEAN meetings, said, "Our
experiences of the past year convince me even more that ASEAN
could achieve greater feats if we can cooperate among ourselves."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavad of Laos, which became a
member of the regional grouping last year, said, "After successive
years of sustained economic growth and prominent ASEAN's role,
Southeast Asia has unfortunately experienced economic
difficulties."
</P>
<P>
"in the face of this turmoil in the present modern
interdependent world today, our member states have intensified
greater cooperation and coordination to address the current
situation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is our conviction that with concerted efforts of the member
states in conjunction with external cooperation, our ASEAN members
will be able to overcome the temporary difficulties so as to help
each member country enjoying a higher plane of development."
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam pointed out that
ASEAN has in its 30 years' history created healthy and strong
fundamentals which form "solid basis for us to overcome temporary
difficulties, maintain the momentum of sustained growth if we are
to bring into full play national and regional resilience, to fully
exploit the existing potentials and build upon the achievements
recorded while drawing up experience from the current crisis."
</P>
<P>
"Closer cooperation will help us overcome the current crisis,
continue to advance on the path toward prosperity," he said.

KAMPALA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police arrested over 40
businessmen and impounded suspected stolen vehicle spare parts at
Kisekka market here Thursday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 2 More Parties Emerge in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Two more political parties emerged
in Nigeria Thursday, as the country is on its way to a new
transition to civil rule process.
</P>
<P>
The People's Democratic Movement (PDM) launched in Lagos is
actually a come-back of the party with the same name formed by
late Major-General Musa Yar'adua, which was denied registration
under the transition program of late military leader General Sani
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The party now has Alhaji Lawal Kaita as its national chairman
and Dubem Onyia as national secretary.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued in Lagos Wednesday after a meeting
aimed at perfecting its strategy under the new dispensation, the
party pledged to cooperate with the government of General
Abdulsalam Abubakar for the success of the transition program.
</P>
<P>
In Port Harcourt, a party known as the New Rivers Forum (TNRF)
was floated by Chief Ebenezer Isokrari, former secretary to the
Rivers State Government and chieftain of the dissolved United
Nigeria Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
Isokrari, announcing the birth of the party at a press
conference and describing himself as the facilitator, said all
the positions in the party were vacant so as to allow credible
persons to vie freely and fairly.
</P>
<P>
The first party formed under Abubakar's new transition program
was the Democratic Advance Movement floated Tuesday in Lagos by
Tunji Braithwaite, a Lagos-based lawyer and politician.
</P>
<P>
Braithwaite was the presidential aspirant of the just
disbanded Gross-roots Democratic Movement (GDM), but the GDM later
chose to have Abacha as its candidate, together with the four
other parties registered by Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The emerge of the three parties followed the announcement of
the new transition program by Abubakar last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar ordered the dissolution of all the political parties
to pave the way for the registration of new parties. He pledged
to hand over power to an elected civilian president on May 29,
1999 after free and fair elections monitered by international
observers.

LAGOS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A German firm known as P.L.E. will

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Urged to Intervene in Angola Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime
Gama has revealed that his government has sent a letter to U.N.
Chief Kofi Annan asking him to intervene in Angolan peace process
so as to avoid the breakout of a new war in the country.
</P>
<P>
Gama revealed Thursday in Sal island, Cape Verde where he is
attending a contact team meeting of the Community of
Portuguese-speaking countries on mediation in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Angola is very urgent and the danger of war
in eminent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The appeal by the Portugal government was made at a time when
Annan has not appointed any new U.S. special envoy to Angola
since the death of Blondin Beye in an air crash in Cote d'Ivoire
at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Lisbon believed that if a new envoy is named to fill in the
sad vacancy emptied by the death of Beye, the peace process in
Angola will be speeded up, said Gama.
</P>
<P>
The political and military situation in Angola is degenerating
in the past few weeks, giving rise to a great possibility for a
large scale armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
The former rebel movement the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) still refused to comply with the
resolution of the U.N. Security Council, thus wearing out the
patience on the part of the Angolan government. And the peace
process in Angola is facing a difficulty more than any other
time.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister suggested that U.N. secretary-general
Annan visit Angola again and get in touch with the signatories of
the 1994 Lusaka Peace Accord which ended the 19-year old civil
war and restore dialog between the Angolan government and UNITA.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that copies of the letter to Annan was also sent
to the United States, Russia and Portugal, the three observer
countries of the Angola peace process as well as to the Angolan
government and UNITA.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Restores Air Link with UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Direct air link between Nigeria and
Britain will resume soon after 14 months' break following an
order to this effect Thursday by the Nigerian Head of State,
General Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar's order with immediate effect was contained in a
statement in Abuja signed by Alhaji Gidado Idris, the Secretary
to the Government of the Federation.
</P>
<P>
Air link between Nigeria and Britain was severed in May last
year, when Britain banned all Nigeria-registered aircraft from
flying into its airspace for their alleged poor safety standards.
Nigeria retaliated immediately by banning all Britain-registered
aircraft from flying into its airspace.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that over 19 billion Naira (about 224 million
U.S. Dollars) was lost in revenue to both sides in the aviation
row. The British Airways, which operated 10 flights to Nigeria a
week, with higher passenger patronage, bigger aircraft and higher
fares, lost even more than its Nigerian counterpart, the Nigerian
Airways.
</P>
<P>
When negotiations between the two sides for the resumption of
air links had failed, the British side reportedly lifted the ban
unilaterally, but the Nigerian government denied its knowledge of
this.
</P>
<P>
The sight of a breakthrough in the row came last Monday, when
Abubakar addressed the nation on his administration's major
policies and expressed the wish to restore air link with Britain,
the U.S. and other nations.
</P>
<P>
According to a media report, British Airways Africa Regional
Manager Andy Stern has said the company will resume operation
next Wednesday with a new Boeing 777 aircraft.

Party (LDP) Friday.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi is expected to be designated prime minister by the House

Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who resigned on July 13
after the LDP's devastating loss in the July 12 House of
Councillors election.
</P>

time of severity. I will do my best for the sake of the party and

<HEADLINE> Economic Improvement In Northern Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The economy in north China's port
city of Tianjin has begun to pick up with increased fixed assets
spending and restructured exports to counter the downturn caused
by the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, local GDP was up 8.79
percent to 60.9 billion yuan, from the same 1997 period, and fixed
assets investment this year is expected to be 15 percent more than
last year, at 42.7 billion yuan, with focus on infrastructure,
housing, technology improvement, and hi-tech development.
</P>
<P>
During the January-June period, the city spent 7.8 billion yuan
on basic construction, 3.1 billion yuan on real estate, and nearly
3.9 billion yuan on technology.
</P>
<P>
The city increased exports to the U.S., Europe, Africa, and the
Commonwealth of Independent States to offset losses caused by the
financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the U.S. went up nearly 44 percent during the first
half of this year, from the same 1997 period, and those to France
up 9 percent and to Italy, 11.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The city had 4.68 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign trade

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese Tourist Spot Promoting Tourism To Offset Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Guilin, the popular Chinese tourist
destination is increasing its tourism promotion to offset the
effects of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Although President Clinton's visit to the city in early July
was good news, the number of overseas tourists fell 19.5 percent,
and income from tourism was down 20.58 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tourism officials say the decline is mainly the result of
24.9 percent fewer Japanese tourists and 80 percent fewer South
Koreans in the first six months. But, they're not too pessimistic
about the future because they believe that business can get over
the slump in the second half with a little effort.
</P>
<P>
Kang Tianbao, Guilin's Vice-mayor in charge of tourism, says
that the city will focus on two countries -- the United States and
Japan -- and on two regions -- Hong Kong and Taiwan. In the past
few months, the city sent four delegations to Japan to promote
tourism.
</P>
<P>
After Clinton's visit, the city drafted a plan to promote the
route followed by Clinton with the cities involved: Xi'an,
Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, television stations in Hong Kong began showing a
documentary on Guilin's tourist activities and recently, the city
invited many Taiwanese media members to visit the city.
</P>
<P>
One good sign is the luxury hotels that have been full since
mid-July, one city official says.

<HEADLINE> 4,000 Australian Students Rally Against Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- About 4,000 Australian
high-school students in Australia's major capital cities of
Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide took to streets Friday in
protest against Pauline Hanson's racism.
</P>
<P>
Waving anti-racism placards and chanting slogans, the students
marched in a nationwide campaign against racism advocated by
Australian federal MP Pauline Hanson.
</P>
<P>
"Migrants are welcome, racists are not" and "Hey hey ho ho
Pauline Hanson has to go," the students in Sydney and Canberra
chanted during the afternoon rallies.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, the biggest industrial and business center in
Australia, an anti-racism rally by up to 2,000 school students
outside Australian Prime Minister John Howard's Sydney office
passed off peacefully Friday.
</P>
<P>
The students chanted slogans outside Howard's office for about
15 minutes before moving on to make speeches at Circular Quay near
the Opera House, Australia's most famous tourism attraction.
</P>
<P>
About 30 police were on hand outside Howard's office and
barricades had been erected in case of trouble, the Australian
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
In Melbourne, the nation's second biggest industrial and
business center, local police estimated 1,200 high-school students
descended on central Melbourne for an anti-racism rally Friday.
</P>
<P>
In Australia's capital city of Canberra Friday afternoon, about
300 students rallied in the city's downtown area and marched along
the city's major avenue Northbourne for about one hour.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 500 students in Adelaide, capital of South Australia
state, rallied against the racist policy of Pauline Hanson in the
city center Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sean Healy, a national walk-out rally coordinator in Sydney,
said in a telephone interview with Xinhua that similar activity
will be held several days later in Brisbane, the third largest
city in Australia, because of school holidays.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Australian government Friday
rejected calls by former prime minister Malcolm Fraser for the
ruling Australian Liberal and National parties to form a
government with the opposition the Labor Party in order to lessen
One Nation's influence in politics.
</P>
<P>
Fraser Thursday predicted the next federal election would
result in a hung parliament, leaving One Nation to wield massive
influence.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Elect New President in October: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's incumbent President Elias
Hrawi has ruled out seeking another term, indicating the
country will hold a presidential election this fall, the Daily
Star newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"President (Carlos) Menem invited me to visit Argentina but I
sent him my apologies because my mandate would have expired by the
time of the visit," Hrawi was quoted as telling a delegation of
members of the Lebanese diaspora in Argentina on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper interpreted Hrawi's remarks as a hint that the
president really wanted to quit the presidency so a new
presidential election is inevitable in October when Hrawi's term
expires.
</P>
<P>
Before this, some lawmakers who had met Hrawi also said that
the president really wanted to have a rest.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi, 72, a Maronite Christian, was elected president in
1989 with Syria's strong backing.
</P>
<P>
When his first term expired in 1996, parliament voted to pass
an one-time constitutional amendment that year, allowing him to
stay on for an extra three-year-and-half term.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats have noted that as his term nearing its end,
all signs pointed to the predication that he would not seek
a third term.
</P>
<P>
Under Lebanon's constitution, the country's top political posts
are equally shared between Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister always comes from Sunni Muslims, the
parliamentary Speaker from Shiite Muslims and the president from
Maronite Christians.
</P>
<P>
Until now, there is no clear contender for the
presidency. Western diplomats said Syria will has the last say in
choosing the new head of state.
</P>
<P>
Syria, with 40,000 troops stationed in Lebanon as
peacekeepers, is a main power broker in the country, which
is recovering from the 15-year-old civil war.

<HEADLINE> China Wants To Add Two World Heritage Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China is cleaning up its most
famous imperial park and sacrificial altar to apply for "World
Heritage" status for them.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO will approve the new group of cultural sites for the
list in December and the Chinese government chose the Summer
Palace and the Temple of Heaven as its applicants this year.
</P>
<P>
It has put nearly 10 million yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars)
into repair work for the Temple of Heaven, according to Lou
Lianju, of the temple administration office. They've torn down all
snack bars around the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests and moved
souvenir shops. They also planted trees throughout the garden
around the temple and the other cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
A new hall will show the ancient praying ceremony to visitors,
Lou said, and the management decided to remove the iron guards on
the Echo Wall's stone steps. The curved wall, which has thousands
of visitors daily, repeats the sound of people's voices.
</P>
<P>
Officials in charge of the Summer Palace in suburban Beijing
have also tried to restore its ancient appearance and workers have
moved snack stalls and power line poles away from central scenic
spots.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO says that the original forms of cultural relics must be
preserved and has special funds for preserving those sites, which
are not to be attacked even in time of war.
</P>
<P>
There are now 552 cultural and natural heritage sites. China's
present sites are the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, the
Zhoukoudian Peking Man Ruins, the Potala Palace in Lhasa, and 15
others.

<HEADLINE> Key Water-Efficiency Project For Northeastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province will build a water saving project using a sprinkler
system on 333,300 ha of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 3.6 billion yuan and be completed in five
years, Provincial Governor Zhang Guoguang says.
</P>
<P>
It will expand the irrigated area in 10 cities and 36 counties
from 30 percent to 44 percent. When completed, the project will
add 1.8 billion kg of grain annually and 2 billion yuan in output
value.
</P>
<P>
The project will also help bring to an end the centuries-old
problem of the weather deciding whether a harvest was a success or
failure, Zhang says.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has a water problem. Its per capita water resources
amount to one third of the national average. Liaoning was hit by 7
serious droughts in the past 5 decades and grain output has been
reduced by as much as 2 to 3.5 billion kg annually since 1978 as a
result of droughts.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Lowers Duty to Help Tackle Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has lowered
duty to a preferential rate of five percent for equipment related
to information technology so as to help institutions to tackle
the millennium bug problem.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae said Thursday the government
has also sponsored a number of seminars on the issue to raise
awareness among the public and private sectors so as to get them
prepared, the Daily Nation reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury has set for itself a target of having its systems
year 2000 compliant by June 30,1999.
</P>
<P>
"This gives us only 49 weeks to implement the changes that
must be put in place by the first day of the new century," said
Nyachae.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the "bug" will have devastating effects on
the economy if corrective measures were not made in an effective
and timely manner.
</P>
<P>
"The millennium bug is seen as a national problem requiring
national attention," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If it is not possible to effectively deal with the problem
within the deadline of December 31 1999, it will be necessary to
put in place standby arrangements and perhaps recovery plans," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Financial Secretary Joseph Kinyua said the government
had set aside 500 million Shillings (some 8.4 million U.S.
Dollars) and full time personnel to tackle the millennium bug by
June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to convert government computer
services, the pension department, and the Kenya Bureau of
Statistics to become year 2000 compliant, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Top Treasury Officials Arrested on Frauds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority
(KACA) has arrested four top treasury officials over alleged
frauds involving more than 230 million Shillings (some 3.9
million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Kenya Revenue Authority Commissioner-General John Msafari,
Commissioner of Customs Samuel Chebii, Financial Secretary Joseph
Kanyi Kinyua, Director of Fiscal and Monetary Affairs Njeru
Kirira and 11 other Customs officials were arrested Thursday,
media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Magistrate Uniter Kidullah said when issuing the arrest
order that the move followed an application by the director of
the Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority (KACA), John Harun Mwau.
</P>
<P>
They were accused of defrauding the government through failure
to tax revenue on sugar and wheat imported from Brazil and
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
They are also to be charged with breaching the public trust by
fraudulently allowing 1,400 tons of uninspected sugar into the
country.
</P>
<P>
Failure to collect tax on illegal sugar imports was a key
complaint by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) when it
suspended a major loan to Kenya in July last year. The IMF has
also asked for reforming KRA.
</P>
<P>
Other IMF demands, agreed with the government in last August,
included the setting up of an independent anti-corruption
authority, reform of the energy sector and investigation of past
abuses of public funds.
</P>
<P>
KACA was set up last December under Mwau, an ex-policeman and
former presidential candidate.

<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China is continuing its effort to
enter the World Trade Organization, according to Hu Zhaoqing, a
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation spokesman.
</P>
<P>
While giving an overview of China's foreign trade and economic
cooperation in the first half of 1998 at a news conference here
today, he pointed to consultations with WTO members like the U.S.,
the EU, Japan, and Canada, and especially the intense talks before
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to China.

<P>
During these talks, he said, the Chinese made several proposals
and there was some progress, but no final arrangement.

reduce China's average industrial tariff to 10.8 percent. This was
another significant effort on China's part to move the negotiation
process forward, Hu said.

JERUSALEM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat
Thursday rejected a request by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
for an immediate summit, with Arafat aides saying talks cannot
resume until Israel accepts the U.S. pullback proposal. Netanyahu
sent Likud coalition chairman Meir Shetrit to meet Arafat to
present the request for holding a summit so that the two leaders
could hammer out remaining differences.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian officials have admitted that they cannot count
on the Clinton administration to press Israel to yield 13 percent
of the West Bank, as originally proposed by the U.S., which rather
urges the Palestinians to compromise with Israel. A PLO
representative in the U.S. said that the U.S. has no alternative
strategy to offer, once its initiative is officially declared a
failure.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli and U.S. officials will conduct joint assessment of
the situation following Iran's missile test Wednesday. Reports
from the U.S. said that the Iran missile missed its target
in the test, but U.S. officials said they expected an
additional test of the Shihab-3 missile to be conducted soon.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh: A Country Vulnerable to Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Flood occurs in Bangladesh almost
every year and incurs heavy losses of both lives and properties
due to the country's particular geographical location and its
climatic features.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is a nation in the Ganges Delta of South Asia. Half
of its 145,000 square kilometers territory which is divided by
experts here into three parts -- the Tertiary Hill in the
southeast, the Pleistocene Uplands in the northwest and the Recent
Plains, is flat alluvial plain below 7.6 meters in elevation.
</P>
<P>
The first two parts, the Tertiary Hills and the Uplands, at
elevations of 305 meters and 9-18 meters respectively, are mostly
flood-free areas, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Recent Plains, consisting mainly of flood plains made up of
continental deposits, deltaic plains built up by both marine and
continental deposits, and the tidal plains composed predominantly
of marine deposits, are all of very low elevation with
considerable areas lying below the 3-meter contour line and all of
them taken together occupy 90 percent of the areas of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has as many as 230 rivers, the majority of which
constituting an interlocking net fall into three river systems -
the Ganges, the Brahmaputra-Jamuna and the Meghna.
</P>
<P>
The river systems shape the daily life of the people and also
bring the perennial threat of flood, according to Dr. A.K.M.
Kafiluddin, a prominent expert in the country.
</P>
<P>
Seventy to 80 percent of the country's annual rainfall
concentrates in the monsoon season, he said, when the rainfall
varies from 89 centimeters in the west to more than 152
centimeters in the northeastern and southeastern parts of
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Heavy monsoon rainfall, coinciding with the flood waters from
the upstreams of rivers and surges in the Bay of Bengal, and
coupled with the location of the major parts of the country at the
lowermost reaches of the three mighty river systems, which drain
vast basins at low altitude, make floods an annual phenomenon
here.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the major parts of the country are vulnerable to
floods due either to overtopping of the river banks by flood
waters as is the case in most flood-affected areas or to
impounding of rain waters in low-lying areas, as is the case of
coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
To reduce flood-caused losses, they said the government should
make long-term plans to deal with possible flooding in the future
instead of merely distributing relief materials.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the experts suggested the construction of upstream
storage dams, embankments and reservoirs in plains for shallow
storage, and channel improvement by dredging rivers.
</P>
<P>
They also proposed measures such as flood preparedness, a
flood-forecasting system, and community-based flood preparedness
activities like evacuation, sheltering, flood fighting,
stock-piling of food and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10 million people have been affected by floods in the
country and 61 have lost their lives since the monsoon season in
the country began early this month, according to officials from
the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Many of those affected have been rendered homeless, as flood
waters have wrecked 29,000 homes, partially damaged 194,000
houses, and ravaged 381,000 acres of standing crops, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The figures may rise further as more rains are expected during
the monsoon season between July and October, weather experts said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has so far sanctioned more than 4
million taka (about 85,000 U.S. dollars) and 2,481 tons of rice or
wheat together with other relief materials for the flood-stricken
population, reports said.

<HEADLINE> China Witnesses Resurgence in Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China reversed the temporary
decline in 1997 with a 5.53 percent rise in pledged foreign
investments to slightly over 24.2 billion US dollars during the
first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Hu Zhaoqing, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), released the figures this morning
at a press conference on the development of China's foreign trade
and economic cooperation in the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of overseas funds actually used stood at 20.45
billion US dollars during that period, down 1.31 percent.
</P>
<P>
The structure of foreign investment further improved with an
increase in large projects and more projects involving European
and American partners. The average investment grew 6.4 percent to
2.5 million US dollars during the period, according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
China approved a total of 314,533 overseas-financed companies
through the end of June, with contracted foreign investment
approaching 545.37 billion US dollars, including some 242.32
billion dollars actually used.
</P>
<P>
Some 60,000 overseas-funded businesses have been canceled or
terminated for various reasons, with 250,000 remaining in
operation, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Hu said China will strive to attract more foreign investment
and noted that MOFTEC will sponsor seven investment
promotion fairs outside the country during 1998 as part of its
effort to attract more companies from Europe and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC's efforts during the latter half of this year will focus
on preparations for the '98 China Investment and Trade Promotion
Fair, said Hu.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say the computer network currently being
installed will offer online.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also accelerate approval procedures for major
foreign investment projects proposed by various localities
provided they comply with existing laws and regulations, according
to Hu.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts will be made to improve the investment
environment and assist existing overseas-financed businesses, said
Hu, adding that the ministry will continue to try to abolish
illicit fees and charges in order to educe burdens on enterprises
and create a better investment environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- More than a hundred tombs found
recently in Yongning County in south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region contain the remains of humans, some of them
dismembered, that date back more than 5,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say that it is strange to find bodies that have
been deliberately dismembered before being buried. The heads of
some were cut off and put into the chest cavity, and arms and legs
were cut off and put at the sides of the tombs.
</P>
<P>
"The tombs represent unique burial customs and are valuable for
the study of pre-historic society and customs in Guangxi and
southeastern Asia," said Fu Xianguo, head of the team that
unearthed the tombs.
</P>
<P>
The 149 tombs have 181 corpses, more than 1,000 relics like
pottery and stone and bone tools. The remains of animals that were
the food of these people were found by the team in a

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Keizo Obuchi is elected as the new
president of the Japanese ruling Liberal Democratic Party Friday
afternoon with 225 votes of the 414 ballots.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, 61, attracted a great deal of attention when as Chief
Cabinet Secretary he gave a news conference to announce Japan's
new era, "Heisei," shortly after Emperor Showa died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi has been elected to the House of Representatives for 12
times since he was first elected to the lower chamber at age of 26
in Gunman Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi advanced his political career in the most powerful
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) faction of former Prime Minister
Kakuei Tanaka, who is known for creating a period of historic
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Obuchi helped Noboru Takeshita set up his new
faction. Takeshita split from Tanaka faction and served as prime
minister from 1987 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
As one of the seven closest aides to Takeshita, Obuchi
succeeded the Takeshita faction and set up his own faction, which
became the largest group within the LDP.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi is very adept at political adjustment and
building a consensus.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi racked up almost no economic experience as state
minister in charge of the Prime Minister's Office under the late
Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira from 1979 to 1980 and chief cabinet
secretary under former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita from 1987
to 1989.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he has focused on LDP business as the party's
secretary general and vice president.
</P>
<P>
As leader of the largest LDP faction, Obuchi tolerated the
fielding of Ryutaro Hashimoto from his camp in 1995 as candidate
for LDP president, a move that earned him the tag of being "nice."
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto and Obuchi are of the same age and they entered the
lower house together in 1963.
</P>
<P>
As foreign minister in Hashimoto's second cabinet, Obuchi
pressed for the signing of a global treaty to ban antipersonnel
land mines, and worked extensively to improve ties with Russia
toward signing a peace treaty by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
While he has earned a good reputation in foreign policy, Obuchi
has yet to build a reputation in domestic affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini Thursday urged Albania to show the "maximum of moderation" in
the current phase of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
He made the request while meeting with visiting Albanian
Foreign Minister Paskal Milo, according to an Italian Foreign
Ministry press release.
</P>
<P>
Dini told Milo that the international community would oppose
"with determination" any enlargement of the Kosovo conflict
involving Albanian territory.
</P>
<P>
He asked his Albanian counterpart to help find possible talking
partners among the ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of
Kosovo to address the international community.
</P>
<P>
Before flying back to Tirana, the Albanian foreign minister
told reporters at the airport that Italy and Albania are committed
to following a common strategy to end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
"For both countries, intervention by NATO forces is only to be
sought if all possible negotiations fail," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Italy and Albania believe a peaceful solution is still
possible in Kosovo, " he added.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, clashes between Serbian security forces and
the armed ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have threatened to spill over
into the neighboring country of Albania, and Serbian defense on
Kosovo's frontier with Albania has been beefed up with mine fields
and other measures to halt the alleged entry of armed men from
Albanian territory. Enitem

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Foreign Ministers Pay Courtesy Call on Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of the nine
member countries of the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) here Friday paid a courtesy call on Philippine President
Joseph Estrada before the opening of the 31st ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting (AMM).
</P>
<P>
Touching on the Asian financial crisis, Estrada told the
ministers that he was heartened that ASEAN had stood by these
challenges and had jointly instituted measures to cushion the
impact of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his support for the various measures taken to
fight the economic and financial crisis, such as the establishment
of the ASEAN monitoring mechanism which is being working out by
the Asian Development Bank and the ASEAN Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he was particularly interested in ASEAN's
concerted action to cushion the impact of the crisis, commenting
Malaysia and the Philippines for entering into an agreement on the
use of their currencies in intra-ASEAN trade.
</P>
<P>
The President also reiterated that his administration was
committed to continuing the market-based economic policies of the
previous Fidel Ramos administration.
</P>
<P>
Estrada added that his government had resolved to adhere to the
original schedule of the Common Effective Preferential Tariff
Reduction, according to which ASEAN must cut its tariffs to less
than five percent by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippines would also adhere to the realization of
the ASEAN Free Trade Area, the full implementation of the ASEAN
Industrial Cooperation and the realization of the ASEAN Investment
Area, three of the most important development and cooperation
projects in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada also emphasized the importance of agreeing

<HEADLINE> 31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting  Opens in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) opened its 31st ministerial meeting here Friday to
discuss a number of issues affecting the region, with Philippine
President Joseph Estrada calling for restoring financial and
economic stability and for a true ASEAN community.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over the opening session, President Estrada called
restoration of financial and economic stability in the region "our
immediate concern."
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN's resilience has been put under severe strain by the
financial crisis sweeping across Asia," he said. "Mothballed
assembly lines and padlocked factory doors tell of real suffering
afflicting our peoples. Millions have already lost their jobs and
so many more are going hungry."
</P>
<P>
Some ASEAN countries, particularly Indonesia and Thailand, have
been hit hard by the financial crisis which broke out in July last
year after their currencies have devalued by a big margin, leading
to bank and factory closures and massive layoffs of workers.
</P>
<P>
Noting that ASEAN governments have taken and continue to take
measures to address the problems, Estrada also urged other
countries to help by achieving economic recovery or providing
greater market access to ASEAN products.
</P>
<P>
But the president stressed that despite the present crisis,
ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, "will move
surely toward greater integration."
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN integration will redound to the benefit of all," he
declared. "And it will only happen if we move together toward
greater total convergence, in our economic life and beyond."
</P>
<P>
He called on member countries to "be open to one another and
freely and candidly exchange views no matter how controversial the
issue." "Only by being open can we truly appreciated what unites
or divides us. Only by talking freely and candidly can we rise and
build and prosper together."
</P>
<P>
Attending Friday's open session are foreign ministers from the
nine ASEAN member countries and Papua New Guinea, an observer
country, and the permanent secretary of the Foreign Ministry of
Cambodia, which also enjoys observer status in the regional
grouping.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day 31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting, foreign
ministers from the member countries are expected to discuss the
ongoing Asian financial crisis and measures to deal with its
social impacts, the forthcoming Cambodian elections, nuclear
proliferation in South Asia, fight against transnational crimes
and other important issues.
</P>
<P>
The AMM is an annual event responsible for the formulation of
policy guidelines and coordination of ASEAN activities.
</P>
<P>
At this year's meeting, the ministers are also expected to
discuss and decide whether there will be a change in ASEAN's
policy from "non-interference" to "flexible engagement."
</P>
<P>
Thailand raised the idea of "flexible engagement," which means
that when domestic developments in a country have had positive or
adverse effects on other ASEAN nations, these nations can give
advice to or press the said country to solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, ASEAN's rotating chairman this year, supports
the new proposal. However, all the other ASEAN members are opposed
to the idea.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar made it clear earlier
that "there is no need to change the principle of
non-interference," which he described as "a well-tested principle
which has served ASEAN well."

<HEADLINE> Flood Affects More People in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- More Bangladeshi people have been
affected by flood as the water levels of major rivers in the
country are still on the rise submerging more areas.
</P>
<P>
About one in every 12 people of Bangladesh's over-120 million
population has been affected by flood since the monsoon season
began in the country in early July, and the death toll from flood
rose to 61 as of Thursday night, according to press reports.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's 64 districts, 54 have been affected, with
standing crops on 381,000 acres of land ravaged, 29,000 homes
wrecked and 194,000 houses partially damaged by monsoon floods,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,100 heads of cattle were missing, 1,274 kilometers of
roads and 1409 kilometers of embankments were damaged by flood.
</P>
<P>
District administrations of affected areas were still assessing
the extent of losses, the reports said. "A clear picture is
expected within a few days," a Relief Control Room officials said.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the Army had been placed on alert as part
of the contingency measure to carry out sudden evacuation
operations in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government has so far sanctioned more than 4 million (about
85,000 U.S. dollars) and 2,481 tons of rice or wheat together with
other relief materials for the flood-stricken population.
</P>
<P>
The flood situation might worsen in central Bangladesh as
rivers in the region continued to rise above their red marks,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Seventy to 80 percent of the country's annual rainfall
concentrates in the monsoon seasons between May and September,
which, combined with its particular geographical features, often
causes flood, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Rainy Season May Delay 2002 World Cup by Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korean soccer officials said
Friday they will coordiante with co-host Japan in the timing of
the 2002 World Cup finals as its rainy season may halt the flow of
the quadrennial sports extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Football Association admitted that it is likely to
reschedule the timing as its rainy season could cause problems if
the World Cup finals sticks to its normal time in June and July.
</P>
<P>
But, there was no formal request to be put forward to the
sport's world governing body FIFA to postpone the tournament to
September or October, and the topic was only raised informally
during the last edition in France last month.
</P>
<P>
The Korean official who requested anonymity, said South Korea
and Japan will jointly decide the timing of the event by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The schedule has to be submitted to FIFA by May 15 next year.
</P>
<P>
"It is true we will discuss the possibility of rescheduling
games since it will be the rainy season here, but there are lots
of factors that have to be considered," he said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem will be rescheduling the leagues in Europe
and South America. Besides, South Korea will also host the Asian
Games in Pusan in late 2002.
</P>
<P>
"Rain is a problem in the June-July season, but we have to
consider may other factors. At the moment, we don't even know
ourselves if the games should be rescheduled or not."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official said that South Korea was in no mood to
back out of the tournament despite its economic crisis although
the host cities may be reduced from 10 to six.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China's world champions Sun
Shuwei and Tian Liang took the highlight of the day when they
outdived the other world big names with a huge margin to win the
men's 10-meter platform synchronized gold medal at the Goodwill
Games here Thursday.
</P>

day's another gold was grabbed by Irina Lashko of Russia in the
women's one-meter springboard.
</P>

a total of 344.64 points for the gold.
</P>
<P>

Varlamov and Igor Loukashin of Russia in their last actions,
edging the European runners-up for the silver, with a score of
308.10 to the Russian pair's 304.98.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The Mexico duo put up a brilliant performance on their last
outing, napping the Russians by three points.

the dives. I think our last dives deserved that high score," Sun
said.

the individual platform. I will try my best to do that," Tian
claimed after winning the first gold for China at the Games.

somersaults in pike - which brought her the highest score of 60.48.
</P>

during the competition. My favorite dive was my fifth dive. The
facility is nice but the air and pool temperature is cold."
</P>
<P>
Guo, 16, said: "I am happy about the silver finish. I hope I
can do better in the other events."
</P>
<P>

world championships, stepped out of the shadow of the tragic

<HEADLINE> EU Hails SAARC As Opportunity To Ease Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has hailed the
up-coming summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) in Colombo later this month as an opportunity
to ease tensions in the region, official Daily News reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The head of delegation of the European Commission here
Ambassador Ilkka Uusitalo Thursday said the summit comes at an
important time for the South Asian region and, if it is to be well
used, can provide an opportunity for the leaders of the region to
ease tensions and to take constructive steps in the regional
integration process in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC charter does not allow bilateral matters to be taken
up at summit but they can be discussed informally on the sidelines
of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of India and Pakistan are expected to meet on the
sidelines of the SAARC summit to discuss ways of breaking the
deadlock in their talks due to various differences including the
Kashmir issue. Relations of The two nations have become more tense
following their nuclear tests in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador pointed out that the European Union supports the
efforts of the South Asian countries to strengthen their regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Though we are not suggesting any specific form or model for
such cooperation, in general terms we consider that such a
cooperation, the same way as it has been in Europe, would be
beneficial also for the countries and people in the South Asian
region", the newspaper quoted the ambassador as saying.
</P>
<P>
The coming year may also provide an opportunity to forge closer
links with the EU and the SAARC, said the ambassador, adding that
there is already a memorandum of understanding between the
European Commission and the SAARC secretariat and both would hope
that concrete actions could be taken based on that memorandum.

<HEADLINE> Study Raises Doubt Over Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jardine Fleming Thanakom Securities said in a study revealed
Friday that at least 1.124 trillion baht (25 billion U.S. dollars)
is required for the privatization of corporations listed on the
Stock Exchange of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Korn Chatikavanij, managing director of the institute, said
the corporations stand very little chance in meeting
recapitalization targets amid the present liquidity crunch.
</P>
<P>
After the baht floated on July 2 last year, debt to equity has
increased from 100 percent to 250 percent at the moment, with the
baht at 40 to 41 to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
This could be a big burden for the government which earlier
made a commitment with foreign creditors to guarantee all private
sector debts.
</P>
<P>
Currently, corporations, especially financial institutions,
can only absorb damages up to 6.6 percent as most firms have run
up 30-35 percent of non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
Korn suggested that both local and foreign creditors reach a
compromise on some of the loans to Thai firms to help them survive
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In addition, capital inflow through foreign direct investment
to Thailand remained lower than expected, accounting for only 12
percent of total new capital required, compared with 93 percent in
Malaysia and 42 percent in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Piyasvasti Amranand, secretary general of the National Energy
Policy Office (NEPO), said the study reflects a need for the
government to set clear measures in the privatization plan.
</P>
<P>
For the energy sector, NEPO expects to gain 100 billion baht
(2.5 billion dollars) from selling shares of companies, including
the government's stake in Esso (Thailand). Next year, the
government will privatize the Ratchaburi power plant project and
Bangchak Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
Piyasvasti, however, said the new capital is insufficient to
help reduce the burden, and the government has to accelerate the
privatization process of other state units including Thai Airways
International and Telephone Organization of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the privatization process cannot solve the
country's financial problems, so the government has to improve
exports while corporations have to rush into debt restructuring.

gathered in Sintra for two days to discuss protection for the
great variety of marine life, to reduce the discharge of
radioactive waste from nuclear companies, and to properly
dismantle decommissioned old oil rigs.
</P>
<P>
The dismantling of 40 of the largest offshore installations,
each weighing more than 10,000 tons, will depend on a case-by-case
technical feasibility study, the ministers said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The declaration on reducing discharges of radioactive waste to
close to zero by 2020 was believed one of the achievements in the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The Sintra Declaration, signed by the 15 member countries of
the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the
Northeast Atlantic, was described as of great significance in
reducing marine pollution.
</P>
<P>
The convention became effective on March 25. The two-day Sintra
conference was the first ministerial meeting of the organization;
it ended Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Airport Resumes Full Service in Catania, Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The airport of Fontanarossa in the
Sicilian city of Catania, Italy, has resumed full service from
1:00 pm Thursday after temporary closure due to the volcano ashes
fallen on the runways.
</P>
<P>
Vitreous ashes produced by a volcano eruption of Mount Etna
fell on the runways and forced the airport to close at 10:00 pm
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The Sicilian volcano intensified its activity early Wednesday
afternoon and by Wednesday evening the runways were already
covered by a fine glossy dust which could have caused problems for
airplane landing and taking off.
</P>
<P>
The local volcanology institute said that the activity of Mount
Etna was a temporary phenomenon and should not be a cause of
concern.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, hundreds of similar eruptions on Mount
Etna were registered by the centre.
</P>
<P>
Experts there said that although such activity indicates that
the volcano is active, it is not a sign of an imminent full scale
eruption.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Blames Economic Woes on Outside Factors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) has blamed outside factors such as transformation
in the global financial system for the economic woes which have
been plaguing the region since July last year.
</P>
<P>
"Much of the storm that has ravaged ASEAN's economies
originated outside the region," said ASEAN Secretary-General
Rodolfo Severino in a report to the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting
(AMM) which began here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the light of the transformation in the global
financial system wrought by globalization and abetted by massive,
uncontrolled and lightning-fast capital movements, moves are being
made to draw up a new architecture for the international financial
system.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN would do well to ensure that it makes a collective
contribution, the product of deep and rigorous thought and
discussion, to this new architecture," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise," he warned, "others will be deciding, once again,
the economic destiny of Southeast Asia, to the peril of the region
and its people."
</P>
<P>
Severino pointed out that at the heart of ASEAN's concern is
the impact of the financial and economic crisis on its people's
lives, particularly in terms of their livelihood and employment.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the loss of jobs and a general reduction of
purchasing power, he said, the incidence of poverty has gone up in
many countries and in some, health care has been impaired, food
shortages have arisen and children have been forced to drop out of
school. "This has enormous implications for the future," he
declared. "Unless this trend is reversed rapidly, the significant
gains achieved by ASEAN economies during the past two decades
could be negated very quickly."
</P>
<P>
Some members of ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam, used to be the fastest growing economies in the world
before the financial crisis hit the region.
</P>
<P>
Severino called for efforts to obtain more funds and assistance
for these countries to address the impact of the crisis, including
active ASEAN involvement in the use of funds from the World Bank
and the Asia-Europe meeting fund.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the use of ASEAN currencies for the settlement of
intra-ASEAN trade, the ASEAN secretary-general said the modalities
for carrying this out are to be agreed upon between the trading
partners concerned and are currently being worked out between
Malaysia and the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia, Malaysia and
Thailand as well as Indonesia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The use of local currencies to settle trade between ASEAN
members was first proposed by Malaysia to reduce dependence on the
U.S. dollar after regional currencies suffered heavy devaluation
during the financial crisis and the proposal later won the support
of finance ministers of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
However, Severino made it clear that "this is not about a
single ASEAN currency. It is not a panacea. But it should help
relieve the pressure on ASEAN countries to obtain hard currency,
encourage them to trade with one another and stimulate economic
activity in general."
</P>
<P>
He urged that ASEAN should expedite the process of concluding
the necessary bilateral payments arrangements between member
countries and of devising measures to encourage ASEAN traders to
use ASEAN currencies in the settlement of their trade between
themselves.

<HEADLINE> FIVB Opposes Bribery in Volleyball Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- FIVB president Ruben Acosta said Thursday that
his organization was concerned on the bribery allegations and would pursue
necessary actions should on-going investigations justified the accusations.
</P>
<P>
In a statement from Lausanne about the recent allegations of bribery
concerning the 1993 World Grand Prix match between Japan and Germany in Chinese
Taipei, Acosta said "we have just heard of these reports. Of course, FIVB is
totally against such practice which would violate all principles attached to
our sport."
</P>
<P>
The volleyball president said "primary evidence shows there seems to be no
truth to these rumors, and the Japanese Volleyball Association is conducting a
full investigation with our support."
</P>
<P>
"We will take the necessary action if these allegations prove to be true and
equally we will also act against those responsible for spreading malicious
stories should the allegations be proved false," Acosta said.
</P>
<P>
"These latest incidents may be a new episode of an organized series of
undeserved attacks on the integrity of the Japanese Volleyball Association, and
FIVB has full confidence in the outcome of this affair," he said.
</P>
<P>
The article originally published in the July 17th edition of the Japanese
newspaper Sankei Shimbun claimed that the coach of the 1993 Japanese women's
Grand Prix team offered their German opponents 1 million Yen (7,140 US dollars)
to throw their match in Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The accused Japanese coach has denied the allegations, as has his German
counterpart.

BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China made considerable progress

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana on Thursday urged the conflicting parties of Kosovo to sit
down and talk, suggesting that NATO may force them to quit
fighting otherwise.
</P>
<P>
Now they have the last chance to do it, Solana,
ending his two-day visit to Macedonia, said at a joint press
conference with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov in Ohrid near
the Albania-Macedonia border.
</P>
<P>
Crisis in Kosovo could only be solved through political and
diplomatic means, said Solana.
</P>
<P>
But, he added, NATO may take measures to force the conflicting
parties to stop if necessary, without making clear what
measures NATO might take.
</P>
<P>
It's not NATO's business to find a permanent settlement to the
Kosovo crisis, Solana noted, but NATO must make efforts to help
find a political solution.
</P>
<P>
If NATO has to act, Solana said, its task is to stop the
fighting, but it will not act from Macedonia's territory.
</P>
<P>
Solana and President Gligorov both spoke highly of the good
relations between the Republic of Macedonia and NATO, and the
latter re-expressed his country's desire to join the
organization.

WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States has named its
squad for the World Basketball Championship in Greece next month,
but none of the NBA big names was included in the roster.
</P>
<P>
As the previous NBA Dream Teams always won the gold medal with
ease, the current team of NBA dreamers face tough challenges from
their European counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"With this team you're playing to win and nobody expects us to

Tomjanovich has reduced his squad from 15 members to 12 on
Thursday and would play their last exhibition game on Saturday
against Italy before proceeding from Rome to Greece on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The new squad of no-names was triggered off by the labor
dispute between NBA stars and the league, and will rely on their
moves on offence and pressure on defence to exploit their
athleticism, said the coach.
</P>
<P>
However, Tomjanovich, coach of two-time NBA champion Houston
Rockets, declined to name his five starters and intended to use
all 12 players as "all these guys are pretty close in talent."

<HEADLINE> Export Increase Makes Up for China's  Losses in Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua)-- China's exports to the United
States and other continents have surged in the first five months
this year, a high-ranking official with the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC) said this morning.
</P>
<P>
Hu Zhaoqing, spokesman for the MOFTEC, said that the
achievements, a result of the strategy of market diversification,
have worked effectively to secure an export growth for the first
half of 1998, "making up in part for the country's losses caused
by the Asian financial crisis".
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remark at a press conference sponsored by the
MOFTEC to provide an overview of China's foreign trade and economic
cooperation in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, between January and May, China's
exports to the European Union (EU) rose by 25.5 percent, to the

respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The growth rates are all above those of last year," said Hu,
adding that the MOFTEC has also stepped up efforts to diversify
the sources of foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, contractual foreign investments from
the EU grew by 86.64 percent and those from the United States by
80.85 percent during that period.
</P>
<P>
China's balance of payment is in good shape, and its foreign
exchanges reserves continued to rise during the first half of this
year, when imports and exports totaled 151.4 billion U.S. dollars,
up 5.2 percent from the same period 1997.
</P>
<P>
Of this, exports stood at 87 billion U.S. dollars and imports
at 64.4 billion U.S. dollars, up 7.6 percent and 2.2 percent

spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation, said this morning.
</P>
<P>
China had signed 808 contracts on import and export of
technology, valued at 5.78 billion U.S. dollars by the end of
June, according to the spokesman, who released the figure at a
press conference to give an overview of the country's foreign
trade and economic cooperation in the first half of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Develop Weed Killer-Proof Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed
a type rice that is not affected by weed-killer through gene
splicing.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Institute of Rice injected altered genes
into rice to develop the new strain, and then tested the shoots
against weed killer that killed all the weeds while the rice
remained unharmed.
</P>
<P>
Because of the use of direct seeding techniques on China's 2
million hectares of rice paddies, weeds are increasingly becoming
a headache for farmers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show 15 billion kilograms of grain going to waste
each year because of weeds and 2 to 3 billion working days spent
annually just getting rid of weeds from the farmland.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in various parts of the world have already used
similar gene splicing on corn, rapeseed, and soybeans.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Launch Debt Restructuring Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's central bank plans to
launch the Indonesian Debt Restructuring Agency (INDRA) on August
3 to help restructure corporate debt and lend support to the
beleaguered rupiah, the Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
INDRA would target 2,000 indebted local companies which
together owe 64 billion U.S. dollars to foreign creditors, Bank
Indonesia (BI) Director Dono Iskandar told reporters at the
central bank's office here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate aim of INDRA is to reduce pressure on the rupiah
by reducing the U.S. dollar demand of private-sector corporations.
</P>
<P>
"The more companies that join INDRA, the stronger the rupiah
will become. If the rupiah strengthens then most of our economic
problems, like food, electricity and fuel subsidies, will be
automatically solved," Dono said.
</P>
<P>
INDRA, set up under a debt rescheduling agreement reached in
Frankfurt, Germany, is a government institution under the
supervision of the central bank. The agreement was signed by BI
and 13 foreign banks on June 4.
</P>
<P>
Dono acknowledged that many Indonesian companies became
technically unable to repay their debt when the rupiah fell
sharply early this year. It is now hovering at around 14,000
rupiah to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, he was still optimistic that Indonesian companies
would join the debt plan, noting that otherwise they would be
declared bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
According to BI, Indonesia's total overseas obligations were
comprised of 54.4 billion U.S. dollars in long-term government
debt and 83.6 billion U.S. dollars in debt belonging to the
private sector and state-owned companies.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Trade Companies Benefitting From Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Shangri-la Hotel is a
major residence for visiting foreign businessmen, but few people
know that its largest stake-holder is Minmetals Development
Co. Ltd., China's largest mineral and metals exporter.
</P>
<P>
The company is also the second largest stockholder of Xiamen
Tungsten Company, the world's largest tungsten manufacturer. Since
it was listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in May 1997, the
company has invested 624 million yuan raised on the stock market
in various areas.
</P>
<P>
Last year, it did 1.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of import and
export business and had domestic sales of 1.3 billion yuan and 230
million yuan in profits.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Board Miao Gengshu explains that issuing shares
has contributed to this development.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more Chinese companies have been listed on the
stock market and more are expected to do so to raise funds and
increase their competitiveness. One government plan calls for at
least one foreign trade company from each province, municipality
or ethnic autonomous region issuing stocks by the year 2000,
according to Liu Shan, Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The first year for a foreign trade company to issue shares was
1993. Now, 19 Chinese foreign trade companies have been listed on
the stock market where they have raised more than 4 billion yuan,
most of which has been put into areas encouraged by the government
like agriculture, communications and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese foreign trade companies used to be regarded
as 'foreign currency earners'," Liu says, "but now they are asked
to be profit-makers."
</P>
<P>
All these listed companies are doing better on average than the
700 listed Chinese firms and many have expanded their business at
low cost and are getting an increasingly large share on the
capital market.
</P>
<P>
Some local analysts say that listing the companies demonstrates
the trade sector's ability to grow by changing from the previous
exports and imports, even though the numbers are still small. The
analysts say that the stock market should be looked at by more
foreign trade companies.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 10,000 foreign trade companies, which did
325 billion U.S. dollars worth of imports and exports in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Australian Scientists Declare World-First Cell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A team of Australian scientists
announced here Friday that they have achieved a world-first
advance by describing the structure of a vital receptor found on
the surface of the body cells of all animals, including humans.
</P>
<P>
"The discovery, reported in this week's issue of the
international scientific journal Nature, has major implications
for our understanding of the mechanism behind growth and
development, and diseases such as diabetes and many forms of
cancer," the Commonwealth Scientific, Industrial Research
Organization (CSIRO), Australia's leading research body, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The team's goal was to understand the atomic structure of a
particular family of receptors, sites on the cell surface which
detect chemical messengers such as insulin, insulin-like growth
factor (IGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), CSIRO said.
</P>
<P>
Receptors are vital links in the body's command chain.
Messenger chemicals like hormones and growth factors attach and
switch on their special receptor, which in turns commands the cell
to perform particular tasks, such as to grow or to process sugar.
</P>
<P>
CSIRO described the team as the first in the world to clarify
the structure of the half of the IGF receptor, marking a major
scientific milestone in a field of research that has been running
since the late 1960s when the 3 dimensional structure of insulin
was determined.
</P>
<P>
"The IGF, insulin and EGF receptors are all in the same family
and their structures are expected to be 90 percent similar, so
understanding the crystal structure of the IGF receptor helps us
to understand most of the structure of all three," explained Colin
Ward of CSIRO Molecular Science.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ward and Tom Garrett of the Biomolecular Research
Institute in Melbourne led the team.
</P>
<P>
"IGF is important to the body's normal growth and development,
but when it gets out of control it can also cause the growth of
cancer cells".
</P>
<P>
"We hope this work in time will lead to a better understanding
of ways to control certain cancers," Ward said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's LDP to Elect New President Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 24 Kyodo - Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) is set to elect a new president Friday afternoon with
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi taking the lead over two other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The new LDP president is expected to replace outgoing Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who announced his resignation
July 13 after the LDP's devastating defeat in the July 12 House of
Councillors election.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, 61, is believed to have secured the backing of about
200 of the 414 eligible voters, including his own 92-member
faction, and more than half the members of three key groups within
the LDP.
</P>
<P>
The other two candidates in the race are former chief cabinet
secretary Seiroku Kajiyama and Health and Welfare Minister
Junichiro Koizumi.
</P>
<P>
Voting by secret ballot will take place at 14:00 local time
(0500 GMT) at the LDP's headquarters in Tokyo. The eligible voters
comprise 367 LDP Diet (parliament) members and 47 prefectural
representatives of the party's local branches.
</P>
<P>
If none of the candidates wins a majority, or 208 votes, in the
first round of voting, a run-off ballot will take place between
the top two candidates.
</P>
<P>
Kajiyama, 72, and Koizumi, 56, hope to prevent Obuchi from
winning a majority in the first round of voting, thus ensuring a
second ballot.
</P>
<P>
Kajiyama left the Obuchi faction after declaring his
candidacy. He is favored by some Japanese business leaders who
believe he can lift Japan out of its economic slump.
</P>
<P>
Koizumi is fielded by the second largest bloc in the LDP,
headed by former Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka. Koizumi is
supported by many of the LDP's younger lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
If Obuchi fails to secure a majority in the first round, a
Koizumi-Kajiyama alliance is unlikely, assuring Obuchi of victory
in a runoff, LDP sources said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines to Meet Creditors On Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) will meet
with its creditor-banks Friday to discuss the impact of the
employees' strike on the recovery program being drafted for the
beleaguered and debt-ridden airline.
</P>
<P>
Perfector Yasay, chairman of the Philippine Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC), said the meeting with creditor-banks
will push through Friday due to its critical importance. Yasay is
heading a three-member hearing panel handling the rehabilitation
case of PAL.
</P>
<P>
"We have to meet so that we can discuss the viability of
rehabilitating Philippine Airlines," Yasay was quoted as saying by
the newspaper Today.
</P>
<P>
He added that the SEC will have to study carefully the impact
of the two-day strike launched by PAL ground crew Wednesday as the
PAL management has expressed a desire to shut down its operations
if it continues to post huge losses.
</P>
<P>
The SEC will have no other alternative but to allow the airline
to close down as long as the creditors agree to its decision, he
said.
</P>
<P>
PAL, the national flag carrier which has been making losses
during the past 12 years, has a total of 85.1 billion pesos in
liabilities, including capital leases, long-term debt, accrued
expenses, short-term debt.
</P>
<P>
PAL has asked the SEC to grant it a 60-day extension of the
deadline for a viable rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
The PAL Employees Association (PALEA) went on a nationwide
strike early Wednesday morning as talks with the management being
mediated by the labor department bogged down.
</P>
<P>
The union is demanding the management re-hire 5,000 employees
who were fired last month under a downsizing program.
</P>
<P>
The PAL management was forced to massively downsize its
operations to survive an indefinite strike staged by its
625-strong pilots' union on June 5. The crippling pilots' strike
lasted 22 days, plunging the already financially-troubled airline
into a deeper financial crisis.

MADRID, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A forest fire in northeastern Spain
has caused at least 120 million U.S. dollars in loss, preliminary
statistics said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The fire began in the Catalonia Autonomous region, central
Barcelona, last Saturday afternoon, due to the dry and hot
weather, and spread to 27,000 hectares of forests.
</P>
<P>
The fire is now under control, but it is still possible for its
reigniting because of the weather condition.

<HEADLINE> Return on Investment at Indonesian State Firms Below </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The average return on investment
in the 160 Indonesian state companies was only 2.68 percent, a
minister was quoted by local press Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the state companies get a return below the cost of
capital and their contribution to the state's earnings is very
small," Minister for the Empowerment of State Enterprises Tanri
Abeng told members of the House of Representatives Commission V
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the low returns were one of the three main
obstacles faced by his ministry in restructuring state firms.
</P>
<P>
"The second is the resistance of management to privatization
and the third is the monetary crisis, which is causing financial
problems for state firms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abeng gave as an example the losses suffered by the state
electricity utility PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) as a result
of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The company booked a net profit of 1.2 trillion rupiah (120
million U.S. dollars) in 1996, but last year it recorded losses of
0.6 trillion rupiah and its position worsened in the first
semester of this year with reported losses of 6.5 trillion rupiah
(650 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"If we do nothing about it, the losses will be 14.7 trillion
rupiah (1.47 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of the year...
That's why the board of directors at PLN must be replaced," Abeng
said.
</P>
<P>
PLN's largest problem is that it agreed to buy too much
electricity from independent power producers at inflated rates.
That has left it with a power glut. It also agreed to pay in U.S.
dollars, even though it sells all its electricity in rupiah, the
minister added.

<HEADLINE> Kluivert Unlikely to Transfer from AC Milan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 23 (Xinhua) -- AC Milan vice president said that
Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert is unlikely to transfer to either
Manchester United or Arsenal on a 21 billion lire (12 million US
dollars) bid.
</P>
<P>
Adriano Galliani said Thursday that his club may agree on
Kluivert's move to a non-Italian club, but only on a higher
transfer fee.
</P>
<P>
"With bids at 12 million dollars, Kluivert is not going to
leave AC Milan," Galliani commented on reports that Manchester
United was bidding for the young Dutch forwad.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Milan rejected bids for Kluivert made by
Premiere League champion Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Kluivert and AC Milan had agreed to part away after the
22-year-old star had a disappointing show in his first season in
the Italian Serie A.
</P>
<P>
However his impressive performances with the Netherlands in the
World Cup have prompted second thoughts on the Italian side.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Providing Jobs In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The private sector of Shanghai,
China's major economic power house, has provided jobs for
152,000 workers who were laid off at state-owned enterprises over
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
This is seen as something that is very helpful for reforms of
state companies and for social stability.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has one of the strongest private sectors in China,
with over 60,000 individually-owned companies (employing fewer
than 8 people) and 156,000 private enterprises (employing 8 or
more).
</P>
<P>
The sector may become an important place for unemployed people
to find work because of new government policies allowing people
who have been laid off to open private businesses and because of
tax cuts.

<HEADLINE> Japan's LDP to Elect President on Friday Afternoon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Liberal Democratic Party's
election for the next president will be on Friday in the
auditorium of LDP headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The results of the first vote are scheduled to be announced at
around 14:50 local time (0550 GMT). If there is a winner, he will
immediately make a brief speech to party members and then hold a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
If there is no majority, the first and second place candidates
go straight into a runoff. A winner of the runoff is likely to be
declared, and he will make a brief speech to the party and then
hold a news conference at around 17:00 local time.
</P>
<P>
There are 414 people who will vote in the election -- 263 LDP
lower house members, 104 LDP upper house members and 47 LDP
provincial representatives. A majority of 208 is needed.
</P>
<P>
Provincial representatives can either deliver their votes in
person or vote by absentee ballot.
</P>
<P>
Parliament is expected to designate a new prime minister on
July 30.
</P>
<P>
Former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, Health and
Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi are competing for the post.
</P>
<P>
Among the three competitors, Obuchi is thought to be the most
promising candidate for the next LDP president.
</P>
<P>
Jiji Press said Obuchi will cancel his planned trip for the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum in
Manila on Monday, since he is anticipating a victory and is now
busy preparing a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Of the parliament members, 91 belong to the Obuchi faction, 87
to the Mitsuzuka faction, 83 to the Miyazawa faction, 62 to the
former Watanabe faction and 17 to the former Komoto
faction. Others do not belong to any faction.
</P>
<P>
The LDP president is almost certain to become the next prime
minister to replace Ryutaro Hashimoto because the party holds a
majority in the more powerful lower house of parliament. Under
Japan's constitution, the winner of the lower house vote for prime
minister becomes the premier even if the upper house selects a
different person.
</P>
<P>
Japanese stocks opened lower Friday morning before the LDP
presidency voting began. The key Nikkei stock average fell 49.55
points, or 0.3 percent, to 16,138.46 in the first 15 minutes of
trading.

<HEADLINE> Paralyzed Chinese Gymnast Able to Extend Her Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Sang Lan, a 17-year-old Chinese
gymnast, was able to flex her elbows and extend her arms this
evening, but still had no feeling below her uper chest and was
unlikely to walk again.
</P>
<P>
Sang, who suffered a severe spinal injury while performing a
routine warm-up vault at the Goodwill Games Tuesday night,
remained in guarded condition, according to doctor Vincent Leone,
an orthopedic spinal surgeon who treated the gymnast at the Nassau
County Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
Doctors realigned her spinal cord and began treatment with
corticosteroids Tuesday night, Leone said. He told the press that
treatment was expected to begin with an experimental drug in an
attempt to regenerate damaged nerves.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Dawei, a doctor of the medical center who is acting as the
interpreter for Sang, told Xinhua that the surgery plan had
already worked out, and the operation date was settled for
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Sang's parents will arrive here Friday night, but Zhao Yuxin,
leader of the Chinese gymnastics team, had gotten the approvement
from Sang's parents to sign her name on the surgery form at the
medical center. That means the surgery can be carried out before
the arrival of Sang's parents.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou, a post picture has been put on the wall of
Sang's room. All the gymnasts attending the Games have signed
their names and prayers for Sang.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see Sang weep or cry these days," Zhou said. "The
first question she asked when she saw team leader Zhao was 'Can I
return to competitions in future?'"
</P>
<P>
Sang is the only child for her parents, who are ordinary
workers in a small city with a total monthly earning about 150
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese gymnastics team, Sang has received
some financial donations in the past two days from American
people. "We are so grateful for what American people have done for
Sang Lan," exclaimed Zhao. She also told Xinhua that Sang will
remain at the medical center to receive further treatment after
the Games.
</P>
<P>
Leone said Sang will undergo surgery to fuse her damaged
vertebrae and implant metal stabilizers. He called her injury
"devastating" and "violent", and said it was too early to give an
accurate prognosis about Sang's future.
</P>
<P>
While he said that some improvement could be expected in her
upper extremities, he added: "I really can't comment on her lower
extremities."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he thought Sang would be able to walk eventually,
Leone said: "You'd be surprised. I'm still going to say unlikely,
but I'm very optimistic."
</P>
<P>
Sang's catastrophic injury again raised questions about the
safety of gymnastics, and of the vault in particular. In the past
decade, the aparatus has produced three injuries that have left
gymnasts paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
Julissa Gomez, an American, broke her neck while attempting a ba
ckward handspring on the horse in 1988, and died from
complications three years later.
</P>
<P>
Adriana Duffy, who competed for Puerto Rico, was confined to
wheelchair after 1989 vaulting accident.
</P>
<P>
Another catastrophic gymnastics injury was suffered by Elena
Moukina, the 1978 world all-around champion from the former Soviet
Union, who was paralyzed in 1980 after an accident during a
tumbling routine.

<P>
ROME, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and China both won their
games in the Baseball World Championships by beating United States
and Spain respectively on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kyung Hun-Ho and Kim Byung Hyun combined for 14 strikeouts as
South Korea beat the United States 3-1 while China rolled over

</P>
<P>
With two straight wins, South Korea shared the top spot in Pool

</P>
<P>
The United States tailed in Pool A with two losses and faces an

Joshua Bard.
</P>
<P>
Kyung was pulled after allowing the run with none out. Kim came

<HEADLINE> Smith to Appear for FINA Doping Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Irish swimmer Michelle Smith could
be punished for a lifetime ban should she was to be convicted of
tampering with a urine sample in the hearing to be conducted in
Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Smith, winner of three gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics, would appear at a hearing on Friday before a doping panel
of the FINA, swimming's world governing body, her lawyer Peter
Lennon confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Smith was charged of manipulating an out-of-competition drug
test in Ireland on January 10 by adulterating her sample with
alcohol, but she has consistently denied taking drugs to boost her
performance.
</P>
<P>
In April, FINA said Smith's samples, tested at an
IOC-accredited laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, showed "unequivocal
signs of adulteration" and "physical manipulation."
</P>
<P>
Both samples reportedly contained a lethal concentration of
alcohol, indicating that the offender intended to avoid the
possible detection of drugs.
</P>
<P>
Under FINA rules, tampering with a urine sample is considered
as serious as taking steroids. The maximum penalty is a life ban.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear how long Smith's hearing will last, or when FINA
will announce its verdict.
</P>
<P>
Smith has faced strings of doping allegations ever since she
won three gold medals at the Atlanta Games.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China's world champions Sun
Shuwei and Tian Liang competed on a level of their own when they
outdived the other world big names with a huge margin to win the
men's 10-meter platform synchronized gold medal here today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese pair chalked up 91.08 points, the day's highest
score, in their final dives, accumulating a total of 344.64 points
for the gold.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Rueda and Fernando Platas of Mexico overtook Alexandr
Varlamov and Igor Loukashin of Russia in their last actions,
edging the European runners-up for the silver, with a score of
308.10 to the Russian pair's 304.98.
</P>
<P>
In today's another final, world champion Irina Lashko of Russia
got better of two Chinese divers to claim the women's one-meter
springboard title with a score of 278.25 points.
</P>
<P>
China's Guo Jingjing, 1995 World Cup winner and world platform
runner-up this year, improved her place round after round,
wrapping up second with 270.93 points ahead of teammate Zhang
Jing, who collected 270.15.
</P>
<P>
The men's event was a totally Chinese show. Sun, 1992 Olympic
platform winner, and Tian, World Cup platform champion this year,
led all the way through the five round final.
</P>
<P>
The Mexico duo put up a brilliant performance on their last
outing, napping the Russians by three points.
</P>
<P>
"We were not nervous at all. We only forcused our attention on
the dives. I think our last dives deserved that high score," Sun
said.
</P>
<P>
"I have fulfilled my first goal here, my next goal is to win
the individual platform. I will try my best to do that," Tian
claimed after winning the first gold for China at the Games.
</P>
<P>
The women's one-meter springboard competition was dominated by
Lashko throughout. The 25-year-old veteran, winner of the 1991
World Cup and silver medalist in the 1992 and 1996 Olympics, made
consistent fine performance in all her five dives.
</P>
<P>
She had a perfect final dive - reverse one and a half plus
somersault in pike - which brought her the highest score of 60.48.
</P>
<P>
At a post-race press conference, Lashko said: "I felt fine
during the competition. My favorite dive was my fifth dive. The
facility is nice but the air and pool temperature is cold."
</P>
<P>
Guo, 16, said: "I am happy about the silver finish. I hope I
can do better in the other events."
</P>
<P>
A total of 60 divers are competing in 10 diving events at the
current Games.

performances of B-share issues generally, and the uncertain
international economic situation.
</P>
<P>
B-shares are sold only to overseas investors, while A-shares
are designed for domestic buyers.
</P>
<P>
Both the Shanghai and Shenzhen B-share indicators fell to
all-time lows, at 38.40 points and 551 points, respectively, and
have been fluctuating since the early months of the year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the number of B-share-issuing companies
listed on China's two exchanges stood at 112, including five new
issuers who floated B-shares in the first six months this year.
</P>
<P>
Local observers attribute the current B-share difficulties
partly to the collapse of Yamaichi Securities Co. and the Hong
Kong-based Peregrine Brokerage Ltd., two major underwriters of
Chinese B-shares.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the withdrawal of foreign capital from Asia and the
active selling of B-shares by foreign investors have worsened the
situation.
</P>
<P>
However, the sluggish B-share market has been caused mainly by
the poor performances of B-shares overall, according to
analysts.
</P>
<P>
They forecast that B-share trading will not recover from its
current downward trend soon, because the end of Asia's financial
turmoil is not in sight.
</P>
<P>
But the experts do not rule out the possibility of a rebound in
B-share trading, since the authorities are paying greater
attention to the issue, and have adopted a series of measures to
standardize and stimulate the operation of the securities
markets.

CHENGDU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Limitations on electricity
consumption have become history in southwest China's Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
"The issue now is how to encourage people and businesses to use
more electricity," said Zou Guangyan, vice governor of Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this month, power consumption quotas and the sale of
large consumption rights are obsolete terms, and blackouts no
longer bother people during the nights. Consumers also are no
longer charged for owning air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
Aside from ending power-consumption limits, the provincial
government also is now committed to speeding up construction of
power grids, cutting power prices and improving after-sales
services.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan was a province with one of the worst electricity
shortages in China, despite accounting for one-third of the
nation's hydropower resources.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the construction of a number of power projects, the
power supply of the province now exceeds demand.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, according to official estimates, the
province's total generating capacity will reach 12 million
kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is working to promote electricity
consumption, the vice governor said.
</P>
<P>
For example, urban households with a monthly consumption of 150
kwh and rural households with a monthly consumption of 80 kwh
will enjoy a 10 percent discount.

</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:

<HEADLINE> 31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting to Open in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers from the nine
member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) will gather here Friday to discuss a number of issues
affecting the region.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day 31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM), the
ministers will discuss the ongoing Asian financial crisis and
measures to deal with its social impacts, the forthcoming
Cambodian elections, nuclear proliferation in South Asia, fight
against transnational crimes and other important issues.
</P>
<P>
The AMM is an annual event responsible for the formulation of
policy guidelines and coordination of ASEAN activities.
</P>
<P>
At this year's meeting, the ministers are also expected to
discuss and decide whether there will be a change in ASEAN's
policy from "non-interference" to "flexible engagement."
</P>
<P>
Thailand raised the idea of "flexible engagement," which means
that when domestic developments in a country have had positive or
adverse effects on other ASEAN nations, these nations can give
advice to or press the said country to solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, ASEAN's rotating chairman this year, supports
the new proposal. However, all the other ASEAN members -- Brunei,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore and Vietnam -- are
opposed to the idea. Analysts expect that no consensus will be
reached at the AMM.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will sign the Second Protocol of the Treaty of
Amity and Cooperation which will include Papua New Guinea and a
joint declaration which aims to build Southeast Asia into a region
free from drug production, abuse and trafficking by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are also supposed to issue a statement on the
Asian financial crisis, which has lasted for a year and crippled
almost all the economies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada will deliver a keynote
speech at the opening ceremony of the 31st ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the Fifth ASEAN Regional Forum and the ASEAN
Post-Ministerial Conferences will also take place here.
</P>
<P>
During the two ensuing events, ASEAN nations will exchange
views on political and security issues with its 10 dialogue
partners (Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, India,
Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the United States) and
the two observers Cambodia and Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
To make preparations for the 31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting,
the ASEAN Standing Committee meeting and the ASEAN Senior
Officials Meeting were already held here on July 21 to 22.

WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls has named Tim
Floyd its director of basketball operations on Thursday, instead
of head coach for the moment.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said that Floyd has joined
the team as a director with the head coaching job remains open
until an NBA labor dispute is resolved.
</P>
<P>
"We are leaving open for Phil (Jackson), Michael (Jordan) and
Scottie (Pippen) to return and defend their championship, while at
the same time providing a plan to move forward if they chose not
to do so," Reinsdorf said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Jackson is unlikely to return to his coaching job in the
Bulls as he said at the beginning of last season that "it would
take wild horses to drag me back" for another season.

<HEADLINE> BNFL Inc. Wins Massive US Nuclear Clean-up Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) has
won a 20-year clear-up deal worth up to 6.9 billion U.S. dollars
from the American government.
</P>
<P>
An official from BNFL's American subsidiary, BNFL Inc. said
Thursday that the contract involves the removal of radioactivity
from millions of gallons of waste stored in underground tanks at
the Hanford Site near Richland, Washington.
</P>
<P>
The two part contract will result in the safe treatment of
about 10 percent of the waste (equal to 20 to 25 percent of the
radioactivity) in Hanford's 54 million gallons of waste by 2018.
</P>
<P>
The company's American subsidiary has won almost 2.5 billion
dollars worth of nuclear clear-up business in the U.S. since being
established in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In the latest contract the British company has Bechte, GTS
Duratek and Science Applications International as partners.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Crimmins, BNFL Inc. President and Chief Executive
Officer said: "The agreement marks a vitally important step on the
path to a safe, efficient, and timely clear-up of Hanford's tank
waste."
</P>
<P>
"We are confident the overall approach is the right one and
will protect the environment by converting liquid radioactive
waste into a stable glass form for ultimate disposal," he added.

<P>
NEW YORK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street Stocks plunged nearly
200 points Thursday as U.S. aircraft maker Boeing joined a sudden
chorus of major companies with discouraging earning news in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The leading Dow Jones industrial average fell 195.93 to
8,932.98, about 400 points below last Friday's record close of
9,337.97 and its first finish below 9,000 since July 1.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indicators also suffered heavy losses, with
declining issues outnumbering advancers by nearly a 4-to-1 margin
in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-company index, a model against
which many stock mutual funds are pattened or compared, fell
24.33 to 1,139.75, down about 4 percent from last Friday's
closing record of 1,186.75.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by technology leaders
like Microsoft, fell 34.53 to 1,935.22. It was the third
straight losing session after a streak of nine straight closing
records for the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
The main factor behind this week's downturn has been the sudden
revelation of earning troubles at very prominent companies,
including Dow components Merck, Hewlett-Packard and DuPont.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's discouraging profit news gave a another heavy blow to
the investors. The Seattle-based aircraft giant failed to
satisfy Wall Street's deflated expectations for second-quarter
profits and issued disappointing forecasts for the full year and
1999.

<HEADLINE> Tsinghua University Signs Agreement with Teleglobe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Tsinghua University and
Teleglobe of the United States signed an agreement here Thursday
for Teleglobe to provide high-speed global Internet connectivity
via its Internet backbone service, Globeinternet (sm).
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony took place at INET'98, the Internet
Society's annual conference, for which Teleglobe is providing
conference attendees with four Mbps of global Internet capacity
via its Frankfurt Globeinternet Point of Presence (POP).
</P>
<P>
Teleglobe is one of the world's leading global carriers and
Internet backbone providers. Tsinghua University in Beijing is the
operator of the China Education &AMP; Research Network (CERNET)
</P>
<P>
The agreement reflects the growing trend of the global
educational and research community to rely on Teleglobe's Internet
backbone, currently linking Internet service providers (ISPs) in
more than 70 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
"Teleglobe is proud to have been selected by CERNET to provide
global Internet access to academic institutions throughout China,
an increasingly important market to Teleglobe," said Bob Collet,
vice president and general manager, data services for Teleglobe.
"We're committed to providing solutions and services to
accommodate CERNET's growing needs."
</P>
<P>
The link will consist of earth station and backhaul circuit
connectivity services by China Telecom to Tsinghua University;
space segment via China Telecom and Teleglobe jointly leased
INTELSAT space segment capacity; and corresponding earth station
and backhaul capacity to a Globeinternet access node in North
America.
</P>
<P>
Teleglobe also will provide a Quality of Service (QOS)
operating system, enabling higher priority traffic to flow ahead
of other network traffic during periods of congestion.
</P>
<P>
"The universities and the institutions connected to CERNET
throughout China are looking forward to the improved global
Internet access that will be provided by Teleglobe, in conjunction
with China Telecom and INTELSAT," said Dr. Wu Jianping of Tsinghua
University. "This link will further facilitate the sharing of
knowledge and expertise by the multitude of academic institutions
connected within China by CERNET."

<HEADLINE> Greece Harshly Criticizes U.S. Official Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday harshly criticized
the statements made by U.S. official on the Cyprus problem, saying
they were unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on statements by White House spokesman Mike Mccurry
that the Cyprus problem issue was a problem of "conflict" between
the two communities in the divided island, Greek spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that the Cyprus problem was one of invasion
and occupation of a large part of the island republic by the
Turkish army.
</P>
<P>
He continued that this was what is being accepted by the
international community, and it constitutes the basis of the
United Nations resolutions and its framework for a settlement of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
If there was a conflict, it was between the rational and
irrational, justice and lawlessness, legality and tyranny, he
said, adding that the Greek government wanted to believe that the
United States did not wish to take the place of the United Nations
or to monopolize the international community's interest in efforts
to settle the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos also expressed his
dissatisfaction over Washington's position towards the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. President Bill Clinton had made several
promises during his pre-election campaigns concerning a solution
to the 24-year Cyprus problem, none of which had today been
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos also
criticized Washington for its pressures to cancel the deployment
of the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles by Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton

"If I thought the process were over, I would say it was

"We have continued intense negotiations (between Israel and
the Palestinians) to this day with both sides based on the ideas
we advanced early," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we come to a time when we think it's hopeless, I'llsay
it's hopeless. Right now I am not prepared to say that," Clinton
said. "I think there is still a chance we can get an agreement
and I am going to keep working on it."
</P>
<P>
Clinton acknowledged differences remain between Israel and
the Palestinians and the peace process still is deadlocked.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerned over Iran's Medium-Range Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Thursday
showed profound concerns over Iran's test-firing of a
medium-range missile.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton said the missile could change the
"stability dynamics" or the Middle East if Iran made it
operational.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian missile, known as a new model of Shehab-3, launched
on Tuesday night, has a range of about 800 miles (1,300km), which
could cover all of Israel, Saudi Arabia and part of Turkey. A U.S.
official said that "It puts U.S. forces in the region at risk."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said it was "a source of
concern to us that they are pursuing a program of this nature."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would like to discuss the matter with Iranian
President Mohammed Khatami, if a dialogue opens.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters once the
Shehab-3 missile is made operational, "Iran will have the
ability to strike more distant targets -- including Israel,
portions of Russia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia."
</P>
<P>
"At that point it would have an impact strategically," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon,spokesman Ken Bacon said the missile was
clearly not meant only for Iraq, Iran's enemy in the long Gulf
War of the 1980s, when both sides used Scud missiles.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States expects other Shehab missile tests
soon because one alone would not be enough to make Iran
confident that the missile would work.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said the Iranian missile test would make the United
States keep working on a system to offset any possible missile
attacks.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to say if either Patriot 3 missiles or the
Arrow missiles the United States is developing with Israel would
be able to shoot down an Iranian missile.

<HEADLINE> Butler Asks Iraq to Hand over Disputed Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler Thursday requested Iraq to cooperate with
his inspection commission and hand over documents on munitions
used by Iraq in its 1980-1988 war with Iran.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. Security Council, Butler complained
that Iraq refused to hand over the document, saying that the
refusal was a violation of U.N. resolutions on access to
weapons-related materials.
</P>
<P>
Butler's complaint to the Security Council was the first about
field inspections in Iraq since U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
signed an agreement in Baghdad in February, giving the U.N.
inspectors full access to potential weapons sites and related
materials in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.N. inspectors said that the disputed documents were needed to
determine what munitions in Iraq's possession had been expanded so
the commission could verify if any still remained.
</P>
<P>
Butler said that these types of munitions had been declared
earlier by Iraq to have been used for chemical and biological
warfare agent delivery. But arms officials said that they had no
proof Iraq had used biological arms against Iran.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. inspectors are responsible for ridding Iraq of all
weapons of mass destruction. U.N. sanctions against Iraq imposed
eight years ago can not be lifted until the inspectors have
accounted for all dangerous arms and related materials although
Iraq has repeatedly denied that it still has any banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Current Security Council President Sergei Lavrov of Russia
intends to ask Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon to explain the
incident to the Council, sources close to the Council said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq reportedly said that the disputed documents would be
opened when Butler meets Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Taraq Aziz
in Baghdad on August 2.
