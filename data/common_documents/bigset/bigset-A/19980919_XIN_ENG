<HEADLINE> Hong Kong SAR's Water Supply Guaranteed to Be Free from Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Water Supplies
Department (WSD) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) has accorded top priority to addressing the problem of the
millennium bug to ensure a reliable and adequate water supply
around the Year 2000 (Y2K), Director of Water Supplies Hu Man-shiu
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The WSD had long recognized the potential implication of the
Y2K problem and all its computer systems developed or upgraded
since 1996 had been made Y2K compliant, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Hu was speaking at a ceremony at which WSD received a Year 2000
Compliance Certificate from Cyril Kerr, chairman of the DATAC
Control International Limited, which had for many years provided
computer software products to the department.
</P>
<P>
The department had reviewed all the systems and equipment
purchased or developed before 1996 and it was found that some 20
percent of the remote control and monitoring system for the water
treatment and distribution facilities, such as Supervisory Control
and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, could be non-compliant, Hu
said.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony on Friday signified the completion of Stage I of
the upgrading works on the SCADA systems, which was designed to
guarantee the systems Y2K bug free.
</P>
<P>
The remaining upgrading works, to be implemented in six stages
at a cost of some three million HK dollars (0.38 million
U.S. dollars), are due for completion by early 1999.
</P>
<P>
The WSD chief said he was confident that all systems and
equipment will be Y2K compliant before the pledged deadline of
mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
Also on hand at the ceremony were Tom Kitt, Irish Minister of
International Trade who accompanied Irish PM Bertie Ahern on the
latter's China tour which ended in the SAR. The Irish delegation
left here Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Thai Parliament Approves Deficit Budget for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The budget for the fiscal year starting October 1 is equivalent
to 14.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and comprises
232.6 billion baht (5.64 billion dollars) for government projects.
</P>
<P>
Several legislators sought in vain to make cuts in the budget
on grounds that the government would not be able to meet its
revenue collection target because of the worsening economic
crunch.
</P>
<P>
But government officials maintained that the Revenue and
Excise Departments had collected even more than their projected
targets this year.
</P>
<P>
Of the approved budget, 587 billion baht (14.2 billion dollars)
will go to fixed expenditure and 5.4 billion baht (130 million
dollars) to debt servicing, with a deficit of 25 billion baht (606
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Thailand's economy is projected to shrink seven to eight
percent this year because of the worsening economic crisis that
was triggered off by the baht float in July last year and its
subsequent depreciation.

<HEADLINE> Romania Lacks Proper Legislation in Anti-Corruption Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Efforts to wipe out
corruption and organized crime in Romania are foundering because
of inadequate legislation and poor training for law enforcement
officers, Justice Minister Valeriu Stoica said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We made great efforts, but unfortunately we end up with results
far from being satisfying," Stoica was quoted by Cronica Romana
newspaper as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Stoica said the main reason of the "slow pace" in the fight
against corruption and organized crime was "the lack of proper
legislation".
</P>
<P>
Some areas lacked complete laws to regulate their operation,
such as banking field, Public Ministry and the courts. As a
result, criminality and problems in those areas could not be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, those who enforced laws, such as police or
financial guards, were not seriously prepared for their work,
Stoica said.
</P>
<P>
Romania's legislation was still inadequate in dealing with the
specifics of organized crime, crime in general, and corruption
which could not possibly be avoided in countries which were in
transition, Stoica said.
</P>
<P>
He added that four "very important" draft laws were waiting to
be discussed in the Parliament where lawmakers would submit them
to debate and if they were approved, adopt them.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Government, Opposition Agree on Bank Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) and opposition parties on Friday ended a
40-day Diet (parliament) standoff over a set of banking system
reform bills aimed at saving the ailing banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came during a series of eleventh-hour talks
between Keizo Obuchi, president of the LDP, and leaders of four
opposition groups after the LDP made concessions.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders were Naoto Kan of the main opposition
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), Ichiro Ozawa of the Liberal
Party, the Heiwa-Kaikaku parliamentary group's Takenori Kanzaki,
and Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chairwoman Takako Doi.
</P>
<P>
The LDP, which had submitted four revised proposals for the
banking reform bills, agreed with opposition parties to jointly
devise a compromise based on the opposition's financial system
stabilization plan which features the introduction of a "bridge
bank" scheme.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi and the opposition leaders agreed to temporarily
nationalize the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB) by putting
it under government administration.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to strip the Finance Ministry of its powers to
determine which troubled banks to be liquidated, nationalized or
revived through government-assisted mergers with other banks.
Those powers would be ceded to a proposed independent panel,
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
The panel, based in the Prime Minister's Office and to be
called the Financial Revival Committee, would be able to decide
the fate of banks without interference from the cabinet, they said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the financial system stabilization bills,
which have been held up in the House of Representatives (lower
house), are expected to be passed in the Diet quickly.
</P>
<P>
Although the LDP has a majority in the lower house, the
opposition dominates the House of Councillors (upper house). The
LDP had refrained from passing the bills through the lower house
for fear the opposition would stonewall them at the upper house.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that the current Diet session will enact these
bills to stabilize the financial system," Obuchi told reporters
after his meeting with opposition party leaders.
</P>
<P>
The current extraordinary Diet session will end on October 7.
</P>
<P>
The reconciliation between the LDP and opposition parties
enables Obuchi to present a completed compromise scheme for
banking system stabilization to U.S. President Bill Clinton during
their summit slated for Tuesday in New York. Obuchi is scheduled
to leave for New York on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Solar Satellite Set Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft orbiting the sun has
finally been set right and will soon restart its solar mission, the
Washington Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers from U.S. NASA and European Space Agency said
here Thursday they had regained control of the Solar Satellite
and managed to get the drifting satellite back facing the right
direction so its solar panels can start generating power.
</P>
<P>
The solar spacecraft, which was launched in 1995 and sent back
huge amount of scientific data, "disappeared" suddenly last June
and stopped sending back signals.
</P>
<P>
Because SOHO had been facing the wrong direction since last
June, some instruments had been roasted by the sun and others
exposed to frigid cold, some instruments might be damaged but
scientists here suggested much of the satellite's scientific
capacity for observing the sun could be restored.

<HEADLINE> Judiciary Committee Continues to Meet on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The House of
Representatives Judiciary Committee Friday tried again to approve
release of more sexually graphic information on U.S. President
Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Democrats will fight to remove any salacious material from
information soon to be released to the public, said Democratic
committee spokesman Jim Jordan.
</P>
<P>
As committee members began meeting behind closed doors, Jordan
said Democratic lawmakers were shocked that Republicans who are
strong supporters of family values "seem the most enthusiastic
about innundating the public with extremely irrelevant and
salacious material."
</P>
<P>
But Republicans have argued the material is relevant to
indicate whether Clinton committed perjury when he testified about
his sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Committee members acknowledged they likely would have to endure
another round of bitter partisanship Friday over the most sexually
explicit material submitted to Congress by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
The committee got so bogged down in debating and defeating
Democratic proposals on party-line votes Thursday that members
never got to discuss release of Clinton's videotaped, August 17
grand jury testimony. The tape is considered the key item in
Starr's referral of "substantial and credible" information that
may indicate impeachable conduct.
</P>
<P>
With a 21-16 committee majority, Republicans have left no doubt
they will use their muscle to override Democratic objections and
bring the testimony to the nation's television screens.
</P>
<P>
Representative Martin Meehan, a Democrat and committee member,
said "I think we're rushing for political purposes" so Republicans
can use the tape in political campaigns. "I think the process is
becoming a joke," he said on ABC's "Good Morning America."
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, a Republican described debate
inside the room Thursday as "strongly partisan, vigorously
partisan."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, top House Republicans had demanded an FBI inquiry
into an alleged "systematic attempt to intimidate" Hyde and other
lawmakers, and the agency pledged to take "appropriate steps" in
response. Republicans have blamed the White House for an online
magazine story exposing a sexual relationship between Hyde and a
married woman in the 1960s. Presidential aides denied involvement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Drop 5.5 Pct in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. construction on
new homes and apartments dropped 5.5 percent in August, the
biggest decline in 20 months, the Commerce Department reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Builders started construction on 1.61 million units at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate in August, down from a 1.71
million-unit rate in July, which had been the strongest pace since
March 1987.
</P>
<P>
Even with the economy slowing, analysts are predicting that
1998 will be a good year for the housing industry, both in
construction of new homes and sales of existing homes, attributed
largely to the availability of low mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
A national mortgage survey carried out by Freddie Mac showed
that 30-year, fixed mortgages declined to 6.77 percent this week,
the lowest level since the giant financing firm began keeping
records in 1971.
</P>
<P>
For August, construction of new single-family homes declined
4.2 percent to an annual rate of 1.25 million units. Construction
of multifamily units plunged an even sharper 9.5 percent to an
annual rate of 368,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The declines were recorded in all regions of the country with
the West suffering the biggest setback, a drop of 8.6 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 394,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Housing construction in the Northeast was down 7.3 percent to
an annual rate of 313,000 units. The South, which accounts for
nearly half of all new home and apartment construction, saw
activity drop by 4.3 percent to an annual rate of 771,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, housing starts in the Midwest fell 3.1 percent to an
annual rate of 309,000 units.

<HEADLINE> Reppas: Simitis-Yilmaz Meeting Likely in Antalya, </HEADLINE>

<P>
ATHENS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis might meet with his Turkish counterpart Mesut Yilmaz in
October to discuss ways of bettering strained relations between
the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that Simitis would most likely have a meeting
with Yilmaz on the sidelines of the summit of Balkan countries in
Antalya, Turkey, on October 12.
</P>
<P>
The model of the first Balkan summit on the southern Greek
island of Crete, where regional leaders had bilateral meetings,
would most probably be followed at the two-day summit in Turkey,
he said, adding that however there had been no formal approach
made by Yilmaz for such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have been at odds for decades over their
disputes in the territorial waters, air space limits, the
delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the
Cyprus problem.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The primary
responsibility for the security and protection of U.N. staff rests
with host governments, the U.N. Secretary-General stressed here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of U.N. Staff Day, September 18, Kofi
Annan said staff security begins with security of person, which
includes the ability to go about work from threats, harassment and
violence.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the past year had seen dreadful events in this
regard, including a fatal helicopter crash in Guatemala, a plane
crash that took the lives of eight staff serving in Angola, staff
members killed in Afghanistan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said the United Nations had done its best
to protect the security and safety of its staff, but the primary
responsibility rested with host governments. He urged Member
States to sign and ratify the 1994 convention on the Safety of
United Nations and Associated Personnel.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest U.N. resources, since 1948, more than
1500 U.N. peacekeepers have died while serving the cause of peace,
and since 1992, there has been a dramatic rise in civilian deaths.

<HEADLINE> Banking Crisis Looming in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK) held an urgent meeting with 20 small commercial banks
Friday amid a looming banking crisis as it had taken control over
two commercial banks within barely two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The central bank convened a similar meeting last Monday, but
the small commercial banks said they could not afford any delays
which might drive a run on deposits.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the banking industry said Friday that the small
banks were demanding specific guarantees including a clear
position on how many more banks may be in trouble and what the
CBK's action plan is.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the CBK put th~2*9ust Bank, which ranked the
sixth in the country's banking industry, under statutory
management with an interim manager after its failure to honor 360
million Shillings (6.05 million U.S. Dollars) in checks due to a
run on the bank by depositors.
</P>
<P>
Trust Bank deposits by August 31 stood at 9.3 billion
Shillings (156.3 million U.S. Dollars) with 17 branches and 622
employees across the country. All of its branches have been
closed down since Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Reliance Bank was also put under statutory
management after it failed to pay 160 million Shillings in
overnight borrowing. Four of its directors and managers have
been charged for fraud.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also confirmed Thursday that a third bank,
Bullion Bank, was facing financial difficulties and had failed to
report to the CBK's clearing house for two days. Bullion Bank
turned customers away Friday, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
CBK Governor Micah Cheserem appealed earlier to the depositors
-- mainly Asians -- not to make panic withdrawals that could
cause a ripple effect in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
There are 55 banks and financial institutIsss in the east
African country.

<HEADLINE> 70 Palestinians Injured in Clashes With Israeli Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 70 Palestinians were
wounded Friday in violent clashes with Israeli soldiers during
massive demonstrations staged to protest the killing of two Hamas
militants.
</P>
<P>
The most violent clashes broke out near a Jewish settlement
outside the West Bank city of Ramallah as about 2,000
Palestinians held a march to demand Israel return the bodies of
Adel and Imad Awadallahs. The two brothers, both members of the
militant Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), were killed by
Israeli soldiers near Hebron last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of angry Palestinian demonstrators marched toward the
Jewish settlement Psagot and stoned Israeli soldiers guarding the
settlement. Palestinian sources said some 70 protesters were
wounded, two seriously, by rubber bullets fired by Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Massive demonstrations were also held in Bethlehem and
Jericho, both Palestinian-ruled towns in the West Bank, to
protest the killing of the Palestinian brothers.
</P>
<P>
Israel said the two were leaders of a military wing of Hamas
which was behind several deadly suicide bombings in Israel last
year which killed dozens of Israelis and injured hundreds of
others.
</P>
<P>
The Awadallah family has called on Israel to return the bodies
for burial, but rejected by Israel which feared that a funeral
for the two brothers would trigger bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The clashes Friday capped a series of demonstrations and
protests over the past week during which Palestinians clashed
with Israeli soldiers and several dozens were wounded.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, PNA urged Israel Friday to
extradite a Jewish settler for trial, who was suspected of killing
a Palestinian youth in a Palestinian village near Ramallah
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The settler, who was detained by Israel police, said he opened
fire at a group of Palestinians because they were throwing stones
at his car. But the Palestinians said he shot at them without
provocation.
</P>
<P>
These incidents came amid mounting tension between Israel and
the Palestinians in the recent days.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army announced Friday that its forces will
re-clamp a total closure of Gaza Strip and the West Bank during the
Jewish New Year holiday, which begins Sunday night, after renewed
threats from Hamas to kidnap hitchhiking Israeli soldiers and
blow up car bombs in Israeli cities.
</P>
<P>
The closure, imposed last week after Hamas threatened to carry
out a series of terror attacks against Israeli targets to avenge
the death of the Awadallah brothers, has been partially eased
since Tuesday and about 10,000 Palestinians were allowed to enter
Israel to work or do business.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The first five Northern Irish
guerrillas serving life sentences for murder were released from
prison on Friday under the terms of the British-ruled province's
landmark peace agreement, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
Four pro-British Protestant guerrillas -- two from the Ulster
Defense Association (UDA), and two from the Ulster Volunteer Force
(UVF) -- and one Roman Catholic who fought for Irish unity in the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), were freed from the Maze prison near
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Reuters quoted a spokeswoman for the Northern Ireland's Prisons
Office as saying that the men had served between 10 and 14 years.
</P>
<P>
They won early release under a scheme that rewards armed groups
for observing ceasefires and supporting the historic Good Friday
peace accord, signed on April 10, which aims to draw a line under
three decades of bloodshed that cost 3,600 lives.
</P>
<P>
A total of 24 guerrillas have been freed since September 11.
Around 200 are set to be released by Christmas, the Prisons Office
said.

<HEADLINE> House Judiciary Committee Decides to Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Judiciary Committee of
the U.S. House of Representatives voted Friday to release the
videotape of President Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony and
2,800 pages of material from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
After long hours of partisan wrangling over two days, Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde said the committee agreed to release the
material after deleting 120 portions deemed sensitive or
offensive.
</P>
<P>
Just when the material would be made public remains unclear but
Hyde said a timetable was likely to be announced later Friday.
</P>
<P>
The White House immediately denounced the committee's action.
</P>
<P>
"This appears to be a rush to prejudgment and an effort to get
out the most salacious material at the speed of light, not at the
proper pace of justice," spokesman James Kennedy said. "But in the
end it will have to be the American people who will have to see if
this indeed has been a fair process or a partisan effort to
embarrass the president."
</P>
<P>
Hyde, a Republican, said the committee sessions were civil but
that bipartisanship "doesn't include surrender to everything the
Democrats want."
</P>
<P>
"There was a general view among the Democrats not to reveal
anything, and there was a general view among Republicans to reveal
as much as possible," Hyde said. He added that Republicans agreed
to "responsible redactions to protect people whose names and vital
statistics and involvement in this was very peripheral."
</P>
<P>
Representative Barney Frank, a Democrat, immediately denounced
the committee's action as "an effort to discredit the president."
He said virtually every vote was a party-line vote.
</P>
<P>
Frank said that on those votes, Republicans forced release of
more salacious material than Democrats favored. "What we have is a
very one-sided, partisan effort to release material before the
president gets a chance to review it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Representative Bill McCollum, a Republican, said it was
necessary to release the material because "the president has put
things in dispute."

<HEADLINE> Iran not Wanting Military Conflict With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A visiting Iranian minister
said here Friday that Iran does not want to get involved in
military conflict with the Afghan Taliban militia despite the
mounting tension.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, Iranian
Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani said
that both Iran and Lebanon did not want to see the region dragged
into turmoil or to see any new development which will cause losses
for the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Lebanon for its support to Iran over the killing
of nine Iranian diplomats by Afghan Taliban militia last month.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi strongly condemned the killing, saying Taliban's act was
in fact a maneuver aimed at weakening the region's attention on
the Israeli occupation, Mohajerani said.
</P>
<P>
On August 8, Taliban guerrillas killed nine Iranian diplomats
in Mazari Sharif in northern Afghanistan, leading to the escalation
of tensions with Iran, which has been supporting Taliban's rivals.
</P>
<P>
In the past weeks, Iran has held two military exercises along
its border with Afghanistan in a show of force to exert pressure on
the Taliban. This has provoked the fears about a military conflict
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani told reporters that his country would continue
supporting Lebanon and its people to fight against Israeli
occupation and to restore their lost land.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 to allegedly protect its north from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been financially backing Lebanon's Hezbollah, or Party
of God, in its fight against the 1,000 Israeli soldiers and its
allied 3,000 South Lebanon Army militiamen in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani arrived here on Friday from Damascus on a four-day
visit to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He has held talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
and Information Minister Bassem Al-Sabaa on bilateral ties and
regional affairs.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for Safety of Humanitarian Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Friday called upon all parties to take necessary measures to
ensure the safety of humanitarian convoys and personnel in
Angola, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The appeal, voiced by U.N. Under-Secretary-General Sergio
Vieira de Mello, came about two days after a humanitarian convoy,
escorted by the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA), was
ambushed on Wednesday on its way to deliver food relief to
northwestern Angola.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that de Mello "calls upon all parties to
take necessary measures to ensure the safety of humanitarian
convoys and personnel in Angola, and to do all in their power to
facilitate the delivery of urgently needed humanitarian assistance
to vulnerable populations throughout the country."
</P>
<P>
Initial reports reaching here said that three MONUA soldiers
were reportedly injured while the fate of 10 others was not
accounted for. Nine out of 17 vehicles which made up the convoy
were damaged in the wake of the attack. However, the U.N.
spokesman said that the attack "resulted in seven wounded and one
dead."
</P>
<P>
"These attacks are seriously impacting on the ability of
humanitarian organizations to assist those in need," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is
extremely concerned over the volatile security situation in Angola
following the recent attack," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process was once again stalled and the
Angolan Government, together with the Security Council, blamed the
rebel UNITA for its violation of the Lusaka Protocol, which was
signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Angola has long been in a state of civil war since its 1975
independence from the Portuguese colonial rule, and little
progress has been made so far in bringing enduring peace into the
central African country.

<HEADLINE> Safety-Net Measures Proposed Against Financial Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has
suggested that the U.N. General Assembly consider safety-net
measures to fence off side-effects of financial integration.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the high-level meeting of the U.N. General Assembly
on the impact of globalization on Thursday, Bangladesh
Representative Anwarul Karim Chowdhury said the U.N. organ should
emphasize the development of mature institutions.
</P>
<P>
Such institutions, he said, should set up legal provisions and
regulatory mechanism and develop supervisory capacities.
</P>
<P>
In the globalization process, he said, the costs were almost
totally confined to the majority of developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Financial integration in developing countries is a much more
complicated process than trade liberalization, he said, noting
that financial turmoil there is often due to hasty economic
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Assembly to consider taking such measures as
emergency food aid, balance of payment support to severely
affected countries, an immediate increase in the level of official
development assistance and reduction of the debt burden.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Woos for Voters' Support in Open Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- With Germany's national
elections just nine days away, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Friday issued a open letter in a German newspaper asking voters to
cast their votes in his favor to ensure a secure future for the
country.
</P>
<P>
Carried as a full-page advertisement in the German
mass-circulation Bild newspaper, the open letter noted the
positive developments in Germany under Kohl's leadership,
including an ongoing economic recovery, an improving job market,
price stability as well as record low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's open letter also said the opposition Social Democrats
(SPD) and the Greens would threaten economic recovery if they won
power in the national vote scheduled for September 27.
</P>
<P>
"Only the CDU stands for future and security," said Kohl in
reference to his Christian Democratic Union party which has been
leading a centre-right ruling coalition in Bonn since 1982.
</P>
<P>
The open letter is part of Kohl's efforts to turn around the
unfavorable trend in opinion polls which show that Kohl is still
trailing the SPD by three to six percentage points, though the gap
has been significantly narrowed when compared with earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
Pinning his hope on a large number of undecided voters, Kohl
has stressed repeatedly that the elections will only be decided in
the final weeks.

<HEADLINE> Side Effects of Globalization Need to Be Tackled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Besides its positive
effects in terms of an increase in trade and investment flows,
globalization has also its downside, according to Pakistan's
representative to an on-going high-level U.N. conference.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Kamal told the U.N. General Assembly meeting Thursday
that recent growth in trade and investment flows has bypassed the
majority of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The prosperity of those developing countries which benefited
from globalization has proven to be fragile, he said, adding
that globalization has been accompanied by an accentuation of
income disparities among and within countries.
</P>
<P>
Kamal said integration into global markets has exacted a very
heavy cost, especially since there are no "safety nets" for
countries faced with economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He called for the strengthening of the capacity of
multilateral institutions to address issues of trade, finance
and development in an integrated manner.
</P>
<P>
Serious attempt must be made to deal with issues of debt,
access to technology and development finance, he said.
</P>
<P>
The September 17-18 meeting on the impact of globalization
and policy response is taking place against a backdrop of severe
recessions in many countries, slowing world economic growth and
chain-reaction financial turmoil.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese woman was
shot dead outside her house in Dar es Salaam Thursday night by
bandits who attempted to rob her car, the police said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rieko Hanaoka was shot while she was waiting for the opening
of the gate of her residence in the Mikocheni area in the
northeastern outskirts of the city, but the bandits failed to
take her car away, Regional Police Commander Alfred Gewe said.
</P>
<P>
People in the neighborhood said they heard a shot when the
incident happened.
</P>
<P>
Hanaoka, who was driving a Suziki Vitara, was working with
maternal and children health services at the Dar es Salaam-based
Muhimbili Medical Center, the largest hospital in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Gewe said three bandits with two pistols were following
Hanaoka in a stolen car which was later abandoned at a petrol
station on the Mbezi Beach. The car is a Toyota Rav 4 with
registration number TZE 5278 stolen on September 13.
</P>
<P>
Police at the same petrol station have found a Toyota chaser
with different plates, TZH 8679 in the front and TZK 2609 in the
rear, Gewe said, adding that none of the numbers is legal and its
real registration number is TZL 599 allegedly stolen on September
10 at the Mikocheni area.
</P>
<P>
The police commander cautioned owners of Suzuki Vitara, Toyota
Rav 4 and Toyota land-cruiser to take care of their cars as
currently they are hot cakes for bandits.
The incident is still under investigation, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Friday voted 15-0 to adopt a resolution on Africa,
calling for more contributions to aid Africa in its efforts to
boost conflict prevention and peacekeeping capacities.
</P>
<P>
The resolution endorsed the establishment of a United Nations
Prevention Action Liaison Office in the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted the resolution following its
consultations on a report, submitted by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan in mid-April, which gave an analysis on the causes and
prevention of conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council said in the resolution that it
"encourages contributions to the United Nations Trust Fund for
Improving Preparedness for Conflict prevention and Peacekeeping in
Africa and to the OAU Peace Fund."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also "encourages the Secretary-General to
develop a strategy for the purpose of enhancing contributions to
the Trust Fund," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council members asked the Secretary-General to
"continue to assist U.N. member states in the further development
of commonly accepted peacekeeping doctrine and to share existing
peacekeeping doctrine and concepts of operations with the OAU and
subregional organizations in Africa."
</P>
<P>
The resolution "invited the Secretary-General to assist the OAU
and subregional organizations in Africa to establish logistics
assessment teams through the sharing of information on the
establishment, composition, methods and functioning of United
Nations logistics assessment teams."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also "invites the Secretary-General to
assist the OAU and subregional organizations involved to determine
the logistical and financial requirements of regional or
subregional peacekeeping operations authorized by the Security
Council," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also "encourages the establishment of
partnership between States and regional and subregional
organizations involved in peacekeeping operations, in which one or
more States or organizations contribute troops and others
contribute equipment."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "encourages the Secretary-General to
facilitate efforts to that end, and requests him to consider
developing a framework to coordinate such partnerships," the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "welcomes the proposal by the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to establish a Council
of Elders within its Mechanism for the Prevention, Management,
Resolution of Conflicts, Peacekeeping and Security for the the
purpose of facilitating mediation efforts."
</P>
<P>
The resolution came after the Security Council's previous
resolution and presidential statement which called for more
efforts to beef up African peacekeeping capacity and effective
scrutiny on arms embargoes in the war-ravaged continents.

forum for social studies Friday held@its inaugural workshop under
the theme "issues in rural development in Ethiopia".
</P>
<P>

manager of the forum, described it as "the first 'think-tank'
civil institution in Ethiopia".

<P>
He said the main objective of the forum is to undertake
in-depth research on issues of development and social change in
Ethiopia and provide a public place for the discussion of such
issues.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that public policy, especially related to
development issues, should not be left to policy makers alone,
saying that such policies must be part of the public debate.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only way that the public and civil society can be
involved in policy choices and the decision making process," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President to Meet U.N. Chief in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' President Glafcos
Clerides said Friday that he would meet soon with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in New York to discuss the
U.N. initiative on Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Larnaca Airport before his departure for New
York to attend the U.N. General Assembly, Clerides said during
their recent meeting in Durban, South Africa, on the sidelines
of the Non-Aligned Movement summit, he and Annan decided to
continue their discussions on the Cyprus issue in New York.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Annan has invited the U.N. Resident
Representative in Cyprus, Ann Hercus, to attend the meeting and it
is possible that Annan's Advisor on Cyprus, Diego Cordovez, will
also be present.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks between the two communities
have been stalled since last summer when Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash walked out of the talks to protest against a
European Union decision to start accession talks with the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash recently proposed to establish a confederation of two
equal states as a basis for resuming the peace talks, but this
has been rejected by the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
The breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" declared by
the Turkish Cypriots in 1983 is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Clerides told reporters that one of the reasons for this trip
to New York was to evaluate the prospects of a debate on the
Cyprus problem at the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to hold meetings with representatives of the
permanent and non-permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between Clerides and U.S. Presidential Emissary for
Cyprus, Richard Holbrooke, has also been arranged.

<HEADLINE> Iran Criticizes Arab League Over Land Dispute With UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran Friday criticized the
Arab League (AL) for supporting the claim of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) over three disputed islands in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said that
the stance taken by the AL in supporting the UAE was "not in
accordance with realities and basic needs of the region and the
world of Islam," the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the declaration issued Thursday by the meeting of
AL foreign ministers in Cairo, Mohammadi said the AL's handling of
the Iran-UAE relations was unbalanced.
</P>
<P>
"One sided support for the UAE claim on the Iranian islands
does not offer any help to settlement of mutual disputes,"
Mohammadi said, adding that the move would only divert regional
and Muslim states' attention from the threats posed by Israel and
its supporters.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that the islands, Greater Tunbs,
Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa, are inseparable and integral parts of
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the three islands at the mouth of the strategic
Hormuz Strait in 1971 after the British colonist forces withdrew
from the region, but both Tehran and Abu Dhabi have claimed full
sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between the two countries were lowered to
the level of charge d'affaires in 1992 after the UAE lodged a
protest against Iran's full control on the islands.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been calling for solving the dispute with the UAE
through bilateral talks, while the UAE demands international
arbitration over the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi also expressed the hope that the AL member states
would encourage the UAE to resume talks with Iran to settle the
disputes.
</P>
<P>
Promoting the atmosphere of friendship, confidence and
cooperation in line with the interests and collective security of
the Gulf states is the most important approach to guarantee
regional stability and security and to remove any possible
ambiguities, he said.

<HEADLINE> Duma Passes Draft Bill to Protect Private Depositors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma on
Friday passed a draft law in the first reading that guarantees
private deposits in both rubles and hard currency.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft, entitled "On State Guarantees on Private
Deposits in Russian Banks," the state guarantees the safety and
return of private deposits both in rubles and hard currency that
were opened in banks as of September 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the measures envisaged in the bill will unlikely
enable the depositors to fully recover their losses in the wake of
the sharp devaluation of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
The national currency dropped to 18.5 rubles to one dollar
Friday on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (MICEX), a
devaluation of some 65 percent from a month ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, the state also guarantees that
individuals will get their wages and social benefits that were
placed in bank accounts after September 1, 1998, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin's representative for the Duma,
Alexander Kotenkov, said Yeltsin backs the draft law's idea on the
whole. However, the proposed measures need to be weighed
carefully, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bill envisages transfer of private deposits from commercial
banks to the Savings Bank of Russia (Sberbank) at the request of
depositors.
</P>
<P>
It details the procedures for transfer of funds from commercial
banks to Sberbank. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) must hand over
to Sberbank an amount of fund out of the mandatory reserves
deposited by banks with the CBR equivalent to the amount of
deposits transferred from commercial banks to Sberbank.
</P>
<P>
If the amount of the mandatory reserves turns out to be less
that the amount of commitments on transferred private deposits,
the CBR will issue promissory notes to Sberbank, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Kotenkov, Yeltsin's representative in the lower house of
parliament, said one should not make Sberbank and the CBR
responsible for all commercial banks' commitments.
</P>
<P>
Depositors who have deposits in foreign currency have the right
to have their deposits repaid by Sberbank in Russian rubles at the
exchange rate as of the date of the promulgation of the law.
</P>
<P>
The Duma decided that its Budget Committee would finalize the
bill and submit it for a second reading in early October.

LUANDA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- One of the three wounded U.N.
soldiers died after unidentified armed men mounted a raid on
their cars Wednesday, the United Nations' peace observer mission
confirmed here Friday.

<HEADLINE> Globalization Benefits Urged to Be Equitably Shared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Several Developing
countries said the benefits of globalization and the
responsibilities to sustain them should be shared equitably by all
participants.
</P>
<P>
Asda Jayanama, Thai Representative to the U.N. high-level
meeting on the impact of globalization said here on Thursday that
globalization has presented opportunities for the strong and
challenges for the weak on an unlevel playing field.
</P>
<P>
"Those able to effectively influence the course of events are
still watching from the sidelines," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan representative Njuguna Mahugu said most developing
countries are still inadequately prepared to cope with the
globalization process.
</P>
<P>
"Deliberate international cooperation efforts should be
targeted to ensure that the benefits of globalization are shared
equitably," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Without such concerted efforts, marginalization of weak and
poor developing countries would intensify," he added.
</P>
<P>
Powerful transnational forces are at work reshaping the key
features of world markets in capital, goods, services, labor and
technology when the bulk of the developing world particularly the
least developed is receiving the shorter end of the bargain, said
Iran's representative Mohammad Javad Zarif.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's representative Celso Amorim said the impetus to growth
in the world economy must be based on the notions of equity and
solidarity and that "there must be an equitable sharing of the
costs incurred in financial crises".
</P>
<P>
Algeria's representative Abdallah Baali proposed that the
enormous economic and financial means of industrialized nations be
deployed to economies in distress to help them rise above their
underdevelopment.
</P>
<P>
"If the situation of developing countries is not quickly
addressed, the international community risks transforming the
East-West confrontation of yesterday into a new form of conflict,"
he warned.
</P>
<P>
Russian representative Nikolai Tchoulkov appealed for the
creation of an international early warning system to avoid
financial crises and for cooperation between the U.N. and world
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Priority areas might include the monitoring of financial flows
and of the economic policies of governments and the strengthening
of an international forecasting capability, he added.
</P>
<P>
The September 17-18 meeting is taking place against the
backdrop of severe recessions in many countries, slowing world
economic growth and chain-reaction financial turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Cuts Civil Servants by Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has cut down
the number of its civil service work force by 185,000, more than
half of the original number, in a six-year reform program, a
State House press release said Friday.
</P>
<P>
After streamlining the bloated bureaucracy, the number of
civil servants has been reduced from 355,000 in 1992 to 170,000
last year, and the bulk of work force is deployed in the social
services, police and local governments, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum forwarded to President Benjamin Mkapa, it is
stated that the work force streamlining has been a result of the
government's Civil Service Reform Program (CSVP) launched in 1991
by the central government.
</P>
<P>
Another output of the program is a 75 percent increase in
average salaries of the civil servants, from 12,000 Shillings
(about 18 U.S. Dollars a month) in 1992 to 54,000 Shillings in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Also under this program the regional administrations have been
reduced from an average of 700 to 80 per region.
</P>
<P>
On the reforms of the pay structure and payroll system, the
statement said 196 grades and 36 different allowances have been
reduced to 45 grades and seven allowances.
</P>
<P>
The reforms have produced positive results. For instance, in
1994-95 fiscal year, wage bill expenditure exceeded the
government budget by 40 percent, but in 1996-97 it was only two
percent over the budget.
</P>
<P>
The program has clearly redefined the role of the staty and it
is now acceptable that the government should withdraw from
industrial production activities, reduce its functions to
affordable levels and enhance the participation of
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector in
the delivery of services.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the reforms are aimed at transforming
public service to an excellent institution playing a pivotal role
in achieving sustained national economic growth and prosperity,
subsequently eradicating poverty in the next century.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Joins Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazil on Friday joined
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which was designed to
prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
A Brazilian delegation headed by Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe
Lampreia concluded the ratification at a ceremony in the U.S.
State Department's main reception room here.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Brazil
"will work actively and critically" to help eliminate the threat
of nuclear weapons, Lampreia said.
</P>
<P>
He added that limiting the spread of nuclear weapons is not
enough. "The NPT will not have fulfilled its goal... until all
existing nuclear weapons are gone," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ratification was hailed by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright as a "milestone."
</P>
<P>
Albright contrasted the Brazilian action with the "nuclear
follies" of India and Pakistan in testing nuclear devices this
past Spring.
</P>
<P>
"Brazil has given the lie to the dangerous nonsense that the
global non-proliferation regime is dead," she said, stressing, as
a nuclear "could-have-been," Brazil has special standing to speak
out and act against nuclear proliferation.

</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has the third largest population in Africa, only

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian new Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov vowed Friday to form a clean government and root
out corruption "once and for all".
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the nation, Primakov reiterated that he would
form a government of "professionals, honest specialists and decent
people."
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to choose a government on party lines or the
affiliation of a minister to this or that political organization,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In what he described as his "first televised address as the
government chairman", Primakov said his government's main tasks
now were to restore investor confidence and bail out the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
He said the announcement on August 17 by the previous
government and the Central Bank, which effectively devalued the
ruble and defaulted on some of Russia's domestic and foreign
debts, resulted in "a situation exclusively difficult for the
country".
</P>
<P>
"I hope that already next week the payment system will
generally start functioning throughout the country," Primakov
said. "That is extremely important."
</P>
<P>
To boost state revenue, the government will also impose
monopoly on alcohol and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
Primakov noted a draft bill passed in the State Duma earlier
Friday in the first reading that protects private deposits in both
rubles and hard currency.
</P>
<P>
"The savings of working people, accumulated in a hard work,
will be reliably protected," Primakov said.

BEIRUT -- Lebanon's leading Muslim guerrilla group Amal
movement is planning to launch fundamental reforms in a bid to
counterbalance the growing influence by the country's another
important Muslim group Hezbollah, the Daily Star reported Friday.

At the ninth congress of the Amal movement which convenes

political bureau member Mohammed Abdel-Hamid Beydoun told the
paper.

Amal, led by the country's House Speaker Nabih Berri and
created during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war, is vying for the

Dollars) on its staff members since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry, Enock Kavindele,
made the denial in a statement presented in parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said that out of the money, 6.1 billion Kwacha (three
million Dollars) was spend on evaluation and consultancy fees.
</P>
<P>
Another 1.7 billion Kwacha (about 800,000 Dollars) was spent
on legal fees, while 1.1 billion Kwacha (about 550,000 Dollars) on
buying vehicles for the agency, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister told parliament that only 5.2 billion Kwacha
(about 2.6 million Dollars) was spent on the staff members'
emoluments with 3.6 billion Kwacha (about 1.8 million Dollars)
being spent on salaries for the workers.
</P>
<P>
The agency, established in 1992, is the only institution in
the country to deal with privatization matters.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Narrows Gap with His Challenger in Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party has narrowed the gap with
the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) to two
percentage points with just nine days to go before the national
elections, a survey of voters showed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The survey released by the German ZDF television network showed
that the CDU had risen half a percentage point from a week
earlier, to 37.5 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SPD dropped 1.5 percent, to just 39.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The gap has been narrowed significantly as compared with
earlier this year when Kohl's party trailed the SPD by up to 10
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that about 29 percent of German voters
had not yet made up their mind which party they would vote for.
</P>
<P>
The German national elections will put Kohl against SPD
chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder, who is premier of the
western German Lower Saxony state. Kohl, who has been German
chancellor since 1982, is running for an unprecedented fifth term.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Amal Group to Reform to Counterbalance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's leading Muslim
guerrilla group Amal movement is planning to launch fundamental
reforms in a bid to counterbalance the growing influence by the
country's another important Muslim group Hezbollah, the Daily Star
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the ninth congress of the Amal movement which convenes
Friday, a series of reform will be adopted by the party aimed at
restructuring the movement and introducing new blood, the party's
political bureau member Mohammed Abdel-Hamid Beydoun told the
paper.
</P>
<P>
Amal, led by the country's House Speaker Nabih Berri and
created during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war, is vying for the
dominance of the country's largest single sect of 1.2 million
Shiite Muslims with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
The two groups are separately waging guerrilla wars trying to
oust 1,000 Israeli troops from south Lebanon where Israel set up a
self-declared security zone in 1985 to protect its north from
cross-border guerrillas' attack.
</P>
<P>
Achieving more victories against Israeli soldiers than the
Amal, Hezbollah gained an increasing popularity among the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Beydoun said the Amal's political bureau is expected to reduce
its number from around 25 to nine or 10 and "a quiet revolution
will take place at the top" instead of the grassroots level.
</P>
<P>
He explained that working from the top down would hasten the
necessary changes to the movement.
</P>
<P>
The paper said a political manifesto to be issued at the
end of the congress will outline the party's detailed reforms.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Suffer Modest Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- European shares suffered
modest falls Friday, after dramatic losses the day before, amid
fears that corporate earnings growth will plunge as the global
economy slows.
</P>
<P>
The London FTSE 100 finished the week with a modest 1.23
percent fall after oil stocks took the index lower on a shock
profits warning from Royal Dutch/Shell. The index closed 77.3
points lower at 5,055.6.
</P>
<P>
The broader indices all finished in the red, while Liffe's
December FTSE contract dropped 70 to 5,130 after a surprisingly
quiet expiry of the September series.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones was flat at the time of the London close. Dealers
said the market did not react to early fluctuations in New York.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market was reluctant to move ahead of
"triple-witching" in the U.S., which refers to the expiration of
S&AMP;P futures, options and stock options.
</P>
<P>
The close-out can cause massive swings in prices as traders buy
or sell the underlying stocks to try and push derivatives prices
up or down before the contracts expire.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, shares were still in the red at the close of
trade after Wall Street registered slender losses. The DAX closed
70.93 points at 4,598.58.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French shares were also lower at the close of trade.
The CAC-40 finished 60.04 points lower at 3,465.22.
</P>
<P>
Attention was focused on telecommunications shares as Alcatel
resumed its plunge after a delayed start to trading, falling 5.6
percent, after declining 38 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Several other blue-chip stocks fell sharply, with computer
group Bull leading declines among technology stocks.

<HEADLINE> S. Afirca's Ruling Party Enjoys Support: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) now enjoys majority support in
Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, the only two provinces held by
its political rivals, according to an opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
The Markinor poll, conducted in July this year, shows that the
ANC has 31 percent support in the Western Cape against 30 percent
of the National Party (NP).
</P>
<P>
In KwaZulu-Natal, the ANC has 41.8 percent support, compared
with 19.3 percent of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).
</P>
<P>
Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal are currently held by the NP
and the IFP.
</P>
<P>
In the richest province of Gauteng, ANC support stands at 49
percent, well ahead of its nearest rival, the Democratic Party,
with 11.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party has its highest support rate of 83.2 percent
in the Northern Province.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, the percentages in all provinces of
those who would not disclose a voting intention -- either saying
they would not vote or were undecided -- was still significantly
high.
</P>
<P>
Markinor said the results, released by the ANC, were part of a
national poll.
</P>
<P>
The national results, released earlier this month, showed that
NP national support had dropped below 10 percent for the first
time, and that the ANC had 57 percent.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Police Urged to Exercise Discipline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police officers were
urged Friday to exercise the highest standards of discipline so
as to effectively combat crime.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka Division Commanding officer Ryan Chitoba said that the
police cannot afford to be indisciplined when executing their
work because the police service is literally built on the bedrock
of discipline.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while opening the Muchinga Community
Police Post in Matero area of Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Chiroba said the concept of partnership between the police and
the community demands that the two work as a unified entity, and
if the police become indisciplined then they distance themselves
from the community who are supposed to give them information that
helps them curb crime.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the police service will not hesitate to dismiss
any indisciplined police officer from the service.
</P>
<P>
Matero is a high crime rate area in the Zambian capital where
motor vehicle thefts are rampant.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, often accused
of human rights violations, has for the first time agreed to a
visit by a U.N. human rights investigator, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Human Rights Commission last October appointed Soli
Jehangir Sorabjee of India as a special rapporteur on Nigeria,
with a mandate to establish direct contacts with the authorities
and people of the west African country.
</P>
<P>
But up to now, Sorabjee has been able to report only from
outside Nigeria, which has long been ruled by the military since
its independence from the British colonial rule in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman did not say when the U.N. investigator would
visit Nigeria, where the new head of state, General Abdulsalami
Abubakar, has freed a number of political prisoners and announced
parliamentary and presidential elections for next year. Abubakar
came to power after his predecessor General Sani Abacha died in
June.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has closed down the
International Credit Bank Limited (ICB) because it failed to work
for the interests of its customers.
</P>
<P>
Radio Uganda said Friday evening that Bank of Uganda, the
central bank, has discontinued the normal operations of ICB and
suspended the job of the managing director and the board.
</P>
<P>
The depositors are advised to be patient until the central
bank finalizes the stock of inventory and audit of the bank.
</P>
<P>
A public relations officer with the central bank said that
under a relevant statute made in 1993, the central bank can close
a branch if its activities are detrimental to customers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, no withdrawals from or deposits to customer
accounts will be allowed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Over the last couple of months, Ugandan Shilling has
depreciated a lot against the U.S. Dollar. Some analysts
attribute the sharp devaluation of Shilling to the reduction of
coffee exports, which account for 55 to 60 percent of the
country's foreign exchange earnings, and to the volatile
situation in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Bank of Uganda announced it intervened to rescue
the falling Shilling but with little success up to now.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Imports Down by Three Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's import value was
recorded at 481 million U.S. Dollars in the first half of this
year, 3.2 percent down from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Egidio Paulo, director of the country's Internal Trade Bureau,
was quoted by Savana Weekly issued on Saturday as saying that
most of the imports were from South Africa, which took up 35.2
percent, followed by Portugal, which accounted for 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the reduction in imports largely to an increase
of the country's grain output in the first six months of this year,
which can satisfy 66 percent of the domestic need now.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the country's imports from Asia were also
down. But he gave no details in this regard.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the imports in the first half of
this year broke down to 35 percent of food stuffs, 28 percent of
raw materials and 37 percent of vehicles and various equipment.

<P>
CHONGQING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing Municipality,
located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, has announced
an ambitious forest protection and afforestation program designed
to reduce the impact of flooding.
</P>
<P>
Deforestation and soil erosion in the upper reaches of the
Yangtze are cited as one of the major causes of devastating summer
floods in the river valley.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, China's largest municipality with a population of 30
million people, issued a decree prohibiting logging in natural
forests and all trade activities involving related timber. The
decree also stipulates that logging in other forest areas should
not exceed the volume of new trees planted.
</P>
<P>
The municipality has also placed a one-year moratorium on urban
construction which encroaches on forests.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing currently has 3 million hectares of wood land and it
plans to increase its present forest coverage from the 21 percent
to 46 percent over the next 11 years.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt Stand on UNITA "Irreversible": FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister Joao
Miranda has said that his government's stand on the opposition
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) is
"irreversible."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Friday night at the Luanda airport before
his departure for New York to attend the 53rd General Assembly
meeting of the United Nations which is scheduled to open next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the new position by the Angolan government on
the peace process, namely Jonas Savimbi is a war criminal and the
UNITA Renovation Committee is the only legitimate dialogist with
the government on the accomplishment of Lusaka Protocol signed in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent a
letter to the Angolan authorities requiring that UNITA members
should return to the government of national unity and
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Miranda refused to comment on the letter, saying "it is not
the appropriate time. He (Annan) should have written the letter
earlier."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that government position is very fair, because it
agrees with the wishes of Angolan people. Only this could bring
peace to them," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign minister, the U.N. has failed to
complete its peacekeeping mission in Angola, mainly because it
has not carried out effective inspection on the disarmament of
the UNITA forces.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the U.N. is not to blame, since UNITA has always been
mocking the international community and the Angolan people.
However, one of its (United Nations') objectives is to disarm the
UNITA forces which it has failed to achieve," said Miranda.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly meeting will last till December,
during which the Angolan foreign minister will make a briefing on
the current situation in Angola and the implementation of the
Lusaka peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Over 200 Feared Dead in Philippine Ship Sinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 214 people were feared
dead when a passenger ship capsized and sank at the height of
Typhoon Vicki Friday night at the mouth of Manila Bay, the
Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, as of late afternoon Saturday, only thirteen bodies
were recovered while 232 others were rescued by ships of the
Philippine Navy, the Coast Guard and fishing vessels.
</P>
<P>
The M/V Princess of the Orient, owned by ferry operators
Sulpicio Lines Inc., was carrying 453 people on board, including
102 crew members. It was also carrying an undetermined load of
cargoes.
</P>
<P>
Rear Admiral Manuel de Leon, coast guard commandant, said that
search and rescue operations will continue as long as necessary.
</P>
<P>
Three Navy ships and three other rescuing vessels are still in
the area of the sinking in search of survivors.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated ship, with a capacity of 3,912 passengers, was
carrying 351 passengers, including 10 children, and 102 crewmen
when it sank in rough seas near Fortune Island, Batangas province
at nearly 11 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tropical storm Vicki, with 75 kilometer per hour winds, was
located about 320 kilometers northwest of Manila late Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the PCG headquarters in Manila, De
Leon said that the Coast Guard received a distress signal from the
ship at about 10:45 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Two Navy ships and a Coast Guard vessel immediately went to the
area to conduct search and rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
Big waves and heavy rains hampered the rescue operation.
Compounding the difficulty was the pitch darkness, rescuers said.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated ship, one of the biggest owned by Sulpicio Lines,
left Manila at 8 p.m. Friday for Cebu City in the central
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
About three hours after it left Manila, the radio operator of
the ship sent an SOS signal, saying that it was listing sideway to
the left.
</P>
<P>
That was the first and last radio message sent by the ill-fated
vessel, according to Arthur Lim, legal counsel of Sulpicio Lines.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary Sonny Coloma of the Department of Transportation
and Communications, said that the ship has an authorized capacity
of 3,912 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Iman Espino, 24, an apprentice engineer of the ship, said that
the incident happened so fast.
</P>
<P>
Espino said it was about 10 p.m. when the ship was buffeted by
big waves. Panic struck among the passengers when the ship listed
to the left, he recalled. The ship never recovered from that
position and sank rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The skipper, Captain Isrom Mahilum, was personally manning the
bridge as he tried in vain to guide his ship toward the shorelines
of Fortune Island.
</P>
<P>
Survivors said a big splash of wave to the side delivered the
coup de grace, as the giant vessel was swallowed to the water 300
fathoms deep.
</P>
<P>
Another survivor, Ernesto Ventura, 30, said the passengers
grabbed life jackets when they noticed that the ship was sinking.
</P>
<P>
The 232 survivors were brought to various hospitals in Metro
Manila after they were rescued.
</P>
<P>
De Leon said an inquiry board will be immediately formed to
investigate the cause of the sinking.
</P>
<P>
It was the third major sea disaster suffered by Sulpicio Lines
in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, more than 2,000 people died when the M/V Dona Paz,
also owned by Sulpicio Lines, sank near Tablas Island in central
Mindoro province. The Dona Paz sinking was the biggest sea
disaster this century.
</P>
<P>
The following year, 250 people died in the sinking of another
ship owned by the company, the Dona Marilyn.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Lim assured the victims and survivors of the M/V
Princess of the Orient that Sulpicio Lines will attend to their
immediate needs, including hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
Compensation for the victims will also be settled, he said.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Sessions Court here
Saturday sentenced two men to six months' jail each after they
pleaded guilty to committing acts of gross indecency by allowing
themselves to be sodomized by former deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Sukma Darmawan Sasmitaat Madja, 37, an adopted younger brother
of Anwar, and Munawar Ahmad Anees, 51, a Pakistani with permanent
resident status in Malaysia who wrote speeches for Anwar, admitted
that they had allowed Anwar to commit the sodomy, an offense under
the Penal Code, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama
reported.
Meanwhile, Anwar denied that he was involved in any of the
activities that he is accused of.
At a news conference here, he said that the guilty pleas by the
two men were made under "dire and cruel circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Anwar repeated that there was a political conspiracy at the
highest
level to destroy his political career "by means of character
assassination."
</P>
<P>
Anwar was sacked as deputy prime minister and minister of
finance on September 2 amidst allegations of sexual misconduct. He
was expelled from the ruling United Malays National Organization
of which he was deputy president, a day later for having "low
morals."

<P>
BAGHDAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi trade delegation led
by Director General of the Foreign Relation Department of the
Iraqi Trade Ministry Farouq Al-Abeidy left here on Saturday for
Damascus to pay a visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
The visit is designed to probe the ways of expanding economic
and trade cooperation between Iraq and Syria and reopening the
Iraqi trade center in Damascus after being closed for 18 years,
the Iraqi News Agency quoted Al-Abeidy as saying before departure.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Minister of Trade Mohammed Mehdi Saleh and Syrian
officials attended a ceremony on September 3 to open the Syrian
trade center at the Baghdad International Fair grounds and the
center has resumed its activities since then.
</P>
<P>
Iraq cut its ties with Syria in 1981 because of Syria's support
for Iran in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. A thaw in relations began
after Syria sent a trade delegation to Iraq in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The trade and economic ties between Baghdad and Damascus have
been developing remarkably since the reopening of the Iraqi-Syrian
borders in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the diplomatic ties have not been resumed so far. A
Syrian Foreign Ministry delegation is expected to visit Iraq
during the next few days to inspect the Syrian embassy here in a
prelude to reopening it.

<HEADLINE> Criminals Establish No-Go Zone in Johannesburg: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A number of buildings
in the central business district in Johannesburg have become
no-go zone, where even police and fire brigade personnel fear to
go, local daily Saturday Star reported.
</P>
<P>
The buildings have become islands of anarchy, occupied and
controlled by people, some them criminals, who effectively reject
law and order by not paying for services and bar entry to any
public officials.
</P>
<P>
Some of these buildings are the nerve centers from which
criminal gangs launch their robbery, theft and assault sprees,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Captain Andre de Klerk of the Hillbrow police said they found
it difficult to attend to complaints in these buildings because
there was always a possibili of attacks.
</P>
<P>
These buildings are housing illegal occupants and criminals
who use them as havens, De Klerk said, adding normally, at least
10 police officers enter the buildings, and only by day.
</P>
<P>
Dan Hurley, acting head of the fire safety division in
Johannesburg, said fire safety standards throughout the inner
city had deteriorated rapidly.
</P>
<P>
"There are buildings in the inner city where our inspectors
have been threatened with assault if they refuse to leave,"
Hurley said.
</P>
<P>
Sibusiso Buthelezi, a councillor in the Greater Johannesburg
Metropolitan Council, admitted there was a vacuum in the control
of some buildings and areas in the city.
</P>
<P>
He said the council was working with the police in enforcement
programs.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, Johannesburg's inner city has seen
exodus of companies to office premises in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
There is a general perception among business people that the
inner city is deteriorating, and that the place is no longer
suitable for business purposes.
</P>
<P>
Gerald Leissner, managing director of Anglo American Property
Services, the biggest owner of commercial buildings in the inner
city, said: "the main cause for business flight is poor
management of the city. If the city can get proper man agement, it
can still revive and flourish."
</P>
<P>
The police cite lack of manpower as the main impediment in
their fight against crime. They maintain, however, that crime in
the central business district has started to level off.

government, has also been fined 850,000 yuan because it occupied
more than seven hectares of forest land.
</P>
<P>
The destruction of forests has been regarded as one major factor
for the devastating floods in the country this summer.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese central government is urging related departments to
reintroduce vegetation and return field land to forests.

<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has ruled out an imminent reshuffle of the cabinet as mere
rumors, the Middle East News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Reshuffle is out of the question now. All reports in this
regard are just mere rumors, usually raised following summer
vacations in September and October of every year," said the
president in an interview to be carried by the weekly magazine
October on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I usually listens and laughs at such rumors since I know quite
well who launches these rumors and the motives behind them," he
said, apparently referring to Egypt's relatively liberal and
outspoken opposition press.
</P>
<P>
Ministers, governors, and parliament members of the ruling
National Democratic Party have often become targets of ridicule or
criticism by some opposition party newspapers, which try to jump
at every chance to humiliate the government.
</P>
<P>
"There should be strong reasons for any cabinet reshuffle,"
Mubarark added, denying dismissing any minister who "exerts
efforts and realizes the state's plan objectives."
</P>
<P>
He said his decisions are taken on the basis of objective
reasons for the good of the country, and called the reports on
cabinet reshuffle constitute "an act of instigation."
</P>

Egypt's last overhaul of the cabinet and the leadership of the

<HEADLINE> Third Plenum of Macao SAR Preparatory Committee Closes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Three documents concerning
Macao's future governmental bodies, pension system and public
holidays were passed today at the Third Plenary Meeting of the
Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region
(SAR) that closed today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee decided to establish the Independent
Commission Against Corruption, the auditing office and customs
office in the future Macao SAR, set forth opinions on the pension
payment of civil servants, and made arrangements on the region's
public holidays in 2000, according to the three documents.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the closing speech, Qian Qichen, vice-premier of the
State Council, said it is an important job of the Preparatory
Committee to decide the framework of the SAR governmental
institution on the basis of the principle in line with the Basic
Law of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
As the existing institutions and functions of the Macao
government fail to entirely comply with the Basic Law, it is quite
necessary to make some changes or readjustment on the name,
function and formation of these institutions, said Qian, who is
also chairman of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the civil servants' pension is a significant
issue in Macao's transitional period and is related to the
practical interests of civil servants and financial operation of
the future SAR government.
</P>
<P>
As the adoption of ideas on the pension payment at the meeting
demonstrates the concern of the Preparatory Committee, Qian voiced
the hope that the Portuguese side would fulfil its responsibility
and handle this matter properly.

<TEXT>
<P>
In referring to the decision of the Central People's Government
on stationing troops in the Macao SAR, the Preparatory Committee
members expressed their firm support to it. The People's
Liberation Army (PLA) troops stationed in the Macao SAR, which are
responsible for defense, will not interfere in the SAR's internal
affairs, and their expense will be covered by the Central People's
Government, Qian pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On the work prior to the Fourth Plenary Meeting of the
Preparatory Committee, Qian cited the most important and urgent
work as to study and work out a method of forming the Selection
Committee for the first SAR government.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Preparatory Committee shall set forth views on
how to define permanent Macao residents and right of abode, study
and make relevant suggestions on how to apply China's nationality
law in the Macao SAR and on how to determine the positions and
numbers of posts for the SAR principal officials, and establish a
special work group to make arrangements on celebrations upon
Macao's return to the motherland on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the end, Qian said the Chinese National Day and Moon
Festival will arrive in about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Reviewing the course of development of the People's Republic
of China over the past half a century, we feel proud of the
growing prosperity and progress of the motherland and are pleased
at the constant advancement of the great cause of its peaceful
reunification," he said, noting that Hong Kong has successfully
implemented the principle of "one country, two systems," whereas
Macao is advancing toward this goal.
</P>
<P>
As Chinese people will think all the more of their near and
dear ones on traditional festivals, Qian express the hope that the
people across the Taiwan Straits will increase exchanges, improve
relations, so as to achieve peaceful reunification at an earlier
date. "We are confident that the reunification will surely be
achieved with the unswerving efforts of both sides," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting also adopted a press communique, which decides
the next plenary meeting of the Preparatory Committee to be held
on November 6-7 in Zhuhai City in south China.

<HEADLINE> Flood-engaged China Prepares For New Typhoon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- China feels slightly relieved
with calmer rivers, with longer sections of the ferocious rivers
having their water levels dip below danger lines, but is growing
apprehended with more frequent typhoons.
</P>
<P>
The water levels at the upper streams till Hankou in the Yangtze
River have dropped below the danger line but the water levels at
the majority sections of the lower stream continue to remain above
the danger line, according to a press release from the State Flood
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters today.
</P>
<P>
The Nenjiang and Songhua rivers also have certain sections with
their water levels above the danger line.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that 1.1 million civilians and soldiers
are still stationed on these rivers' banks and dykes, searching
and tackling leaks and wounds that are still happening. At the
height of the crisis in August, over three million civilians and
soldiers were stationed along the rivers.
</P>
<P>
With the rivers returning to normal, typhoons are becoming
active along the southeastern coast of China, said the press
release.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Shanghai flood control headquarters said
that the No. 6 typhoon this year is pressuring on the city's
borders, likely to cause strong winds, heavy rain, high sea tide
and severe flood.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Deputy Mayor Han Zheng has called for a prompt check
and consolidation of billboards, road lamps, roadside trees and
dangerous houses as well as flood control facilities.
</P>
<P>
Some residents have been moved out of their dangerous houses in
the low-lying areas into safer places.

capital of Saudi Arabia, according to a report by the Kuwait News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Al-Salmiya scored its first goal in the 5th minute thanks to

Al-Helal pressed ahead and succeeded in scoring its first goal
in the 25the minute through its Nigerian forward Mooni, and drew
level three minutes later through veteran midfielder Yousef
Al-Thundayyan.
</P>
<P>
A 2-2 draw would have put the Kuwait squad into the next
round, but the Nigerian player of the Saudi Al-Helal spoiled that
by striking again in the 69th minute of play.
</P>
<P>
The two teams drew in the first leg in Kuwait 0-0 early this

LHASA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered a group of ancient cave dwellings in Ngari Prefecture,
the Tibet Autonomous Region.

<P>
The caves, which are scattered over an estimated area of 3,000
sq.m., have been described as the largest group of dwellings of
their kind thus far discovered in China.

Local historical documents include accounts of certain sites
which include scattered fortresses and cities.

<P>
Experts conducted extensive excavations which have yielded
dozens of wall paintings.

<HEADLINE> PNA: Ross Mission Failed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has said that the current 10-day diplomatic
mission of U.S. Mideast peace envoy Deniss Ross failed.
</P>
<P>
The PNA made this conclusion during its weekly cabinet meeting
in Gaza Friday night presided over by PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat,
said a statement issued by PNA in Gaza on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
No progress was made in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks
brokered by Ross, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement did no give details about the gap between the
Palestinians and Israelis on issues being discussed, but said
Arafat had already briefed U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright about Ross's current
mission.
</P>
<P>
Ross's current mission was mainly focused on Israel's troop
redeployments in the West Bank and security cooperation between
PNA and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who is to fly home later Saturday evening, has asked for
another meeting in Gaza with Arafat before departure to discuss
"technical issues" concerning the redeployment and security
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The PNA cabinet also discussed the shooting incidents occurred
in the territories and asked the Israeli government to take
measures to prevent such incidents from happening, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Palestinian student Rawhi Karabseh was shot to
death near Ramallah by a Jewish settler. This incident caused
further clashes and confrontations between the Palestinians and
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
As asked by Xinhua, a PNA official said Arafat will travel to
New York at the end of this month to address the U.N. General
Assembly, but no summit meeting is scheduled with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu even the U.S. has asked for that.
</P>
<P>
To break the deadlock of the peace process, Albright will hold
separate meetings in New York with Arafat and Netanyahu to
continue the U.S. mediation effort, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Central Government to Take on Military Expenditure of Troops to Be Stationed in Macao SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Central Government will
be responsible for the military expenditure of the troops to be
stationed in Macao after it returns to the motherland in December
1999, Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks at the closing of the third plenary
session of the Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
"The troops to be stationed in the Macao SAR for defense
affairs will not intervene in the internal affairs of the Macao
SAR and the military spendings of the troops will be born by the
Central Government," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Preparatory Committee have expressed full
support for the Central Government's decision to send troops to
the Macao SAR, calling it both a symbol of national sovereignty
and an important factor for the maintenance of stability,
according to Qian.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question at a press conference after the
closing of the session, Chen Ziying, secretary-general of the
Preparatory Committee, said that the Chinese Government has
officially notified the Portuguese Government of the issue of
stationing troops in the Macao SAR but has not yet received any
reaction from the Portuguese side.
</P>
<P>
Qian announced at a meeting on Friday that in accordance with
stipulations of the Chinese Constitution and the Basic Law of the
Macao SAR, the Central Government will, after Macao returns to the
motherland, station an appropriate quantity of well-trained troops
in the Macao SAR.

WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee of the
United States on Friday voted along party lines to release the
videotape of President Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony, along
with 2,800 pages of documents from the inquiry into his
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky. The materials were set to be
made public on Monday.
</P>
<P>
-- The Senate of the United States, for the second time in two
years, failed to override President Bill Clinton's veto of a ban
on a late-term abortion procedure that opponents call partial
birth. The vote was 64to 36, three fewer than the two-thirds
needed to override.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- As vote-counting neared completion and with Bosnian Serb
President Biljana Plavsic heading toward defeat by a hard-line
nationalist, Western officials on Friday began to assess the
damage, saying the election had dealt a severe blow to U.S.-led
efforts to rebuild Bosnia into a multiethnic country.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday formally accepted the
report of his advisory board on race, saying that despite
widespread criticism of its work, the panel has managed to nudge
the nation along the difficult road toward racial reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Lawyers Warn Gays of Prosecution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Law Association of Zambia
(LAZ) has warned the country's gays who are trying to register an
association that they risk being prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Government-owned Times of Zambia Saturday quoted LAZ president
George Kunda as saying that under Zambia's existing laws, no one
is permitted to be involved in unnatural acts like sodomy or
lesbianism.
</P>
<P>
He said the Zambian laws have to be respected because
currently the absurdity of one involving himself in sodomy or
lesbianism is as bad as having sex with an animal.
</P>
<P>
On the people who have come out in the open claiming that they
are gays, Kunda noted that they risk being prosecuted because it
is a crime under the land's Penal Code.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Zambia has to abide by its cultural behavior
which is guided by its laws and people have to be careful of what
they are fighting for because whatever is done reflects on the
country's culture.
</P>
<P>
In the past weeks, the Zambia Independent Monitoring Team
(ZIMT) has been campaigning for the recognition of gays rights
but the move has since raised a lot of dust.
</P>
<P>
At a consultative meeting on the rights of minorities in
Lusaka Thursday, ZIMT president Alfred Zulu, who said early last
week there are about 500,000 gays or lesbians in Zambia, claimed
that some senior government officials and parliament members are
also homosexuals and that some of them have even registered with
the newly-formed Lesbians, Gays and Transgeer Persons
Association (LEGATRA).
</P>
<P>
He further announced that LEGATRA will register next week
after presenting its manifesto to the Registrar of Societies and
other government departments or officials.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Ambassador to Zambia Jon Lomoy said Thursday in an
interview that Zambia could learn a lot from his country's
experience as far as rights of minorities such as gay people are
concerned.
</P>
<P>
He also said that tremendous changes of attitudes could be
achieved through sharing experiences.
</P>
<P>
In 1948, lesbian and homosexual activity was prohibited in
Norway but now it is against the law to discriminate lesbians or
homosexuals, according to the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
However, he said such an issue is connected to deep-rooted
cultural values.
</P>
<P>
The LAZ has advised Norwegian ambassador to respect Zambia's
laws.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Yamzho Yumco Power Station Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAHSA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Yamzho Yumco Lake pumping
power station in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region has
passed state examination and was transfered to the local people
after one-year trial operation at a ceremony here Friday.
</P>
<P>
A monument bearing the inscriptions "Building the Yamzho Yumco
Power State to Benefit the Tibetan People" written by Jiang Zemin,
general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee and president of the state, in 1990 was unveiled on the
same day.
</P>
<P>
The project, so far the largest power station in Tibet, was
built in eight years at a cost of 1.8 billion yuan (217 million
U.S. dollars). The project boasts an installed capacity of 90,000
kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The power station has raised Tibet's total installed capacity
to over 300,000 kilowatts and trebled the capacity of the Lhasa
power grid.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin made an inspection tour of Tibet in July 1990. He
stressed that energy resources and transport should be given top
priority in Tibet's economic development. He encouraged builders
of the Yamzho Yumco power station to do a better job and make
contributions to the prosperity of Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Nortel Seizes Foothold in China's Mobile Telephone Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States-based
telecommunications technology company Northern Telecom (Nortel)
has taken a foothold in China's expanding mobile communications
market by designing and building one of the country's first CDMA
network.
</P>
<P>
Nortel built the local mobile communications network in Xi'an
in northwestern Shaanxi province with its third-generation
IS-95CDMA technology. The equipment has had its receiving and
switching power specially enhanced to accommodate local
conditions. It supports 13,000 mobile telephone users in Xi'an
city and six surrounding prefectures.
</P>
<P>
Nortel built the project jointly with the Great Wall Mobile
Communications Company, a subsidiary of local Shaanxi Telecom.
</P>
<P>
This move is part of the all-round-strike strategy that Nortel
adopted after merging Bay Networks earlier this year. Sources from
Nortel said this is aimed to reinforce the company's leading
position in global CDMA market.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign companies are competing for the lion's
share of the mobile telecommunications market in China. China has
already developed GSM and ATM mobile communications equipment and
put them into mass production.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has decided to use home-made switches
in expanding the national backbone mobile communications network,
foreign companies, with the advantages of zero tariffs and
abundant resources, got an upper hand in selling their equipment
to local markets at provincial, city and county
levels. Forerunners in China market include Ericsson, Nokia,
Motorola and Nortel.
</P>
<P>
China now boasts over 20 million mobile telephone users. The
figure is expected to reach 40 million by the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> Iran's President Heads for U.N. General Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami left here Saturday for New York to attend the 53rd session
of the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly Monday
about Iran's positions and policies on regional and international
issues, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Khatami travels to the West since taking
office in August last year, leaving behind his country's tensions
with the Afghan Taliban militia due to the killing of nine Iranian
diplomats by the group last month.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 Iranian troops have been stationed at the
Iranian-Afghan border. Iran has threatened retaliation against the
Taliban by taking military actions.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the United States, Khatami will meet with
Iranian nationals living in the country, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear whether he would hold talks with U.S. officials
on improving bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Since he came to power, Khatami has called for dialogs with the
U.S. in a bid to remove the "wall of mistrust" between the two
archenemies. The U.S. has echoed the call in a positive manner.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-U.S. relations froze in 1979 after Iranian students
took hostage the U.S. embassy staff in the Islamic Revolution.
Iran has since been under U.S. economic sanctions.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, EU Trade Talks Break Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Free trade talks
between South Africa and the European Union (EU) broke up without
agreement Friday as the two sides wrangled over wine and food
exports, South African media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The position has been a very hard-line one from their side,"
said Elias Links, South Africa's ambassador to the EU and chief
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
"What we want is for the European Commission (the EU
executive) to come back with an agricultural offer improved," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The South African side had expected the European Commission to
make new concessions on opening the EU market to South African
exports of farm products such as cheese and milk, cut flowers,
and fresh and processed fruit.
</P>
<P>
But South African officials said they found to their dismay
that the EU refused to formally table a new agricultural offer
until progress was made on a separate wines and spirits accord.
</P>
<P>
Links blamed the collapse of the 21st round of talks on the
EU's insistence that South Africa stop labeling its fortified
wines as sherry or port. The EU says only Spain can produce wines
called sherry and only wines from the Portuguese city of Oporto
can be labeled as port.
</P>
<P>
South Africa claims it has used those terms for 300 years.
</P>
<P>
Although he expressed dismay at the lack of progress on the
package overall, Links said advances had been made on industrial
goods and he hoped talks could resume within the next couple of
weeks.
</P>
<P>
However, aside from the wine and food issues, a number of
other products remain sensitive, notably cars, chemicals and
steel.
</P>
<P>
Officials from both sides also indicated fisheries would be
difficult to resolve, with the EU demanding the right to fish in
South African waters in return for opening up EU markets to South
African imports.
</P>
<P>
"It's not in South Africa's interests to open up fisheries
resources in exchange for market access," said Bahle Sibisi,
South Africa's director of foreign trade relations.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders promised South African President Nelson Mandela
when they met in Cardiff, Wales, in June that a free trade
agreement would be completed by European Autumn.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Cases Keep Low in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Scores of cases of cancers were
recorded in every 100,000 people in Jordan last year, one of the
lowest rate in the world, official statistics said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The statistics issued by the Cancer Registry at the Health
Ministry said that a total of 3,302 new cancer cases were reported
in 1996, 74.3 in per 100,000 Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
Of the cancer patients, 52 percent were male and the rest
female. Out of the diseases, lung and bladder cancers haunted the
male while breast and colon-rectal cancers frequented the female.
</P>
<P>
There were 185 cases of lung cancer in male patients,
accounting for 10.9 percent of the man's cancer cases, while
bladder cancer cases stood at 168, or 9.9 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed that male Jordanians also suffered from
cancers related to colon-rectum, skin, non-Hodgkin's lymph,
prostate, brain, stomach and larynx.
</P>
<P>
Among the female cancer patients, 455 were suffering from the
breast cancer, accounting for 28.5 percent of the female cancer
cases, while colon-rectal cancers were at 111, making up 6.9
percent of the total, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
The statistics said female Jordanians were also hit by cancer
of skin, brain, thyroid and non-Hodgkin's lymph.
</P>
<P>
Experts have attributed the occurrence of cancer in the kingdom
to people's overuse of sugar and lack of exercises.

<P>
MAPUTO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Lagos Lidimo, chief of the
general staff of Mozambhcan defense forces (FADM), has said that
FADM is willing to send troops to join the interposition army in
Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
Lidimo held talks recently with military chiefs from the
Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) in Abidjan, Cote
d'Ivoire, on the current situation in the west African country,
according to Noticias newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lidimo disclosed to the press here Friday that FADM is now
ready to join the observation forces in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
However, Lidimo noted that only when the Bissau government and
rebels wish to understand each other, could the efforts to end
the conflict be successful.
</P>
<P>
The important thing is a ceasefire, then comes the deployment
of intervention 35rces, he added.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that military chiefs from the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) agree to divide Guinea Bissau
into five zones and send 5,000 troops to each zone, while CPLP
chiefs are for deploying intervention forces along the country's
border.
</P>
<P>
Now the issue has been handed over to the foreign ministers of
the countries concerned for discussion, he said.

<HEADLINE> 7 Killed, 250 Missing in Philippine Sea Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Seven bodies have been
recovered and more than 250 people are still missing Saturday
after a Philippine inter-island ferry sank in the rough sea in the
central Philippines, the Coast Guard said here.
</P>
<P>
According to Commander Feliciano Dy of the Philippine Coast
Guard, sketchy reports said rescuers picked up seven bodies,
including that of a five-year-old boy, offshore in Ternate town,
Cavite province.
</P>
<P>
A local radio quoted another Coast Guard officer as saying a
total of 178 people were rescued after nearly 17 hours of rescue
operations. But the remaining 266 people were still missing.
</P>
<P>
Rear Admiral Manuel de Leon, commandant of the Coast Guard,
said those rescued were brought to different places in Manila and
Cavite. Most of them are undergoing treatment at different
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The MV Princess of the Orient, owned by Sulpicio Lines Inc.,
was sailing from Manila toward Cebu City in the central
Philippines Friday night when it was slammed by big waves near
Fortune Island, Batangas province, about 100 kilometers south of
Manila.
</P>
<P>
The ship, which was carrying 351 passengers and 100 crew
members, dispatched a distress signal at 10:40 p.m. Friday, saying
it was leaning sideward.
</P>
<P>
That was the last communication the Coast Guard received from
the vessel. Two ships were immediately dispatched to the area.
</P>
<P>
The rescuers encountered difficulty in combing the area because
of big waves and heavy rain brought by typhoon Gading.
</P>
<P>
Two navy patrol ships were combing the area for more survivors
and sailors reported seeing empty life boats and lights in the
distance but described the seas as "very rough."
</P>
<P>
Rose Velasco, a town mayor and a leader of the rescue
operations, said there are still some people in the sea riding in
life craft. But he said the rescuers cannot get closer because of
big waves.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the real cause of the accident has yet to be
determined. But they said typhoon Gading, which caused strong
winds and big waves, maybe a main reason.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, France to Organize World Meeting on Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and France will invite
25 countries in two weeks to a world "conference for peace-loving
nations" to seek a solution for the faltering Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Countries invited to the conference include the United States,
Russia, European Union (EU) nations, Morocco, Saudi Arabia as
well as Jordan, according to Jordan Times Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, the conference will exclude Israel, the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA), Lebanon and Syria in the initial
stage, diplomatic sources said to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The sources explained that the exclusion of these key players
in the Middle East peace process is due to the awareness that
Israel will not attend such an international peace conference and
thus other players should not be invited too for the sake of
balance.
</P>
<P>
However, the conference will be followed by a smaller gathering
for those directly involved in the peace process, they said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will reiterate the danger of not moving ahead
with the implementation of the signed agreements and demonstrate
international support for peace in the region, which should be
based on the principle of land for peace, they added.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats insisted that the Egyptian-French initiative
appears to gain momentum and may get its chance, especially at a
time when the U.S. failed in its latest efforts to persuade Israel
to accept its peace proposal, under which the Jewish state is
asked to withdraw its troops from 13.1 percent of the occupied
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders of Egypt and France have stressed that their
joint plan is not meant to compete with the U.S. proposal
and it will not occur until the U.S. announces its failure
to press Israel to accept its proposal, the Jordan Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government showed little enthusiasm for the
initiative, as its Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross said here
last Wednesday that the administration only wanted to concentrate
on its own peace proposal.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats remained skeptical whether the Egyptian-French
initiative will finally take off if the U.S. and Israel do not
give their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israel peace talks deadlocked last March
due to the Jewish settlements in Arab East Jerusalem. Peace
talks on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks were stalled for
months, too.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Will Face Israel with Solidarity: Syrian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries will deal
with the Israeli intransigent policy toward the Middle East peace
process with solidarity and cooperation with Europe, Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Sharaa has said.
</P>
<P>
In remarks to the Kuwaiti Arabic daily, Al-Qabas published
on Saturday, Al-Sharaa said, "Israel will be faced with Arab
solidarity and steadfastness and cooperation with Europe."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to resolutions of the meeting of the
Arab League Ministerial Council which concluded in Cairo on
September 17.
</P>
<P>
The council urged the international community to impose
sanctions on Israel in response to its arbitrary policies on
the Middle East peace process, press the Israeli government to
implement U.N. resolutions and honor all the agreements it
signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"We have called for imposition of a political-economic
blockade on Israel because stand of (Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin) Netanyahu has not changed," Al-Sharaa said.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has been stalled since March
last year as the Israeli government refused to abide "land for
peace" principle in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Asked how he evaluates the U.S. stance on the peace
process, the Syrian foreign minister said, "the American stand
is unstable but we are waiting for possible developments."
</P>
<P>
On possibility of holding an international conference on the
Middle East peace process which was proposed by Egyptian and
French leaders, Al-Sharaa indicated that such a meeting required
efficient preparation to ensure practical results.

<P>
JAKARTA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has been exploiting
only 62 percent of its marine potentials, Antara News Agency
Saturday quoted the Agriculture Ministry's official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's annual fish production has been recorded at only 3
million tons, compared to its potential to produce 6.18 million
tons per annum, said the ministry's Director General for Fishery
H. Untung Wahyono.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Indonesia has 1.9 million hectares of waters
which could be developed into fishing grounds that could yield 42
tons per 100,000 hectares per annum.
</P>
<P>
Wahyono pointed out that despite the economic crisis,
Indonesia's fishing industry has grown by 5.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
Annual earnings from fish exports have reached 2 billion U.S.
dollars, he said, adding that with the development of more fishing
grounds, the figure could increase to 10 billion dollars in the
next five years.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Sends Relief Aid to Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Saturday further provided
humanitarian aids to flood-ridden Sudan.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian plane carrying 30 tonnes of food, medicine and
other relief goods flew to Sudan early in the day, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has provided its southern neighbor with 137 tonnes of
relief goods since August after the heaviest floods in centuries
inundated 119,000 houses and left 204,000 families homeless in 10
Sudanese states.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's 15-year civil war and the ensuing famine also have left
2.5 million go hungry and millions more displaced.
</P>
<P>
The situation was aggravated after the United States launched
air attacks last month on a facility near the Sudanese capital
Khartoum, which Sudan says is a pharmaceutical factory providing
the country with 50 percent of its needs for medicines.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-Sudanese relations have been improving steadily after
year's of disputes over Egypt's claims that Sudan was helping
Islamic militants trying to overthrow its secular government and
replace it with strict Islamic rule.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan in Awkward Position Amid Growing Iran-Afghan Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- With no thaw in sight over
its persistently strained relations with arch rival India,
Pakistan finds itself delicately poised amid growing tensions
between its two strategically important Muslim neighbors -- Iran
and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Events across our western borders could lead to a situation
disastrous for Islam. Therefore statesmen from the Islamic world
should act to resolve the situation in time," Pakistan's Army
Chief General Jehangia Karamat has said.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to avoid a possible conflict between Iran and
Afghanistan, Islamabad has stepped up its diplomatic efforts to
realize conciliation between the two Muslim states.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz's visit to Tehran on Thursday came
against the backdrop of a stern warning sounded by Iran's supreme
leader Ayatollah Khamenei about "a huge threat of war in the
region over Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Iran has so far deployed more than 200,000 troops along the
border with Afghanistan following the killing of nine of its
diplomats by the Taliban militia in the northern Afghan town of
Mazar-i-Sharif, the former stronghold of the anti-Taliban Northern
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
"So far I have prevented the raging of a fire in the region,
which is not easily extinguishable. But all should know that the
threat is very huge and widespread and very near," Khamenei, who
is also supreme commander of the Iranian Armed Forces, said as
Iran put its armed forces massed on its northeastern borders with
Afghanistan on high alert.
</P>
<P>
Iran's top leader said war could only be averted by "forcing
the Pakistani army to stop interference in the internal affairs of
Afghanistan and by forcing Taliban leaders to abide by logic and
reason and stop their catastrophic acts and compensate for the
past errors."
</P>
<P>
Pakistani leaders have repeatedly denied any involvement of
aircraft and armed forces in the Taliban's recent military
actions.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman has said Pakistan is in no way
involved in the Afghan-Iranian tension. Denying charges of
Pakistan's involvement in the latest trouble, the spokesman said
such reports were being circulated by disgruntled elements who
wanted to see the relations between Pakistan and Iran tarnished.
</P>
<P>
"We respectfully state that no Pakistani troops or aircraft
were involved in the Afghan conflict," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Government sources here said Foreign Minister Aziz's visit to
Tehran was aimed at trying to defuse the tension and allay Iran's
apprehensions in regard to Pakistan's role. However, the Iranian
side felt it had not been taken into confidence.
</P>
<P>
With Tehran not accepting Islamabad's denial of military
involvement in Afghanistan, Pakistan has offered to establish a
bilateral commission with Iran to determine the nature and level
of external interference in that country.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Iran and the Taliban militia mounted after the
militia admitted that its "renegade" followers had killed nine
Iranian diplomats and a correspondent of the state-run Iranian
News Agency in Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban last month captured the strategic town in a series
of their stunning victories against the pro-Iranian opposition and
took prisoner several Iranian truck drivers who Tehran said were
engaged in humanitarian activities in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
The Nation, an Islamabad-based English daily, said editorially
this week that "Pakistan should go an extra-mile to allay Iran's
apprehensions, convince the Iranian leadership of its good
intentions, and try to revive the age-old relations that have now
touched its lowest ebb."
</P>
<P>
Islamabad should also use whatever leverage it might have with
the Taliban militia to convince its leadership of the urgency to
resolve its differences with Iran, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that any conflict between Kabul and Tehran is
bound to be disastrous for the entire region. The threat must not
be taken lightly, particularly by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
From Pakistan's point of view, a war in the region would be
disastrous for two reasons. First and foremost, given the present
state of the economy, Pakistan is not in a position to fight a
war.  And second, as pointed out by General Karamat, a war in the
region would render it "insecure" and thus would undermine its
tremendous economic potential not only for countries within the
region but also for those outside it.
</P>
<P>
The tension between Iran and Afghanistan remains high as Iran
refuses to withdraw troops from its border. The Iranian side
reiterated that it will only do so unless the Taliban apologize
for the killing, apprehend and extradite to Iran those responsible
and repatriate the bodies of the remaining personnel.

<HEADLINE> Regions Inject Massive Funding in Water Conservation Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Two south China provinces
have vowed to inject massive funding into improving water
conservation facilities following this summer's devastating
flooding.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong Provincial Government plans to invest 1.7 billion
yuan (about 204.8 million U.S. dollars) from provincial coffers
and use one billion yuan from a treasury bond issue to reinforce
river levees and sea walls.
</P>
<P>
This developed province was hit by heavy flooding in June, with
floodwaters adversely affecting over 2.67 million local residents,
causing direct economic losses of more than 7.49 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The neighboring Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region plans to
invest 700 million yuan to improve 30 major reservoirs and
introduce irrigation to an additional 13,300 hectares in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi also plans to allocate 11.2 billion yuan over the next
few years to build water conservation facilities in Baise City,
improve irrigation facilities and reinforce 30 reservoirs.

<HEADLINE> Tension between Turkey, Libya Eases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has expressed
satisfaction with Libyan efforts to ease the recent tension
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Libyan Ambassador to Ankara Mansur Muhammed Bedir
conveyed a written note to the Turkish Foreign Ministry,
explaining that the Libyan authorities had no previous knowledge
of a group of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) parading
in the celebrations, local Daily News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey recalled its Ambassador Mufit Ozdes to Libya for
"consultations for an indefinite period" to protest Libya's
permission to the PKK group to march in a ceremony marking the
anniversary of the the Revolution on September 1 by wearing
national dresses and carrying PKK flags and pictures of PKK
leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Libya expressed regret over the incident, stressing that an
immediate investigation had been launched in order to find and
punish those responsible.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a statement issued by the Turkish Foreign
Ministry as saying that "we see this explanation as positive".
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish
state in the southeast of Turkey. More that 35,000 people have
been killed in the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Libya, among other countries, of supporting
the PKK. Reports said that some 400 PKK members are believed based
in the North African country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Parties Politicize Flood Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Political parties in Bangladesh
have been trying to benefit from the country's prolonged flood
which started hitting the South Asian nation in early July by
politicizing the situation.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains coupled with onrush of upstream waters began to
strike Bangladesh in early July submerging vast areas of the
country, leaving millions homeless and hundreds of people dead.
</P>
<P>
In July, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told her people that they
must learn to live with the floods and in August, she said, "We
will be able to tackle the flood situation by our own resources."
</P>
<P>
Hasina was unwilling to appeal for international assistance
despite the fact that in normal years, the country has an official
annual food shortage of around 2 million tons and the shortfall
would rise sharply whenever a heavy flood occurs inundating and
washing away large tracts of standing crops.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the motive behind was an attempt of the
ruling party, the Awami League, to create an image of "competent"
government, and at the same time deliberately downplay the extent
and damage caused by the deluge to prepare for the month-long
programs to mark the death anniversary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,
the first prime minister of independent Bangladesh and father of
Hasina.
</P>
<P>
It was not until late August that the government, seemingly
realizing the severity of the flood, began sending danger signals
to the world community for help and aid in cash and kind.
</P>
<P>
The official relief operations have been conducted by
ministers, members of parliament of the ruling party and ruling
party workers, a report in the latest issue of the Courier weekly
magazine said, reportedly focusing on their constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the opposition in the parliament and Chairperson of
the Bangladesh Nationalist Party Begum Khaleda Zia accused the
government of "failing to stand by the flood-hit people" and of
corruption in relief distribution. "The relief goods received for
the affected people went to the houses of Awami Leagues," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"The government's relief campaign is only confined to the
state-run television camera. Their relief camera activities stop
after taking the camera snap," a report in the Bangladesh Observer
on August 29 quoted Zia as saying.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, repeatedly accusing the government of
mismanaging relief materials, called for the establishment of an
"All-Party Flood Relief Committee," a proposal the government has
turned down.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think such a committee is needed as the government has
been handling the relief activities efficiently since the current
flood began," Press Secretary to the Prime Minister Jawadul Karim
said on August 17. The ruling party accused its opponents of
reaping political benefit out of the flood.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on September 8, Finance Minister Shah
A.M.S. Kibria denied mismanagement charges in the distribution of
relief materials, saying the government was following "the
time-tested method" of relief distribution.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that if that was true, the government should not
be afraid of setting up the "all party relief committee,"
incorporating all efforts to undertake and oversee relief
activities and to prove wrong allegations of irregularities and
pilferage in distribution of relief goods.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister also ruled out any possibility of food
scarcity after floods in the country as there was "sufficient
stock of food" and more food aid was "in the pipeline" from donor
countries and international agencies. But fears of a possible
famine were in the air, the observers said, as according to some
experts, the estimated crop losses would be as high as around 2.5
million to 2.7 million tons instead of 2 million tons as predicted
by the government.
</P>
<P>
The government had so far obtained commitment of 172.5 million
U.S. dollars of assistance in cash and kind for emergency relief
and post-flood rehabilitation work, far below the requested 879.5
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
A report in the Finance Express newspaper on August 17 said
some donors would rely on non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
for distribution of relief goods, in response to allegations of
thefts and pilferage of relief materials by people in charge of
the operation. Another report said some donors wanted to launch a
rehabilitation program through NGOs.
</P>
<P>
About 60 million people have been affected directly or
indirectly and more than 1,000 have died so far during the
catastrophic floods that wrought havoc in 52 out of the country's
64 districts.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day session of country's parliament on September
7 and 8, Hasina appealed to all concerned for massive relief work,
both at home and abroad, by "sinking all difference."
</P>
<P>
She called on the nation to stand united, bury politics and
save the people from this freak of nature, as "this is not the
time to find fault or mistake of others. This is the time to rush
to the floating people." Khaleda Zia reciprocated warmly by
saying, "We're ready to cooperate with the government because
people and country are more important to us than party and
politics."
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding, there has neither been any coordinated move on
large-scale emergency relief to the worst-affected people nor any
planned steps for the post-flood rehabilitation program, according
to another report in the Courier magazine.
</P>
<P>
"The national leaders must forge national unity so much so that
the whole nation can work as one man, and the miserable situation
now prevailing in the country demands nothing less than a kind of
momentum which is attained in times of national warfare...," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
It is now the right time for both of the ruling party and the
opposition to be on the same platform appealing for help to the
unfortunate people, overseeing the utilization of relief goods and
providing the needed sympathy and moral strength to the people for
rebuilding whatever they have lost, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Blasts Israeli Threats Against Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Saturday that the Israeli leadership cannot prevent
the Palestinians from pursuing their right to establishing an
independent state, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
As long as no progress has been made in the peace march,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can never prevent the
Palestinian people from exercising their legitimate right to
self-determination, Moussa said before leaving for New York to
attend the 53rd session of the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
If Netanyahu blocks any progress in the peace talks with the
Palestinians and puts hurdle in the implementation of the signed
agreements, serious frustration among the Palestinians will be
prompted, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks stalled in March 1997 after
Israel began construction of a Jewish settlement in traditionally
Arab East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of
their would-be independent state.
</P>
<P>
The talks are currently stuck over the long-delayed Israeli
further withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by the deadlock in the negotiations, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat has made it clear that the Palestinians will
declare an independent state next May when the Oslo Accord expires.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of Arab foreign ministers held on Wednesday and
Thursday in Cairo, Arafat called for Arab support for the
Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has threatened possible annexation of parts of the
West Bank by Israel if Arafat goes ahead with the plan.
</P>
<P>
Egypt "completely differs" with Netanyahu, who alleged that the
proclamation of the Palestinian state would blow up the Mideast
peace process and abandon all the agreements signed between the
Palestinians and Israel, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that tangible progress would be made in
ending the deadlock in the peace process after United States
Mideast envoy Dennis Ross decided to extend his mission in the
region, which started on September 9.
</P>
<P>
"I wish that Ross would succeed in his mission and (help) reach
a balanced agreement (between the two sides)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ross initially planned to end his mediation between Arafat and
Netanyahu Friday. But he decided to stay on until Saturday night,
hoping to make headway towards a deal.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis have yet to come to terms on a
reported U.S. proposal for Israel to withdraw from a further 13
percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted the proposal, but Israel is
balking at it citing security concerns.

<HEADLINE> Susi Susanti Gets Pregnant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Olympic badminton gold
medalist Susi Susanti of Indonesia has got pregnant, which
stopped her from an Asian Games singles title bid before her
retirement, a local report said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Kompas daily quoted Susanti as saying that: "This is God's
will. Even though I didn't try to get pregnant, now I do. This is
to me a blessing I must treasure."
</P>
<P>
"I am not disappointed ... I guess I have gained a lot as a
badminton player," said Susanti, 28.
</P>
<P>
Susanti, who also won four-time All England and world
champions, said On July 19 that she wanted to retire to start a
family, but that she first she would take one last crack at the
elusive singles title in the 13th Asian Games in Bangkok in
December.
</P>
<P>
At the time she said she had been "vexed" by the Asian games
title, which she has never gained.
</P>
<P>
Susanti took the 1992 Olympic gold medal and married
co-Olympic gold medalist Alan Budikusuma on February, 1997.

<P>
MANILA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have ended
their three-day meeting and agreed to meet again next month, the
Philippine News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice-chief for political affairs, was
quoted as saying the two sides decided to end their meeting Friday
in Cotabato City, capital of southern Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will continue to discuss problems with regard to
the identification of MILF-controlled territories in Mindanao,
Jaafar said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier during their meeting, both sides agreed to strictly
adhere to a settlement to re-position their respective troops in
Buldon, Maguindanao, to avoid future armed engagements.
</P>
<P>
The move came after a series of mortar shelling from both sides
in Buldon despite an earlier local cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed on a five-kilometer "safe" distance
for their respective troops in the area.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the larger Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) which signed a peace treaty with the
government in 1996. The government wants a similar peace accord
with the MILF.

<HEADLINE> Construction Activity Declines in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Construction activity in
New Zealand suffered a further decline in August.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released here Saturday by Statistics New
Zealand, the number of new dwellings authorized for construction
fell to 1,478 in August from 1,648 in July.
</P>
<P>
Residential consent activity has been subdued throughout 1998,
with the number of new dwellings now reduced to a level last seen
in April 1995.
</P>
<P>
During 1997 the number of new dwellings authorized in a month
regularly exceeded 2,000 while this figure has only been reached
twice in 1998 so far.
</P>
<P>
Gradually weakening construction activity reflects the economic
recession in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Many local economists are of the view that the economic
recession in New Zealand is worse than the government thinks. The
Bank of New Zealand predicted that the official figures would show
that New Zealand's economy shrank by 1.3 percent in the second
quarter of this year, which would be worse than the official
forecast of 0.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> More Than 170 Rescued in Philippine Sea Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, September 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 175 survivors of a
sunk Philippine inter-island ferry were rescued Saturday by
Philippine Navy and Coast Guard vessels, the Coast Guard said
here.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers also recovered a body from the sea. But the remaining
275 people were still missing nearly 20 hours after the passenger
ship sank Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Rear Admiral Manuel de Leon, commandant of the Coast Guard,
said 14 were picked up by rescuing fishing boats and already
brought to Navotas, Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Navy also rescued dozens of others while the
Philippine Marines saved 17.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers said it is difficult to count the number of survivors
since there are many boats participating in the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
The MV Princess of the Orient was sailing from Manila toward
Cebu City in the central Philippines Friday night when it was
slammed by big waves near Fortune Island about 100 kilometers
south of Manila.
</P>
<P>
The ship, which was carrying 351 passengers and 100 crew
members, dispatched a distress signal at 10:40 p.m. Friday saying
it was leaning sideward.
</P>
<P>
That was the last communication the Coast Guard received from
the vessel. Two ships were immediately dispatched to the area.
</P>
<P>
The rescuers encountered difficulty in combing the area because
of big waves and heavy rain brought by typhoon Gading.
</P>
<P>
Two navy patrol ships were combing the area for more survivors
and sailors reported seeing empty life boats and lights in the
distance but described the seas as "very rough."
</P>
<P>
Rose Velasco, a town mayor and a leader of the rescue
operations, said there are still some people in the sea riding in
life craft. But he said the rescuers cannot get closer because of
big waves.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the real cause of the accident has yet to be
determined. But they said typhoon Gading, which caused strong
winds and big waves, maybe a main reason.

WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Oscar De La Hoya beat
Julio Cesar Chavez Friday night before Chavez's corner signaled
to quit the fight after the eighth round of their WBC
welterweight title bout in Las Vegas, the United States.

Chavez was bleeding from month and nose and had cuts over both
eyes. In the last minute of the eighth round, his corner signaled
to referee Richard Steele that Chavez would fight no more.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time De La Hoya stopped Chavez. Two years
ago, he beat Chavez in the fourth round to win the junior
welterweight title.
</P>
<P>
"You did it. You did it," Chavez told De La Hoya as the two

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian countries
endorsed a plan for cooperation in food, agriculture and forestry
at the end of a two-day meeting on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by the agriculture and forestry ministers
from the member countries of the Association of the Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), aimed to work out strategies to enhance
regional food security and international competitiveness of ASEAN
products.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement released later said the meeting had achieved
positive results.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the ministers discussed the impact of the
Asian economic crisis and expressed grave concern over a rapid
increase in unemployment, poverty and in some cases shortage of
food in the wake of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis, coupled with climate changes in the
region, have hampered the performance of agriculture and forestry
sectors in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers called for stronger cooperation within ASEAN to
ward off the negative effects.
</P>
<P>
The 20th ASEAN ministers of agriculture and forestry meeting
opened Thursday in Hanoi. The annual meeting of the highest level
is aimed at boosting regional cooperation in agriculture and

<HEADLINE> Rubber Plantation in India Hit by Economic Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Among the four main
plantation commodities in India, natural rubber has been the worst
hit by the economic slowdown in the country in the past 18 months,
the Observer of Business and Politics said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Its main consumers-- tyre and automotive industries-- have been
reeling under demand recession. The government's policies to allow
import of second-hand tyres as well as arbitrary import of
different grades of rubber for making specific products have not
only led to lower offtake of the commodity, but also caused a
slump in prices even as supplies are exceeding demand.
</P>
<P>
The situation is so alarming that a majority of rubber planters
in Kerala State in the far southwestern India, which accounts for
93.5 percent of the 585,000 tons of production, are faced with an
uncertain future with no signs of demand picking up. Worse still,
even during the lean season between February and August when
tapping of trees is halted on account of monsoon, prices remained
slack.
</P>
<P>
The declining offtake of rubber by the passenger car sector
since the previous financial year has led to high inventories.
Tyre manufacturers have put a freeze on sourcing their raw
material.
</P>
<P>
According to projections made by the Rubber Board, the total
supply of rubber in 1998-99 is expected to reach 791,000 tons
while demand is likely to be 700,000 tons, leaving an excess
supply of 91,000 tons as against 51,000 tons the previous year.

<HEADLINE> 10 Tamil Rebels Killed in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- At Least 10 Tamil rebels were
killed Friday in fighting in the north and east of Sri Lanka
between the rebels and government troops, a military spokesman
said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Ink Dewage said government troops operating ahead of
defenses confronted a small group of rebels Friday afternoon at
Pulmaichchi Atikulam in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
The troops retaliated, killing at least two rebels and injuring
three others during the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
On the same day during daytime east of Mankulam, north of
Olumadu areas, government troops sniped and killed three rebels,
Dewage said.
</P>
<P>

rebel bunkers, killing four rebels while one soldier was injured
during the incident, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In another incident Friday morning at Nasivanthi in Batticaloa
district in the east of the country, troops ambushed and killed
one rebel, Dewage added.
</P>
<P>

in the north and east of the country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Online Grocery Market in U.S. Still Immature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Despite projected sales
of 10.8 billion U.S. dollars, the online grocery market in the
United States will represent less than 2 percent of consumer
packaged goods revenues in 2003, according to a market forecast
report.
</P>
<P>
The report released this week by the market analysis firm
Forrester Research, said that online grocery sales will continue
to be held back by limited geographic availability, delivery and
membership fees, a small target audience and uncertainty about the
market itself.
</P>
<P>
Forrester researchers said that the market will remain tiny in
the next five years. Although packaged goods manufacturers are
gearing up to sell directly, the report said, convenience-driven
shoppers are still not used to online sales. "Manufacturers should
continue to sell through grocers both on-and off-line," Forrester
suggested.
</P>
<P>
The online grocery market can be divided into full-service and
speciality sellers. The former sells a complete range of grocery
products via a PC, phone or fax. The latter offers a limited
selection of gifts, hard-to-find items or bulk replenishment
products via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Constrained by the costs and limitations of delivering fresh
and frozen products to a limited audience of high-income online
families, Forrester said, full-service providers are currently
struggling to develop a profitable operating model and gain
critical mass in a few key markets.
</P>
<P>
Despite a compounded annual growth rate of 92 percent over the
next five years, full-service grocery sales will only reach 4.5
billion dollars in 2003 in the United States, less than one
percent of total industry sales, Forrester predicted.
</P>
<P>
But Forrester expects the speciality category, driven by online
gift sales, to climb to 6.3 billion dollars by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Although the market is small right now, Forrester researchers
said that the prospect of 15 million households making speciality
purchases online will prove too important to ignore.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers will look for ways to exploit the Web, like building
loyalty, learning more about the buying habits of online consumers and
driving off-line sales through online promotions, Forrester said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Forrester's study, companies attending the American
Marketing Association's annual research conference this week
agreed that the Net has become a boon for marketers.
</P>
<P>
For companies in need of marketing information, researchers
attending the meeting said, the Internet offers a means of
reaching consumers who can respond at their own leisure.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Vows to Raise Kashmir Issue at U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
said Saturday that he would forcefully present Pakistan's case in
his address to the United Nations, drawing the attention of the
world community to the pressing issues like Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the media before his departure for New York via
Copenhagen, Sharif said that during his address to the U.N.
General Assembly and his individual meetings with government
leaders, he would raise all those issues which help establish
peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about his scheduled talks with his Indian
counterpart, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in New York, Sharif said he
would ask for substantive dialogue on the core issue of Kashmir,
which is the main cause of conflict between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan will continue its efforts to resolve all the
issues peacefully and through the process of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, would not change its policy, even after
becoming a nuclear power. Pakistan has always been trying to have
better relations with India, by removing the differences, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his scheduled meeting with Iranian President
Muhammad Khatami, Sharif said it would help reduce existing
tension between Iran and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, would try its best to bring the state of
confrontation to an end.
</P>
<P>
With this objective, the prime minister pointed out, he had
sent Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz to Tehran to discuss ways and
means to remove misunderstanding between Pakistan and Iran and
reduce tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Sharif hoped that the efforts of his government would be
successful and peace and security will prevail in the region.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said that during his stay in New York,
Sharif will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, Iranian President Khatami, Turkish Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz and others.

<HEADLINE> Poland Reports Economic Growth in First Eight Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Poland's economy continued to
grow in the first eight months this year despite effects of
Russia's financial crisis, the government's Strategic Research
Center said in a report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said, however, that economic growth started
to lose momentum in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months this year, the country's industrial
production was up by 7.9 percent, compared with the same period
last year, while labor productivity increased by 8.3 percent and
housing construction sector by 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
In foreign trade between January and July, Poland's exports
grew at a faster pace than its imports, keeping its trade deficit
on a safe level.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose by 20.1 percent to 17.8 billion dollars and
imports by 15.3 percent to 24.8 billion dollars, leaving a deficit
of 7 billion dollars, 4.6 percent more than the corresponding
period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months this year, unregistered border trade
earned 3.5 billion dollars, up 11.4 percent from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Poland's foreign exchange reserves stood at 27 billion dollars
by the end of August, 6.3 billion dollars more than the volume at
the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
Direct foreign investment in the first half of the year
exceeded 5 billion dollars, the equivalent of last year's total.
</P>
<P>
The government is expecting foreign investment to hit 30
billion dollars in total by the end of the year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The country's employment is also improving, with the jobless
rate falling to 9.5 percent from 10.3 percent at the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted several negative factors in an otherwise
rosy picture. The country's inflation rate was 10.6 percent in
the first eight months this year, compared with 9.6 percent in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Lower economic returns were recorded in Polish enterprises,
especially in the coal mining sector.
</P>
<P>
In addition, enterprises were burdened by debts between 9
billion and 10 billion dollars, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said Friday that the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe should
intervene to settle the political crisis in Albania.
</P>
<P>
"It will be mainly up to them" to intervene for the restoration
of normalcy in that Balkan country, Dini said in Bari, a southern
port city across the Adriatic from Albania.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Albanian parliament's decision to lift immunity
from prosecution of opposition Democratic Party leader Sali
Berisha, Dini said it would be "a mistake" for the Albanian
government to authorize the arrest of Berisha because this would
"only increase the difficulties and tensions" in the Balkan
country.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek
will lead a high-level mission to Albania on Saturday to seek ways
to end the violence in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Geremek, chairman of the OSCE, will be joined by Greek
Alternate Foreign Minister George Panpandreou on behalf of the
Council of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Albania's Socialist-led coalition of Prime Minister Fatos Nano
has accused former president Berisha of trying to overthrow the
government during serious unrest on Monday sparked by the murder
of popular deputy leader of Berisha's Democratic Party, Azem
Hajdari.

said, quoting TFB's labor union president Worachart Asantarit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of labor unions and employees of all 15
banks, Worachart said the government should intervene to prevent
further aggravation of employees' financial burden.
</P>
<P>
He threatened to call strikes if the banks' management do not
revise their plans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state-owned Krung Thai Bank (KTB) is expected to
lay off a number of staff following the merger with First Bangkok
City Bank and Bangkok Bank of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Senior managers of KTB said the bank's current work force is
15,000 and will swell to 19,000 when the merger is completed.
</P>
<P>
BBL, currently the country's largest commercial bank, has
announced that the bank will relaunch its early-retirement program
late this year.
</P>
<P>
In the previous round introduced earlier this year, about 2,000
employees were encouraged to quit. As of June 30, the bank had
23,800 workers on its books.
</P>
<P>
Despite the unions' call for government intervention, Bank of
Thailand Governor Chatumongol Sonakul stressed that salary cuts
were unavoidable as Thai banks need to compete with other players,
particularly foreign banks.

<HEADLINE> 30,000 Tickets Sold for Holyfield-Bean Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 tickets
have been sold for the IBF-WBA heavyweight title fight between
Evander Holyfield and Vaughn Bean in Atlanta Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It is the biggest fight in terms of attendance ever held in
Holyfield's hometown. "When I was a kid I didn't pay any
attention to boxing unless I was boxing," said Holyfield, who at
eight began boxing in age-group competition.
</P>
<P>
Boxing fans have long paid tribute to Holyfield and now he
became more popular after beating Mike Tyson twice.
</P>
<P>
"He's a good champion, a good guy," said Joe Frazier, the
former heavyweight champion, who is helping train the 25-year-old
Bean. "The world looks up to him. He's a clean guy. He ranks
right up there with all the great champions."
</P>
<P>
Bean, who built a 32-1 record fighting inferior
opponents,said: "I don't think he's overlooking me. He loves his
job."
</P>
<P>
The bout is being held because Bean is the IBF's No. 1
contender and Holyfield would be stripped of that organization's
title if he didn't take the fight.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield is guaranteed 3.5 million U.S. dollars by Showtime,
and because of the good ticket sale he should make 5 million.
Bean is able to get 1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield gained 11 million and 35 million in the two fights
against Tyson, and his payday for the Moorer fight was 20
million. All three of the bouts were pay-per-view.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China
(CPC) and the Chinese government attach great importance to
developing relations with Vietnam, a visiting senior CPC official
said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau and the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, stressed
the importance at a meeting with General Secretary of the
Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Le Kha Phieu.
</P>
<P>
Wei said a long-standing Sino-Vietnamese friendship not only
accords with the common aspirations and fundamental interests of
the two peoples, but also contributes to peace, stability and
development in the Asia-Pacific region and even the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples are good neighbors
with a long history of friendship, recalling their mutual support
and close cooperation during the struggle for national
independence and liberation.
</P>
<P>
Wei lauded the continued progress in friendly relations between
the two parties and two states in recent years, with frequent
exchanges of high-level visits as well as expanding and fruitful
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The CPC official briefed the CPV chief on China's political and
economic situation and applauded the CPV's efforts in leading
Vietnam to a sound economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Phieu noted that the Vietnamese people would never forget the
support of the Chinese people and the CPC during the years of
struggle against imperialist aggression.
</P>
<P>
The two peoples, working for the same goal of a strong economy,
have many common interests and can learn a lot from each other,
said Phieu.
</P>
<P>
He said the CPV highly values its relations with the CPC and is
determined to consolidate and develop the friendly cooperation
between the two parties, the two states and the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Phieu also briefed the Chinese visitor on Vietnam's reforms and
opening to the outside world while praising China's achievements
in its reforms.

Later in the day, Wei met with his Vietnamese counterpart Pham
The Duyet for discussions on relations between the two parties and
the two states.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Provide Emergency Aid to China's Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
will launch its first-ever emergency relief operation in China to
help flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The operation will reportedly cost 87.7 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Millions of people have been forced to flee from their homes
because of floodwater. They are living in temporary shelters on
dikes and in public buildings and are in desperate need of
international relief assistance," said WFP Deputy Executive
Director Namanga Ngongi on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of WFP's emergency operation is to provide food and to
help these people rebuild their homes and the local infrastructure
which were destroyed by the floods," he added.
</P>
<P>
WFP plans to provide 247,214 metric tons of rice to 5.8
million people in the most seriously affected townships of Hunan,
Hubei, Anhui and Jiangxi provinces. The flooding has been the
worst in China since 1954.
</P>
<P>
Continuous rains since March 1998 have caused vast flooding in
central China, affecting 223 million people, or one-fifth of
China's population, mostly along the Yangtze River and in
Northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete government statistics show that by the end of August,
some 1.3 million hectares of crops and five million houses were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
WFP, the food aid organization of the United Nations, became
operational in 1963. It provides relief assistance to victims of
natural and man-made disasters, and supplies food aid to people in
developing countries to help stimulate self reliance within
communities.

<HEADLINE> NBA Wizard's Star Decides to Sue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Washington Wizards
forward Juwan Howard has decided to sue a Connecticut woman who
falsely accursed him and former teammate Chris Webber of sexually
assaulting her, an attorney said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Howard is not interested in money. He wants the good name and
reputation he's had for most of his life restored," said Mitchell
Rubenstein, the attorney representing Howard in the action filed
last June. The lawsuit filed in Montgomery County, seeks 20
million U.S. dollars in damages.
</P>
<P>
"Any individual that has been falsely accused of a crime such
as this one can assume that it has damaged his reputation and
value as a marketable celebrity," said Rubenstein.
</P>
<P>
Howard has not lost any endorsement contracts since Melissa
Reed, 25, claimed she was sexually assaulted at a party at
Howard's suburban Maryland home on April 6.
</P>
<P>
Howard and Webber, who has been traded to the Sacramento
Kings, denied any wrongdoing and after hearing testimony from
Reed and many of the 40 people who attended the party, a
Montgomery County grand jury returned no indictments.
</P>
<P>
Following the grand jury meeting, Reed's lawyer Ned Collier
said his client testified that she went to a room with Webber and
was struck, cutting her lip, then restrained by one of four
people present in the room before being sexually assaulted.
</P>
<P>
Rubenstein says that Howard remains committed to clearing his
name, and wants to continue with the action although monetary
damages may be difficult to recover.

most of his playing career with Portland Trial Blazers before
moving into the team's front office, Friday was named vice
president of basketball operations for the Cleveland Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers selected Paxson in the second round of the
1979 NBA draft. He spent 10 seasons in Portland, playing in two

offensive skills coach. He went on to serve as special assistant
to the president and assistant general manager.
</P>
<P>
"His new position with us is a logical progression in Jim's
career development," said Cavs president Wayne Embry. " He fills
a need we have had for some months to bring somebody on board who
can coordinate our efforts with respect to scouting, player
acquisition and development. That will be Jim's focus.
</P>
<P>
"I have no intention of retiring anytime soon," Paxson said in
a statement released by the team. "The Cavs have a very bright
future and I want to remain part of that. The only thing I know
for certain is that whenever I end my career, I want it to be
with the Cleveland Cavaliers."

<HEADLINE> Immunity lifted from Berisha But No Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Albanian state prosecutors did
not make any immediate efforts Friday to arrest the opposition
Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha after he was stripped of his
parliamentary immunity.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of the parliament voted on the same
day to remove Berisha's immunity and turn the matter over to
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Berisha is accused of attempting a coup by taking advantage of
the serious social unrest sparked by the assassination of
opposition leader Azem Hajdari.
</P>
<P>
Albania's chief prosecutor Arben Rakipi said they were still
investigating the case before deciding on what to do next.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Berisha reacted by vowing that he will not be
daunted by the loss of immunity and will continue his fight to
oust the government led by prime minister Fatos Nano, even from
jail.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to accept any sacrifice," he said.
</P>
<P>
He continues to call for daily mass street protests until the
Nano government steps down.
</P>
<P>
Tensions still surrounded Tirana on Friday as the government
suspected a possible riot in the name of Hajdari. On the same day
last year, Hajdari was injured in parliament by a gunshot.
</P>
<P>
Armed police set up dozens of road blocks leading to Tirana,
turning back many vehicles and allowing only those with Tirana
license plates to pass.
</P>
<P>
Inside the city, tanks and police cars were everywhere. A huge
concrete barricade protected the entrance to the Democratic Party
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the Democratic Party staged protests in Tirana
and the northern city, Shkoder, with police watching closely, but
no violence was reported.

<HEADLINE> Yibin Continues Massive Afforestation Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YIBIN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Yibin, a city in the upper
reaches of the Yangtze River in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, has planted trees on 250,000 hectares and turned
previously barren hills green over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The city's forest coverage has jumped dramatically from 86,000
hectares in the late 1970s to 340,000 hectares, up 29.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
Yibin has gained the distinction as the No. 1 City on the
Yangtze due to the 600 rivers and streams which flow through the
surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
Excessive logging has seriously damaged the city's forest
resources, leaving only 86,000 hectares of forest coverage by the
end of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The local government has adopted dozens of policies and
regulations to encourage local farmers to plant trees over the
past 20 years, in addition to introducing overseas investment and
exploring ways to improve tree species.
</P>
<P>
Yibin's 300 forestry enterprises had a combined output value of
two billion yuan (240 million US dollars) in 1997, or 15.2 percent
of the city's total gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The city's landscaping and afforestation projects reduced areas
affected by soil erosion so as to cut the silt to be carried to

<HEADLINE> China Uses Overseas Funds to Plant More Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- As floodwaters in the
Yangtze River and the Dongting Lake in central China are receding,
the people around the Lake have prepared to plant 30,000 hectares
of trees to preserve soil and protect the levees.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of the funds of this five-year tree planting
project will be provided by Germany, according to local official
sources.
</P>
<P>
The second work meeting on Sino-German joint afforesting the
Dongting Lake area ended here Friday, and the the project will
soon start.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the German government promised to provide China with
a grant of 60 million Deutsch Marks a year for environment
protection, among which 40 percent will be used in afforestation.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, these funds have been used in planting trees in 10
Chinese provinces and regions, such as Shaanxi and Hunan provinces
and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to incomplete statistics, Germany, Japan, Australia,
Canada, New Zealand, Finland and the Netherlands have provided 400
million U.S. dollars to China's forestry undertaking and related
industries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the World Bank has also provided China with loans of
about 800 million U.S. dollars for afforestation. Many of China's
provinces and major nature reserves have benefited a lot from such
international aid.
</P>
<P>
Forestry experts said, however, the scale of China's direct use
of overseas fund in forestry is, at present, still very small.

<HEADLINE> Oil Pipeline Sabotage Pollutes Rivers in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of barrels
of crude oil spilled into the waters of four rivers located near
the border area of Colombia and Venezuela as a result of a
terrorist attack on the Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Colombian official sources said Friday the affected rivers are
the San Miguel, the Sardinata, the Tarra, and the Catatumbo.
</P>
<P>
The National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas are suspected of
the sabotage.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian and Venezuelan government have prepared emergency
plans to prevent the crude from reaching the Gulf of Maracaibo via
the rivers.
</P>
<P>
Colombian oil pipelines have been the target of more than 50
terrorist attacks, almost all of them committed by the ELN, which
claims the attacks are attempts to prevent the plunder of natural
resources by trans-national companies.

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Manager Denies Bid for Shearer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Arsenal manager Arsena Wenger said on Friday that he did not bid
for striker Alan Shearer of the Newcastle United.
</P>
<P>
Shearer, 28, who joined Newcastle from Blackburn for 15
million pounds (25.20 million U.S. dollars) two seasons ago, was
linked with a 20 million pounds (33.60 million U.S. dollars) move
to Highbury after his agents Tony Stephens and Jon Holmes were
spotted arriving at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
But Wenger said on Friday that no negotiations had taken place
and that he had no intention of signing the player.
</P>
<P>
Wenger said: "We are not close to signing anybody and we're
not close to signing Alan Shearer at all.
</P>
<P>
"I read in all the newspapers that Newcastle want to keep him
and it's just illusion that he will be coming to Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
"Shearer's a good player but at the moment it's important to
keep Nicholas Anelka as first choice because he's 19 years old
and it would nearly close the door for him. I don't want that."
</P>
<P>
Shearer has been linked with a host of clubs since Ruud Gullit
took over at Newcastle on August 27, but ironically after a lean
start to the season, he scored three times in Newcastle's last
two matches against Southampton and Partizan Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal have found goals hard to come by this season, scoring
just four times in six matches, and strikers Dennis Bergkamp and
Anelka have yet to find the target since Anelka scored in the
Charity Shield against Manchester United five weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
But Wenger insisted he will keep faith in the French teenager,
who missed a string of chances in the European Champions' League
1-1 draw at Lens on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal meanwhile on Friday did introduce the player they hope
will help bring the goals flowing back: 21-year-old Swedish inte
rnational Fredrik Ljungberg, who starred in Sweden's 2-1 European
Championship defeat of England earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal paid 3.0 million pounds (5.04 million U.S. dollars)
for the attacking midfielder and he may make his first appearance
in Sunday's Premiership clash against Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
French midfielder Emmanuel Petit is doubtful for Sunday's
match with Wenger giving him only a 40 per cent chance of
recovering from an ankle injury picked up against Lens on
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urged to Form Special Council on Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's advisors on race told him on Friday that significant
racial disparities and discrimination still exist in the nation
and a special presidential council should be formed to deal with
race issues.
</P>
<P>
An advisory council on race completed a 15-month assessment of
race relations in the country by concluding that while progress
has been made, much more is needed as the population shifts from
primarily whites and blacks to increasing numbers of Hispanics and
Asian Americans.
</P>
<P>
"For more than two centuries, we have been committed to the
ideas of freedom and equality, but much of our history has been
defined by our struggle to overcome our steadfast denial of those
ideals and instead start to live by them," Clinton said in
accepting the report from the advisory council.
</P>
<P>
"When we approach others with discrimination and distrust, when
we demean them from the beginning, when we believe our power can
only come from their subjugation, their weakness or their
destruction, as human beings and as citizens, we pay a terrible
price," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The report by the seven-member board found that "significant
racial disparities and discrimination continue despite more than
30 years of civil rights laws and some progress directly
attributable to affirmative action and other programs."
</P>
<P>
Throughout America's history, the board said, white privilege
allowed blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, Asians, certain
European immigrants and religious groups to gain only limited
acceptance, usually after painful, hate-generated conflict.
</P>
<P>
The report said, "the goal of creating a more just and unified
society requires continued leadership from the office of the
president."
</P>
<P>
The advisory board urged Clinton take the lead in educating
people about that history and how an inferior status was assigned
to people of color.
</P>
<P>
It recommended stricter enforcement of civil rights laws,
improved data collection on racial and ethnic discrimination and a
strengthening of laws against hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1990 Census, 73 percent of Americans were
white, 11 percent Hispanic, 12 percent black, four percent Asian
Pacific American and one percent American Indian and Alaska Native.
</P>
<P>
The projected figures for 2050 say 53 percent of the population
will be white, 25 percent Hispanic, 14 percent black, eight
percent Asian Pacific and one percent American Indian and Alaska
Native.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "We must build an America where discrimination is
something you have to look in the history books to find."
</P>
<P>
He also announced a one billion U.S. dollars program to provide
loans for minorities and women who either want to start a business
or just began operating one.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- English Premier league club
Tottenham Hotspur chairman Alan Sugar rejected a new takeover bid
for the club on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sugar, owner of 40 percent of its shares, announced last month
that he wanted to sell his controlling interest, but has now
turned down two bids.
</P>
<P>
The first came last week from leisure company ENIC and the
latest, which offered an increased price per share for 29.9
percent of the company, was from a consortium including
journalist and TV presenter Richard Littlejohn.
</P>
<P>
"Alan Sugar described me and our bid as a fantasy but it was
very much based in reality," said Littlejohn on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We offered Alan Sugar the chance to leave Tottenham with his
head held high but he has turned us down.
</P>
<P>
"However, this may not be the end of the matter," he said.

<HEADLINE>   FIFA Chief Vetoes Video Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- World soccer governing body
FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Friday welcomed England's plans to
introduce full-time referees next season but vetoed video aid on
disputed goals.
</P>
<P>
The English premier league plans to become the first to
introduce professional referees and is considering using
technology to help officials make decisions when there is a
dispute over whether the ball has crossed the goal line.
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely delighted that the premier league is
looking at introducing professional referees," said Blatter who
has been calling for full-time referees for several years.
</P>
<P>
He said that soccer's International Board, the law-making body
of the game, had given English officials the go-ahead to study
the development of new technology but experimenting with it in a
major league was another matter.
</P>
<P>
"That is four or so steps down the road," Blatter said. "The
referee should remain the sole authority on the pitch."
</P>
<P>
FIFA is keen to protect the referee in an age when every
controversial incident is studied by an array of television
cameras.
</P>
<P>
The world body is also against England's idea of having
sponsorship of officials' kit.
</P>
<P>
Premier league referees's officer Philip Don said on Friday
that officials would try to persuade Europe's governing body UEFA
to permit sponsorship of officials' kit.
</P>
<P>
Don said footballing authorities could pay for a small group
of professional referees but that sponsorship would probably be
needed to pay for all referees to be fully professional.
</P>
<P>
But Blatter said: "There is a FIFA rule from 1987 which says
that there should be no advertising on referees' jerseys. There
is enough money in the game to take some percentage (of the
costs) from the clubs and federations."

<HEADLINE> Fuzhou's Overseas Investment Up 29 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 19 (Xinhua) -- This capital of southeast
China's Fujian Province reported 780 million U.S. dollars in
contracted overseas investment in the first eight months of this
year, a rise of 29 percent from a year ago, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
During the January-August period, Fuzhou approved 352
overseas-funded projects, with total investment valued at 1.4
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two figures were 21 percent and 11 percent, respectively,
greater than the comparable figures of last year.
</P>
<P>
The growth in contracted overseas investment is especially
significant considering the negative impact of the financial
crisis in Southeast Asia, which used to be a major source of
overseas investment in Fuzhou, a city official said.
</P>
<P>
"The fallout of the financial crisis has been partly offset by
our effort to attract investment from Europe, the United States
and Japan," he added.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges World Powers to Shoulder Responsibilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday called on the industrialized nations to do
their part in seeking a global solution to the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the end of the two-day high level
dialogue of the General Assembly on the impact and policy
responses to globalization.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the crisis cannot be solved unless the
industrialized nations shoulder their responsibilities and resolve
to work with others to find solutions which take the interests of
all countries into account," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The conference saw tens of speakers debating on how to take
advantage of ever growing globalization in terms of more trade and
investment flows and how to fence off its side-effects on
developing economies.
</P>
<P>
The forum took place against a backdrop of severe recessions in
many countries, slowing world economic growth and chain-reaction
financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"If something has been wrong, up to now, it is that developing
countries have too often been passive rather than active
participants in the search for a collective response to
globalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the Asian economic crisis, the exports value of
developing countries are expected to fall 8 percent from 1997
following the collapse in commodity prices, and in the African
case, the figure could be as high as 15 percent, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Those figures imply terrible hardship for millions of
individuals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Terming it as "the first major crisis of globalization", Annan
said the crisis is becoming global and threatening to further
widen the gap between the rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
"We have somehow to maximize the benefits and to protect those
who are in danger of becoming victims," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the developed countries to increase flows of
official aid and take swift action to reduce the debt burden on
the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations has a unique and indispensable role
to play in helping forge a global response to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We have, I believe, a special responsibility to insist on the
need for global solutions, based on global rules that are
fair to all," the Secretary-General noted.

<HEADLINE> IMF Okays Three-Year EASF Loan for Bolivia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Friday okayed a three-year loan under the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) equivalent to about 138
million U.S. dollars for Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to support the country's economic program
for 1998-2001. The first annual loan of some 46 million dollars
will be disbursed in two equal semiannual installments, the first
of which is available immediately.
</P>
<P>
The government's program for 1998-2001 seeks to achieve a big
reduction in poverty through faster economic growth and stronger
social programs. Economic growth under the program should increase
from 4.5 to 5 percent in 1998 to 5.5 to 6 percent by 2000, while
gross international reserves should remain at about 6.5 months of
imports, and inflation is expected to decline to 6 percent in 1999
and 5.5 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia joined the IMF in December 1945. Its quota is about 173
million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF credits totals
about 248 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Congress Agrees to Satellite Export Control Shift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- House and Senate
negotiators announced Friday that they had agreed to shift the
satellite export control back to the State Department in a major
challenge to the administration's current policy.
</P>
<P>
The decision, part of a compromise defense bill, came as a
result of efforts by the House and Senate to reconcile their
versions of the Pentagon financing measure.
</P>
<P>
The satellite provision requires full House and Senate approval
and if President Bill Clinton would also agree, the licensing
jurisdiction over commercial communications satellites would be
transferred back to the State Department in mid-March 1999 from
the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
Clinton moved the final licensing responsibility out of the
State Department in 1996 at the request of American satellite
manufacturers and some congressmen. The Republican-dominated
Congress, worried about possible missile technology transfer to
China, want the State Department to resume control over satellite
export.
</P>
<P>
Congress have set up some 10 committees to investigate the
allegations that launching American commercial satellite atop
Chinese rockets have eventually enhanced China's military
capability. Both China and American satellite exporters have
denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representative have voted to ban flatly future
satellite exports to China before the inquiries conclude. But
because of objections from some Senate Democrats, the House
provision was dropped.
</P>
<P>
The decision followed a Senate hearing Thursday with the
presence of senior officials from the State, Defense and Commerce
Departments.
</P>
<P>
The officials at the hearing defended the current export
policy. William A. Reinsch, under secretary of commerce for export
administration warned that putting the State Department in charge
would delay the licensing process, and put American satellite
companies at a competitive disadvantage with foreign rivals.
</P>
<P>
"This will hurt American companies with no national security
benefits," Reinsch said, According to "The New York Times."
</P>
<P>
He said Commerce Secretary William M. Daley would urge
President Clinton to use his veto. It is unknown how the president
would react.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton and his top national security aides insisted
that the new procedures under the Commerce Department did not
relax export controls or threaten national security. But it is
feared that Clinton's troubles from the Monica Lewinsky scandal
have weakened his support on Capital Hill.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Second Annual ESAF Loan for Cameroon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) announced here Friday the approval of the second annual
loan for Cameroon under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF), equivalent to some 74 million U.S. dollars.

<P>
The loan is provided in support of the government's program for
1998/99. The loan is available in two equal semiannual

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Compensate Bombing Victims in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The victims of the
August 7 bomb blast that killed 11 and injured many others in the
country, will soon be compensated, a U.S. official said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Vivian Derryck, assistant administrator of Bureau for Africa
of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
made the statement on his second day of his four-day visit to
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Derryck, who arrived in the country Thursday, said this while
handing over a batch of medical supplies to the Muhimbili Medical
Center (MMC) which played a major role in treating the injured
after the bombing happened.
</P>
<P>
The medical supplies, worth 100,000 U.S. Dollars, were handed
over to the Minister of Health Dr. Aaron Chiduo.
</P>
<P>
The supplies include surgical gloves, various types of
suturing materials, syringes and cotton wool, among others.
</P>
<P>
She said the United States is working on how the victims
should be compensated, without giving details. Eleven people were
killed and more than 70 others were injured after a bomb blast
rocked the U.S. embassy in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Derryck once again expressed her country's appreciation for
Tanzania's swift response to the incident.
</P>
<P>
She said despite lack of medical supplies under a tremendous
strain from the disaster, the MMC staff were able to handle and
provide excellent care to the victims.
</P>
<P>
At the hand-over ceremony, the minister said the tragedy was
an eye opener to Tanzania and that there is a need to handle
disasters with modern equipment with concerted efforts.

<HEADLINE> Berger: U.S. Foreign Policy Not Distracted by Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said Friday the
U.S. was not so preoccupied with the Monica Lewinsky scandal that
it would ignore foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a grave mistake for any foreign leader or any
group to believe that if the United States' interests are
threatened, the United States would not respond in a firm and
united way," Berger told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government did not let Clinton's political crisis get
in the way when it launched the missile attacks in response to
bombings at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, said Berger.
</P>
<P>
"We had strong bipartisan support for doing that and I believe
that... when America's interests are at issue, that Republicans
and Democrats generally come together to do the things that have
to be done," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Clinton denied that the scandal has
decreased his ability in implementing foreign policies. He said he
never stopped and will not stop in leading the country on foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Iraq are at odds over U.N. weapons inspections,
and the U.S. has not ruled out the use of force to make Baghdad
cooperate with the U.N. inspection team.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also faces the challenges of terrorism. Washington in
August used cruise missiles to hit guerrilla training camps in
Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan suspected of
producing a chemical used in nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
Clinton prepared to go to New York Sunday to begin three days
of focus on foreign policy centered on the U.N. General Assembly
session.
</P>
<P>
He will deliver a speech to the General Assembly Monday that
will include recommendations on how the international community
can enhance its fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Berger said Clinton will stress that with the spread of
information technology and the potential spread of weapons of mass
destruction, there is a "greater degree of common responsibility"
for nations to join against the threat.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton wanted to make it clear that "the fight against
terrorism is not a clash of civilizations or cultures."
</P>
<P>
"The dividing line is between those who practice, support and
tolerate terror, and those who understand that terrorism is plain
and simple murder," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Clinton will meet Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi about the growing refugee crisis in the embattled Serbian
province of Kosovo and tensions in Albania.
</P>
<P>
After his speech Monday, Clinton will meet with Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif to encourage him to take steps to slow
Pakistan's nuclear arms race with India.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is also expected to meet Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi about security issues and stress the urgency of action to
boost Japan's economy to stimulate growth across Asia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Fails to Overturn Clinton's Abortion Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Friday
failed to override President Bill Clinton's veto of a ban on a
late-term abortion procedure.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 64-36, three short of the two-thirds required to
overturn a presidential veto, a similar result to the May 1997
Senate passage of the bill.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen Democrats and 51 Republicans voted for the override,
while four Republicans and 32 Democrats joined to sustain the
veto.
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the ban tried in the past year to gain support
from the final three votes they needed, but no senators changed
sides, although the vote was not along straight party lines.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has vetoed the ban twice since 1995, but has said he
would support a modified version that would allow the procedure to
be used when necessary to protect a woman's health.
