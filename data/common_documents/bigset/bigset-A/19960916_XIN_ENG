<HEADLINE> China's Artists Facing Possibility of Unemployment for First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Artists are preparing
to say farewell to a life of security and the first group of
unemployed is expected to be seen in Beijing in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Tian Junyi, deputy director of the Arts Bureau under the
Ministry of Culture, said today that some performers have left
their jobs and face the possibility of unemployment, as a result
of a newly introduced examination system this year.
</P>
<P>
"This is an indication that a great change has taken place in
the relation of the state and the artists, thanks to the market
economy. The tenure system which existed in art circle for several
decades is coming to an end," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The examination system was initiated in January of this year in
a dozen state-level units of ballet, symphony orchestras, opera,
and Peking Opera. By early September, more than 1,400 artists had
taken part in a series of examinations.
</P>
<P>
About 120 people found themselves without jobs as a result of
poor performance or for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
A new personnel center is now providing living expenses for
these people. If they do not find work before a certain date, they
will no longer qualify for assistance from the center.
</P>
<P>
Although the number is small, these will be the first group of
artists to face unemployment, said Jiang Fengyi, deputy director
of the Personnel Department of the Culture Ministry, who noted
that, "Previously, all artists were fed by the state. A troupe
could not dismiss a staff member at will."
</P>
<P>
Zhao Jichang, a stage supervisor and former director of several
state troupes, said that the new system was first tried in
enterprises, and its application to artists shows that the
economic reforms are now touching the fields of culture and
ideology.
</P>
<P>
Tian said that two things that will influence China's artists
are beginning to appear: one is the introduction of a market
economy, the other is the use of contracts.
</P>
<P>
Luo Na, a former singer with the Oriental Songs and Dance
Ensemble, said that although they face the prospect of
unemployment, artists can have greater freedom protected by the
law. They are free to move and free to choose where they want to
develop their special interests and talent.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the state troupes will be followed by reforms in
other troupes around the country, Tian said, and that both fine
arts and literature are expected to be affected.
</P>
<P>
Most artists from state troupes are expected to take the exam,
according to Tian, who said that "this shows that the artists are
supporting the reform and are devoted to art."

<HEADLINE> Election Legitimacy Not Judged By Bosnian Muslims: Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALE, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Bosnian Serb official
today said that it is the international community not the Muslim
ruling party that will decide the legitimacy of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Jovan Zametica, the advisor to the Serb acting President
Biljana Plavsic, told reporters that Muslims "are not judges and
planners" of Saturday's elections, but the international community
and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
are.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to the charges by the Muslim
authority on Saturday night that the Serbs were manipulating the
elections and thus the Muslim government would not recognize the
outcome of the elections.
</P>
<P>
"We have OSCE here and it will be the judges of these
elections," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
OSCE is charged with responsibility to organize and monitor the
first post-war general elections in Bosnia. More than 2,000
international and domestic observers had been recruited to monitor
the 4,600 polling stations all over the country.
</P>
<P>
"Let's hope that wiser council prevail and that we are heading
for a period of peace and prosperity," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary results, 60 to 70 percent of the 2.9
million eligible voters cast ballots Saturday, including 20,000
Muslim refugees and 6,000 Serbs who crossed the ethnic-borders to
vote in the place of their origin.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, an OSCE official said Sunday in
Sarajevo that the Serb authority had instructed their officials to
stop counting votes from elections early in the day because of the
Muslim protest. But the counting resumed in the afternoon after
the misunderstanding between the Serbs and the OSCE was cleared.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Elections to Boost Peace in Balkan: Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic said in meeting with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
today he is upbeat on the peace prospects in former Yugoslavia,
which is being enhanced by Saturday's Bosnian elections.
</P>
<P>
"We have good reason to be optimistic for the future
development of the region," since the peaceful elections created
"the conditions so that all future initiatives and decisions are
taken by legally-elected bodies," said Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims -- the three former
enemies in Bosnia -- Saturday peacefully chose their collective
presidency, a parliament, national and regional institutions under
the U.S.-broked Dayton peace accord reached last November.
</P>
<P>
Both Milosevic and Holbrooke, the author of the Dayton accord
ending the four-year Bosnian ethnic war, said the elections were
"the best test of the success of the Dayton peace accords," the
official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said he hoped "all forces on the political scene...
will achieve a successful cooperation", make new-style governing
institutions emerge in Bosnia after the vote work, and try to
recover the war-torn economy in the whole region as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's complex and multi-tier polls around Bosnia have
paved the way towards lifting the UN economic sanctions on Federal
Yugoslavia, which comprises Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, former U.S. assistant secretary of state, had just
ended his tour of polling stations on both Muslim-Croat federation
and Serb republic terrain.
</P>
<P>
He will return to Sarajevo later today to see Bosnian President
Alija Izetbegovic and then travel to Brussels tonight to brief
NATO commanders before returning to the United States to report to
President Bill Clinton and the U.S. Congress.

<HEADLINE> UK Businesses Against Single European Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain's businessmen strongly
oppose a single European currency, saying that it would push up
unemployment, taxes and interest rates, according to a survey to
be published this week.
</P>
<P>
The survey of directors of almost 400 stock-market companies
shows that 58 percent to 37 percent of businessmen are against
Britain joining a single currency.
</P>
<P>
British directors are far more sceptical about the single
currency than their European counterparts, and the majority of
them see only adverse consequences from the single currency, the
survey indicates.
</P>
<P>
Most of them believe that unemployment would rise, taxes go up,
interest rates rise, public borrowing increase, investment drop,
and trade with countries outside Europe decline.
</P>
<P>
They also think that with a single currency, Britain's ability
to compete with the rest of Europe would diminish and that Britain
would be less able to compete with America and the Pacific Rim
countries.
</P>
<P>
As for the City's ability to compete as an international
financial center, 50 percent to 29 percent of the businessmen
surveyed said a single currency would be adverse for London.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Parliamentary Election Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's five-phase
parliamentary election, which started on August 18, ended today
with the last round of the election held in eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Some 410,000 voters were called on to cast their votes at 903
polling stations in the Sunday elections in Beqaa, which has been
a stage of repeated Israeli air raids at bases of Shiite Moslem
guerrillas in retaliation for casualties of Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Election officials put the turnout at some 30 percent in the
last and fifth round of elections, the lowest among the five
rounds of elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the maximum polling rate registered at some stations
amounted up to 60 percent, when the minimum was put at only 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
At stake in Sunday's elections were eight seats reserved for
Sunni Moslems, three for Greek Catholic Christians, three for
Maronites, two for Greek Orthodox Christians, one for Druzes and
one for Armenian Orthodox Christians.
</P>
<P>
Of the 134 candidates competing for the 23 seats allocated
for the constituency, 57 belonged to four electional coalitions
and 77 were independents.
</P>
<P>
The strongest coalition was the "List of National Concord and
Unity" comprising candidates of Lebanon's two major Shiite
groups, the Amal movement of House Speaker Nabih Berri and the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, as well as others.
</P>
<P>
But the 23-member coalition was not a "monolithic bloc"
because of its ingredients, including a nephew of President
Elias Hrawi, two allies of Premier Rafik Hariri and six
ministers in the government, as well as some figures who have
rarely agreed to anything in the past.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah had three candidates and two
allies in the coalition, which was only formed after Syria, the
main power broker in Lebanon, mediated a compromise between the
moderate pro-Syrian Amal movement and the fundamentalist
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Quarrels between the parties continued until the last moment,
forcing Damascus to exert pressure for the birth of a joint list
of candidates.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah lost one seat in the first round of elections in
Mount Lebanon and another in the third in Beirut, but won four
seats in the forth in south Lebanon last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It has eight seats in the outgoing 128-seat parliament, which
was created in the last election in 1992, the first since
Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war ended.
</P>
<P>
Syria had earlier intervened to bring about a coalition in
south Lebanon between the two rival Shiite groups, which won 21
of the 23 seats in the elections last Sunday, leaving two to
Bahia Hariri, sister of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, and another
to Hezbollah-backed candidate.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Defends Decision to Allow US Warplanes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today again defended
its decision to allow U.S. warplanes to use its air bases, saying
that the current circumstances have forced Kuwait to do so.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
Egypt's port city of Alexandria, Kuwaiti Deputy Premier and
Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah told reporters
that Kuwait has allowed the U.S. to base eight Stealth bombers in
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait wants to defend itself and is free in its decisions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
It was on the second consecutive day that Sheikh Sabah
defended Kuwait's decision to allow U.S. air forces to be based
there.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, he said in Cairo that Kuwait has a right to use
forces of friendly countries to defend itself against any threats.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to stress that Kuwait is a sovereign country
that has a right to call any troops of a country with whom we
have an agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official today denied that there are U.S. ground
forces passing through the Kuwaiti territories.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has accused Iraq of posing threats to it, and the
U.S. is sending more ships, warplanes and troops to the Gulf amid
high tension between the U.S. and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah attended the 106th regular meeting of Arab
foreign ministers and an emergency meeting of the ministers in
Cairo Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The emergency meeting was called by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to discuss ways to push forward the stalled Arab-Israeli
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Iran Says It Shelters 60,000 Iraqi Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today
that it has sheltered 60,000 Iraqi Kurdish refugees in six camps
in three western provinces.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Husseini, director general in charge of foreign national
affairs at the Interior Ministry, said that the Iranian
government has spent 20 billion Iranian rials (about 11 million
U.S. dollars) on the refugees issue.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official made the statement in the western city
of Baneh, according to the state-run television IRIB this
evening.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that the government has provided necessity for
refugees such as tents, clothing, blankets, food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
However, he criticized the United Nations and other
international organizations for failing to give assistance to the
Iraqi refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United Nations and international
organizations should not be indifferent toward the human tragedy
in the region.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference early last week, he said that Iran
faces the danger of 2 million Iraqi refugees pouring into the
country due to the latest fighting in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iraq refugees would swarm into the country
through three Iranian provinces of West Azarbaijan, Kermanshah
and Kurdestan.
</P>
<P>
There are 17 refugees camps in the three Iranian
provinces. But not all of them are ready to accommodate refugees
because some of them are already occupied by refugees from
previous influx, he said.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "If necessary we can set up 10,000 tent camps."
</P>
<P>
About 2 million refugees are now residing in Iran, about 1.5
million from Afghanistan and others from Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Premier Insists on Mutual Compromise in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said on the occasion of the Jewish 5757 New
Year that the new Israeli government pursues regional peace, but
peace of mutual compromise, not one-side surrender to the
demands of the Arabs, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
In a strong-worded interview with the radio, Netanyahu said
that it should be clear to all parties concerned that the
direction of his government is peace, but the peace is different
from that during the previous government of Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
The hard-line Likud leader said that he can not assure
Israelis that there will be no more victims of terrorist
attacks. But he threatened that the Palestinian Authority
understands fully well that Israel's response to such attacks
will be "swift and harsh."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu acknowledged in his book published earlier this year
that he described PLO leader Yasser Arafat as a man who
contributed more than anyone else to spreading "international
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
He rejected accusations of most Arab countries that his
government is foot-dragging on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Egypt's threat to postpone the regional economic
summit scheduled to take place in Cairo in November, saying that
to cancel the conference will harm Egypt's own interests.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Egypt's military exercises and the recent reports
of Syrian troop redeployment in Lebanon, the premier said that
Israel is carefully following all such movements of military
forces.

</P>
<P>
Chinese State Councillor Luo Gan made the commitment while
meeting with UNESCO Director General Federico Mayor here this

</P>
<P>
Luo said cooperation between China and the

Referring to the "world solar program 1996-2005" and the
"Harare declaration on solar energy and sustainable development"
approved by the conference of the World Solar Commission held
here yesterday, Luo said the Chinese government will take an
active part in the series of activities for the implementation of
the two documents.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kuwait's Doubts Delay U.S. Troops Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The planned deployment of
5,000 Army troops to joint a U.S. military buildup in the Gulf
region was, at least for the moment, stranded at their Fort
Hood, texas, because of Kuwaiti leaders' qualms about hosting
such a large contingent.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the situation is ever-changing, it seems they may
or may not ever be utilized," Pentagon spokesman Navy Lt. Cmdr.
Scott Campbell said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The United States announced on Friday that it had ordered the
5,000 Army troops from Fort Hood to join forces already in the
Gulf as a show-off of the U.S. strengthening military presence
in the region in another possible strike against Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein for his defiance of U.S.-unilaterally-expanded
no-fly zone in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But Washington announced the deployment before consulting with
Kuwaiti leaders to obtain their approvement.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Kuwaiti leaders may have had doubts about the
wisdom of hosting such a large contingent of U.S. forces at a
time when many Arab states have criticized U.S. strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said 3,000 soldiers at Fort Hood, ready to go
this weekend, were ordered to hold on, and it was possible they
might not go at all.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Fort Hood said: "If we get the order, we
expect it'll probably be on Tuesday."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry, on a visit to the Gulf
seeking for a new alliance against Saddam with Gulf states as
they did in the Gulf War in 1991, has asked Kuwait's emir,
Sheikhh Jaber al-Ahmad Al-Sabah for permission to proceed with
the plan to deploy the 5,000 Fort Hood troops during his visit
to the country on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Foreign Minister Sheikhh Sabah al-Ahmad al-jaber
al-Sabah said there was no question of U.S. land forces crossing
into Iraq from Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Call for Pressuring Israel into Moving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Arab states today called on
the international community to pressure Israel into starting
serious final-status talks with the Palestinians in accordance
with the signed agreements between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In resolutions to be issued at the end of the 106 session of
Arab foreign ministers here tonight, the co-sponsors of the
Middle East peace process -- the United States and Russia -- and
the European Union members are urged to make greater efforts in
pushing forward the peace march.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions also assert the importance of resuming
Israeli-Lebanese and Israeli-Syrian peace talks on the basis of
the terms of the reference of the 1991 Madrid peace conference so
as to realize a just, comprehensive and lasting Mideast peace,
according to Egypt's new agency MENA.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions also make it clear that Jerusalem is an Arab
city, denouncing what they call Israeli practices to change the
identity of the city and drive away its Arab citizens.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the resolutions condemn Israel's building and
expansion of Jewish settlements on Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions warn Israel against any violation of the
principles on which the peace process is based and denounce
Israel's continued military closure of the Palestinian self-rule
areas.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions, carried by MENA, also condemn Israel for its
failure to withdraw its troops from Hebron and refusal to
establish safety passages between the self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs call on Israel to allow the Palestinians to get
control over their water resources, according to the resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The regular meeting of the foreign ministers opened Saturday,
when an emergency meeting of the ministers was also held under
the chairmanship of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to seek ways
to push forward the stalled peace process.

Jack Wigglesworth, LIFFE's Chairman, said "It is very
encouraging that the Exchange has traded record volume for the

"We believe that the continued development of bilateral

</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the two countries share comprehensive
common views on a number of international issues.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed that there is still room for
bilateral economic and trade cooperation, in spite of the progress
made in the past. They agreed to look for new ways to cooperate.
</P>

After they briefed each other on their relative domestic
situations, Jiang voiced his appreciation for Tadzhikistan's great
efforts at safeguarding national independence, realizing national
reconciliation, stablizing the domestic situation, and developing
the economy.

BANGKOK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Legislators from Southeast
Asian nations met here today in Thailand's southern province of
Phuket to discuss issues of common concern in the region.

Perry consulted with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel,
Defense Minister Turhan Tayan, Chief of General Staff Ismail
Hakki Karadayi and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Tansu Ciller on the current situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Perry had outlined the continuing
threat posed by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to regional
security and stability.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that in a productive exchange of views
regarding a regional strategy on Iraq, Perry spoke of
Turkey's leading role in the international coalition forces that
vigilantly resisted "Iraqi aggression" since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The continuing enforcement of the northern "no-fly zone" in
Iraq under OPERATION PROVIDE COMFORT is vital to coalition efforts
to contain Saddam Hussein and deter further "aggression and
coercion", it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the U.S. defense secretary reviewed in
particular the status of U.S.-Turkish cooperation in a training
program for the Bosnian Federation forces.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akber said in a press
conference that during the talks with Perry, Ciller expressed
Turkey's desire to get compensation as soon as possible as Turkey
has suffered a great loss of 27 billion dollars since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Ciller hoped to implement U.N. Security Council resolution 986
and immediately reopen the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik petrol pipelines
linking Turkey and Iraq, added Akber.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Disappointed over Slow Trade with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is disappointed with the
slow progress of trade between Jordan and Israel, English-language
daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
In July, the paper said, Jordan exported one million
U.S. dollars worth of goods to Israel, while its imports from
Israel stood at 1.7 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This is very disappointing for us," the paper quoted Mohammad
Smadi, Jordan's Director General of the Ministry of Trade and
Industry, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials blamed the slow progress of bilateral trade
on Israeli bureaucratic policies and unwarranted security
considerations.
</P>
<P>
They complained of the delays of cargo movements at the border
due to the so-called security consideration and the
cumbersome back-to-back system, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The back-to-back system, stipulated in the transport accord
signed between the two countries, requires that goods moving
between Jordan and Israel and between Jordan and the Palestinian
self-rule areas be unloaded from Jordanian vehicles onto Israeli
or Palestinian vehicles.
</P>
<P>
So, some vehicles had to be delayed at the border for days due
to the security consideration, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"The back-to-back system is time-consuming and costly," Smadi
said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Jordan also contributes the depressing
trade volume between Jordanians and the Palestinians in the West
Bank to Israel's strict and bureaucratic policies.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the economic agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians "discriminated against Jordanian products in terms
of the number and type of products we are allowed to export to
the self-rule areas."

<HEADLINE> UN Welcomes Peace Efforts by Afghan Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations (UN)
welcomes the peace efforts made by Afghan neighbors in the Afghan
peace process, a UN official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Marrack Goulding, visiting
UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, showed his
confidence that a negotiated settlement for the Afghan problem
will be possible with international efforts.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, a group of countries have great influence on Afghan
factions," he said, adding that the UN should take advantage of
such influence and cooperate with those countries in bringing
peace to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
However, Goulding noted that the Afghan neighbors should keep
contact with the UN about "what they are doing" in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Norbert Holl, head of the UN special mission
to Afghanistan, will visit some countries which are active in
mediation among Afghan factions in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the reported foreign interference in
Afghanistan, Goulding said that all the member states of the UN
condemn any kind of foreign interference in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A document in this regard has been adopted unanimously in the
UN, he added.
</P>
<P>
So far, the UN is not in the position to accuse any countries
of interfering in Afghanistan because no solid proof is available.
</P>
<P>
Replying another question, Goulding said that the UN opposes
any attempt to disintegrate Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Goulding, together with Holl, paid a four-day visit to
Afghanistan from last Thursday to discuss with Afghan leaders how
the UN can reinvigorate its peace efforts in that country.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's Attempt To Join UN Denounced (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan authorities are trying
to smuggle themselves into the United Nations by bribing a few
countries to push for the establishment of a special UN committee
to consider Taiwan's "representation" in the UN, a spokesman for
the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council, said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The move is an act to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan", one which is contrary to the fundamental interests of the
Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits and which
sabotages the easing of relations across the straits, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, also representing the Taiwan Work Office of the
Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee, pointed out that it
is the common wish of the Chinese on both sides of the straits
that relations across the straits be developed and the motherland
be reunified as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We have appealed more than once that the two sides hold
political consultations under the "one China" principle to resolve
political differences. We also hope that the Taiwan authorities
will respond to our proposal that they promptly take practical
steps to develop direct postal, trade, air and shipping services
across the straits."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the Taiwanese authorities, under
pressure from both inside and outside the island, have put up the
appearance of trying to ease tensions across the straits, but in
reality they are doing their utmost in pushing for "pragmatic
diplomacy" and creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan",
and continuing to obstruct direct postal, trade, air and shipping
services across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"This effectly proves that what the Taiwan authorities have
said about easing the relations across the straits is insincere
while what they have actually done is designed to divide the
motherland," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's Attempt To Join UN Denounced (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As early as 25 years ago, the 26th session of the UN General
Assembly passed Resolution No.2758, confirming that the People's
Republic of China is the sole legitimate representative of China
at the UN and that PR China is one of the five permanent members
of the UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities, in disregard of the historical facts
and reality, have continued to clamour about Taiwan's
"participation" in the UN. This action can do nothing but harm the
development of relations across the Taiwan Straits, The spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the UN is an inter-governmental
organization participated by representatives of sovereign states,
and the issue of "China's representation" has been thoroughly
resolved.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chinese government has done much to protect
the rights and interests of the people of Taiwan and will continue
to do so.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that when the motherland is reunified,
the people of Taiwan will be able to, like the rest of the Chinese
people, share the dignity and honor of a great country.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities' perverse acts of attempting to split
the motherland and block the peaceful reunification by means of
internationalizing the Taiwan issue in collusion with
international intervention forces, are unpopular and doomed to
failure, the spokesman pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Chinese government will continue to
implement the principle of "peaceful reunification and one
country, two systems" and President Jiang Zemin's eight-point
proposition, expand economic cooperation across the straits and
promote the direct postal, trade, air and shipping services
between the two sides, and the development of relations in other
fields between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> UN Identifies Features of Settlement of Afghan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The UN General Assembly has
identified the essential features of a negotiated settlement of
the Afghan problem, Marrack Goulding, UN Under Secretary General
for Political Affairs Marrack Goulding said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The features include a ceasefire, establishment of a
broadbased government for a transitional period, creation of joint
security forces and elections or some other traditional ways of
consulting the Afghan people," Goulding told a press conference at
the UN Information Center in Islamabad after paying a four-day
visit to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The major problem of the lingering Afghan peace process is not
the lack of peace plans, he said, adding that some elements'
willingness to solve the problem by force is the major obstacle.
</P>
<P>
He said that his visit to Afghanistan coincided with the
Taliban's offensive in eastern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The offensive complicated the problems that the UN and others
face in setting up a political process," he noted.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the war-torn country from Thursday to
Sunday, Goulding held talks with Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, Premier Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Chief Commander of the
government troops Ahmed Masood, Leader of Junbush-i-Melli Rashid
Dostum, and the Taliban leadership.
</P>
<P>
As the Rabbani-Hekmatyar coalition government, the Taliban, and
the Junbush-i-Melli are the top three players in the Afghan arena,
Goulding stressed the need to facilitate a compromise among the
three.
</P>
<P>
He said that all the three factions have accepted the UN role
in the Afghan peace process, but one of them is still not ready to
realize ceasefire and sit down for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
"The fall of Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan to the Taliban
has generated intense diplomatic activity inside Afghanistan and
in the neighboring countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We can take advantage of this to enlist the help of all
concerned in persuading the Afghan parties to give up military
option and agree to negotiate with each other in good faith," he
added.

<HEADLINE> France to Close Embassy in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- government sources said
here today that France will close its embassy in Sierra Leone as
part of a world wide slash in budgetary expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The closing down of the embassy in Sierra Leone will take
place along with three other embassies and five consulates in
other parts of the world, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
No data for the closure has been announced, but diplomatic
sources said it will be put into effect in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the French embassy will reduce to six the
number of diplomatic missions in the country while majority of
the European states are represented by consulates.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say the closure of the embassy will come as a
shock to the civilian government of President Tejan Kabbah which
has been working to get western countries to reopen their
missions closed down in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
France established diplomatic ties with Sierra Leone in 1961
and it has been assisting the west African state with annual food
aid of rice and flour, contruction of schools, bridges, water
supplies, military training and medical assistance to amputees
caught up in the rebel war.

The ministers also warned that the Arab states will link its
normalization of relations with Israel to progress in the peace
march.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab state ever to make peace with Israel in 1979,
has acted as a mediator between the Arabs and Israel, particularly

WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The space shuttle
Atlantis blasted off today for its fourth rendezvous with the
Russian Mir space station and to retrieve NASA astronaut Shannon
Lucid who has now spent a record six months in space.
</P>
<P>
Atlantis lifted off at 4:54 a.m. (0854 GMT) with a six-member
crew aboard.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle is expected to dock with Mir on Wednesday to pick
up Lucid and drop off John Blaha, her replacement, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said.
</P>
<P>
Lucid has set a U.S. space endurance record as well as a world
record for a woman with her six-month stay. When the shuttle
returns to earth on September 26 after its 10-day mission, Lucid,
a 53-year-old biochemist and mother of three grown children, will
have spent 188 days in space, 48 days more than expected.
</P>
<P>
She was supposed to return to earth in early August, but
problems with booster rockets on Atlantis and two hurricanes
delayed the shuttle's trip by some seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle will also return to earth with some 990 kilograms
of scientific samples and other gear from Mir.

<HEADLINE> World Solar Summit Opens in Zimbabwean Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The world solar summit,
sponsored by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO), opened here today with thousands
of delegates from over 100 countries attending.
</P>
<P>
Opening the summit, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who is
also the Chairman of the World Solar Commission, urged the people
in the world to accelerate the development and utilization of
solar energy and other renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
He said the sun is a virtually never-ending source of energy
on the planet. However, no serious attempt has been made to
harness and bring the benefits of this resource to the disposal
of the vast majority of the rural people who cannot afford
conventional energy sources.
</P>
<P>
Once solar energy is harnessed, he added, it does not require
expensive and elaborate infrastructure or highly skilled experts.
</P>
<P>
''Solar technologies therefore are an entry point for the
adoption of wider renewable energy technologies,'' Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
The benefits of solar energy extend beyond the supply of light
and heat for everyday use, he pointed out, adding that it can
enable rural people who live without electricity to improve the
quality of their lives.
</P>
<P>
The development and use of solar energy will not cause
environmental pollution as the conventional energy sources like
coal, oil and natural gas do, he said.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali issued
a written statement at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said, amplified by a growing world population, conventional
energy production has had a lasting and damaging impact on the
environment and therefore the people are compelled to consider
positively the alternatives to the conventional energy sources.
</P>
<P>
''The world needs new policy initiatives to meet the challenge
of ensuring an efficient, affordable and safe energy supply into
the next century and beyond,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
Representative of the European Commission Christos Papoutsis
also spoke at the opening ceremony. He said the European
Commission supportss the development and use of the renewable
energy sources and is ready to provide funds for the third world
people for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day world solar summit, delegates will examiness
before approval the ''world solar program 1996-2005'' and the
''Harare declaration on solar energy and sustainable
development''. The two documents, drawn up by the World Solar

<HEADLINE> UN to Continue Relief Program in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The UN is spending 130
million US dollars this year on its relief program for the
war-torn Afghanistan, UN Under Secretary General for Political
Affairs Marrackk Goulding said here today.
</P>
<P>
"One of the most striking impressions we have brought back is
the dreadful suffering which this unending war has brought to the
ordinary people of Afghanistan," Goulding told a press conference
here after paying a four-day visit to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The devastation of Kabul has to be seen to be believed," he
added.
</P>
<P>
By all measurements of human health, welfare and prosperity,
Afghanistan is one of the most deprived countries in the world, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern about the fall in voluntary contributions
to the UN humanitarian and rehabilitation programs in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"It will be difficult to reverse this trend unless a convincing
peace process can be established in Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, I was equally impressed by the enthusiasm of the UN
people who continue to work inside Afghanistan to relieve
suffering and help rehabilitate the country's infrastructure," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"All the UN people I talked to were looking forward to the day
when they could move on from relief to reconstruction and
development in Afghanistan at peace," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan should not become a forgotten conflict, Goulding
said, quoting UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
Goulding visited the war-ravaged country from Thursday to
Sunday and held talks with Afghan leaders on how the UN can
reinvigorate its peace efforts in that country.

<HEADLINE> HK to Introduce Telephone Calling Number Display Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A telephone Calling Number
Display (CND) service could be introduced into Hong Kong, a
spokesman of Hong Kong's Telecommunications Authority announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision is based on the general support indicated
by the community and the prospective service providers.
</P>
<P>
It is envisaged that interested service providers will submit
their applications for providing CND shortly, and equipment
suppliers will proceed to manufacture suitable telephone terminals
in accordance with the standards approved by the Authority.
</P>
<P>
But service providers have to demonstrate before launching
their services that they would comply with stringent codes of
practices to be issued by the Authority on the handling of CND
information.
</P>
<P>
The Authority would launch an effective publicity program for
introducing CND to let the public fully understand how the service
works, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the CND service gives customers full
control. The called parties can see who are calling before picking
up their phones as the callers' phone numbers will be shown on the
called parties' display units when the phone rings.

<HEADLINE> Audit Says UK Failing Its Human Rights Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain is guilty of
more than 40 violations of its international human rights
obligations, according to an audit due to be published this
week.
</P>
<P>
The absence of constitutional and judicial safeguards relating
to privacy and equal protection under the law are the most serious
violations, the report says.
</P>
<P>
But other failures range from lack of freedom of information to
the use of the security services in Northern Ireland, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The audit revealed a "disturbing neglect of basic civil and
political rights in Britain," said Professor Kevin Boyle, director
of Essex University's human rights centre which carried out the
audit using benchmarks such as the European Convention On Human
Rights and the UN Covenant on Civil And Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
The report says Britain's traditional legal, constitutional and
political arrangements fail to protect civil liberties and
"do not fully ensure that an effective remedy is provided."
</P>
<P>
Since 1975 the European Court of Human Rights has ruled
against Britain in 42 cases -- in 25 as a result of acts
passed by Parliament, in a further l0 as a result of
secondary legislation.
</P>
<P>
These violations were historic. However, the audit has
found a further 42 current and continuing violations of
obligations.
</P>
<P>
It says that Britain's traditional legal, constitutional,
and political arrangements fail to protect political rights
and freedoms effectively.
</P>
<P>
The audit points out that it is the fault of lack of a written
constitution and the doctrine of "parliamentary sovereignty," with
party discipline ensuring that governments dominate the Commons,
Britain's lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Britain's secretive regime severely limits MPs' powers to hold
ministers accountable," the audit says. It adds, "Scrutiny of new
legislation is partisan and largely nominal."
</P>
<P>
Parliament, it says, "has neither the will nor the
resources to check the mass of secondary legislation which
pours through every year and continually extends ministerial
and official power."

<HEADLINE> Nepali Parliament Postpones Decision on Treaty With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The joint session of the
two houses of the Nepali parliament was adjourned today for the
third time in four days after the ruling and opposition parties
failed again to reach a compromise over a border river development
treaty with India.
</P>
<P>
The parliament was scheduled to hold a voting on ratification
of the Mahakali Treaty at today's joint meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting lasted only about half an hour before Lower House
Speaker Ram Chandra Poudel announced that it was adjourned until
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government and the opposition appeared to have stuck to
their earlier positions. The parliament had postponed its
decision on the fate of the Mahakali Treaty twice since last
Thursday, when the joint session convened.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML), which holds the key to the ratification of the
treaty, has maintained that the treaty could be ratified only
after some "necessary corrections."
</P>
<P>
But the coalition government led by the Nepali Congress (NC)
Party said correction to the treaty could be made only after
ratification.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and India signed the treaty on the integrated development
of the Mahakali river, which is Nepal's western boundary with
India, last February in New Delhi.

needs of foreign students who want to learn Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The university now has courses for students in a two-year

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Newspaper Reveals US Secret Plan to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The plan is based on the seizing of northern Iraq by Jalal
Talabani and doing away with Masoud Barzani, in addition to
provoking a wide-scale riot in southern Iraq and declaring a
puppet government there," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Talabani is leader of the pro-Iranian Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) while Barzani is leader of the Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP).
</P>
<P>
"This plan was supposed to reach its climax in September
this year," the paper added.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the failure of the PUK to control the situation
in northern Iraq induced Clinton's advisers to suggest dealing a
blow to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that, with the failure of the U.S. missile
attack to alter the situation in northern Iraq, both U.S. Defense
Minister William Perry and Secretary of State Warren Christopher
were forced to admit that the fate of Iraqi Kurds did not interest
the United States and that what the U.S. wanted to defend was oil
in southern Iraq, rather than the Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The paper concluded that, in dealing with the U.S. aggression on
Iraq, stress should be laid on the key motive, namely, Iraqi oil,
rather than the U.S. election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Tension looms tense between Iraq and the U.S. has intensified
following two salvos of the U.S. missile attacks early this month
and the U.S. attempts to enforce the expanded "no-fly" zones in
northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes and thousands of troops were heading to the
Gulf in a show of force, even as Iraq suspended its attempts to
shoot down U.S. jets enforcing the "no-fly" zones.

BAGHDAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Oil Products
Distribution Organization has started to send liquid gas to
Sulaimaniya province in northern Iraq, local newspaper
Al-Johmouriya reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Director General of the organization Hussein
Sulaiman El Hedeithi as saying that 3,000 tubes of liquid gas
has been sent from the Kirkuk liquid-gas production plants
to Sulaimaniya province.
</P>
<P>
El Hedeithi noted that the sending of liquid gas to Sulaimaniya
would continue and the Sulaimaniya liquid-gas plants would be
repaired.
</P>
<P>
A plant for filling liquid-gas tubes would be opened in the
city of Taamim in order to meet the great needs of the residents
in northern Iraq, the director added.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago the Iraqi government started sending hundreds of
oil tanker trucks carrying large quantities of gasoline and kerosene
to the provinces of Sulaimaniya, Irbil and Dahuk where the
gasoline and kerosene were sold at the official prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices in the northern provinces of Iraq have been soaring
since 1991 when these provinces got out of the control of the
central government.

BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Post and
Telecommunications will remove some stamps, pre-stamped envelopes
and post-cards from their counters in the near future.
</P>
<P>
An official with the MPT says that this will improve the
ministry's management of its affairs and reduce the amount of
overstocked items.
</P>
<P>
He said that stamps, commemorative stamps, and pre-stamped
envelopes and cards, which are not suitable for today's use are
overstocked and have caused postal service and stock control
problems. This, plus some illegal stamp deals related to it that
were discovered, has made the MPT decide to destroy the stock.
</P>
<P>
The official says that all pre-stamped envelopes and post-cards
that are not suitable for use will be voided, while all
commemorative stamps issued before 1994 and other one-fen,
two-fen, three-fen, and four-fen stamps will be destroyed.
</P>

PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry will meet the French and British defense ministers in London
on Monday to discuss the situation in Iraq, Agence France Presse
quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Perry, who has been touring Gulf states to drum up support for
U.S. action against Iraq, left for London after a five-hour visit to
Turkey where he held talks with foreign minister Tansu Ciller.
</P>

The United States, Britain and France set up a coalition after the

protect Kurdish and Shi'ite Muslim civilians from attacks by Iraqi
troops.

Britain expressed its support for the U.S. missile strikes
against Iraq last week, and let U.S. troops use its Indian Ocean
island of Diege Garcia as a base from which to launch bombing
missions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
France, which distanced itself from the United States during
the missile raids, has since warned Iraq against any attack upon
allied aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones, and has reaffirmed
its commitment to the security arrangements agreed with the allies
after the Gulf War.

WARSAW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Poland's former president Lech
Walesa said today he "would not pay a penny" of a 145,000
U.S.-dollar tax bill on royalties from his biography, a report
in the newspaper Rzeczpospolita said.
</P>

Local tax authorities are sending him the bill payable on

Walesa made public the one-million-dollar income as a

</P>
<P>
But the tax bureau in Gdansk said the money was a contribution
fee and he should pay taxes on it. The tax bill, plus interest,
comes to 400,000 zloty (145,000 dollars).

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tourism Building up in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kampala, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's tourism earnings
have shot up in recent years as the government takes powerful
steps to encourage the development of the sector.
</P>
<P>
The latest version of "Uganda Tourism Today" magazine said the
earnings from tourism increased to over 90 million U.S. Dollars
in 1995, up from 16 million Dollars in 1986, the year when the
current government came to power.
</P>
<P>
And the number of visitors had increased from 32,790 in 1986
to about 193,000 in 1995, representing an increase of 585
percent, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange earnings from tourism are expected to
grow to 200 million U.S. Dollars in 1997 and over 800 million by
the year 2000, according to the prediction of some experts.
</P>
<P>
At present tourism is Uganda's second largest foreign exchange
earner, only after that of coffee. In terms of the tourists
expenditure, Uganda ranked 12th in Africa, up from the 35th
position five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Between 1964 and 1971, which was the best period for the
development of tourism in Uganda's history, a 34 percent annual
growth was achieved in 1970, recording the highest earnings of
16.5 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the political turmoil and economic instability
of the era of former President Idi Amin from 1972 to 1978, the
industry registered a 13.8 percent annual decline. Tourism had
the lowest earnings of just one million Dollars in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, as overall political stability and economic growth
was achieved in Uganda, coupled with the favorable government
policies, the development of tourism is on an upbeat.
</P>
<P>
An estimated annual growth rate of 53 percent would be
achieved, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken the following steps to promote
tourism in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
During the last ten years, 100 million U.S. Dollars of the
government revenue has been spent to renovate major hotels and
tourist lodges in the country.
</P>
<P>
Many favorable conditions, including tax reduction, has been
granted to both local and multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
Also, a ten-year government plan was launched in 1993 for the
development of tourism, under which concrete measures have been
taken to improve basic infrastructures needed for the development
of tourism.
</P>
<P>
The measures included abolishing visa requirements for
tourists from 33 countries and regions, simplifying entry and
exit procedures for tourists, and permitting direct charter
flights from neighboring countries to tourist attraction areas in
Uganda without stopping over at the country's sole international
airport in Entebbe, 40 km south of capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Uganda mainly hosts tourists from Kenya, Tanzania, Britain and
the Netherlands. And 50 percent of these tourists have been
coming into the country via the Entebbe International Airport.
</P>
<P>
And a first ever tourism institute was opened in early
November 1994 in a bid to educate and train experts needed for
expanding the country's tourism.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, barriers still exist on Uganda's way to
developing tourism, including inadequate tourism resources, lack
of coordination and coherence in licensing tourism-related
enterprises, lack of reliable data and accommodation as well as
lack of access to credit.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Denies US Request for Use of Incirlik </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said here today that
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry did not make a request for
the use of Incirlik airbase in Adana, southern Turkey, for
possible air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ciller made the remarks after she held talks with the
U.S. defense secretary on the situation in Iraq. Perry arrived
here early this morning on his Middle East tour aimed at securing
support for a possible military showdown with Iraq. He visited
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain before visiting Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said: "It is impossible for us to oppose such a
request for Incirlik," adding that Perry had not made the
request to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Turkey's Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan sent a message to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
saying: "Turkey will not allow the bombing from Incirlik. We are
not siding with the intervention of the U.S.".
</P>
<P>
Before his talks with Ciller, Perry met with Turkey's Chief
of General Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi to discuss the latest
developments of the situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A U.S.-led allied air force based in Incirlik has been
patrolling over northern Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> WHO Cites Tibet's Achievement in Medical Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Tibet's grass-roots health work
has won high praise from a senior World Health Organisation
official.
</P>
<P>
The official, S.T. Han, director of the WHO's Asia-Pacific
Region has spoken highly of the achievements in the Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
He said he was deeply impressed by the good job being done by
local medical workers when visiting several hospitals and medicare
centers for women and children in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the other parts of the country, Tibet's health
care is poor, said Danzim, chairman of the Tibet Association for
Foreign Cultural Exchange. But local governments at all levels
have exerted efforts to improve medical work in grass-root units
over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been focused on promotion of medical work in rural
and pastoral areas, to provide health services for farmers,
herdsmen, lamas and the disabled, Danzim said.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has also given priority to rural and
pastoral areas in allocation of investment of health care. The
staff members of the regional health department have received a
college or university education and had experience in local
hospitals, he said, therefore they are able to promote the
development of health care in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Han stressed the importance of building a health care network
in rural and remote areas. He promised local people that the WHO
is trying its best to give support to the project.
</P>
<P>
The WHO official also praised the work local doctors have made
in eliminating one-time major disease, poliomyelitis.
</P>
<P>
The rural medical care network covers 85 percent of Tibet's
total area.

<P>
LAGOS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
foreclosed privatization of some enterprises key to the national
economy in their present form, the Guardian newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Industries Minister Lt.-Gen. Mohammed
Balarabe Haladu as saying that such enterprises include all sugar
companies, steel mills, paper and newsprint manufacturing
companies, refineries and petrochemical concerns, fertilizer
plants and Nigeria Airways.
</P>
<P>
''Despite the privatization program, it is realized that some
projects that are vital to the economic development of the nation
but which the private sector would not find attractive, or are
of strategic nature, may have to be undertaken by the public
sector,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it has become clear to the government that there exist
some enterprises that ''could not be privatized in their present
form, except at considerable losses to the government.''

<HEADLINE> National People's Congress Plays Greater Role in State Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior official from
China's top legislature said today that the system of people's
congresses has been improving over the past years, and is playing
more and more important role in state affairs.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zheng, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee
of China's National People's Congress (NPC), made the statement in
Beijing at a meeting held by the Association of
Secretaries-General of Parliaments.
</P>
<P>
He said China's NPC and its Standing Committee have made great
achievements in legislation. They have the power to make decisions
on some major issues of the state, and have strengthened
supervision over the enforcement of laws and the work of the
country's administrative, judicial and procuratorial organs.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 18 years, they adopted over 290 laws and
decisions on legal affairs, which include the Criminal Law, the
Civil Law, the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region,
and laws concerning economy, culture, education, science and
technology, administration, national defense, ethnic groups and
environmental protection, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, a legal system with the Constitution at the core
has been preliminarily established. Basically, there are laws to
go by in the country's political, economic and social life," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Now that China is experiencing a change from a traditional
planned economy to a socialist market economy, the current NPC and
its Standing Committee have made economic legislation their most
important task, he noted.
</P>
<P>
With regard to law-enforcement supervision, Liu said that
during annual sessions of the NPC, the State Council, Supreme
People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate all make work
reports to the NPC, and seek suggestions and opinions from NPC
deputies.
</P>
<P>
Every year, the General Office of the NPC Standing Committee
receives more than 60,000 letters from the masses, and 13,000
visitors. It has helped correct wrong cases and solve citizens'
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the NPC has established relations with parliaments
in 138 countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> 5,000-year-old Cities On Upper Reaches of Yantze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- City ruins dating back some
4,500 to 5,000 years have been found along the upper reaches of
the Yangtze River, an area that was previously thought to have
been slower in developing civilization.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the find marks a break from the
traditional view that there was no record of cities before the
first dynasty was set up in the 21st century BC on the upper
reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
"The find is proof that the area is one of the origins of
China's 5,000-year-old civilization," the experts say.
</P>
<P>
Remains of cities were found scattered about present-day
Xinjin, Dujiangyan, Wenjiang, and Pixian counties on the Chendu
Plain, in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Scholars have found characteristics common to all the cities,
which lie parallel to rivers, built on a large platform with walls
made of beaten earth.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the earliest city site found in the area was
Sanxingdui from some 3,000 to 4,000 years ago, where a great
number of unique bronzes, such as a mask with protruding eyes,
have been unearthed.

BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The week-long 96th conference
of the Inter-Parliamentary Union opened today in Beijing's Great
Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin extended a warm welcome to
parliamentarians to the conference, and delivered a speech at the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"We are at an important historical juncture of the turn of the
century," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"What kind of a world shall we bring into the new century? This
is an issue that people throughout the world are giving greater
attention to, and one to be addressed at this Conference."
</P>
<P>
The IPU has played a useful role in maintaining world peace,
promoting inter-parliamentary exchanges, Jiang said.

<P>
"We hope that it will serve as a bridge of friendship between
parliaments and peoples of various countries, and make its
contribution to world peace and development," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said
in a written massage, which was read out by Joseph V. Reed, his
special representative and UN Under-Secretary-General, that
parliamentarians across the world are playing a more and more
important role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians participate in UN operations ranging from
electoral assistance to institution building and preventive
diplomacy, and serve as essential links between the world
organization and the world public, building understanding and
support for UN goals and activities, Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress, said at the opening ceremony that the
IPU has played a positive part in promoting friendship and

parliamentarians worldwide.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the conference would contribute to world peace
and development.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Sorour, President of the IPU's Council, extended thanks
to the Chinese government and people for their hospitality and
careful, and well-conceived preparations for the conference.
</P>
<P>
The principal themes for debate include promoting greater
respect and protection of human rights, women and children in
particular, and policies and strategies to ensure the right to
food in an era of globalization of the economy, and trade
liberalization, Sorour said.
</P>
<P>
"The right to food is the most fundamental human right," Sorour
said, adding, "The right to food is the right to life itself."
</P>
<P>
After the opening ceremony, Chinese President Jiang Zemin held
a reception in honor of the president of the IPU's council, the
Secretary-General of the IPU, head of delegations, and members of

<HEADLINE> IMF Concerned About Philippines' Increasing Real </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The rapid increase in real
estate loans could endanger the Philippine financial sector,
similar to what had happened in Japan and the United States, an
International Monetary Fund (IMF) official warned here today.
</P>
<P>
John Hicklin, head of a visiting IMF team, told reporters that
his team has asked the Philippine Monetary Authorities to closely
analyze the ratio of real estate loans to the total loan portfolio
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The rapid increase in real estate loans could have an adverse
impact on the financial sector, should the sector suffer a slump,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that many banks in Japan and the United States lent
heavily to real estate projects but the projects failed when the
economy went into recession and land prices dropped substantially.
</P>
<P>
But the Philippine Central Bank said that the loans that go to
real estate projects and business are not big enough to be a cause
of concern as the share of real estate loans to the total loan
portfolio is only 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hicklin said that the IMF is generally "very impressed" with
the country's economic performance and economic management.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still too early to give a fair assessment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Emboldened by a high gross national product rate of 7.1 percent
in the first half of this year, the Philippine government is
sticking to its 1996 growth targets of 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry left here for Britain and France to meet with his
counterparts of the two countries after his four-hour short visit
to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Perry told reporters at the Ankara
Esenboga Airport that his contacts in Ankara are "short but
positive."
</P>
<P>
"I found opportunities for the talks with the high-ranking
officials of the Turkish government. President Clinton asked me to
visit Turkey. There were good exchange of views here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Perry met with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Chief of
General Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi and Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller during his short visit.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Marc Grossman told reporters at the
airport that Perry would meet with his British and French
counterparts to exchange views on the situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that Perry's talks with Turkish leaders are very
"productive," adding that Perry did not make a request to Turkey
for the use of Incirlik airbase in Adana, southern Turkey for the
possible air strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan sent
a message to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, saying that" Turkey
will not allow the bombing from Incirlik. We are not siding with
the intervention of the U.S."
</P>
<P>
A. U.S.-led allied air force based in Incirlik has been
patrolling over northern Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. defense secretary had consultations on
the latest developments in this region with the Turkish leaders.
</P>
<P>
Grossman said that Perry gave the information about his
Middle East tour to the Turkish high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Five leaders of three
hooligan gangs have been executed in China, Liu Jiachen, vice
president of the country's Supreme People's Court, announced today.
</P>
<P>
The executions were carried out in Shangqiu of central China's
Henan Province, in Nanping of east China's Fujian Province and in
Xianyang of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, yesterday and
today.
</P>
<P>
The five criminals were sentenced to death for committing such
serious crimes as hooliganism, killing, theft and harming
individuals.
</P>
<P>
"Some hooligan gangs are well organized, having some
characteristics of sinister gangs of the underworld, which are
doing serious harm to society. It will be the focus of the
crackdown against crimes in the next stage," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The number of criminal cases, especially those involving
criminal gangs, has been on a steady rise in some areas of China
in recent times.
</P>
<P>
Usually they have the characteristics of large gang members,
active in large areas, committing crimes frequently and doing
serious harm to society, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
China has been striking hard against violent crime, focusing on
wiping out those endangering social security and public order. The
crackdown against serious crime since April has effectively
contained criminal activities and won widespread support from
people.

This represents the largest-ever commitment ever by the
government to turning Xinjiang into the country's most important
oil production base, said Zhou Yongkang, vice-president of CNPC.
</P>
<P>
According to a nationwide study, the Tarim, Turfan-Hami, and
Junggar basins, along with other basins in Xinjiang, have a total
of 20.86 billion tons of oil and 10.3 trillion cu.m. of gas
resources, accounting for 30 percent of the country's total of
continental reserves.
</P>
<P>
The source said that by the end of last year, the region had
1.94 billion tons of oil and 356.7 billion cu.m. of gas reserves,
but that there is still a large potential for oil and gas
exploration.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang pumped 12 million tons of crude last year, accounting
for 9 percent of the country's total figure.
</P>
<P>
With larger investment over the next five years, Xinjiang is
expected to have annual crude output of 23 million tons by the
turn of the century, or 16 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang intends to expand Sino-foreign cooperation in oil and
gas exploration to meet the target of 1.1 billion tons of oil and
155 billion cu.m. of gas reserves in the next five years.

<HEADLINE> China-S'pore Suzhou Industrial Park Making Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The China-Singapore Suzhou
Industrial Park (CS-SIP), the flagship joint venture between China
and Singapore, has made steady progress over the past 30 months,
with more and more foreign investment being committed, a senior
Singapore official in charge of the project said here today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 65 companies from 10 countries have already
committed more than 1.7 billion US dollars worth of investment in
the Industrial Park.
</P>
<P>
Of these, 53 are industrial projects with a total investment of
1.43 billion US dollars, which, when fully implemented over the
next three years, will employ a total of 16,000 workers, said
David Lim Tik En, chief executive officer of the China-Singapore
Suzhou Industrial Park Development Co., Ltd., (CSSD).
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a signing ceremony for a 65 million US
dollar, four-year Transferable Loan Facility granted by a
syndicate of banks to the CSSD. The proceeds of the Facility will
be utilized to part-finance the development of District 1 and 2 of
the Industrial Park.
</P>
<P>
The CSSD is a Sino-Singapore joint venture to develop the Park,
which is situated in the Suzhou Municipality of Jiangsu Province,
China. The concept is to develop a modern, integrated industrial
park complete with commercial, residential, recreational and
institutional facilities and supported by infrastructure amenities
of international standard.
</P>
<P>
Lim said that now 11 industrial projects are already in
operation and the figure is expected to reach 20 by the end of
this year. Another 20 projects are currently being implemented, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"More importantly, interest in the CS-SIP continues to remain
high. Judging from the type of projects which we have in our
project pipeline, we are confident that many more world class MNCs
(Multi National Corporations) will announce decisions to invest in
manufacturing activities in Suzhou Industrial Park next year," Lim
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Addresses IPU Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
made a speech on the international situation, China's role in
promoting world peace and the country's political system, when
addressing the opening ceremony of the 96th Inter-Parliamentary
Conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The president said that China is an important force for
safeguarding world peace and stability, and a developed and
stronger China will certainly make greater contribution to world
peace, stability and progress.
</P>
<P>
"The turn of the century is approaching, which has placed us at
another important historical juncture," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
The general international situation at present features a
growing trend towards multipolarity, the president remarked. To
seek world peace, national stability, economic development and
social progress has become the irresistible trend of our times, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "we must not lose sight of the destabilizing
factors, especially the persistent presence of hegemonism and
power politics, the widening gap between the rich and poor,
precarious conditions for survival and development of mankind and
the intranquility in the world."
</P>
<P>
"As we live on the same planet," Jiang added,"we must respect
each other, enhance cooperation, maintain peace and promote
development, which should become the consensus shared by those
statesmen and far-sighted men who care about the future of the
mankind and what all countries in the world should do."
</P>
<P>
He said that China maintains that state-to-state relations
should be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and
other universally recognized principles governing international
relations, and a just and equitable new international political
and economic order should be established.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people are ready to work with
governments and peoples of other countries for a better world,"
the president confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that the Chinese people have, over the past
ten-plus years, made unremitting efforts to achieve modernization,
national reunification and world peace. "As a result, our economy
has grown steadily, various undertakings have thrived, people's
life has improved markedly and the aggregated national strength
increased with each passing day."
</P>
<P>
On China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong and Macao in 1997 and 1999 respectively, Jiang noted that the
Chinese people have the ability, means and confidence to remove
all the obstacles and accomplish the great cause of national
reunification, including the return of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the system of people's congress, Jiang called it
China's fundamental political system, which embodies the broadest
people's democracy.
</P>
<P>
"The form of representative political system depends on the
conditions of a country. As such, there should be no uniform
model," the president noted.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Chinese people believe in democracy, and
"the system of people's congress, China's fundamental political
system, embodies the broadest people's democracy, and guarantees
the smooth development of various undertakings in our country. It
has thus got people's support."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that over the past ten years and more, while
carrying out economic structural reform, China has vigorously
conducted a political structural reform to improve the socialist
democracy, legal system and the system of people's congresses.
</P>
<P>
"We are firmly convinced that through self-improvement and
development, the socialist democratic political system we are
practising in China will demonstrate increasingly greater
vitality," Jiang said.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and China today
agreed to strengthen their cooperation in the field of education
through signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the talks between Malaysian
Education Minister Najib Tun Razak and China's Education
Commission Chairman Zhu Kaixuan who arrived here yesterday for a
week-long visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Najib told a joint press conference later that officials of
both countries would hold meetings soon to facilitate the signing
of the MoU which would take place when he visits China next year.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed at today's talks that the MoU would include
students and lecturers' exchange programs, exchange of visits by
senior educational officials and the establishment of direct
contacts between educational institutes of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
Najib said his ministry proposed to double the intake of
students from China to 120 next year and planned to facilitate
visa arrangements for students from China wishing to study in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Describing his talks with Najib as "friendly and fruitful", Zhu
Kaixuan said he hoped the proposed signing of the MoU would
provide more opportunities for bilateral cooperation in education
and promote such cooperation to the level paralleling that in
political and economic fields.
</P>

ANKARA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry left Ankara Esenboga Airport today after a
four-hour short visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Perry held a 50-minute-long secret
meeting with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel at the
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Turkish National Defense Minister Turhan Tayan and
Undersecretary of the Foreign Ministry Onur Oymen attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the meeting, Perry flew to the Ankara Esenboga
Airport by helicopter and left Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Perry did not meet with Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan during his short visit as the latter opposed the
U.S. military operations against Iraq early this month.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Erbakan sent a message to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, saying: "Turkey will not allow the bombing from
Incirlik. We are not siding with the intervention of the U.S."
</P>
<P>
Incirlik air base is located in Adana, southern Turkey. A
U.S.-led allied air force based in Incirlik has been patrolling
over northern Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The air force, made up of U.S., British and French warplanes
and support aircraft, daily patrols the "no-fly zone," set up
above the 36th parallel over northern Iraq after the Gulf War to
deter the Iraqi attacks on Kurds in northern Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The New Shanghai Museum is
scheduled to open to the public in mid-October, according to a
press conference held today.
</P>
<P>
The museum is being built at a total cost of 570 million yuan
(about 69 million US dollars). Organizations and people in Hong
Kong and overseas donated a total of ten million US dollars to the
construction of the museum.
</P>
<P>
The new museum will have 14 exhibition halls, including the
Ancient Chinese Bronze Hall, the Ancient Chinese Porcelain Hall,
the Chinese Paintings Hall, the Ancient Chinese Jadeware Hall, the
Ancient Chinese Coins Hall, the Chinese Seals Hall and the Ancient
Chinese Sculptures Hall.
</P>
<P>
Donations from overseas were mostly spent decorating the halls.
</P>
<P>
The old Shanghai Museum, which was built in 1952, has 120,000
relics. But it became too small to meet the rising needs stemming
from rapid social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai municipal government decided in 1992 to build the
New Shanghai Museum in People's Square in downtown Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the new museum started in 1993, and the first
phase was completed one year later. Three halls of the new museum
opened to the public on a trial basis on December 30, 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- More than a billion yuan has
been poured into ailing enterprises to give China's reform policy
a major shot in the arm.
</P>
<P>
The money was raised during a series of transactions at a key
trade fair, which saw ownership of state-owned factories and
enterprises changing hands.
</P>
<P>
At the Fujian Investment and Trade Seminar in Xiamen, Fujian
province, people witnessed the conclusion of three contracts for
the transfer of property rights valued at 50 million yuan, two
agreements worth 63 million yuan, and 16 letters of intent
involving more than one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 property rights transactional centers, from
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Harbin and Shenyang cities
and Sichuan province, had listed about 800 projects valued at 32
billion yuan at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time that a trade seminar set up a special
hall to encourage the transfer of property rights among different
regions, departments and industries," Wu Tianlin, director of the
Department of Production Structure under the State Commission for
Economic Restructuring, said.
</P>
<P>
"Such business is beneficial in optimizing capital,
rationalizing the allocation of resources, and promoting market
development," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Business people from the United States and Singapore agreed
that the annexation and purchase of an enterprise is better than
making an investment in building a new plant in China in terms of
economic results.

<TEXT>
<P>
China has huge available assets, and its operational state
properties are valued at two trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, the conventional management system has led to the
separation among departments, local protectionism, and backward
market development. It also has caused stagnation in state
property, hindering the reforms in the restructuring of industry,
enterprises and property.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Information Center under the State
Commission for Economic Restructuring, said that China's property
business boomed in 1994 and 1995, but cooled later because some
people feared the loss of state property.
</P>
<P>
"State properties are able to maintain and increase their value
only after they really enter into the market," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the establishment of a modern
enterprise system requires clearly defined property rights, the
flow and restructuring of the available assets, enliving state
enterprises by invigorating larger ones and liberalizing smaller
ones, and adjusting the industrial structure. The necessary
changes can not be separated from the question of property rights.
</P>
<P>
A statistical report showed that China has more than 200
property transactional organizations in major cities.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, more than 1,000 enterprises in Zhejiang and
Shandong provinces have been merged into other enterprises with
better economic results; and 1,200 businesses in Zhejiang and
Jiangxi provinces and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have been
sold out.
</P>
<P>
And 40 percent of the enterprises on Shanghai's market of rural
enterprises transactions were purchased by overseas and private
business people.
</P>
<P>
At present, Shanghai and Fujian have worked out local
regulations to supervise and manage the business.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the development of the property transactions
will help push China's reform and opening to new heights.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Market Offers HK New Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korea is adopting a
more open policy on imports, and the country is a growing export
market for Hong Kong businessmen, according to a research report
by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC).
</P>
<P>
TDC's market research report said South Korea's simplified
import procedure has brought about more export opportunities for
Hong Kong products with garments, kitchenware, watches, toys and
stationery as popular items, which are being exported freely to
Korea.
</P>
<P>
Another positive factor in the South Korean market is the
changes in its distribution system. The distribution system has
entered a transitional period as a new infrastructure has been
established and old facilities are being streamlined.
</P>
<P>
The report said that all department stores in South Korea have
set aside sales areas for imported goods to meet their clients'
needs. In Seoul alone, some 60 big chain supermarkets are doing
thriving business in imported items.
</P>
<P>
Asia remains one of the largest import sources for South Korea,
which accounted for 40.6 percent of the country's total imports in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong products are becoming more popular in South Korea.
Hong Kong's ladies clothing exports to South Korea were up 393
percent in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is Hong Kong's 6th largest trading partner, with
bilateral trade rising by 25 percent to 94.9 billion HK dollars
(12.24 billion US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, Hong Kong's domestic exports to South
Korea grew 14 percent to 2.4 billion HK dollars (309.7 million US
dollars) and showed a 13 percent growth in the first half of this
year when compared with the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Seeks Canadian Help in Fisheries Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will seek
Canadian assistance to develop the local fisheries industry
especially in formulating laws to preserve fish stock and training
manpower.
</P>
<P>
Canada, an advanced fishing nation, has successfully enforced
laws on the preservation of fish stock and Malaysia will send
staff of the Fisheries Department to Canada to further their
studies, Malaysian Agriculture Minister Sulaiman Daud said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Malaysian fisheries industry lost
millions in earnings because many fish that were caught were not
sold to consumers.
</P>
<P>
Small fish caught were discarded at sea due to various reasons
including the non-availability of fish mills, thus causing
depletion of stock and his ministry would look into ways to reduce
such losses and having laws is an alternative, he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement after opening the eighth ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Fisheries Federation
meeting and ASEAN-Canada Fisheries Post-Harvest Technology Project
conference here.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN presently groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 delegates from ASEAN member countries and Canada are
attending the three-day conference.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Japanese Outcry Over Diaoyu Islands Hits Headlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong media today gave
wide coverage of Sunday's demonstration, in which 12,000 people
took a five-hour march on the streets against Japanese claim to
the Diaoyu Islands.
</P>
<P>
Many newspapers carry a front-paged picture across the banner,
showing the grand scene of the rally and the surge of wave to
protect the Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
Singing patriotic songs, the protesters marched in heavy
showers from the downtown Causeway Bay to Central to show their
determination to safeguard the Islands. They waved banners and
chanted slogans to express their indignation at the revived
Japanese militarism.
</P>
<P>
A group composed of seven children aged between four and ten
took part in the protest Sunday, reports Ming Pao. They vowed to
protect the Diaoyu Islands because, as they said, they learned
from television programs the Diaoyu Islands are part of the
Chinese territory. A grandma in her nineties also took to the
streets, saying that the state affairs were related to every one
and every family, according to the Chinese paper.
</P>
<P>
Many local papers call for a diplomatic and peaceful approach
to the issue.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Steps up Legislation to Protect Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANZHOU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang
Province has formulated a number of regulations to tighten control
over land and protect land resources.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress has
issued a number of regulations to implement the Land Law,
including Rules on the Implementation of Land Management and the
Regulations Concerning the Protection of Basic Farmland.
</P>
<P>
The Zhejiang Land Administration has formulated seven sets of
regulations to tighten land control, such as the Regulations on
the Prompt Handling of Idle Land.
</P>
<P>
Provincial authorities are now formulating the Regulations on
Supervision over Land Use and the Regulations on Management of
Urban Zoning.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the regulations, Zhejiang saved 1,300
hectares of land used for construction in the first half of 1996,
a greater amount than reported in the same period last year,
despite a larger construction scale.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, farmers in Zhejiang, one of the most developed areas
in China, reclaimed over 330 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 43 million people, Zhejiang covers only
100,000 square kilometers. With the substantial increase in
population and rapid economic development, the contradiction
between a huge population and limited land is becoming
increasingly evident.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, land administration departments at all
levels had prevented 220 hectares of farmland from being occupied
without good reason.

<HEADLINE> Ratio of Female Parliamentarians on Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Women parliamentarians
worldwide are on the decline, according to the 96th conference of
the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which opened today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are an average of 10.4 women out of every 100
parliamentarians, down from 11.3 in mid-1995, data released at the
conference reveals.
</P>
<P>
China is a glowing example where women are playing a major role
in the country's political affairs. Its National People's Congress
is the largest parliament in the world, in which women account for
21 percent, about twice the world average.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, females make up 11 percent of the House
of Representatives and eight percent of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The highest world average rate was recorded in 1988, when the
proportion of female parliamentarians stood at 14.8 percent, which
means that the current level is nearly a third lower than eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The data also indicates that the percentage of female
parliamentarians in North Europe is higher than anywhere else,
with Sweden leading all other countries with a 40.4 percent level,
followed by 39.4 percent in Norway, 33.5 percent in Finland and 33
percent in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast, there is not a single woman in the
parliaments of six countries -- Comoros, Djibouti, Kuwait,
Mauritania, Papua New Guinea and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ahmed Fathy Sorour, President of the IPU's Council, said at
a meeting of female parliamentarians Sunday that the IPU advocates
the establishment of a new partnership between men and women in
political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Men and women must cooperate, as problems like poverty have a
significant impact on both sexes, Sorour said.

<HEADLINE> Washing Machine-driers Sales Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Sales of combination washing
machine-driers are showing continuous growth in Japan amid an
increasing number of working women, Kyodo reported today.
</P>
<P>
Although relatively expensive, the machines meet rising demand
for devices which cut both time and work, and thus are being seen
as a growing market by electrical appliance manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Sharp Corp. and Sanyo Electric Co. are currently the two major
providers of the machines, co-developed with European makers and
produced abroad. Other makers are likely to enter the market next
year.
</P>
<P>
Sharp sold 30,000 units of its "Shinkansen" model, developed
jointly with Swedish maker Electrolux AB, between its introduction
in May last year and this March, and monthly sales continue at the
5,000 units-plus level, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Priced at 200,000 yen (1,504 U.S. Dollars), the washing
machine has a capacity of six kilograms and the drier three
kilograms, Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
Sanyo's "Himawari" (sunflower) model, developed jointly with
an Italian maker and with capacities of 5 kg and 2.5 kg for the
washer and dryer respectively, has also sold at a monthly rate of
some 5,000 units since its introduction in March at a price
190,000 yen, Sanyo said.
</P>
<P>
Both machines have hit record levels for imported machines.
</P>
<P>
The main users include the aged and company officials who are
assigned posts in areas where they have to live away from their
families, as well as working women and housewives, the companies say.
</P>
<P>
The machines are also helpful for the disabled as the door is
attached in front, rather than on the top like ordinary washing
machines in Japan, the electric makers said.
</P>
<P>
Even their price, at almost half the monthly average wage, is
"not too expensive" compared with the total cost for both separate
washing machine and drier, Kyodo quoted a Sharp spokesman as
reporting.
</P>
<P>
The companies forecast possible domestic production in the
future as the market grows further along with competition in both
price and function.

KUWAIT CITY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry delivered a message from U.S. President Bill
Clinton to Saudi King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz before leaving Saudi
Arabia early this morning, according to the Saudi Press Agency
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Perry delivered the message during a meeting with Fahd in
Jeddah in western Saudi Arabia Sunday night upon his arrival in
the city from Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Perry was on a shuttle Gulf tour which had taken him to Kuwait
and Bahrain. the Saudi Press Agency said the content of the
message was not revealed.
</P>
<P>
The agency said it believed the letter dealt with the
objectives and issues on which Perry said in Kuwait Sunday
President Clinton hoped for consultation with U.S. allies. The
U.S. also will reaffirm its commitment to Kuwait's safety and
brief its allies on its strategy toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This was Perry's second Saudi trip in two days. He inspected
the U.S. air forces deployed in Riyadh, Saudi capital, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Perry was on a mission to seek support for a possible further
U.S. military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had already sent eight stealth f-117 fighters to
Kuwait last Friday. But it has delayed the earlier announced move
to send 5,000 troops to Kuwait to round out the heavy military
equipment deployed in the country since 1994 when Iraq moved
forces to Kuwaiti border.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber still has not given permission to
the U.S. troops' access to the Gulf state although Perry raised
the demand Sunday moring during a meeting with the Emir.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Bahrain Sunday agreed to play host
to 23 U.S. F-16 jet fighters, becoming only the second Gulf
nation to allow U.S. forces to operate from its soil in the
current confrontation with Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Hopes More Dialogues with France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
today that China and France should not only further promote
all-round bilateral cooperative ties, but also continue dialogues
and cooperation in the international sphere.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting in Beijing with French Minister of Equipment,
Lodgement, Transport and Tourism, Bernard Pons, the premier said
the Chinese government appreciates the active approach President
Jacques Rene Chirac and the French government took towards
developing Sino-French relations. He said China will make efforts
to promote a further development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that there are various fields for economic cooperation
between China and France, adding that the cooperation has made
major progress in certain big projects, such as the Daya Bay
Nuclear Power Station. He said negotiations on joint production of
100-seat plane are progressing well.
</P>
<P>
The successful cooperation on this project, according to Li,
will symbolize an important step forward in Sino-French and
Sino-European cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to President Chirac's China visit next
May, with a belief that his visit will enhance the friendly
bilateral ties between the two countries," said the premier.
</P>
<P>
According to Pons, President Chirac values France's cooperative
relations with Asia, and with China in particular. During his
recent meeting with Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of China's Central
Military Commission, Chirac reiterated France's understanding of
the importance of relations between France and China.
</P>
<P>
Pons added that President Chirac and the French government have
been deeply impressed with the results of Premier Li Peng's recent
visit to France.
</P>
<P>
Pons said that the fact that more than 20 leading French
entrepreneurs have come to China with him indicates the positive
attitude that the French government and the industrial circles
have towards economic cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
The French minister said there has been a consensus between
France and its European partners that a cooperation with China in
the area of airplane manufacturing should be vigorously promoted,
and the French government is willing to work along with the
entrepreneurs to put the project into operation.

<HEADLINE> 14 Chinese Scientists Win "Elite Science and Technology Award" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen Chinese scientists
and technicians have been awarded the "Elite Science and
Technology Award" initiated by Chao Chung Ting, winner of the 1976
Nobel Prize for Physics, and established by Hong Kong-based Elite
Industrial Holdings LTD.
</P>
<P>
The winners received the non-government sponsored prize,
presented by the State Science and Technology Commission, for
their outstanding achievements in five agricultural, forestry and
chemistry research and application projects.
</P>
<P>
Each research group was awarded 100,000 Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, Minister in charge of the State Science and
Technology Commission, said at the awards ceremony that the work
to reinvigorate the country through science and technology, while
maintaining sustainable economic development, must rely on the
transformation of scientific and technological achievements into
productive forces.
</P>
<P>
He said China will advance the move by drafting laws and
policies, and mobilizing all possible forces.
</P>
<P>
Chao Chung Ting said China's population accounts for one-fourth
of the world's total, while its contribution to world science
development accounts for less than one-fourth.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that China will take 25 percent of the share of
development advances in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yongling, President of the Elite company, said his firm
will provide venture investment for the mainland's science
application projects, especially those that are agricultural.
</P>
<P>
The five awards went to projects such as a compound regulating
agent for plant growth called ABT, a strain of high-quality rape
developed by genetical engineering, high-yield rubber tree
planting in high-elevated areas in Yunnan, the use of
medium-grade phosphine mines for phosphine amine production, and
the MB-86 catalytic promoter for polypropylene production.
</P>
<P>
The ABT regulating agent has been used for growing over 1,000
kinds of plants in about 80 percent of China's counties. To date,
735 million U.S. dollars in profits have been generated by the use
of the high-tech agent.

BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen said here today that Africa will achieve prosperity in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that China will always support the African people,
when he was meeting with a delegation composed of diplomats from
African countries and headed by Mundabi Bolumbu of Zaire's foreign
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Qian, also vice-premier of China, said, despite many changes in
the international sphere, Sino-African friendship has never
changed. He noted that after the Second World War the African
countries generally became de-colonialized.
</P>
<P>
"It's foreseeable that prosperity and development in Africa
will also be realized in the next century," Qian added.
</P>
<P>
With regards to China's foreign policy toward Africa, Qian said
the Chinese government always respects African people's
self-determination in their choices and does not interfere with
their domestic affairs, not only in their national liberation and
independence, but also in economic cooperation with African
nations.
</P>
<P>
He noted China has always held that its cooperation with
African countries is mutually beneficial on a basis of equality.
</P>
<P>
Mundabi expressed his gratitude to China for its help and
support to African countries. He said African countries had
completed their political de-colonialization, and at present they
are still on the road of economic de-colonialization. He hopes
China will continue to help African countries get out of their
dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister stressed that China's friendly
ties with African nations is demonstrated in its support, not only
to their independence and emancipation, but also to economic
development. He reassured that the Chinese people will stand by
the African people.
</P>
<P>
The African delegation arrived in Beijing on September 9, on a
23-day working visit to China, as guest of the Chinese People's
Institute of Foreign Affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A Museum at the ancient
Temple of Marquis Wu, Zhuge Liang (181-234) is to be given a
multi-million yuan boost by the government of Chengdu City in
China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The government is to allocate one-hectare of land for an
expansion and improvement program at the historic site, costing
several million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Temple of Marquis Wu lies to the south of provincial
capital Chengdu, and was built in memory of Zhuge Liang, prime
minister of the Kingdom of Shu in the Three Kingdoms period
(220-280). Its construction dates back to the sixth century.
</P>
<P>
In the temple also lies the tomb of Liu Bei, the ruler of the
Kingdom of Shu. It is said that Liu and his two wives are buried
together in the tomb.
</P>
<P>
An official at the museum said that the allocated land and
funding will be used for the improvements and protection work at
the Temple of Marquis Wu.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Museum for the Temple of Marquis Wu,
Zhuge Liang, will become a center for collecting, displaying, and
studying historical relics and archives related to the culture of
the Three Kingdoms period.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Chengdu City government and the cultural
relics departments in Chengdu have spent three million yuan (over
370,000 US dollars) rebuilding a number of ancient structures in
the Temple, collecting historical relics in Han Dynasty (206
B.C-220), and holding symposiums on the culture of the Three
Kingdoms period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, lightning conductors and fire alarm systems have
been installed on ancient structures and trees.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in the first half of this year, 500,000
yuan (over 62,000 US dollars) was earmarked to renovate the tomb of
Liu Bei.

<HEADLINE> Over One Milliion People Participate in Lebanon's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 16 (Xinhua) -- 1,137,040 out of totally
2,077,257 eligible voters participated in Lebanon's general
elections this year, making the turnout amount to 44 percent,
according to Lebanese Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr.
</P>
<P>
From August 18 to September 15, the five-phased election was
held in the country's five areas on successive five Sundays.
</P>
<P>
Results of the fifth and last round of elections in the Beqaa
in the country's eastern part will be announced Monday night or
Tuesday morning after counting all the votes in the constituency.
</P>
<P>
People from all sectarian communities, religions and areas
participated in the elections, Al-Murr, who is also the deputy
prime minister, told a press conference held in his office late
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
"Since the first day when the issue of parliamentary elections
was raised, we had been facing a wave calling on the citizens to
boycott the elections and another demanding a postponement of the
elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But the state decided to hold the elections in order to keep
the democracy and maintain the health political atmosphere in
Lebanon which objected an extension of the present parliament,"
the interior minister added.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that people's active participation in the
elections was a "response to the demands of the boycott and
extension."
</P>
<P>
The highest turnout, which was put at 52 percent, was
registered in the last round of elections in the Beqaa, while the
lowest, which was put at 33 percent, was scored in the Beirut
constituency.
</P>
<P>
Al-Murr noted that the complaints lodged to his Interior
Ministry during the elections "were all formal and did not affect
the outcomes of the elections."
</P>
<P>
The 1996 general election was the second since the country's
15-year civil war ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Most Christians and some Moslems boycotted the last general
elections in 1992, lowering the general turnout down to only
13 percent, on the grounds that there could not be a just
election in this country as long as there were foreign
troops on its lands.

</P>
<P>
The savings deposits of urban residents increased at an annual
rate of 30 percent, reaching 3.5 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, people's spending on housing only constitutes a small
percentage of total sales of commodities. Urban residents are
being encouraged to invest in residences, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The development of residential houses will stimulate production
of 50 related industries, such as building materials, metallurgy,
textiles and chemistry.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, residential construction swallowed 14 percent of the
country's steel output, 47 percent of cement, 40 percent of glass
and 20 percent of timber.
</P>
<P>
The building cost per square meter has risen from 703 yuan in
1990 to last year's 1,710 yuan. This has hindered individual
purchasing of houses, it said.
</P>
<P>
The article called for straightening out of government policies
in this respect, and building a housing supply system catering to
the needs of consumers in different groups.

<P>
KAMPALA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A devastating fungal disease
has destroyed hundreds of coffee plantations in western Uganda,
"the New Vision" paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Evarest Balyesima, the deputy district agricultural officer of
Bundibugyo district said the disease, known as trycomycosis, was
first reported in the district three years ago but was moved.
</P>
<P>
He said the fungus attacks the collar region, base of the
plant and causes leaves to turn yellow and whole plant to die.
</P>
<P>
Specialists said the disease could not be controlled by
chemicals and advised farmers to burn the infected plants, to
restrict the movement of the affected seed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, researchers at the coffee research center suspected
an incurable coffee wilt disease is ruining coffee in central
Kiboga district, some 120 kilometers northwest of Kampala.

<HEADLINE> Henan Makes Headway in Anti-pollution Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENZHOU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan
Province has made headway in dealing with industrial pollution in
recent years, remarkably reducing the discharge of waste gas,
waste water and industrial residue.
</P>
<P>
According to the province's environmental supervision
department, all major rivers in Henan are polluted to some degree,
and some posed health hazards to the residents who live nearby.
</P>
<P>
Early in 1991, the province focused on the treatment of eight
heavily-polluted rivers, and 200 factories which discharged 65
percent of the province's industrial waste.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, Henan had closed down 1,380 small paper
mills, considerably reducing the discharge of wastewater, waste
gas and waste residue.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the provincial environmental protection
bureau said that although progress has been made in curbing
industrial pollution, the general environment in the province is
still not satisfactory, and is a major obstacle to economic
development and social progress.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government recently proposed that in the next
five years, the province should significantly increase its
industrial output, while maintaining its industrial pollution
level no higher than that reported in 1995.

To improve highway traffic conditions, the city will accelerate
the construction of transportation facilities, and impose heavy
fines on random parking or speeding, illegally-built construction
projects at road sides and illegal business operation of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The city will also plant trees along 15 avenues, improve
vegetation in three parks and build six new parks. City officials
also will strengthen management of advertisement boards, new
residential quarters, and the catering trade.

<HEADLINE> Qing Dynasty Imperial Steles Found in Hebei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,800 imperial
steles from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) have been found in north
China's Hebei Province, where Qing's imperial tombs and a large
number of summer resorts are located.
</P>
<P>
Most of the steles were discovered during a general survey of
cultural relics and are in good condition with clear inscriptions.
</P>
<P>
Wu Sufang, a member of the survey team, said that the province,
which rings the Qing capital, Beijing, was the site of many
important imperial rites, hunts, and tours, has many steles that
record these events.
</P>
<P>
The steles differ from those of previous dynasties, which often
consist of a base, a body, and a top, in that the Qing imperial
steles have a spire surmounting the top, which is in the style of
a dragon, and are sometimes contained in a pavilion.
</P>
<P>
What is more unusual, is the fact that each of the steles has
inscriptions in the Chinese, Manchu, Mongolian, and Tibetan
languages.
</P>
<P>
Many of the inscriptions are a copy of the calligraphy of the
Kangxi and Qianlong emperors.
</P>
<P>
The study of steles represents part of modern Chinese
archaeology and has increasingly popular among Chinese scholars
since the Song Dynasty (960-1279).

<HEADLINE> China Holds First National Ozone Layer Protection Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China today held its first
national conference on ozone layer protection, the second
International Ozone Day.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, State Councillor and Minister in charge of the
Environmental Protection Commission under the State Council, spoke
of China's active participation in the ozone layer protection.
</P>
<P>
He said at the conference, "Although we are a developing
country, with dual missions of economic development and
environmental protection, China has actively participated in the
international cooperation to protect the ozone layer."
</P>
<P>
He added that China was among the first to propose the
establishment of the multilateral fund mechanism to implement the
Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.
</P>
<P>
China has ratified the Vienna Convention for the Protection of
the Ozone Layer, and the London amendment to the Montreal
Protocol, set up a special coordinating body, and worked out the
"National Program for the Phasing-out of Ozone Depleting
Substances."
</P>
<P>
"These show the determination and sincerity of the Chinese
government to protect the ozone layer, and implement the
conventions," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that developed countries should take the major
responsibility for the ozone layer depletion.
</P>
<P>
"We hoped that they would actively act in accordance with the
provisions of the Montreal Protocol to make financial
contributions, and transfer the technology in order to support the
developing countries in their phasing-out processes," he said,
adding that the establishment of an effective technology transfer
mechanism is necessary in the international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yangzu, deputy chief of the State Bureau for Environmental
Protection, disclosed that, during the Ninth Five-year Plan
(1996-2000) period, China plans to control the installation of new
ozone depleting substance production and consumption, reduce the
volume of production and consumption of the substances by 50
percent, and ensure the production of substitutes be nationalized.
</P>
<P>
"But the prerequisite is to have support from the Multilateral
Fund, and relevant technology to be transfered," he said.

<P>
KAMPALA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's inflation rate for
August 1996 fell to 7.4 percent compared to 7.8 percent in July,
reported "the New Vision" paper today.

<HEADLINE> German Minister on Bosnian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said today that the Bosnian elections held Sunday were not
ideal but indispensable.
</P>
<P>
The elections are seen as an indispensable step for a country
that has suffered deeply but is working for the survival of all
nationalities, Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
They signified progress that is being made toward another
important phase in implementing the Dayton Agreement signed last
December, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, the elections failed to reach the
normal standard of a democratic state as the situation in the
region remains unstable.
</P>
<P>
The fact that most of the 320,000 Bosnian refugees now staying
in Germany have participated in the elections demonstrated their
concerns over the future politics in the country.
</P>
<P>
Whether the Bosnian refugees are willing to go home will depend
on their viewpoints on the political situation in their homeland,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local newspaper of Welt am Sonntagm,
Kinkel did not rule out the possibility of Germany sending a
battalion of fighting forces of Bundeswhr (German Federal Defense
Forces) to Bosnia if the U.N. mandate for peacekeeping in the
region is extended.
</P>
<P>
Whether or how to send the German fighting forces to Bosnia
will be decided by NATO and the United Nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper today reported that the German Defense Ministry
is planning to dispatch 2,500 troops to replace its 4,000
servicemen in the U.N. peacekeeping forces stationed in the
war-torn Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry's plan to send fighting forces has evoked
varied repercussions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Guenter Verheugen, vice-chairman of the parliament group of the
Social Democratic Party, said he favored the extension of the
peacekeeping mission in the region, but is opposed to the plan of
the Defense Ministry.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army continues
to monitor Syrian troop deployments in Lebanon and Syria, finding
no significant changes over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post quoted sources as saying that the army
has adjusted its intelligence gathering along the Lebanese and
Syrian borders, and has found no abrupt movements.
</P>
<P>
Syrian, who has some 30,000 troops in Lebanon, has been
redeploying its forces there for the past few weeks, and army
units have been pulled out of landmark positions in and around
Beirut, capital of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Most of the redeployed troops have taken up positions in the
mountain range on the Syrian border where the Syrian army has
Sam-7 anti-aircraft missiles and anti-aircraft gun batteries
installed.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Beirut said that 20,000 Syrian soldiers had
already moved from Beirut, the central Lebanese mountains and
other regions toward the Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian troop movements started last month when troops
evacuated a number of positions in the mountains of central
Lebanon in what Lebanese sources announced was a defensive
redeployment after apparent Israeli threats to attack Syrian
forces in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Despite the pullouts, sources said, armed Syrian troops are
still stationed in Beirut, and these troops are highly visible
in some areas, including Shiite Moslem suburbs that are a
stronghold of the Hezbollah.

ANKARA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Perry arrived at Ankara Esenboga Airport this morning on
part of his Middle East tour aimed at securing support for a
possible military showdown with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A White House official said before Perry's departure to the
Middle East that the purpose of his tour is to "share our
intention and options with our allies and friends and get their
input on the degree to which they would support such action and
the implication of such action."
</P>
<P>
Turkish National Defense Minister Turhan Tayan received Perry
at the airport. Perry visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain
before he came to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Perry is expected to meet with Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel, Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi, Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller and other
high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
Turkish sources said that the United States wants to use
Incirlik airbase in Adana, southern Turkey, for any potential air
strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan sent a
message to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein: " Turkey will not
allow the bombing from Incirlik. We are not siding with the
intervention of the U.S."
</P>
<P>
A U.S.-led allied air force based in Incirlik has been
patrolling over northern Iraq since the 1991 Gulf war.

<P>
The air force, made up of U.S., British and French warplanes
and support aircraft, daily patrols the "no-fly zone," set up on
north of the 36th parallel after the Gulf War to deter the
Iraqi attacks on Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The force's strength and composition vary according to the
demands of the situation although Turkey wants to limit the
number of the combat planes to 48.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Vital to World Peace, Stability: Jiang Zemin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China is an important force
for safeguarding world peace and stability, and a developed and
stronger China will certainly make greater contribution to world
peace, stability and progress, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"The turn of the century is approaching, which has placed us at
another important historical juncture," Jiang Zemin said at the
inaugural ceremony of the 96th conference of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) this morning.
</P>
<P>
"What kind of world shall we bring into the new century? This
is an issue that people throughout the world are giving greater
attention to and one to be addressed at this Conference," he said.
</P>
<P>
The general international situation at present features a
growing trend towards multipolarity. To seek world peace, national
stability, economic development and social progress has become the
irresistible trend of our times, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
"But we must not lose sight of the destabilizing factors,
especially the persistent presence of hegemonism and power
politics, the widening gap between the rich and poor, precarious
conditions for survival and development of mankind and the
intranquility in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As we live in the same planet, we must respect each other,
enhance cooperation, maintain peace and promote development, which
should become the consensus shared by those statesmen and
far-sighted men who care about the future of the mankind and what
all countries in the world should do," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China is an important force making for world peace and
stability. It maintains that state-to-state relations should be
based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and other
universally recognized principles governing international
relations and a just and equitable new international political and
economic order should be established, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people are ready to work with
governments and peoples of other countries for a better world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"As far back as the early 1980s, Mr. Deng Xiaoping admonished
us to do a good job in three areas, namely, modernization,
national reunification ad world peace," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We have made unremitting efforts in these areas over the past
ten years and more. As a result, our economy has grown steadily,
various undertakings have thrived, our people's life has improved
markedly and the aggregated national strength increased with each
passing day," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 and 1999, the Chinese government will resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao respectively.
Jiang noted that the Chinese people have the ability, means and
confidence to remove all the obstacles and accomplish the great
cause of national reunification, including the return of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
At present, people of all ethnic groups in China, united as one
and full of confidence, are working hard to advance the great
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. A
developed and stronger China will certainly make greater
contribution to world peace, stability and progress, Jiang
said.

<HEADLINE> Boutros-Ghali Calls for More Cooperation between UN, IPU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Secretary-General expressed his hope that the Inter-Parliamentary
Union (IPU) will have closer and more consolidated ties with the
UN to help promote greater respect and protection of human rights
and ensure the right to food.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the 96th Inter-Parliamentary Conference opened
here today, Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali said parliamentarians across
the world are playing a more and more important role in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Deputy UN Secretary-General and the special representative of
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Ambassador Joseph V. Reed read out the
message to the conference this morning.
</P>
<P>
In his message, the Secretary-General said that the
parliamentarians participate in UN operations ranging from
electoral assistance to institution building and preventive
diplomacy, and serve as essential links between the world
organization and the world public, building understanding and
support for UN goals and activities.
</P>
<P>
He added that the world's parliaments have an important role in
the area of human rights. "They can enact legislation making
national laws conform with international norms. They can allocate
natinal resources - personnel as well as funding - to support such
legislation. And they can establish parliamentary commissions to
monitor the effectiveness of legislation and recommend new or
redoubled efforts where necessary."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the
special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on Violence
against Women, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and other
UN focal points for human rights all wish to work more closely
with parliaments individually and through the IPU.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward in particular to the Inter-Parliamentary Union
Symposium scheduled to be held in New Delhi In February 1997 on
promoting partnership between men and women in politics."
</P>
<P>
According to the Secretary-General, another fundamental task
for parliaments is to promote implementation of the right to food
through national legislation and policies that address the root
causes of hunger and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
He termed the food problem as "acute". Close to 800 million
people in developing countries face chronic under-nutrition. As
many as 88 nations fall into the category of low-income
food-deficit countries.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Boutros-Ghali said, bilateral and
multilateral assistance to developing country agriculture is
declining. Fisheries are being overexploited. Forests are being
destroyed. As world population grows, the per-capita availability
of arable land will decrease even further.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Summit scheduled to convene in Rome in November
will address these issues at the highest level. Ministrers of
foreign affairs, agriculture, trade, economy and development
co-operation will also attend, along with non-governmental
organizations and other members of civil society.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to note that there are plans for
a 'Parliamentarians' Day' during the proceedings. Your input will
be especially welcome, and influential." said the
Secretary-General.

Lu Youmei, president of the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project
Development Corporation (CTGPC), said that "damming of the Yangtze
River at the end of 1997 is a foregone conclusion."
</P>
<P>
The construction quality has met the design demands and
investments in the project have remained within the budget, said
Lu, whose company is in charge of the project, targeted for
completion in 2009.
</P>
<P>
By August, investment in the 17-year project had reached 17
billion yuan (about two billion US dollars based on current
prices), which met construction costs. Of this figure, over 16
billion yuan has been invested in fixed assets of the project, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The appearance of the 15-square-kilometer construction site
changes day by day, due to the efforts of over 20,000 workers. So
far, they have excavated 120 million cubic meters of earth and
stone, and have placed over 2.6 million cubic meters of concrete.
</P>
<P>
Some 83 percent of the digging for a water diversion channel
built to change the navigation course of the Yangtze River is
finished. The 350-meter-wide channel, known as an "artificial
Yangtze," will be navigable by next April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 90 percent of the excavation for a temporary
shiplock and a shiplift on the left bank of the river has been
completed.
</P>
<P>
Work on the two projects will be mostly wrapped up by next
year, Lu said.

<HEADLINE> China Protects Citizens' Rights Comprehensively: Top Legislator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China has made marked
progress in promoting political structural reform, building
socialist political democracy and advancing socialist culture and
ethics since it embarked on a reform and opening-up drive in the
late 1970s, a top legislator said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Such fundamental rights of citizens as political and property
rights, right of the person, rights to work and to education are
extensively covered by China's Constitution and laws," Qiao Shi,
chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee, said in a speech delivered to the opening of the 96th
Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
</P>
<P>
China has formulated the Civil Procedural Law, the Criminal
Procedural Law, the Administrative Procedural Law, the State
Compensation Law and many others, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
"These laws set out explicit stipulations for the protection of
citizens' rights of action and their right to state compensation
in accordance with law," Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
To protect the rights and interests of special interest groups,
Qiao said, China has enacted the Law on the Protection of Women's
Rights and Interests, the Law on the Protection of Minors, the Law
on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Senior Citizens,
and the Law on the Protection of the Disalbed.
</P>
<P>
"China's laws for safeguarding its citizens' rights are quite
comprehensive and fairly complete," Qiao said, adding that China
has adopted 300 laws and decisions on legal matters and thereby
put into place a legal system by and large with the Constitution
at its core.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he noted, China has stepped up its efforts to
enact a batch of laws on market economy with a view to promoting
the standardization of economic management system and operational
mechanism and running them by law.
</P>
<P>
The NPC and its Standing Committee have greatly intensified the
supervision over the implementation of the Constitution and laws
and have gradually improved and strengthened the supervision over
the work of the administrative, judicial and procuratorial organs,
Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
"Practice has proved that the NPC and its Standing Committee
play an important role in the life of our nation," Qiao told
parliamentarians from 133 countries.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to build China into a strong, prosperous,
democratic, culturally-advanced modern socialist country," Qiao
said. "we have full confidence that the Chinese people have every
ability to achieve the goal through generations of unremitting
efforts."

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Workers in south China's
Guangdong Province can now freely choose jobs in any place and any
kind of enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicate that 6.5 million people from rural
areas in the province, and from other provinces, now work in
various enterprises in Guangdong -- state-owned companies,
collectively-owned businesses, Sino-foreign joint ventures and
private firms.
</P>
<P>
Under a new employment system in Guangdong characterized by
two-way selection, employers can freely choose qualified employees
and employees choose desired jobs and employers.
</P>
<P>
University graduates can also freely choose jobs, in a change
from job assignment by the government.
</P>
<P>
The new performance-based employment system has brought about
changes in the salary and wage system in an effort to increase
productivity, according to an official of the Provincial Labour
Department.
</P>
<P>
Under the new wage system, enterprises, except for state-own
companies, have eliminated equalitarianism in salary distribution.
</P>
<P>
In some hotels in the city a veteran chef can earn 30,000 yuan
(about 3,500 US dollars) a month, compared with 500 or 600 yuan
for a waiter or a waitress.

<HEADLINE> India Plagued by Power Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indian power scenario
presents a very dismal picture with a widening gap between the
demand and supply in power, the Indian Express said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a study by the Confederation of Indian Industry
(CII), the demand for power is on the rise with rapid
industrialization of the country, while the present installed
capacity has not kept pace with growing demands of the industry.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year of 1995-96 (April-March), power requirement
was 378 billion kwh (kilowatt-hour) but actual power generated was
in the region of 351 billion kwh with 7.1 percent deficit.
</P>
<P>
The power sector is plagued by problems of inadequate
generating capacity and high transmission and distribution losses
which have contributed to the increasing gap between the demand
and supply in power.
</P>
<P>
Very slow implementation of power projects is another factor
responsible for the country's power deficit, the study said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Airlines to Raise Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indian airlines has
decided to raise fares on domestic routes by an average of 16
percent from September 22, the Times of India said today.
</P>
<P>
However, in case of flights operating in the northeastern
states of the country, the increase will be 10 percent, an
official release said.
</P>
<P>
The revision in fares has been necessitated by the increase in
the price of aircraft turbine fuel coupled with all-round
increases in several other input costs, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The price of aircraft turbine fuel was increased by 10 percent
in July, 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the revised fares will be applicable
for all tickets issued on or after September 22, 1996, and for
travel commencing on or after October 1, 1996, irrespective of the
date of issuance of tickets.

<HEADLINE> Lightweight Helicopter Heralds New Era for Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Expectations are high for a
lightweight helicopter jointly developed and produced by China,
France and Singapore, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Market surveys suggest world demand for EC 120 helicopters
stands at 1,600, the newspaper quoted Chen Qinan from the China
National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corp as saying.
</P>
<P>
The first EC 120 will be delivered in 1997, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Seven EC 120 helicopters, two demonstration and five pre-serial
production models, will be manufactured in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter is expected to be certified by France's Joint
Airworthiness Authority by the end of this year, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the five-seat EC 120 helicopter can meet
both military and civil requirements, including agricultural
spraying, search-and-rescue and evacuation operations,
intelligence uses and other applications.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters are economically efficient to operate,
competitively priced and easy to maintain, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Production will climb to 16 helicopters in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The EC 120 program started in 1992, and the helicopter made
its maiden flight in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, This is the first time China shared
investment and risks with foreign partners in helicopter
production. The Chinese company holds a 24 percent equity share,
France-based Eurocopter 61 percent, and Singapore-based Aerospace
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation lays a solid foundation for China to join
hands with other overseas helicopter makers," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
He said China is now working together with the United States,
Brazil, Japan and Spain and Taiwan region to make a new generation
of 19-seat helicopters, the Sikorsky S-92, expected to make its
first flight in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"China's helicopter industry is expected to make headway in the
next 10 years," said Chen, "because cooperation has helped train a
group of Chinese helicopter engineers."
</P>
<P>
China's helicopter sector has long been hampered by poor
quality and consequent low demand, but advances introduced with
the EC 120 should help change the sluggish situation in the
industry.

<HEADLINE> Right to Food Preconditions Political Rights: IPU Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A top official of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union said here today that the right to food
is the most fundamental human right and even preconditions
political rights.
</P>
<P>
The issue of human rights, especially for women and children,
and the problem of food security are very closely related, Ahmed
Sorour, President of the Council of IPU, said at the 96th
conference of the international organization for parliamentarians
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the right to food is the right to life itself,"
Sorour said. "And without securing the right to life no other
human right will hold any significance."
</P>
<P>
He said that the right to food includes most other human
rights, civil rights, economic rights and the right to development.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely necessary and urgent that concrete action is
taken in this respect, a task which amounts to no less than saving
the future of humanity as a whole because hunger, disease and
misery do not respect artificial political boundaries," Sorour
told the conference.
</P>
<P>
Of a total population of 5.7 billion, 800 million people are
chronically undernourished and about 200 million children under
the age of five suffer from protein and energy deficiencies,
Sorour noted, adding that sufficient food need to be produced for
three billion more people by the year 2030 while safeguarding the
natural resources of the earth.
</P>
<P>
"These alarming facts are the reason for which the General
Assembly of the United Nations endorsed in December 1995 the
decision of the FAO's governing conference to convene a World Food
Summit to examine the present situation and find solutions for the
future," Sorour said.
</P>
<P>
"I consider that our duty in this respect starts here and now,
because the outcome of our discussions here in Beijing will
constitute an important input and a force for momentum at the Rome
Food Summit," the president said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A selective examination
conducted by the Shanghai Technical Supervision Bureau shows that
domestic conditioners are more effective than imported ones.
</P>
<P>
The examination, which covers 48 kinds of air conditioners for
sale in China's leading industrial city, shows that 83.3 percent
of the China-made air conditioners are up to standards, a rise of
13.5 percent from the previous year. The standardization rate is
obviously higher than the imported ones.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributes this to the fact that most Chinese air
conditioner manufacturers have strong technology and follow
international standards of production for their products, the
bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The examination indicates that Chinese air conditioner
producers have successfully solved the problem of poor
refrigeration and excessive noise, which are two major
difficulties plaguing the domestic-made products.

KATHMANDU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's national flag
carrier, the Royal Nepal Airlines, has decided to slash down the
number of its flights to various destinations in India from today
due to a shortage of aircraft, newspapers said here today.
</P>
<P>
The airline's twice daily flights between Kathmandu and Delhi
are affected hardest by the cancellation move with all the flights
on September 17, 18, 20, 22, 25, 27 and 29 being canceled, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Scheduled flights to Calcutta and Mumbai from September 17 to

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Royal Nepal's weekly flights to Paris have also
been affected by the cancellation, according to airline
officials.
</P>

since early June.
</P>
<P>
The lease on the Yugoslav jet expired today, leaving the Royal
Nepal with only two wide-body Boeing 757 to operate in its

"We are firmly convinced that through self-improvement and
development, the socialist democratic political system we are
practising in China will demonstrate increasingly greater
vitality," Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Forms 3 Key Economic Regions to Boost Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Three key economic regions have
been formed in Vietnam in a bid to promote a balanced development
of the economy, according to local press.
</P>
<P>
The three areas are the northern triangle of Hanoi, Hai Phong
and Quang Ninh, the central region from Thua Thien-hue to Quang
Nam-Da Nang and Khanh Hoa, and the southern triangle of Ho Chi
Minh city, Dong Nai and Ba Ria-Vung Tau.
</P>
<P>
The three regions, which share a high and stable economic
growth rate and a rational economic structure attract most of
capital, labor and commodities.
</P>
<P>
The southern key economic region has posted an annual
industrial growth rate of 20 percent since 1991 with Ho Chi Minh
city in the lead.
</P>
<P>
Industrial parks have been built in the region producing
textiles, leather products, garments, building materials,
processed food, electronic goods, automobiles, motor-bikes and
home appliances.
</P>
<P>
The northern economic triangle has the advantage of natural
resources and cheap labor force. It has three border gates at
Mong Cai, Hoanh Mo and Bin Lieu, facilitating trade with China and
other countries.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure networks in this region include the Noi Bai
International Airport in the capital city, Cat Bi Airport in Hai
Phong, Hai Phong Port, and national highways are being upgraded.
</P>
<P>
The central key economic region lies on the main trans-Vietnam
corridor and is also a gate to the open sea and to Laos, Cambodia
and northeastern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam government is planning to built several large
industrial zones within next 15 years specializing in oil
refining, building materials, ship building and repairing, mining
and minerals, automobile and motor-bike assembly etc.
</P>
<P>
A 70-square kilometer port is also planned in Dung Quat which
will be Vietnam's biggest and most advanced port.

<P>
According to concerned sources today, an interim report on the
proposed urban poverty reduction project is ready for review
before it is given the final go-ahead for implementation expected
to start in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
The project includes 3 main components: slum upgrading which is
being designed to cover some 450,000 people, pilot housing and
policy development for addressing urban poverty.
</P>
<P>
A number of government agencies and non-government
organizations will be responsible for implementing the project,
but the Dhaka city corporation, the highest level administrative
body of the capital, will be its main driving force, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
An ADB study conducted early this year revealed the appalling
condition of Dhaka city where 55 percent of the population of 9.3
million remained below the poverty line and 32 percent below the
hard-core poverty line.

<P>
HANOI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is planning to provide
additional 470 megawatts (mw) to power supply in southern area
next year, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam Electricity Corporation (VEC) General
Director Le Liem, three thermal power plants will be built in the

</P>
<P>
Two turbine gas generator groups with total a capacity of 70 mw

<P>
The other two turbine gas generators with a capacity of 300 mw
as well as a 100-mw generator in this area will begin operation in
March 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, this is still not enough to meet the demand of the
area, especially Ho Chi Minh City, which annually consumes about
10 billion kilowatt-hours, or one third of the total electricity
in Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Introduce VAT Tax System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's current turnover tax
system will be replaced by a value-added tax (VAT) system by 1998
to meet the requirements of a new market economy, the Vietnam News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Finance Ministry officials as saying that a
draft VAT law will be drawn up and submitted to the National
Assembly for approval later this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, VAT rates of 0 percent, 5 percent, 10
percent and 15 percent will be imposed to replace the existing
turnover tax rates ranging from 0 percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
VAT, levied on the increased value of a product at each level
of manufacturing and marketing, will apply to all kinds of goods
produced or marketed in Vietnam, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
But in the first phase, only businesses which earn more than
600 million Vietnamese dong (about 54,000 U.S. dollars) in annual
turnover will be subject to the VAT system due to the limited
capacity of the tax sector, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Before the law is ready, VAT will be implemented on a trial
basis at 11 state-owned businesses and enterprises in the textile,
sugar and cement industries.
</P>
<P>
At present there are more than 6,000 state-owned, 25,000
non-state businesses and one million small traders in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
A Finance Ministry official said the government hopes VAT will
help eliminate double taxation and limit tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of VAT is also aimed at encouraging the
exports of locally-made products, to better control the production
and distribution of goods on the local market, and to streamline
tax procedures to help Vietnam's integration into the regional
economy.
</P>
<P>
Items subject to 5 percent VAT rate include fertilizer,
medicines, medical equipment, paper and food, while the 15 percent
rate will apply to luxury goods and services such as cosmetics,
the hotel industry and other goods and services subject to special
taxes.
</P>
<P>
The 10 percent rate will be levied on other items apart from
the above mentioned.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Finalizes Draft Commercial Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has finalized the draft
of its first commercial law and ready to submit it to the National
Assembly for approval in mid-October, sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
If passed, the commercial law will cover a wide scope including
definitions of free trade, healthy competition, traders and their
obligations and interests, equality before the law, leading roles
played by state-owned businesses, etc.
</P>
<P>
All these definitions and concepts have not been included in
any legal documents in Vietnam, where numerous commercial
activities are undertaken spontaneously while trade links and
cooperation are set up on consensus.
</P>
<P>
After 10 years of renovation, trade in Vietnam is now fast
paced. As a result, many new trading relationships have emerged
and require legal regulation and intervention in line with
international commercial laws and practices.
</P>
<P>
Current legal documents in this area are mainly sub-laws such
as decrees, ordinances, instructions and regulations monitoring
commercial activities or relating to trading relationships.
</P>
<P>
Luu Van Dat, head of the commercial law drafting
sub-committees, said the draft commercial law has been built on
the basis of the current commercial ordinance with reference to
commercial laws of other countries as well as surveys of Vietnam's
trading activities at present.
</P>
<P>
When it is effective, the commercial law will replace all
current sub-laws in trade and ensure impartiality in commercial
operations among traders.

JAKARTA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of the
General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), and
his party left here for home this morning at the end of a six-day
official visit to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Fu met with Indonesian President
Soeharto, Minister of Defense and Security Edi Sudrajat and Armed

In his speech, Fu also lashed out at "the theory of China's
threat," saying, "This is utterly groundless and ulteriorly
motivated." "It is aimed at containing the development of China,
sowing discord between China and its neighboring countries and
facilitating their arms sales," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Fu's speech was warmly welcomed by about 100 Indonesian
high-ranking officers and students of the institute.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese military delegation also visited some military

WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Fire destroyed a
predominantly black church in Indiantown, Florida, early Sunday
and investigators said the blaze appeared to arson.
</P>
<P>
Police had suspects in the fire but had not made any arrests
Sunday night. The early morning blaze at the Apostles Faith
Church of Jesus in Indiantown did not appear to be racially
motivated, police said.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling this one suspicious," fire prevention chief Jon
Pasqualone was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Federal agents joined the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Indiantown is a citrus and cattle farming community of about 50
kilometers northwest of West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
There have been more than 70 suspicious fires at church
properties belonging to predominantly black congregations in
Southern states since 1995. An equal number of fires have been
reported at white churches in the region.
</P>
<P>
There is evidence of racism in at least 18 of the fires.
Racial motivation has been ruled out in more than two dozen other
cases, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Parliament Unlikely to Ratify Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali Parliament may
not be able to ratify a border river development treaty between
Nepal and India at its current sesssion as the ruling and
opposition parties failed to reach a compromise at an all-party
meeting Sunday, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The joint session of the two houses of the Nepali Parliament
has been scheduled to vote on the Mahakali Treaty later today.
</P>
<P>
Though the ruling and opposition parties would meet again today
prior to the parliamentary meeting, they are less likely to change
their respective positions, the newspaper Kathmandu Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The government is committed to present the Mahakali Treaty,
signed last February in New Delhi by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba and his then Indian counterpart P.V. Narasimha Rao, to the
parliament for ratification today, the paper quoted government
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) still maintains its demand for written
commitments from the Indian government on several issues as
preconditions for its ratification.
</P>
<P>
The issues raised by the opposition party include India's
purchase of power from a hydropower project on the Mahakali River,
Nepal's claims to the river and removal of Indian troops from a
far-western Nepali district.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the response from the Indian side to these
demands was "not positive."
</P>
<P>
Ratification of the Nepal-India treaty on the integrated
development of the Mahakali River, which forms Nepal's western
border with India, needs at least a two-thirds majority support
from the 265-seat parliament, in which the main opposition party
has 101 members.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Curb Issuance of Bills of Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand is
expected to introduce tight control over the issuance of bills of
exchange by non-bank private institutions in a bid to curb the
country's high short-term external debts.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will require non-bank institutions to reveal
the outstanding amount of bills of exchange they have issued and
the move is believed to be a warning to the institutions about
this activity.
</P>
<P>
However, Central Bank Governor Rerngchai Marakanond said that
the timing for the introduction of new measures will depend on the
liquidity in the financial system and financial status of the
issuers.
</P>
<P>
It is now not a proper time to launch the measures when
liquidity in the financial system is tightening and most business
sectors are weak and short of fund supply, he was quoted as saying
by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The huge amount of bills of exchange sold overseas is
reportedly among the factors behind the country's high short-term
offshore debts of 41.1 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a central bank report, non-bank private
institutions' offshore debts totaled 24.2 billion dollars at the
end of 1995, about 7.3 billion dollars of which were short-term.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Strives to Be Biggest Palm oil Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is expected to
become the world's biggest palm oil producer as the country's oil
palm estates continue to expand, an official said.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, oil palm plantations in the country covered 1.8
million hectares, producing 4.8 million tons of crude palm oil,
Plantation Director Rante Tondok was quoted by the newspaper the
Indonesian Observer as saying today. The output accounted for
30.79 percent of the world's total that year.
</P>
<P>
However, Tondok said, Indonesia was still second to Malaysia,
the world's biggest palmoil producer, whose output accounted for
49.44 percent of the global production.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Malaysia's top position might sooner or later
be taken over by Indonesia. By 2010, he said, his country's palm
oil output may account for 43.02 percent of the world's total,
while Malaysia's production would continue to decline to only
38.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tondok said the oil palm estates in Indonesia would continue to
grow.
</P>
<P>
Under the primary cooperative credit program implemented in the
country's eastern provinces, the oil palm plantations will
increase by 600,000 hectares in the next few years, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said, effort to form partnership for
raising oil palm will be intensified. At present, 60 companies
plan to soon develop business partnership for the expansion of oil
palm estates and they will develop an additional 766,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
By last year, the government had approved 551 new major estates
covering 5.4 million hectares of land.

<HEADLINE> UN in Financial Crisis: Under-Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A top United Nations official
said here today that the world's largest international
organization is facing the worst and most protracted financial
crisis in its history, urging parliaments worldwide to continue to
support the UN.
</P>
<P>
As of August 31, arrears in payment for the regular and
peace-keeping budgets of the UN amounted to almost three billion
US dollars, said UN Under-Secretary-General Joseph Reed, who is
here attending the 96th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union as special representative of UN Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
"I regret to say that the host country of the United Nations
and the country of my birth - for reasons that you are aware of -
is the main debtor of the organization," Reed told
parliamentarians from 133 countries.
</P>
<P>
Reed said that the Secretary-General has asked him to mention
in particular that the People's Republic of China has always paid
membership dues on time and in full.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations is not one of the luxuries of international
life," Reed said." "The United Nations is the only machinery we
have for collective cooperation among all nations. It is the only
global tool for promoting peace and security. It is the only
worldwide institution for furthering development. It is the only
universal mechanism for protecting human rights. It is the only
shared framework for strengthening international law."
</P>
<P>
The work of the UN is of vital importance for saving children
from starvation and disease, providing food, clothing and shelter
for refugees, delivering humanitarian relief to the devastated
areas, working to stop the cycle of natural disasters in lands
repeatedly afflicted by them, countering the new internal threats
of crime, drugs and disease, and making peace between adversaries,
among other tasks, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
Despite economic difficulties, these activities are going on,
Reed said.
</P>
<P>
As mandated by the member states, the United Nations
Secretariat has undergone a serious restructuring and downsizing
over the past four years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The staff of the UN has been cut by 20 percent compared to ten
years ago and the number of departments and offices has been cut
from 20 to 12, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that further radical cuts are being prepared
for submission to the 51st session of the General Assembly, adding
that a new management plan has been launched by the Secretary
General aimed at increasing efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
Reed read an address of Boutros Boutros-Ghali to the conference
this morning.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Inter-Parliamentary Union And Its Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The 96th conference of the
world's largest international organization of parliaments opened
in the Chinese capital this morning.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,400 representatives, including 75 speakers and deputy
speakers and more than 600 parliamentarians are attending the
meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), a group whose aim
is to promote personal contacts between all members of
parliaments, so as to strengthen representative institutions and
promote world peace and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The principal themes to be discussed at the conference are the
protection of human rights, especially the rights of women and
children, and ensuring the right to food in the time of trade
liberalization and economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time China held the meeting of this kind.
</P>
<P>
The IPU was created in 1889 on the initiative of two
parliamentarians from the United Kingdom and France. It is now
headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. It is also the world's
largest organization of parliaments of sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
It forwards opinions on international issues relating to
parliaments' activities, as well as suggestions about the
development of representative institutions.
</P>
<P>
Since the Second World War, the IPU has developed into a center
for legislative institutions of different nations to dialogue with
each other and carry out parliamentary diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The IPU supports the efforts of the United Nations, shares its
objectives and works in close cooperation with it.
</P>
<P>
China's parliament, the National People's Congress, has been a
member of the IPU for over 12 years.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-Parliamentary Conference is the principal body that
expresses the IPU's views on political issues. It meets every
spring and autumn, bringing together parliamentarians from various
countries to study international problems and make recommendations
for action.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the conference is determined by the
Inter-Parliamentary Council based on the Executive Committee's
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
A supplementary item and an emergency supplementary item can be
chosen at the conference from proposals set forth by different
parliaments attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Issues discussed at the conferences over recent years
included: arms control, the Middle East, the war between Iran and
Iraq, south Africa, human rights, minority ethnic groups,
protection of children's rights, clearing up the remnants of
colonialism, outer space, and the world's food source.
</P>
<P>
By the first half of 1996, IPU had 135 members and four
associate members.
</P>
<P>
On April 2, 1984, the Inter-Parliament Council named the
Chinese National People's Congress, China's parliament, a member
of IPU. The Chinese delegation has attended every IPU conference
since the 71st, and some other special meetings.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold this year's meeting in Beijing was reached
at the 154th meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Council in Paris
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
This was another grand-scale international meeting of a
political turn hosted by China, which is proceeded by the Fourth
World Conference on Women of the United Nations a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Maradona Unsure If He'll Play Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Diego Marathona said here on
Sunday that he was not sure if he would continue his soccer career.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Argentine, at a brief news conference while
attending a street soccer tournament in London, hedged about his
future in the game.
</P>
<P>
"It's not decided if I will play again, but I don't think so,"
said Maradona, once considered the world's No. 1 player.
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely going to finish my training course to be a
certified manager," he added, fueling speculation he may one day
seek to coach Argentina's national team.
</P>
<P>
Maradona, who completed a 10-day treatment program for drug
abuse last month in Switzerland, has been on a "semi-holiday" in
recent weeks in Canada and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The temperamental Argentine entered the drug treatment program
after he was harshly criticized for missing five straight
penalties for his Boca Juniors club. He is still under contract
with the Boca team.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago in Canada, he played what was billed as the last
game of his career. He scored the winning goal in a match between
his brother Lalo's Toronto-based Italia team and a team of
all-stars from the seven-team Canadian National Soccer League.
</P>
<P>
Sunday he confirmed he will fly to the southern Spanish city of
Alicante on Monday, apparently to seek medical advice about
playing soccer again.

CHENGDU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Yang Yong, has become the
first primary school teacher with a master's degree in southwest
China's Sichuan Province.

The 70-year old Experimental Primary School in Chengdu, capital
of Sichuan, has also attracted eight more college graduates to
teach pupils in the new semester.
</P>
<P>
Many college students do not want to be primary school
teachers, because of lower pay and hard work, said Su Wenyu,
principal of the experimental primary school.
</P>
<P>
The school plans to improve the working and living
conditions for the new teachers, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Yang, 29, is the first primary school teacher with a master's
degree in Sichuan. He said that he will conduct a series
educational projects on basic learning as a primary school
teacher.

<HEADLINE> Costa Wins Bournemouth Tennis Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Spaniard Alberto
Costa came from behind to beat German Marc-Kevin Goellner 6-7,
6-2, 6-2 to win the Bournemouth International Open on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Costa follows another Spanish player, Jose Higueras, who won
the last Bournemouth tournament in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Costa was a decisive winner in a mainly baseline duel, but not
before a protracted protest from Goellner in the fourth game of
the final set.
</P>
<P>
Costa was leading 2-1 and 40-30 on the German's service and
then hit a fierce forehand immediately called out by the line
judge.
</P>
<P>
But umpire Gerry Armstrong over-ruled the decision -- then
awarded the game to Costa to give him a crucial 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
Goellner demanded that the umpire look at the line. The umpire
descended, but stuck to his decision.
</P>
<P>
Goellner then appeared to lose heart and Costa, world-ranked
15, won three of the next four games to win his third title of the
year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wishes Yeltsin Well on Heart Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton today called Russian President Boris Yeltsin to wish him
well on his forthcoming heart surgery, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
"It was just a (friendly) call to talk about his pending
surgery and to wish him luck," White House spokeswoman Mary Ellen
Glynn told reporters accompanying Clinton on his trip in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders talked for about 10 minutes before Clinton left
Washington for the one-day campaign trip to the country's
heartland.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who told Russians 10 days ago that he would have
bypass surgery, suffered two heart attacks last year. Because of
health problems in summer, Yeltsin virtually disappeared from
public view for weeks. His aides initially said he was exhausted
after a long re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials told reporters that the Russian leader
expressed his gratitude for Clinton's good wishes and for the
readiness of U.S. surgeons to take part in pre-operation
consultations with their Russian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Two top German cardiologists are expected to join a Russian
team of experts to review Yeltsin's case.
