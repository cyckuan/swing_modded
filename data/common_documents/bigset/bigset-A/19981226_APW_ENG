Report: Japan considers wider U.N. peacekeeping role for troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The government is considering allowing Japanese
troops to give wider logistical support to U.N. peacekeeping
missions, newspapers reported Saturday.
	   The Japanese constitution, written by the U.S. occupation
authorities after World War II, limits the Japanese military to
self-defense, and Tokyo has allowed its troops only restricted
involvement in U.N. missions.
	   But the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is being forced to come
up with a wider policy as a condition for a coalition government
with the opposition Liberal Party, the Asahi and Yomiuri newspapers
reported.
	   The Foreign Ministry is working on a proposal setting new
guidelines for Japanese involvement in medical, transportation and
other support for U.N. peacekeepers, but away from combat zones,
the newspapers said, citing unidentified government sources.
	   The head of the Liberal Party, Ichiro Ozawa, is pushing the
government to change its interpretation of the constitution to
allow Japanese soldiers to join any U.N. backed military
operations, such as the 1991 Gulf War to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
	   But the Asahi newspaper said the government opposes that,
arguing that the constitution bans any operations abroad that
involve combat, the newspaper said.
	   Under current policy, the Japanese military's involvement in
U.N. peacekeeping is limited to noncombat observer missions, such
as monitoring the implementation of truce agreements.

Doull grabs seven for NZ
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand paceman Simon Doull
destroyed India's batting with seven wickets Saturday as the hosts
reached a good position on the opening day of the second test.
	   Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin scored a classy unbeaten 103
to carry India to 208 all out after he won the toss. New Zealand
was 51 for one at stumps.
	   Doull claimed a career-best 7-65 to make a mockery of the much
vaunted Indian top order while Azharuddin tried to wrest the
initiative with his century on a difficult pitch offering plenty of
sideways movement.
	   New Zealand lost Matthew Bell for four in his first test, but
Matthew Horne and skipper Stephen Fleming took New Zealand to
stumps with 16 and 27 respectively.
	   After the first test in Dunedin had been abandoned without a
ball bowled, India's batting first was soon in trouble against the
seam and swing of Doull.
	   Doull, who had been doubtful for the test after withdrawing with
an injured calf muscle before the first test, grabbed the first
seven wickets to fall running into the wind from the pavilion end
at the Basin Reserve.
	   Exploiting the early dampness, Doull had India teetering on 16
for four in the first hour.
	   India enjoyed a brief reprieve during a forceful 82-run stand
for the fifth wicket between Sachin Tendulkar (47) and Azharuddin,
but Doull's spell after lunch further buried the visitors' hopes.
	   Doull followed up his 4-7 in 27 balls before lunch with 3-9 in
24 balls after the break as India stumbled to 149 for eight.
	   Doull then had 7-34 leaving Azharuddin unbeaten on 60 and the
tail to bat with.
	   Azharuddin playing in his 93rd test rose to the challenge and
put the three-pronged seam attack to sword, cutting and driving
furiously for most of his 14 boundaries.
	   It was a typical captain's innings by the 35-year old veteran.
After Anil Kumble had helped him add 33 runs for the seventh
wicket, Azharuddin found an unlikely partner in No.10 Venkatesh
Prasad and hammered 58 runs for the ninth wicket.
	   Prasad was equal to the task and defied the Black Caps for 62
minutes for a career-best 15.
	   Azharuddin, whose first two scoring shots were boundaries, raced
to his 21st century in 210 minutes. His second fifty came off just
60 balls as he made only his ninth century in 51 tests outside
India.
	   The only blemish in Azharuddin's 230-minute stay at the crease
was when he was dropped off an attempted hook by wicketkeeper Adam
Parore off part-time medium paceman Craig McMillan on 103.
	   The last four wickets helped the skipper add an invaluable 109
after Tendulkar's dismissal had India struggling on 99 for five.
	   Before lunch Azharuddin and Tendulkar treated a 9,000-plus
Boxing Day crowd to some exhilarating batting as they repaired the
early damage done by Doull.
	   After a slow start a quite start, Tendulkar made his presence
felt with a mind boggling 72-ball innings that produced 47 runs.
	   His innings was cut short by Doull in the third over after lunch
when the right hand flicked a catch to Bell at square leg.
	   Both teams went into the test with two spinners each. New
Zealand picked off-spinner Paul Wiseman and India included teenage
off-spinner Harbhajan Singh to partner leg-spinner Anil Kumble.

Favorites stage early duel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Race favorites Sayonara and Brindabella
staged an early duel at the start of Saturday's Sydney-to-Hobart
yacht race, although the American maxi suffered a setback after it
was first out of Sydney Heads.
	   Sayonara, the world maxi champion, led at the first marker but
lost her first spinnaker shortly after passing through the heads
out of Sydney Harbor.
	   However, its crew of top class international sailors had a
replacement up within seconds.
	   The setback allowed Brindabella, last year's line honors winner,
to draw level with Sayonara after the latter bolted clear following
a strong start.
	   There was excitement at the start when Nokia, the biggest boat
in the 115-strong fleet, collided with Bright Morning Star. The
83-foot maxi ketch did not appear to have the right of way.
	   Early placings followed the favored list with Australian maxi
Wild Thing third out of the heads.
	   Another maxi, Marchioness, was fourth, followed by the 60-footer
Sydney.
	   A huge but well-behaved spectator fleet containing thousands of
onlookers gathered to see the entrants embark upon their
630-nautical mile sail south and across to Hobart on the island
state of Tasmania.
	   Sayonara, the 1995 line honors winner, was rated a strong
favorite, with Brindabella, Wild Thing and Nokia the only other
boats attracting interest in the battle to reach Hobart first.
	   The leading maxis maintained a strong early pace courtesy of
favorable 10 to 15 knot northeasterly breezes.
	   While the front-runners were easily exceeding the 10- to 11-knot
pace needed to eclipse Morning Glory's 1996 race record, the fleet
was anticipating much tougher conditions later in the day.
	   Morning Glory, a German maxi, broke the 21-year-old race record
two years ago, arriving in Hobart two days, 14 hours, seven minutes
and 10 seconds after she left Sydney. (djp)

No. 16 Air Force 45, Washington 25

<TEXT>
	   HONOLULU (AP) _ Take that, Bowl Championship Series committee!
	   Air Force, snubbed by the BCS in the national championship
picture despite an 11-1 record, put an exclamation point on its
season Christmas Day by pounding Washington 45-25 in the inaugural
Oahu Bowl.
	   Earlier in the first-ever bowl doubleheader, Colorado outscored
Oregon 51-43 to win the Aloha Bowl.
	   In beating the Pacific-10 Huskies, the Falcons lived up to their
ground-conscious persona by ripping off 234 yards. And, for good
measure, Blane Morgan, Air Force's triple-option wizard, outplayed
heralded Washington quarterback Brock Huard. Morgan completed 12 of
16 passes for 267 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 50 yards.
	   Huard, a junior who has announced he will skip his senior season
to go into the NFL draft, also showcased his skills. He completed
23 of 32 passes for 267 yards. But that came up far short of making
up the difference and three interceptions didn't help.
	   Air Force, which won its final nine games after a one-point loss
to Texas Christian, scored on three of its first four possessions
and never looked back. Each time, Morgan guided the Falcons on long
drives _ 73, 83 and 74 yards _ with Jemal Singleton scoring twice,
on runs of 12 and 2 yards, and Scott McKay getting the third on a
15-yard run.
	   Braxton Cleman scored on runs of 3 and 1 yards for Washington to
make it 22-13 at the half, but the Falcons responded with 16
unanswered points in the third quarter to put the game away.
	   The scores came on a 42-yard field goal by Jackson Whiting, a
4-yard run by Spanky Gilliam and Morgan's 79-yard pass to Matt
Farmer.
	   Morgan closed out the Air Force scoring by hooking up with McKay
on a 30-yard pass in the fourth quarter. With the game out of hand,
Washington's Marques Tuiasosopo scampered 7 yards for one TD and
then passed 11 yards to Mikjo Austin with four seconds left.

Top Khmer Rouge leaders defect to government; Ta Mok still at

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two key leaders in the Khmer Rouge's
reign of terror in Cambodia the 1970s announced in a letter
released Saturday that they are willing to defect to the
government.
	   The apparent surrender of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea _ in what
looked like a deal to escape prosecution for crimes against
humanity _ leaves only one major Khmer Rouge figure at large, the
brutal general Ta Mok.
	   The two defectors, who have surfaced in the former rebel town of
Pailin in Cambodia's rugged northwest, sent letters to Prime
Minister Hun Sen announcing they had broken away from Ta Mok.
	   ``I have no other request except a request to be allowed to live
as a simple citizen,'' Khieu Samphan wrote in a copy of the letter
obtained by The Associated Press.
	   In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk read over national radio
Saturday, Hun Sen praised the move.
	   ``I would like to warmly welcome the two personalities and I
hope this decision made by the two personalities will become a
mobilization of strength for national reconstruction and peace,''
Hun Sen wrote.
	   Khieu Samphan was the the nominal Khmer Rouge leader, while Nuon
Chea was the rebel movement's political chief.
	   The two were considered among the main architects of the Khmer
Rouge's genocidal rule over Cambodia between 1975 and 1979. As many
as 2 million people died of starvation, disease and executions when
the Maoist guerrillas forced the population into massive
agricultural labor camps.
	   The Cambodian government and the United States have said in the
past that they wanted Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea and Ta Mok captured
and tried for genocide and crimes against humanity.
	   A team of legal experts appointed by the United Nations visited
Cambodia last month to assess evidence for a possible international
tribunal. Hun Sen's spokesman, Prak Sokhon, said at the time that
the government remained committed to bringing them to trial.
	   It was unclear whether the defection meant the Cambodian
government would not pursue charges against them, though Hun Sen's
language was notably conciliatory and mirrored that used in other
defections of equally bloodstained leaders.
	   Pailin, the town where the two defectors are, is under the
control of Ieng Sary, another top Khmer Rouge leader who negotiated
amnesty with the government in 1996 in exchange for leading
thousands of guerrillas out of combat.
	   Those defections marked the beginning of the end of a guerrilla
war that had festered since an invasion by Vietnam toppled the
Khmer Rouge regime in 1979.
	   The latest offer of defection comes just weeks after Khmer Rouge
chief of staff Khem Ngun and seven other generals surrendered and
returned to the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh for the first time in
19 years to meet government officials.
	   That surrender dealt what amounted to the final death blow to
the last hard-line faction.
	   Still at large is Ta Mok, the one-legged general known as ``The
Butcher'' for his revolutionary brutality. He seized command of
what remained of the hard-liners after deposing Pol Pot, the
long-time Khmer Rouge leader, in a bloody internal struggle in
1997.
	   Pol Pot, under house arrest by his former comrades, died of a
heart attack in April.
	   Ta Mok's violent reputation may make it difficult for the
government to avoid calls to have him tried _ either in Cambodia or
by an international court _ for crimes against humanity.
	   Nuon Chea is one of the most shadowy leaders of the group,
renowned for secrecy and paranoia. He was considered Pol Pot's No.
2 and a key political theorist.
	   Khieu Samphan was long the group's nominal leader, though real
power rested with Pol Pot and Ta Mok. Considered an intellectual,
he was the group's chief diplomat.
	   After Pol Pot's death, some observers believed Khieu Samphan was
being held against his will by Ta Mok, whom he feared.

 &UR; Military says 14 Tamil rebels killed in sea battle &QL;

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Sri Lankan Defense Ministry said
Saturday its navy killed 14 Tamil Tiger rebels and destroyed rebel
equipment during a sea battle.
	   Military spokesman Colonel Ranjith Witana said among the
deceased were nine senior members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, the rebel group fighting government forces for an
independent homeland for the minority Tamils.
	   The ministry's statement came after the clandestine Voice of
Tigers radio admitted losing 12 members Friday, including two top
ranking local guerrilla leaders, in the same incident. But it said
the fatalities occurred when their speeding motorboat capsized
after an accident.
	   The Voice of Tigers radio monitored in the northern city of
Vavuniya said two lieutenant colonels were among the dead. It gave
no other details and did not say when or exactly where the accident
took place. The military also did not specify where the attack took
place.
	   Witana quoting unidentified sources said a total of 14 rebels
were killed, including nine senior rebels. He said the attack
``destroyed a large logistic consignment'' of the rebels. He did
not clarify or elaborate.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland in north and
east of Sri Lanka, accusing the Sinhalese majority of oppressing
Tamils.
	   While not all Tamils embrace the rebels' extreme solution, many
feel they are denied opportunity by the Sinhalese, who dominate the
government and military. The government denies the charge and says
Tamils have equal rights.

Azhar defends his decision to bat first

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Skipper Mohammad Azharuddin
defended his decision to bat first after his century saved the day
for India in the second cricket test at Basin Reserve Saturday.
	   Swing bowler Simon Doull cut through the strong Indian batting
line up with a career-best 7-65 as India was dismissed for 208 on
the first day.
	   Azharuddin's 21st century rescued the side after Doull's initial
eight-over burst had reduced the innings to 16 for four in the
first hour.
	   ``The wicket did a bit in the first hour and a half,''
Azharuddin said. ``I give credit to Simon who bowled very well.
	   ``I think when you bowl like that there isn't much one could do.
No complaints. They all got out to good balls.''
	   Azharuddin said it was easier to bat after lunch but had plenty
of praise for Doull.
	   ``You can't take away the performance of Simon,'' Azharuddin
said. ``It was a tremendous effort. He bowled an outstanding line
and length.''
	   Azharuddin said he did the right thing by batting first after
India had opted for two spinners.
	   ``The spinners are our strength and we have to play
accordingly,'' he said.
	   Doull, a doubtful starter 48 hours before the test, said he had
an obligation to come out strongly after skipper Stephen Fleming
had lost the toss.
	   ``The onus was on the three seamers and it happened to be my
day,'' Doull said.
	   ``It was one of those days you felt good, had the rhythm and the
ball came out nicely out of the hand. The ball did lot more through
the air than off it, but I think there is plenty for the spinners
from day three onwards.''

Australia wins toss but rain washes out first day

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with no play possible on first day &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian paceman Matthew Nicholson
and England wicketkeeper Warren Hegg were kept waiting for their
test cricket debuts Saturday when the opening day of the fourth
test was washed out.
	   Australian captain Mark Taylor won the toss and sent England
into bat on a grassy wicket at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
	   But heavy, persistent rain prevented any play on the opening day
and the umpires abandoned the day at 1615 local time.
	   Taylor made utility bowler Colin Miller his 12th man while
England dropped batsman John Crawley and off-spinner Peter Such.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two key leaders in the Khmer Rouge's
reign of terror in Cambodia the 1970s defected to the government on
Saturday and declared they want to become ``ordinary citizens.''
	   The move by Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea _ in an apparent deal to
escape prosecution for crimes against humanity _ leaves only one
major Khmer Rouge figure at large, the brutal general Ta Mok.
	   The two defectors, who have surfaced in the former rebel town of
Pailin in Cambodia's rugged northwest, sent letters to Prime
Minister Hun Sen announcing they had broken away from Ta Mok.
	   ``I have no other request except a request to be allowed to live
as a simple citizen,'' Khieu Samphan wrote in a copy of his letter
obtained by The Associated Press. Nuon Chea also asked to return as
``an ordinary citizen.''
	   The letters indicated the pair had sealed their defection in
talks by telephone Friday night with Hun Sen. In a letter to King
Norodom Sihanouk read over national radio Saturday, Hun Sen praised
the move.
	   ``I would like to warmly welcome the two personalities and I
hope this decision made by the two personalities will become a
mobilization of strength for national reconstruction and peace,''
Hun Sen wrote.
	   Khieu Samphan was the the nominal Khmer Rouge leader, while Nuon
Chea was the rebel movement's political chief.
	   The two were considered among the main architects of the Khmer
Rouge's genocidal rule over Cambodia between 1975 and 1979. As many
as 2 million people died of starvation, disease and executions when
the Maoist guerrillas forced the population into massive
agricultural labor camps.
	   The Cambodian government and the United States have said in the
past that they wanted Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea and Ta Mok captured
and tried for genocide and crimes against humanity.
	   A team of legal experts appointed by the United Nations visited
Cambodia last month to assess evidence for a possible international
tribunal. Hun Sen's spokesman, Prak Sokhon, said at the time that
the government remained committed to bringing them to trial.
	   The U.S. Embassy did not immediately take calls from reporters
seeking comment. Local United Nations staff said the only official
with the authority to speak was out of the country.
	   It was unclear whether the defection meant the Cambodian
government would not pursue charges against them, though Hun Sen's
language was notably conciliatory and mirrored that used in other
defections of equally bloodstained leaders.
	   Under the policy, no Khmer Rouge senior leader has ever been
taken into custody and tried.
	   Pailin, the town where the two defectors are, is under the
control of Ieng Sary, another top Khmer Rouge leader who negotiated
amnesty with the government in 1996 in exchange for leading
thousands of guerrillas out of combat.
	   Those defections marked the beginning of the end of a guerrilla
war that had festered since an invasion by Vietnam toppled the
Khmer Rouge regime in 1979.
	   The latest offer of defection comes just weeks after Khmer Rouge
chief of staff Khem Ngun and seven other generals surrendered and
returned to the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh for the first time in
19 years to meet government officials.
	   That surrender dealt what amounted to the final death blow to
the last hard-line faction.
	   Still at large is Ta Mok, the one-legged general known as ``The
Butcher'' for his revolutionary brutality. He seized command of
what remained of the hard-liners after deposing Pol Pot, the
long-time Khmer Rouge leader, in a bloody internal struggle in
1997.
	   Pol Pot, under house arrest by his former comrades, died of a
heart attack in April.
	   Ta Mok's violent reputation may make it difficult for the
government to avoid calls to have him tried _ either in Cambodia or
by an international court _ for crimes against humanity.
	   Nuon Chea is one of the most shadowy leaders of the group,
renowned for secrecy and paranoia. He was considered Pol Pot's No.
2 and a key political theorist.
	   Khieu Samphan was long the group's nominal leader, though real
power rested with Pol Pot and Ta Mok. Considered an intellectual,
he was the group's chief diplomat.
	   After Pol Pot's death, some observers believed Khieu Samphan was
being held against his will by Ta Mok, whom he feared.

Proposal for national talks involving Suharto founders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A controversial proposal for a
dialogue on Indonesia's social and political problems that would
include former President Suharto is foundering.
	   The idea was launched by Muslim leader Abdurrahman Wahid, who
believes Suharto remains a powerful figure even though he was
ousted in May after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Last week, Wahid met Suharto and asked him to join a four-person
meeting on how to help Indonesia overcome political uncertainty,
social unrest and the worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   The other two participants were to be President B.J. Habibie,
Suharto's successor and onetime protege, and Gen. Wiranto, chief of
the politically powerful military.
	   However, The Jakarta Post on Saturday quoted Wahid as saying
Suharto was probably not interested in the proposal although he had
expressed enthusiasm for the idea.
	   ``I doubt that (Suharto) really wants to meet with Habibie. Let
us hope he was not talking nonsense,'' said Wahid, who is chairman
of Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's biggest Muslim group.
	   Habibie, who has tried to distance himself from Suharto, has
shown little interest in Wahid's proposal. He is implementing
political reforms and has scheduled parliamentary elections in
June, but student protesters say he is not sincere about democratic
change.
	   Critics have expressed concern about any dialogue involving
Suharto, who faces demands from student activists that he be put on
trial on charges of corruption and human rights abuses.
	   Opponents have also suggested Wahid, who is considered a
possible presidential candidate in elections next year, proposed
the idea in order to gain a higher national profile.
	   Wahid has said that Suharto remains a key figure because he
likely still commands the loyalty of many government bureaucrats as
well as high-ranking military officials.
	   In recent months, Indonesia has endured outbursts of religious
and ethnic violence as well as persistent student protests against
Habibie.

Report: Chinese authorities commend officers for crime boss case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Chinese authorities have commended police and
security agents for helping catch recently executed Hong Kong crime
boss Cheung ``Big Spender'' Tze-keung, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   Central and Guangdong provincial public security authorities
honored 11 units and 192 police in a ceremony attended by more than
1,200 people Friday, Chinese-language daily Ming Pao reported.
	   Cheung, 43, and four of his underlings were executed by gunfire
earlier this month in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou
immediately after a court rejected their appeals in a sensational
gang trial.
	   The court had sentenced them to death last month for kidnapping
two Hong Kong tycoons, smuggling dynamite and guns from China into
Hong Kong, robbing gold stores, and stealing 277 tons of steel.
	   The kidnappings, reportedly of Victor Li, son of property
magnate Li Ka-shing, and Walter Kwok, chairman of big developer Sun
Hung Kai Properties, allegedly netted 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 210 million), the largest modern-day ransom.
	   Friday's ceremony included officials from Beijing and several
neighboring cities, with two police officers receiving
commendations of ``Second-class Model Hero,'' the paper reported.
	   Officials also handed out monetary awards between 200-600 yuan
(U.S. dlrs 24-72).

	   GAMBOA, Panama (AP) _ Three abandoned single-story wooden houses
sit in the middle of the rainforest along the Chagres River, alone
but for the thousands of birds that screetch overhead.
	   It is here that a consortium is spending dlrs 25 million to
build a five-star hotel and resort, complete with 100 rooms, a
swimming pool, a convention center and a cable car to take tourists
on a half-mile (800-meter) journey above the canopy of virgin
rainforest.
	   And it is projects like this that the government hopes will more
than make up for the dlrs 300 million a year that the economy will
lose when the U.S. Army withdraws from the Panama Canal next year.
	   ``Panama has a tremendous advantage with all its forests. Here,
it's easy to build tourism,'' said Bernard Josephs, an English
businessman who is investing in a tourism project along the canal.
	   Panama is hoping that a major part of its new economy will be
ecotourism _ resorts that respect and profit from the untouched
nature that surrounds the 50-mile (80-kilometer) canal.
	   The Soberania Park nature reserve has more species of birds and
insects than the United States and Canada combined.
	   Near that park, one project is already up and running.
	   On a dock on Gatun Lake, which feeds the canal, a cruise ship
docks every Thursday. About 1,000 tourists _ mostly Americans _ get
off the ship to feast their eyes on the unspoiled rainforest.
	   Some take a helicopter ride over the rainforest. Some board a
smaller boat to sail the Chagres. Some swim in the lake. Some go to
the nearby canal locks to watch the ships raised and lowered. And
some visit nearby San Lorenzo Fort, a three-century-old castle.
	   ``I'm very impressed by the forest,'' said Lenor Chavez of
Albuquerque, New Mexico, eating a hamburger at the dock after a
trip to the fort and a swim in the lake. ``I'll never forget that I
swam in the canal. I'd like to come back to get to know the rest.''

Christmas comes to children despite copper strike _ thanks to

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with toys distributed to children. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANANEA, Mexico (AP) _ Despite a month-long strike that cut into
this copper-mining town's Christmas, there were boxes and boxes of
gifts for the children _ a present from an anonymous American.
	   Cabbage Patch dolls, soccer balls and footballs, Lego sets,
motorized cars and trucks _ union workers unloaded the gifts from a
fruit truck for a noon celebration Christmas Day.
	   A Tucson real estate man who identified himself only as Art but
said he once was a copper miner spent nearly dlrs 10,000 to provide
the 920 gifts. He explained he sympathized with the mining
families' plight and felt that as a Christian, helping the children
was the right thing to do.
	   The Barbie doll handed to Maria Jesus Verdugo was the only gift
she would get _ but it was enough.
	   ``She's beautiful,'' Maria murmured. ``I've been hoping for one
for a long time.''
	   With about 2,000 mine workers in their 36th day of a strike
protesting worker dismissals and other mine policies, Maria's
father could not even buy tamales and menudo for the family's
Christmas Eve dinner. They ate beans.
	   ``It's sad because they didn't stop the strike,'' said Maria.
``I was hoping they were going to end it before Christmas.''
	   Others echoed her comment.
	   ``I just want it to end so my dad is working again and can bring
money home,'' said Daniela Anahy Gonzalez, 10.
	   Patricia Ayala de Dorantes had sent her four children to bed
early Christmas Eve, not wanting to give them false hopes about
gifts.
	   ``You feel really ugly inside,'' she said. ``It's hard to know
what to say when they ask, `Mommy _ what about Santa Claus?' You
don't want to hurt them. You want to do everything possible to give
them the illusion of Santa Claus.''
	   Early Christmas Day, workers unloaded the truck, placing the
mounds of toys on a stage in a dusty old theater. Early that
afternoon, the toys were handed out as, one by one, children
scrambled up the stairs to the stage and held out their hands.
	   Martin Quintana was handed an American football. Clearly more
familiar with soccer balls, Martin seemed determined to get the
most out his new possession.
	   ``I have to learn how to use it,'' he said. ``I've got some
cousins on the other (U.S.) side who know and they can teach me.''
	   Martin's mother, Maria Luisa Quintana, said she had a message
for ``Senor Art.''
	   ``Tell him _ from all of us _ that we are very grateful for what
he did for our children,'' she said. ``God bless him.''

Founder of China's nuclear program dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Wang Ganchang, the scientist credited with
founding China's atomic bomb program, has died of an unspecified
illness in Beijing, state-run media reported Saturday. He was 90.
	   The state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that Wang died Dec. 10
and was cremated Friday at Beijing's Babaoshan cemetery, the final
resting place of many of China's revolutionary heroes.
	   A native of eastern Jiangsu province, Wang was graduated from
elite Tsinghua University in 1929 and earned a doctorate from
Berlin University in 1933. Returning to China the following year,
he helped establish China's nuclear research program.
	   Wang worked as a research scientist at the University of
California at Berkeley after World War II ended in 1945. He
returned to China just before the Communists took power in October,
1949.
	   Working at a government-run academy, Wang oversaw the design and
manufacture of China's first atomic bomb.
	   A front-page report in Saturday's People's Daily, the newspaper
of the Communist Party, lauded Wang as the ``founding father'' of
China's nuclear weapons program and noted that President Jiang
Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji, among many others, had sent
condolences upon hearing of his illness and death.
	   ``Wang Ganchang was an outstanding representative among our
nation's scientists. His passing is a great loss to atomic research
in our country and the world,'' it said.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Inmates overpowered guards and seized about
12 hostages at a prison packed with Christmas visitors, authorities
said.
	   Details of the disturbance at the Reclusorio Sur were not
immediately clear. News reports had said as many as 10 inmates were
involved, but Jaime Alvarez Ramos, the city's director of prisons,
said there were just four.
	   Alvarez told reporters the inmates started a riot on Friday to
give them an opportunity to escape. When that failed, they took
hostages.
	   One prisoner told the Televisa television network by telephone
that they had guns and grenades and would kill the hostages if the
police did not back away. An unidentified hostage told Televisa
they were being held in the infirmary and that one hostage was
injured.
	   Among the hostages were prison doctors and nurses, said Luis
Alberto Silva, a Red Cross official. It was not known if visitors
were among the hostages.
	   The government news agency Notimex, citing unofficial sources,
said two people had been killed, but Alvarez said there were no
deaths and only one person inside the prison had been injured.
Silva said eight people had been treated for minor injuries in the
distrubance.
	   Some 350 adults and children who had been visiting the prison
were evacuated after the hostages were taken, Notimex reported.
Most had swollen and teary eyes because of tear gas used by the
police, Notimex said.
	   More than 600 police surrounded the prison Friday evening,
Notimex said. But the standoff continued into the night.

Top Khmer Rouge leaders defect to government; Ta Mok still at large
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with Hun Sen brushing aside
questions of trial, Thai army saying Ta Mok down to 100 men, other
details.
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two top Khmer Rouge leaders
considered architects of the group's genocidal reign of terror in
the 1970s defected to the government today. Khieu Samphan and Nuon
Chea said they wished to become ``ordinary citizens.''
	   Prime Minister Hun Sen said he personally negotiated what
amounts to the pair's surrender, and brushed aside questions of
whether they would be brought to trial for crimes against humanity.
	   ``We should not talk about any court,'' Hun Sen said. ``This is
a time when we should talk about reconciliation.''
	   Hun Sen's language indicated that a deal had been struck letting
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea make peace with the government in
exchange for avoiding trial, despite pressure from the United
States and other countries to bring them to justice.
	   The deal involving Khieu Samphan, the nominal Khmer Rouge
leader, and Nuon Chea, the rebel movement's political chief,
appeared to finish off one of history's most brutal revolutionary
groups. It leaves at large only one major Khmer Rouge figure, the
one-legged general Ta Mok, and less than 100 loyalists.
	   Hun Sen, in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk read over national
radio, said he ``would like to warmly welcome the two
personalities, and I hope this decision ... will become a
mobilization of strength for national reconstruction and peace.''
	   The two leaders were key figures in the Khmer Rouge's brutal
1975-79 rule, under which as many as 2 million people were killed.
	   The Khmer Rouge have waged a guerrilla war since their regime
was toppled by invading Vietnamese troops in 1979.
	   The Cambodian government and the United States have said they
wanted the two captured and tried for genocide and crimes against
humanity. It was unclear whether the defections meant the Cambodian
government would not pursue charges against them.
	   An aide to Hun Sen, Om Yentieng, said the prime minister
supports a tribunal for ex-leaders involved in genocide but that
justice should be left to local courts _ which are woefully
unequipped for such a task.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, who were in the former rebel town
of Pailin in northwestern Cambodia, sent letters to Hun Sen
announcing they had broken from Ta Mok.
	   ``I have no other request except a request to be allowed to live
as a simple citizen,'' Khieu Samphan wrote in a copy of the letter
obtained by The Associated Press.
	   Nuon Chea wrote: ``I am honored to submit my request to the
Royal Government to return to society as an ordinary citizen to
take part in the consolidation of peace and stability.''
	   The U.S. Embassy did not immediately take calls from reporters
seeking comment.
	   The defections come just weeks after Khmer Rouge chief of staff
Khem Ngun and seven other generals surrendered and returned to the
Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, for the first time in 19 years. That
surrender dealt a death blow to the guerrilla group.
	   Khem Ngun told The Associated Press that Khieu Samphan and Nuon
Chea had not attached any conditions to the surrender.
	   Khieu Samphan was the best-known Khmer Rouge intellectual, and
his polished manners led to his becoming the group's public face.
He was the official leader of the group for years, although real
power remained with Ta Mok and the infamous Pol Pot, who died of a
heart attack in April months after he was purged.
	   Nuon Chea was known as Brother Number Two, after Pol Pot. In May
1975, a month after the Khmer Rouge seized power, Nuon Chea laid
out the group's policy hallmarks _ destroying every vestige of a
market economy and killing suspected traitors.
	   In Thailand, which closely monitors Khmer Rouge activities, Maj.
Gen. Wiwat Sattarak, chief of the border task force, said that Ta
Mok has no more than 100 loyalist troops left.
	   ``The Cambodian government's attitude is to let him grow old and
die by himself,'' Wiwat said. ``It's not worth the money to chase
him.''

East Timor's spiritual leader unwilling to meet Indonesian
</HEADLINE>
president

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ East Timor's spiritual leader has
rejected an offer to meet President B.J. Habibie, citing
differences over Indonesian government policy in the former
Portuguese colony.
	   Earlier this week, Habibie said he wanted to meet Roman Catholic
Bishop Carlos Belo to discuss efforts to make peace in the troubled
territory, which was invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
	   However, Belo said the government has failed to respond to a
list of conditions that he submitted to Habibie during a meeting in
June, one month after the ouster of authoritarian President
Suharto.
	   ``If they're not carried out, I will not come to Jakarta,'' Belo
said Friday after celebrating Christmas at his home in Dili, the
capital of East Timor.
	   Belo, co-winner of the 1996 Nobel peace prize, did not specify
his conditions. But he has appealed for a reduction in the number
of Indonesian soldiers in East Timor as well as greater freedom of
movement for its inhabitants.
	   Belo also said it was not his role to brief Habibie on
developments in East Timor, which has endured fighting between the
military and separatist guerrillas for two decades.
	   ``I am not in a position to report about East Timor since it is
the job of the governor,'' Belo told reporters.
	   Indonesia has taken a more conciliatory stand on East Timor, and
talks on how to end the conflict in the half-island territory of
800,000 people have gained ground in recent months.
	   Indonesia has offered East Timor autonomy in exchange for
international recognition of its sovereignty. Independence
activists, however, say any autonomy deal must be transitional and
that a vote on self-determination must eventually take place.

China commemorates 105th anniversary of Mao's birth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China marked the 105th anniversary of the birth
of the late revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung on Saturday with the
release of books, computer disks and other memorabilia.
	   Although many of Mao's radical communist policies have been
discredited since his death in 1976, the ruling Communist Party has
sought to use his legacy to reinforce its own legitimacy.
	   Wei Jianxing, a member of the Standing Committee of the party's
powerful Politburo, presided over the launching of a CD ROM
introducing Mao's theories illustrated by more than 3,000 pictures
from official archives, the newspaper China Daily and other
state-run media reported.
	   A six-volume reference work on Mao's life also was recently
published, the reports said.

Cyclone Cora batters Pacific islands

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with cyclone moving away from Tonga &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A fishing boat with six people on
board was missing Saturday after Cyclone Cora battered the Pacific
island nation of Tonga, Tongan police said.
	   The 7-meter (yard) boat was missing in high seas off the central
Ha'apai group of islands.
	   The cyclone, which had moved away from Tonga's main island
Tongatapu by 6 p.m. local time (0400 GMT), was reported to have
damaged crops and buildings and cut communications lines throughout
the island group.
	   The cyclone battered the main island of Tongatapu and the
Ha'apai chain with wind gusts of up to 100 mph (160 kph), a police
spokesman said.
	   ``We've had extensive damage ... to crops, especially
breadfruit, bananas and food crops, both in the northern islands
and now the central island of Tongatapu,'' the unidentified
spokesman told New Zealand's National Radio.
	   He said people had moved away from low-lying regions to avoid
the storm.
	   New Zealand Meteorological Service spokesman Chris Webster said
the worst of the storm appeared to be over.
	   He said the cyclone was now to east of Tongatapu and moving in a
southeasterly direction toward open sea.
	   The only remaining danger was to shipping in the area, he said.

Taiwan blames Cambodia for rejecting offer to resolve waste dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan criticized Cambodia on Saturday for
seeking China's approval before asking Taiwan to take back over
3,000 tons of mercury-tainted waste dumped by a Taiwanese firm, the
state-run news agency reported.
	   Five deaths have been blamed on the waste, sent to Cambodia last
month by Taiwan's giant Formosa Plastics Corp. It also led to the
panic-stricken exodus of residents from the Sihanoukville seaport
area where it was found two weeks ago.
	   Taiwan's Central News Agency quoted Foreign Ministry official Yu
Sheng-teh as saying Cambodia should not have unilaterally announced
an initial test result of the toxic content of the waste without
consulting Taiwan.
	   While rejecting a Taiwanese offer to send an official team to
investigate on the waste, Cambodian authorities sought help from
China to resolve the dispute, Yu said.
	   ``The inappropriate act has caused damage to our international
image,'' Yu was quoted as saying. ``It has also hurt our national
prestige.''
	   Yu did not elaborate. But Taiwanese newspapers reported earlier
that Cambodia consulted China on handling the waste and China
approved its request to return it to Taiwan.
	   Cambodia recognizes Beijing, which claims sovereignty over
Taiwan.
	   Taiwanese environmentalists have criticized the Taiwan
government for failing to seek a quick solution to the dispute and
to clean up Taiwan's image as an exporter of toxic waste.
	   Meanwhile, Taiwan's Environmental Protection Bureau asked
Formosa Plastics Corp. to send a delegation to Cambodia this week
to collect waste samples and conduct its own tests. It also asked
the company to take back the waste regardless of the test results.
	   Lee Chih-chun, the company's general manager, said it is willing
to abide by the government decision but he questioned the test
result announced by Cambodia that shows the waste has a mercury
content of 675 parts per million.
	   He said the waste, with a mercury content as low as 0.096 parts
per million, is not hazardous to human beings.
	   The waste, believed to be compressed industrial ash, was quietly
dumped near Sihanoukville last month.
	   A dock worker died a few days after cleaning the hold of the
ship that transported the waste, sparking riots in Sihanoukville.
	   Thousands have fled in fear of the waste and violent protests.
Police said four people were killed in traffic accidents on the
road to the capital.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONOLULU (AP) _ After three failed attempts this year to float
around the world in a balloon, American millionaire Steve Fossett
sounded a little discouraged.
	   ``I think it's time to go sailing,'' Fossett said Friday after
he and two other adventurers abandoned their effort to make the
first nonstop around-the-world balloon flight.
	   British mogul Richard Branson, however, said he was undeterred.
	   ``We've finally cracked everything in the technology,'' he said.
``We'll buck up ourselves and start again.''
	   Fossett, Branson, and Per Lindstrand of Sweden, who have made a
total of 11 attempts at a nonstop flight around globe, were in good
condition when U.S. Coast Guard helicopters lifted them out of the
Pacific Ocean about 10 miles (16 kilometers) off Kahuku Point at
the northeast tip of Oahu.
	   ``We're glad to be alive,'' Branson said. ``We thought we were
going to make it all the way, but we hit a brick wall of bad
weather.''
	   They were seven days into their journey _ about the halfway
point _ when they ditched. The 272-foot-high (83-meter),
combination helium and hot-air balloon bounced for miles
(kilometers) in 3- to 4-foot (1- to 1.3-meter) seas because bolts
that were supposed to cut the balloon loose from the crew capsule
had been frozen by the cold and didn't work, Fossett said.
	   Fossett, who was forced to ditch in the Pacific during an
attempt to circle the globe earlier this year, described the
landing as ``pretty smooth,'' despite the bouncing.
	   His colleague Lindstrand begged to differ: ``This was the worst.
It was horrendous.''
	   The men lost the high-altitude 200 mph (320 kph) winds they
needed to carry them across the Pacific to North America. They got
caught in a low-pressure system and feared they would be stuck in
the trough for a week.
	   ``In the middle of the night we decided it was a hopeless
situation,'' Fossett said. ``If we had kept going, it would have
left us too far away from land for an easy pickup.''
	   They maneuvered the craft up and down between 6,000 feet (1,800
meters) and 27,000 feet (8,100 meters) to try to find a fast
easterly wind, but the best they could find was a 16 mph (26 kph)
breeze.
	   The system ``caught us very much by surprise. We thought we had
a solid route across the Pacific,'' Fossett said.
	   Balloon pilots aren't able to steer or control speed with much
precision. They navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to
ascend or descend into different wind currents.
	   Had the balloonists made the U.S. West Coast, they would have
broken the 15,200-mile (24,320-kilometer) balloon distance record
that Fossett set on a solo attempt to circumnavigate the globe in
August.
	   This voyage began Dec. 18, in Marrakech, Morocco, and covered
12,500 miles (20,000 kilometers). The goal was to eventually reach
Western Europe, after flying over southern Canada or Washington
state sometime Friday.
	   The craft was not immediately recovered, but Fossett said plans
were under way to salvage the capsule and its equipment.
	   During the journey, the team secured permission from 97
countries to cross their airspace. Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea refused permission. The crew also had some tense moments when
they passed over China farther north than the balloon had been
authorized to fly.
	   A joint Australian-U.S. team plans to launch another attempt
next week. American real estate magnate Dave Liniger and his Remax
team are making final preparations in the Australian town of Alice
Springs to launch their giant balloon on or soon after Dec. 29.

	   Hun Sen, in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk read over national
radio, said he ``would like to warmly welcome the two
personalities, and I hope this decision ... will become a
mobilization of strength for national reconstruction and peace.''
	   The two leaders were key figures in the Khmer Rouge's brutal
1975-79 rule, under which as many as 2 million people were killed.
	   The Khmer Rouge have waged a guerrilla war since their regime
was toppled by invading Vietnamese troops in 1979.
	   The Cambodian government and the United States have said they
wanted the two captured and tried for genocide and crimes against
humanity. It was unclear whether the defections meant the Cambodian
government would not pursue charges against them.
	   An aide to Hun Sen, Om Yentieng, said the prime minister
supports a tribunal for ex-leaders involved in genocide but that
justice should be left to local courts _ which are woefully
unequipped for such a task.
	   But an analyst said Hun Sen risks losing support from Cambodians
if he prevents a trial for at least one of the defectors.
	   ``With Nuon Chea, it is very clear he was involved in dealing
with security, prisoners and torture,'' said Youk Chhang, director
of a Cambodian research center devoted to gathering evidence
against the Khmer Rouge.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, who were in the former rebel town
of Pailin in northwestern Cambodia, sent letters to Hun Sen
announcing they had broken from Ta Mok.
	   ``I have no other request except a request to be allowed to live
as a simple citizen,'' Khieu Samphan wrote in a copy of the letter
obtained by The Associated Press.
	   Nuon Chea wrote: ``I am honored to submit my request to the
Royal Government to return to society as an ordinary citizen to
take part in the consolidation of peace and stability.''
	   The U.S. Embassy did not immediately take calls from reporters
seeking comment.
	   The defections come just weeks after Khmer Rouge chief of staff
Khem Ngun and seven other generals surrendered and returned to the
Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, for the first time in 19 years. That
surrender dealt a death blow to the guerrilla group.
	   Khem Ngun told The Associated Press that Khieu Samphan and Nuon
Chea had not attached any conditions to the surrender.
	   Khieu Samphan was the best-known Khmer Rouge intellectual, and
his polished manners led to his becoming the group's public face.
He was the official leader of the group for years, although real
power remained with Ta Mok and the infamous Pol Pot, who died of a
heart attack in April months after he was purged.
	   Nuon Chea was known as Brother Number Two, after Pol Pot. In May
1975, a month after the Khmer Rouge seized power, Nuon Chea laid
out the group's policy hallmarks _ destroying every vestige of a
market economy and killing suspected traitors.
	   In Thailand, which closely monitors Khmer Rouge activities, Maj.
Gen. Wiwat Sattarak, chief of the border task force, said that Ta
Mok has no more than 100 loyalist troops left.
	   ``The Cambodian government's attitude is to let him grow old and
die by himself,'' Wiwat said. ``It's not worth the money to chase
him.''

Primakov hails budget passage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Saturday
praised Russian lawmakers' speedy initial approval of the draft
1999 budget, calling the vote ``a victory for common sense.''
	   Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, showed
widespread support for Primakov's government by voting in favor of
the 1999 budget's first draft on Thursday.
	   Primakov had said the government needed a budget as soon as
possible to turn around Russia's economic slide and begin paying
billions of rubles (dollars) in unpaid salaries.
	   The budget passage is ``a victory for common sense, a victory
for compromise,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``We are finding a common language, a common approach. And we
will further work intensively with the lawmakers,'' he said.
	   Still, some lawmakers have serious problems with the draft.
Primakov met with regional governors Saturday, who say the budget
unfairly distributes tax revenue between the regions and the
federal government.
	   The regional governors make up Russia's upper house of
parliament, the Federation Council, which must also approve the
budget. In the past, the Duma, not the governors, have put up the
strongest fight over the budget.
	   Primakov sounded optimistic about avoiding a standoff with the
governors, and said the budget now calls for the federal government
to split revenues down the middle.
	   ``We have approached a balance on interests and an optimal
distribution of revenues between the federal center and regions,''
Primakov said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Russia's economy plunged in August when the government stopped
propping up the ruble and defaulted on some of its domestic debt.
State employers haven't paid many wages on time for years, and the
latest crisis only worsened the problem.
	   When he was selected as Prime Minister in September, Primakov
made paying back wages one of his top priorities. But he has been
unable to overcome the country's mounting salary debts, which total
roughly 80 billion rubles (dlrs 4.1 billion).
	   ``This is the question of questions, and attention to it must on
be lessened,'' he said of the wage crisis on Saturday.

Museum shows Christian images as an arm of politics in old Indian
</HEADLINE>
art &QL; 
 &UR; By CARL HARTMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ India's vast subcontinent, now torn by
struggles between Hindus and Muslims, once had a ruler who used
Christian ideas and Christian art to strengthen his rule over his
hostile subjects.
	   Christian art and its influence in India lasted much longer than
the ruler's policies.
	   The rarely-told story goes back more than 400 years. It's on
view in an unusual show at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, part of
the Smithsonian Institution, called ``The Jesuits and the Grand
Mogul.''
	   The key to the Christian influence traces back to a politically
important relationship with Portugal.
	   Mongolian heirs of Genghis Khan had swept down from Afghanistan
and conquered much of what is now India and Pakistan. Europeans of
the time called them moguls _ another form of ``mongol'' _ and
``Grand Mogul'' became the term for a wealthy, dictatorial ruler.
	   Probably the grandest of the moguls was Jalal ud-Din Mohammed,
known as Akbar, who ruled in the time of the first Queen Elizabeth.
The English had less to do with India at the time than the
Portuguese, who ran an important colony on the Indian coast at Goa.
	   Through Goa, Jesuit missionaries from Rome were royally welcomed
to Akbar's court, bringing western artists with them.
	   When European travelers like the Englishman Sir Thomas Roe came
into the palaces of the Mogul emperors, they were astonished to
find the walls covered by Italian Renaissance-style murals with
Christ, the Madonna and Christian saints, said Gauvin Bailey,
curator of the exhibit.
	   Bailey estimated that a third of Akbar's painters _ he had about
100 _ did Christian scenes, though many of them remained Hindus.
	   A more sedate painting now at the Chester Beatty Library in
Dublin puts the theologians on their knees before the enthroned,
mustachioed emperor, who is attended by a servant with a fly-whisk.
	   As a Muslim conqueror ruling tens of millions of Hindus, Akbar
had political problems. He tried setting up a religion of his own,
combining several faiths. Some Muslims said he had abandoned Islam;
some Christians thought he was about to be converted. Both proved
wrong.
	   One good reason Akbar kept on good terms with the Portuguese was
that he needed their warships to protect Muslim pilgrims on their
way to Mecca, a rite that is required of every able-bodied Muslim
who can afford it. Akbar had no navy of his own.
	   Milo C. Beach, head of the gallery and an authority on the
period, called Akbar's policy highly successful, at least in the
short run.
	   ``He brought everybody in,'' Beach said. ``The Christians
weren't an important political element domestically, but it was
important for trade to know how the Portuguese worked.''
	   Akbar's son Jahangir carried on the policy. But Christian saints
gradually disappeared from court painting under Akbar's grandson
Shah Jahan, a more traditional Muslim, though they lingered on in
folk art.
	   At Agra, Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal, sometimes called the
world's most beautiful building. Bailey said that although claims
that an Italian architect created the Taj are untrue, the structure
still shows western influence: an Italian technique for encrusting
jewels in stone, flower designs carved from Dutch models.
	   The western influences stayed until British conquerors dethroned
the last Mogul 150 years ago. The Portuguese held on to Goa until
1961.
	   Madonnas, saints and cherubs are prominent in the paintings at
the Sackler show. It will be on view through April 4, 1999.

Official: 10,000 Somalis move to Ethiopia to escape drought
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ An estimated 10,000 Somalis have
crossed into Ethiopia to escape severe drought that has hit
southern Somalia, a regional official has said.
	   Abubakar Abdi, head of the Region 5 Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Office in southeastern Ethiopia, told state-run media
Friday the Somalis were fleeing to the Warder and Afder zones of
the Ethiopian region formerly known as the Ogaden, which itself has
been hit by a serious drought.
	   ``The zones where the Somali refugees are now camped has been
hit by a serius food shortage cause by a severe frought, making the
problem even more critical,'' Abubaker was quoted as saying.
	   Another unnamed official of the Federal Refugees and Returnees
Affairs Administration emphasized that the Somalis were arriving in
Ethiopia to escape effects of the drought and not clan-based
fighting that has flared up again in parts of southern Somalia.
	   It was the first reported mass exodus of Somalis into Ethiopia
since hundreds of thousands sought refuge from civil war and famine
in 1993-94.
	   Most of the inhabitants of Ethiopia's Region 5 are ethnic
Somalis.

Bloodshed continues in South Africa's KwaZuluX-Natal province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Assailants shot to death two boys
and a young man in a region in eastern South Africa that has been
plagued by violence, police said Saturday.
	   One 21-year-old man survived the Christmas Day attack that
killed another 21-year-old and two 13-year-old boys, said police
spokesman Bala Naidoo.
	   No suspects have been caught and police did not know the motive
behind the attack, which occurred at 8:15 p.m. Friday in a house in
Umlazi, 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of the coastal city of
Durban.
	   Police were discounting any link with an attack on a Christmas
Eve party that killed eight people in the town of Margate. Those
killings happened after the gunmen apaprently tried to crash the
party but were refused entry.
	   ``It's totally unrelated to the Christmas Eve killings, which
happened 250 kilometers (155 miles) away,'' Naidoo said.
	   Both attacks happened in KwaZulu-Natal province, which in revent
years has been hit by violence, much of it politically inspired.
	   Fighting between followers of the Zulu-Nationalist Inkatha
Freedom Party and of the African National Congress in the years
before all-race elections in 1994 killed more than 10,000 people.

Officer of Israeli-allied militia found shot dead

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon AP) - A security officer of the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia was found dead of gunshot
wounds Saturday in the village of Chebaa, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   The body of Ghassan Daher was found in the early morning shortly
after a shootout in the village in the western Bekaa valley, said
the officials, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.
	   It could not be determined whether Daher's killing resulted from
a personal vendetta or a political assassination, the officials
said.
	   Chebaa is on the slopes of Mount Hermon in the Israeli-occupied
zone in south Lebanon, which is patrolled by some 1,500 Israeli
troops and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen. It is a center for
smuggling contraband goods between Lebanon, Israel and Syria.
	   Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed guerrilla group whose fighters are
active in the region, often target collaborators with Israel. A
Hezbollah official in Beirut said the group had no comment on
Daher's killing.

Yemenis can avoid military service by paying dlrs 20 fee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemenis can now avoid the country's
compulsory two-year military service by paying a fee equal to dlrs
20.
	   Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh on Friday approved a bill
allowing men who do not wish to be drafted to pay 15 percent of a
conscript's monthly salary of 700 riyals (dlrs 5.6) for the two
years, the official Al-Thawra newspaper reported Saturday.
	   That amounts to a total of 2,520 riyals, or dlrs 20.
	   Economic analysts said the reason for the new law was to reduce
government expenses in line with economic reforms required by the
International Monetary Fund.
	   The government provides housing and clothing and pays a
transportation allowance as well as a monthly stipend to its
conscripts. No figures were available on the total amount of money
spent on conscripts.
	   Military service is compulsory in Yemen for men over 18.
	   Yemen has a foreign debt of some dlrs 10 billion. Most of its 17
million people live in poverty.

Moi signs constitutional review bill, setting reform in motion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ In a move that sets the long-awaited
constitutional reform process in motion, President Daniel arap Moi
has signed a bill that opens the way for the naming of a 25-member
review commission, news reports said Saturday.
	   On Christmas Eve, Moi signed the Constitution of Kenya Review
Commission Act which was passed by parliament Dec. 8, according to
a statement issued by Attorney-General Amos Wako.
	   Following his re-election last December to a final five-year
term, the 74-year-old Moi reluctantly agreed to a review and major
overhaul of the original 1963 constitution that began with a series
of meetings early this year among political parties and members of
civil society.
	   The talks nearly collapsed over the issue of who should sit on
the review commission.
	   Under the bill, which becomes law as soon as it is published
next week in the Kenya Gazette, political parties will name 13
members, the Women's Political Caucus will name five, the rest of
civil society will name four, including at least one disabled
person, and the Roman Catholic, Protestant and Muslims communities
will each name one.
	   At least eight of the 25 seats must be filled by women.
	   Kenya's two major independent national newspapers hailed the
approval of the bill but expressed concern about the actual process
of writing a new constitution.
	   ``It will be imprudent if, in applauding the success of forcing
the formerly recalcitrant government to cut a deal on the review,
Kenyans lose sight of the fact that the ultimate prize really is
the construction of a constitution which addresses the fears and
concerns that brought about the crisis of governance the country is
laboring under, and guarantee that the laws will not be abused in
future by the ruling elite and violated to serve narrow
interests,'' the Daily Nation wrote Saturday.
	   The review will be carried out nationwide through a three-tiered
system by the commission, the National Consultative Forum and the
District Consultative Forum.
	   If all goes according to schedule, the new constitution should
be approved by 2001 in time for the next general elections a year
later.
	   ``It is expected that immediately the exercise kicks off, the
commissioners will have their hands full,'' wrote the East African
Standard.
	   ``We hope that there will be no attempt from any quarter to
sneak in amendments that will only serve to marginalize sections of
the citizenry who already have doubts about the prospects of
fairness and justness under the process.''
	   Kenya is also scheduled to conduct a census next Aug. 24-25. The
last census in 1989 was widely criticized for inadequately
representing the real strength of the 40-odd tribal or ethnic
groups that make up the country's estimated population of 29
million.
	   The present constitution has been amended several times, the
last time in 1991 to permit the return of a multi-party political
system.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa kept the West Indies on
the back foot with three wickets in the second hour of play to have
the visitors at 69 for three at lunch on the first day of the third
test at Kingsmead Saturday.
	   With the West Indies using their ninth opening pair in 23 test
matches in Philo Wallace and retreaded wicketkeeper Junior Murray,
South African captain Hansie Cronje won the toss and sent the
tourists in to bat on a well-grassed pitch.
	   The West Indies are in a must-win situation, being two down in
the five-match series, and have made five changes to the team which
was beaten inside three days in the last match in Port Elizabeth.
In addition to Murray and Wallace, who returns after illness,
19-year-old Darren Ganga makes his debut, leg spinner Rawl Lewis
returns, and Franklyn Rose is included in place of Nixon McLean.
	   After putting on 50, the opening pair fell in quick succession,
Wallace falling to a poor shot to Jacques Kallis for 21, and Murray
being trapped in front by David Terbrugge just two runs later for
29. It seemed as if all the good work was to be undone when the
form man, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, succumbed to the wiles of Kallis
and an uncharacteristically injudicious shot for four.
	   At lunch, captain Brian Lara was not out on 10, and Carl Hooper
on two. There were glimmerings of some Lara form early on, after he
survived a snorter of an opening delivery from Terbrugge which
could have had him trapped in front had it not been called a
no-ball. He flicked Allan Donald off his hip for a lovely legside
boundary, and then stroked him through the covers gloriously just
before lunch.

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Assailants shot to death two boys
and a young man in a region in eastern South Africa that has been
plagued by violence, police said Saturday.
	   One 21-year-old man survived the Christmas Day attack that
killed another 21-year-old and two 13-year-old boys, said police
spokesman Bala Naidoo.
	   No suspects have been caught and police did not know the motive
behind the attack, which occurred at 8:15 p.m. Friday in a house in
Umlazi, 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of the coastal city of
Durban.
	   Police were discounting any link with an attack on a Christmas
Eve party that killed eight people in the town of Margate. Those
killings happened after the gunmen apaprently tried to crash the
party but were refused entry.
	   ``It's totally unrelated to the Christmas Eve killings, which
happened 250 kilometers (155 miles) away,'' Naidoo said.
	   Both attacks happened in KwaZulu-Natal province, which in revent
years has been hit by violence, much of it politically inspired.
	   Fighting between followers of the Zulu-Nationalist Inkatha
Freedom Party and of the African National Congress in the years
before all-race elections in 1994 killed more than 10,000 people.

Taiwanese gangs kidnap prize racing pigeons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Police said Saturday they arrested a
leading member of a gang that kidnapped prize racing pigeons and
collected ransoms totaling more than 50 million Taiwan dollars
(U.S. dlrs 1.5 million) from the owners.
	   Shen Pao-tien was arrested Saturday in Ilan, eastern Taiwan, but
six other members of his gang were still at large, police said.
	   The gang had kidnapped about 2,000 pigeons over the past two
years, said police, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The birds were captured with nets during Taiwan's popular pigeon
races and their owners identified through the numbered rings the
birds wear around their ankles, police said.
	   Ransom demands topped 1 million Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 3,000)
for some of the birds, they said.
	   Some owners were reluctant to contact police because the
kidnappers have been known to cut off the foot of a bird and mail
it to the owner.
	   The United Evening News said some gangsters bribed race
employees to tip them off about the times and routes of the races.
In many races, less than half of the racing pigeons safely reached
the final destination.
	   Despite cheating and kidnapping, the races remain popular with
gamblers because prizes can reach 100 million Taiwan dollars (U.S.
dlrs 300,000), the report said.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A train rammed into a bus that was
crossing railroad tracks in eastern India Saturday, killing 12
people and injuring six others, domestic news agencies reported.
	   Railway officials said impatient bus passengers, who had been
waiting for an ``all clear'' signal at the crossing, snatched the
keys from the guard and forcibly opened the gate to pass through,
the Press Trust of India reported.
	   While the bus was crossing the tracks, a freight train came at
full speed and crashed into the bus. All the victims were coal
miners who were on their way to work in the bus.
	   The accident occurred near Dhanbad in eastern Bihar state, about
1,100 kilometers (660 miles) southeast of New Delhi.
	   The train's speed was not immediately available.

Pakistan to record Australian cricketers' statements
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistani judicial inquiry is sending
two people to Australia this week to record the statements of
disgraced Australian cricketers Mark Waugh and Shane Warne, cricket
authorities said Saturday.
	   The Pakistani inquiry is investigating allegations made by
Waugh, Warne and teammate Tim May that top Pakistani cricketers
were involved in match fixing.
	   However the inquiry says the testimony given by Waugh is suspect
following admissions by both Waugh and Warne that they took money
from an Indian bookmaker in exchange for information about pitch
and weather during a 1994 series.
	   The information affects the odds bookmakers give to people
betting on the game.
	   Pakistani cricket officials say Waugh made a false statement
when he appeared before the Pakistani judicial inquiry in October.
The inquiry is probing allegations that Pakistani cricketers Salim
Malik and Wasim Akram were involved in match fixing. The Pakistani
cricketers have denied the allegations.

Russian hostage freed in exchange for Chechen prisoner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian policeman held hostage in Chechnya was
released Saturday in exchange for a Chechen prisoner being held in
Russia, a news report said.
	   Sergei Khalansky, a 41-year-old police inspector in the southern
Russian town of Grazhdanskoye, was kidnapped June 9 and taken to
the breakaway Chechnya region, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Khalansky's abductors demanded a large ransom, but in a deal
worked out by Alexander Lebed, Khalansky was exchanged for a
Chechen prisoner being held in Russia. No details were given about
the Chechen prisoner.
	   Lebed, a retired general who negotiated the end to Chechnya's
1994-96 independence war with Russia, has helped in the release of
Russian hostages. He is considered a top contender for Russia's
2000 presidential elections.
	   Hostage-taking for ransom has become a booming business in
Chechnya, a small Caucasus region awash in violence and crime since
the end of the war. More than a hundred Russian and foreign
hostages are believed to still be held there.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Leading maxi yachts Brindabella,
Sayonara and Marchioness were locked in a three-way duel down the
New South Wales state coast Saturday as the Sydney to Hobart fleet
faced deteriorating weather.
	   All three maxis reported in at the same latitude during Saturday
night's positioning report when they were about 30 nautical miles
south of Jervis Bay on the New South Wales south coast.
	   American maxi Sayonara and Sydney boat Brindabella reported they
were about 50 kilometers (30 miles) offshore while Marchioness was
a couple of miles further inshore. In fourth spot was Australian
maxi Wild Thing.
	   The three leaders covered 105 nautical miles in the first 7 1-2
hours of the race.
	   Propelled for the most part by favorable northerly breezes, the
leaders rocketed along at an average speed of 14 knots in the first
part of the 630-nautical-mile race to Hobart on the island state of
Tasmania.
	   The fast early pace put the leaders well on schedule to eclipse
Morning Glory's 1996 race record but that was before the far
tougher conditions forecast for overnight Saturday night.
	   Morning Glory, a German maxi, broke the 21-year-old race record
two years ago, arriving in Hobart 2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes
and 10 seconds after she left Sydney.
	   While the annual event started in friendly and favorable
northeasterly breezes, the 115-strong fleet reported cloudier
conditions as it moved down the coast.
	   The yachts were bracing for a tough night with thunderstorms
predicted ahead of a west-southwesterly change expected to lash the
south coast by Sunday morning.
	   Earlier, a crowd of around 300,000 people on the Sydney
headlands and water witnessed the start of the annual blue water
classic.
	   Sayonara took the initial honors when she beat Brindabella
though Sydney heads, but the 1997 line honors winner drew level
when the American maxi's spinnaker blew out and had to be replaced.

	   ANGRA DOS REIS, Brazil (AP) _ Tribal elders decreed a ``day of
joy'' to welcome the village's new arrival. Guarani boys in face
paint and loincloths danced to the music of a homemade fiddle
played with a tree branch.
	   The celebration was for the long-awaited coming of the ``ayu
ryrurive,'' a Guarani term roughly meaning ``box for accumulating
language'' _ that is, a computer.
	   ``We have been hearing about computers for a while,'' said Luiz
Eusebio, an assistant chief at the Sapukai (sah-poo-kah-EE)
village. ``We thought we need to learn about them because we need
to have more knowledge about non-Indians.''
	   Their ticket to the information age came recently from the
Committee for the Democratization of Information, a private group
that provides computers and training to poor communities, mostly
the hillside slums of Rio de Janeiro.
	   But it seemed unlikely computers would come to the 400 Guaranis
of Sapukai, a 5,200-acre (2,080-hectare) community tucked among
lush green mountains along the coastal highway 100 miles (160
kilometers) west of Rio.
	   For one thing, the village had no electricity.
	   ``I always dreamed of bringing computers to an Indian
reservation, but I didn't know how,'' Rodrigo Baggio, the group's
president, said while he pulled cables from the back of his car to
install four personal computers at the village's Federal Indian
Bureau post.
	   Most of Brazil's 300,000 Indians live in the remote Amazon, too
far for Baggio's group to travel. But the Guarani were close enough
to bring in a gasoline-powered generator to run the computers.
	   With the help of the Indian Bureau and the Indigenous Missionary
Council, which has ties to the Roman Catholic Church, Baggio set
out to install computers and provide training for the village's
five teachers.
	   The first step was having teacher Ernesto da Silva come to Rio
for a week of instruction.
	   ``It's like anything else. At first it's hard, and then you get
used to it,'' said da Silva, beaming proudly before a drawing of
the village's school he made using a computer.
	   Baggio's goal is to provide job training for poor communities
and help them organize.
	   But at Sapukai, no one expressed any interest in the idea of
working outside the reservation. The tribe plans to use the
computers mainly to keep health records, develop educational
materials and build a database of Guarani history, myths and
traditions.
	   Besides, they can afford only enough gasoline to run the
generator for a couple of hours twice a week. Baggio said he hopes
to bring solar power to Sapukai, if he can raise the money.
	   But despite come concessions to Western culture _ shorts,
T-shirts, plastic sandals, metal pots and even a little Portuguese
_ the tribe's leaders are wary about the impact computers might
have on their lives.
	   ``If we use the computer more than twice a week, we won't have
time to plant. And if we don't plant, we starve,'' said Eusebio,
the assistant chief. ``We also know if we turn them off they will
just sit there. It's not like they can run around the village
causing trouble.''

Helping North Sea sailors in distress for 175 years

	   IJMUIDEN, Netherlands (AP) _ The rougher the seas, the better.
	   It's an unusual motto for a sailor. But for Laendert Langbroek,
gale-force winds and choppy surf provide a welcome challenge when
he isn't frantically trying to save someone's life.
	   Langbroek is one of 500 members of the Royal Dutch Rescue
Institute, the corps that has been helping North Sea mariners in
distress for almost 175 years. They are all volunteers.
	   It's not ``Baywatch'' _ between distress calls it can get pretty
monotonous. So for these saviors at sea, the daily struggle of man
vs. nature helps break up the routine.
	   ``You have to have a real affection for the sea,'' said
Langbroek, coxswain aboard the rescue ship Christien.
	   Known by its Dutch acronym, KNRM, the independent, nonprofit
organization stands vigil from its 35 stations along the Dutch
coast.
	   For Langbroek, that can mean riding the swells and dips of
crashing waves in a four-man boat capable of cruising at 40 mph (65
kph).
	   Clad in bright orange thermal rescue suits and radio headsets
with giant earpieces designed to keep out the deafening sounds of
the sea, the KNRM volunteers rely on computer monitors to track
their movements and guide them through rough conditions toward
vessels in distress.
	   Often it ends up being a ship foundering in the surf with a
stalled engine, or an inexperienced ``Sunday sailor'' too seasick
to steer back to the safety of shore. Sometimes the volunteers even
have to save each other; during a recent training session, one fell
overboard by mistake and had to be hauled back in.
	   Sometimes it's a matter of life and death.
	   Langbroek's most memorable rescue call came a few years ago
during a raging storm. Several Danish sailors had fallen overboard,
and Langbroek and his crew spent hours in the dark searching the
churning waters with floodlights. They never found the bodies.
	   At 1,500 distress calls a year, the job of rescuer is a rigorous
commitment. Volunteers are on call 24 hours a day. When their
beepers go off, they must report to their ships within 10 minutes.
Many weekends are spent on training exercises.
	   For their time at sea, volunteers get a stipend equivalent to
about a dollar an hour. After a long day, crew members often pool
their money for refreshments at the boathouse. ``It's the beer
fund,'' said Kees Brinkman, a KNRM spokesman.
	   Despite the long hours and lack of pay, the corps has a waiting
list for joining its prestigious rescue crews.
	   ``We have three times as many volunteers as we need,'' Brinkman
said.
	   Because of that, it is able to select the most seaworthy,
experienced and readily available people for its corps.
	   Those selected join a proud group that began in 1824, when
rescuers used horses to launch their boats and rowed out to vessels
in trouble.
	   The KNRM plans to celebrate its 175th anniversary next year with
a show of Dutch pragmatism: replacing its older steel boats with
faster aluminum ones.
	   The new craft, which cost about 2.5 million guilders (dlrs 1.3
million) each, are being paid for entirely with donations and the
proceeds of Christmas card sales.
	   Other fund-raising ideas are under consideration, including one
to develop a rescue simulation ride for children.
	   ``We get letters from little boys all the time,'' said Wessel
Agterhof, another volunteer. ``They all want to know how they can
be rescuers.''

Turkish president says country not ready to lift death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ President Suleyman Demirel on Saturday
said he disapproved of a government bid to abolish the death
penalty to gain the extradition from Italy of a Kurdish rebel
leader, who is wanted here on terrorism charges.
	   ``Turkey is not ready for the lifting of the death penalty,''
Demirel told reporters in a year-end news conference.
	   The government has drafted a bill to replace the death penalty
with life in prison. The aim is to win the extradition of Abdullah
Ocalan, the leader of a 14-year-old Kurdish guerrilla war for
autonomy in southeast Turkey.
	   Italian law forbids extradition of anyone who might face capital
punishment.
	   Demirel said the lifting of the death penalty for Ocalan's
extradition was a ``grave condition.'' He referred to public
outrage against Ocalan, who is blamed in Turkey for the death of
thousands of people.
	   Turkey has not carried out any executions since 1984 despite
issuing death sentences.
	   Ocalan, who showed up in Italy on a flight from Moscow last
month, has been looking for a safe country to go since Syria
expelled him in October in response to heavy pressure from Turkey.
	   Estonia, Ukraine, Libya and North Korea had been mentioned in
news reports as possible destinations.
	   Ocalan, who has asked Italy for political asylum, has been
staying in a villa near Rome while his future is decided.
	   Some 37,000 people have died in the conflict since Ocalan's
Kurdistan Workers Party launched a guerrilla war for autonomy in
1984.

Pakistan rejects unilateral moratorium on fissile material
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan, one of the world's newest
nuclear powers, rejected a unilateral moratorium on fissile
material used to make nuclear bombs Saturday.
	   ``Given our genuine security concerns, we cannot agree to any
demand for a moratorium on the production of fissile materials
unilaterally or multilaterally,'' Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz told
the National Assembly or powerful lawmaking Lower House of
Parliament.
	   Both Pakistan and India exploded underground nuclear tests last
May, declared themselves nuclear powers and generated global fears
of a nuclear arms race on the Asian subcontinent, a volatile region
that already has seen three wars in the last 51 years.
	   Aziz says the United States and other western countries have
asked Pakistan to declare an early moratorium on the production of
fissile material.
	   But Aziz says Pakistan has concerns about India's stockpile of
fissile material, as well as stockpiles worldwide.
	   ``We believe that a fissile material treaty should be an
instrument promoting both nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear
disarmament,'' Aziz said. ``When the substantive negotiations start
on Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty in Geneva next year, Pakistan
will pursue its position, which is shared by a majority of the
non-aligned countries.''
	   Both India and Pakistan are under fierce pressure from the
international community to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,
something Pakistan already has expressed a willingness to do.
International sanctions imposed following the underground tests
were relaxed after Pakistan indicated it would sign the test ban
treaty.
	   However, the Pakistan government has been steadfast in its
refusal to sign the pact ending the production of fissile material.

After Christmas engagements, pope relaxes at holiday retreat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ After a bout with the flu and the
demands of Christmas appearances, Pope John Paul II on Saturday
bantered with pilgrims as he began a brief holiday in the Alban
hills southeast of Rome.
	   Following celebration of a Christmas Eve midnight Mass, which
lasted into the early hours of Friday, and then another appearance
to the public gathered in St. Peter's Square at noon on Christmas
day, John Paul scheduled a late morning helicopter flight Saturday
for Castel Gandolfo, a lakeside hilltown which hosts the papal
holiday retreat.
	   ``Merry Christmas, Castel Gandolfo,'' the pope joked after
giving his blessing to pilgrims and tourists in the courtyard of
the 17th-century palace.
	   John Paul, who is to spend a few days in the hilltown, seemed
rested and in good spirits in the crisp, sunny day. On Dec. 18, the
Vatican announced that the pope had canceled some private audiences
because of a light flu and fever.

Defections by top leaders pull plug on dying Khmer Rouge

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two leaders of the Khmer Rouge reign
of terror in the 1970s defected to the government Saturday in a
deal that could signal the end of the bloodstained revolutionary
group but is unlikely to bring them to justice.
	   Prime Minister Hun Sen said he personally negotiated the final
touches on the defections Friday night, the 20th anniversary of the
Christmas 1978 invasion by Vietnam that toppled the genocidal
regime.
	   Khieu Samphan, the Khmer Rouge's nominal leader, and political
chief Nuon Chea said in letters read by Hun Sen on national radio
that they wished to become ``ordinary citizens.''
	   Hun Sen later brushed aside questions whether they would be
brought to trial for the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians,
indicating a deal had been struck allowing them to surrender in
exchange for not being tried.
	   ``We should not talk about any court,'' Hun Sen said. ``This is
a time when we should talk about reconciliation.''
	   The defections leave at large only one major Khmer Rouge figure,
the one-legged general Ta Mok, known as ``The Butcher,'' and less
than 100 die-hard loyalists. Om Yentieng, an aide to Hun Sen, said
that Ta Mok's arrest is still sought.
	   Hun Sen said in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he
``would like to warmly welcome the two personalities'' in the
interests of ``national reconstruction and peace.''
	   The defectors were key players in the Khmer Rouge's rule after
the Maoist revolutionaries won a civil war in 1975.
	   The Khmer Rouge emptied the cities and sent the populations to
agricultural labor camps in the countryside. Perhaps one Cambodian
in five died of overwork, disease, starvation and systematic
executions.
	   Longtime Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot _ purged in a bloody power
struggle last year _ died in April while under house arrest by his
ex-comrades. Khmer Rouge leaders said he suffered a heart attack.
	   Cambodia's current leaders and the United States have said in
the past that they wanted Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea and Ta Mok
captured and tried for genocide and crimes against humanity.
	   A team of legal experts appointed by the United Nations visited
Cambodia last month to assess evidence for a possible international
tribunal. Local U.N. officials said the report was due to reach
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a few weeks.
	   Om Yentieng said the prime minister supports a tribunal but that
justice should be left to local courts _ woefully unequipped for
such a task.
	   Over the past two years, the government has adopted a policy of
negotiating de facto amnesty with Khmer Rouge leaders to persuade
them to end nearly two decades of stalemated civil war.
	   Analysts warned Hun Sen risks losing support from Cambodians if
he prevents a trial for at least one of the defectors.
	   ``With Nuon Chea, it is very clear he was involved in dealing
with security, prisoners and torture,'' said Youk Chhang, director
of a Cambodian research center devoted to gathering evidence
against the Khmer Rouge.
	   Still, the strategy has brought peace to large areas of Cambodia
for the first time in a generation but means that none of the
group's most bloodstained chieftains has been taken into custody.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea's letters said they had sealed their
defection by telephone Friday with Hun Sen, who formed a new
government last month expected to curb the political instability
long exploited by the Khmer Rouge.
	   In Thailand, which closely monitors Khmer Rouge activities, Maj.
Gen. Wiwat Sattarak, chief of the border task force, said that
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea moved to defect a month ago.
	   ``Ta Mok remains with a handful of loyalist troops willing to
die for him. There's no more than 100,'' Wiwat said. ``The
Cambodian government's attitude is to let him grow old and die by
himself, it's not worth the money to chase him.''

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ An estimated 10,000 Somalis have
crossed into Ethiopia to escape severe drought that has hit
southern Somalia, a regional official has said.
	   Abubaker Abdi, head of the Region 5 Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Office in southeastern Ethiopia, told state-run media
Friday the Somalis were fleeing to the Warder and Afder zones of
the Ethiopian region formerly known as the Ogaden, which itself has
been hit by a serious drought.
	   ``The zones where the Somali refugees are now camped has been
hit by a serious food shortage cause by a severe drought, making
the problem even more critical,'' Abubaker was quoted as saying.
	   Another unnamed official of the Federal Refugees and Returnees
Affairs Administration emphasized that the Somalis were arriving in
Ethiopia to escape effects of the drought and not clan-based
fighting that has flared up again in parts of southern Somalia.
	   It was the first reported mass exodus of Somalis into Ethiopia
since hundreds of thousands sought refuge from civil war and famine
in 1993-94.
	   Most of the inhabitants of Ethiopia's Region 5 are ethnic
Somalis.

Pro-democracy leader won't let government deport her
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi
has told members of her party that she won't allow Myanmar's
military regime to deport her.
	   The opposition National League for Democracy said in a statement
obtained Saturday that Suu Kyi told members last week not to worry
about rumors that she would be deported after the New Year.
	   ``Party members should not be worried of my deportation,'' Suu
Kyi said. ``I am not a citizen of other countries and I have no
intention of leaving this country.''
	   Suu Kyi is married to a British academic, Michael Aris. The
government often refers to her a spy and puppet of foreign nations,
particularly former colonial ruler Britain and the United States.
	   ``I am not a British citizen and my conscience is clear,'' said
Suu Kyi. ``How can a government deport its citizen if there is no
country to accept him or her?''
	   Suu Kyi, daughter of independence hero Aung San, has spent most
of the past decade under house arrest or had her movements
restricted in a struggle with the military rulers for more
democracy.
	   Though she was under house arrest at the time, her party won
parliamentary elections allowed by the military in 1990. The ruling
council of generals never allowed the parliament to meet.
	   The party launched a campaign earlier this year to convene the
parliament unilaterally, triggering a roundup of hundreds of
members. Only those promising to quit her party have been freed.
	   Recently, the ruling State Peace and Development Council has
been organizing mass rallies demanding Suu Kyi be deported, echoed
by commentaries in official newspapers.

Bodies of four kidnapped foreigners found in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The bodies of four foreigners beheaded in Chechnya
earlier this month were found on the outskirts of the Chechen
capital Grozny, a news report said Saturday.
	   The bodies of the four men _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and
Rudolf Petschi of Britain, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were
found late Friday night, said Chechen presidential spokesman
Mairbek Vachagayev, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The foreigners' heads were found on a roadside Dec. 8, after a
rescue attempt by local authorities apparently went wrong. The men,
all engineers in Chechnya to install a cellular phone system, were
kidnapped in early October.
	   Officials said the bodies would be sent to Britain.
	   Authorities have accused a rebel warlord of killing the four
men, but have provided no evidence to support their claim. The
warlord, Arbi Barayev, denies the charges.
	   Chechnya has been plagued by violence and kidnappings,
especially since its 1994-96 independence war against Russia. It
runs its own affairs though no country recognizes its claims of
sovereignty.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Solidifying his support among the
military, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has appointed a new
air force chief and promoted loyalists who back his Kosovo
policies, media here reported Saturday.
	   The moves followed last month's sacking of the chief of
Yugoslavia's army, who was reportedly critical of Milosevic's
handling of the Kosovo crisis and his replacement with a
neo-communist supporter of the Yugoslav president.
	   The appointments and promotions came amid a dangerous escalation
in clashes in Kosovo this week that threaten to return the
Albanian-majority province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's major republic,
to all-out war.
	   The promotions were announced after a session late Friday of the
Supreme Defense Council, the country's five-member decision-making
body for top defense issues, headed by Milosevic.
	   The daily Politika carried a front-page announcement that
Lt.-Gen. Spasoje Smiljanic was appointed commander of the air
force, a position that had been vacated in October when the former
air force chief was deposed.
	   Milosevic also promoted seven generals, including three who were
involved in the Yugoslav army campaign against Kosovo's separatist
Albanian guerillas this year.
	   A commander of the army corps in provincial capital Pristina was
moved up to head a regional section of the Yugoslav army, while a
former chief of special forces in Kosovo was made his aide.
	   Another loyalist was appointed new commander in the region of
Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
	   Milosevic also relieved three high-ranking army officers of
their duties but it was not immediately clear whether they were
purged for suspected disloyalty.
	   Last month's deposition of the former army chief, Gen. Momcilo
Perisic, was a result of his opposition both to the neo-communist
party run by Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, and of Milosevic's
hard-line stand on Kosovo.
	   There had also been growing rumors in Belgrade that the ruling
couple feared a coup attempt by Perisic and the secret police
chief, the second most powerful man in Yugoslavia, whom Milosevic
dismissed earlier in November.
	   In Kosovo on Saturday, there were no reports of new fighting
after the most recent outbreak in the north of the province.
	   But the government-run Media Center said that the Kosovo
Liberation Army killed an elderly Serb farmer _ one of the few
Serbs who had not left the area, near the guerrilla-controlled town
of Podujevo.
	   Serb and Yugoslav forces launched an offensive in the region on
Thursday, reportedly killing at least nine people. The crackdown
poses the gravest threat yet to the Oct. 12 agreement that halted
months of violence between Serbs and guerrillas trying to gain
Kosovo's independence.
	   William Walker, head of an international force monitoring the
Kosovo situation, said the newest fighting _ just south of Podujevo
_ had led to the ``tensest period since the agreement was signed.''
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army said late Thursday it would
``not sit idly by'' and would ``attack with all means available.''
However, the KLA regional commander Walker met with insisted that
his forces were not firing unless fired on.
	   The United States, France and the European Union have warned
both sides not to continue the violence. Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov on Friday warned the West against using force to halt
the latest violence.
	   In October, NATO threatened airstrikes against the Serbs as
punishment for their crackdown begun last February, in which
hundreds died and some 300,000 were forced to flee their homes. The
NATO attacks were put on hold after a cease-fire was reached and
Milosevic pulled out some of his forces.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two leaders of the Khmer Rouge reign
of terror in the 1970s defected to the government Saturday in a
deal that could signal the end of the bloodstained revolutionary
group but is unlikely to bring them to justice. Prime Minister Hun
Sen said he personally negotiated the final touches on the
defections Friday night, the 20th anniversary of the Christmas 1978
invasion by Vietnam that toppled the genocidal regime. Khieu
Samphan, the Khmer Rouge's nominal leader, and political chief Nuon
Chea said in letters read by Hun Sen on national radio that they
wished to become ``ordinary citizens.'' Hun Sen later brushed aside
questions whether they would be brought to trial for the deaths of
as many as 2 million Cambodians, indicating a deal had been struck
allowing them to surrender in exchange for not being tried. ``We
should not talk about any court,'' Hun Sen said. ``This is a time
when we should talk about reconciliation.'' (CAMBODIA-KHMER ROUGE)

	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A fishing boat with six people on
board was missing Saturday after Cyclone Cora battered the Pacific
island nation of Tonga, Tongan police said. The 7-meter (yard) boat
was missing in high seas off the central Ha'apai group of islands.
The cyclone, which had moved away from Tonga's main island
Tongatapu by 6 p.m. local time (0400 GMT), was reported to have
damaged crops and buildings and cut communications lines throughout
the island group. The cyclone battered the main island of Tongatapu
and the Ha'apai chain with wind gusts of up to 100 mph (160 kph), a
police spokesman said. (TONGA-CYCLONE)
	   HONOLULU (AP) _ After three failed attempts this year to float
around the world in a balloon, American millionaire Steve Fossett
sounded a little discouraged. ``I think it's time to go sailing,''
Fossett said Friday after he and two other adventurers abandoned
their effort to make the first nonstop around-the-world balloon
flight. British mogul Richard Branson, however, said he was
undeterred. ``We've finally cracked everything in the technology,''
he said. ``We'll buck up ourselves and start again.'' Fossett,
Branson, and Per Lindstrand of Sweden, who have made a total of 11
attempts at a nonstop flight around globe, were in good condition
when U.S. Coast Guard helicopters lifted them out of the Pacific
Ocean about 10 miles (16 kilometers) off Kahuku Point at the
northeast tip of Oahu. They were seven days into their journey _
about the halfway point _ when they ditched. (BALLOON QUEST)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Police charged a businessman and his
girlfriend Saturday with trying to defect to communist North Korea
to avoid fraud charges at home. Businessman Kim Hak-hee, 48, and
his girlfriend Lee Soo-ok, 39, who fled South Korea in 1993, met
North Korean embassy officials in Singapore on Dec. 14 to arrange
their defection through Beijing, authorities said. Kim and Lee were
captured Tuesday by Interpol in the Kuala Lumpur airport while
stopping for a transit flight for Beijing, and where extradited to
South Korea, police said.

Turkish president pushes parliament

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's president on Saturday pushed the
heavily fragmented Turkish Parliament to try to reach a consensus
on a new government.
	   Demirel's remarks came two days before Yalim Erez, an
independent lawmaker who was designated as premier by the president
on Wednesday, starts negotiations with party leaders.
	   If Erez fails to form a coalition soon, Demirel could appoint a
caretaker government to run the country until elections on April
18.
	   But Demirel made clear he wanted a government in place soon with
a real coalition.
	   ``I am seeking a consensus,'' Demirel said.
	   ``I will not form a government which is not based on
Parliament's confidence,'' Demirel told reporters in a year-end
news conference. ``If Erez cannot form a government by Jan. 10,
then new searches begin for new government formulas.''
	   A vote of confidence is not required for a caretaker government.
	   Erez, who is expected to ask a range of parties to join his
Cabinet, must submit any eventual coalition to a parliamentary vote
of confidence to see if it can command a majority in the
legislature.
	   Demirel's refusal to appoint a caretaker government is another
setback for the pro-Islamic Virtue Party since under such an
arrangement the party would be granted 10 ministry posts to reflect
its standing as Parliament's largest party.
	   Demirel already snubbed Virtue by appointing Erez, the acting
industry and trade minister, breaking with the tradition of asking
the leader of the largest party to try to form a government.
	   Virtue is the successor of a banned Islamic party, Welfare, that
was pressured out of government by the military last year for
anti-secular activities.
	   The coalition government led by Mesut Yilmaz collapsed Nov. 25
over allegations that the acting premier rigged the sale of a bank.
	   Before Erez, veteran leftist politician Bulent Ecevit spent
three weeks in a failed bid to form a coalition with Turkey's
bickering center-left and center-right parties.

Seven killed in rebel attacks in Burundi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Rebel attackers have killed at least
seven people in southwestern Burundi, the official news agency ABP
reported.
	   In a dispatch Friday, ABP said four people were killed Wednesday
in Rumonge commune in Bururi province, and another five people were
kidnapped.
	   The agency said Hutu rebels trying to oust the government of
President Pierre Buyoya left pamphlets behind ``to intimidate
people.''
	   Another three people were killed Tuesday in an attack on Munege
village, ABP said.
	   During a conference in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, earlier this
week to discuss prospects for peace in the tiny central African
nation, Burundian legislators expressed concern about possible
violence over the Christmas and New Year's holidays by FNL rebels,
the armed wing of the rebel Palipehutu group.
	   Last New Year's Eve, FNL attacks around Bujumbura airport left
more than 200 people dead.
	   Palipehutu has been opposed to the ongoing Burundian peace
process that has brought about a partial cessation of attacks by
another rebel group and agreement by parties representing minority
Tutsis and majority Hutus to work together.
	   At least 200,000 people have died in Burundi, most of them
civilians, since Tutsi paratroopers killed the country's first
democratically elected president, a Hutu, in an failed coup in
October 1993.

Onboard computer navigator forgets to mention ferry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ A German couple out for a Christmas
drive near Berlin ended up in a river _ apparently because their
onboard computer navigator forgot to mention they had to wait for a
ferry.
	   The 57-year-old driver and his passenger were not injured in the
accident, police said Saturday.
	   The couple was out driving Friday night when they came to
Caputh, where a ferry operates across the Havel River.
	   That information, however, apparently was never stored in the
satellite-steered navigation system they were using, police said.
The driver kept going straight in the dark, expecting a bridge, and
ended up in the water.
	   Ship traffic on the river was stopped for two hours while the
luxury car was fished out about 4 meters (13 feet) from the river
bank.
	   ``You can't always blindly rely on technology,'' a coast guard
police officer said.

Palestinians demand Israeli compliance with peace pact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians are demanding that Israel
lift its suspension of the Wye River peace accord, saying the
ongoing election campaign is no reason to freeze the process.
	   ``This Israeli government continues to be a government,
responsible for its commitments,'' chief Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said after Friday night's meeting of the Palestinian
Cabinet in the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   Israel has said its election timetable _ direct balloting for
prime minister is expected by late April _ is not affecting the
peace process.
	   However, the call for early elections was triggered by
lawmakers' rejection of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's peace
policies, and how and whether to implement the peace pact is
already a major campaign issue.
	   Israel says it froze the 2-month-old U.S.-brokered accord
because of Palestinian violations, and has refused to go ahead with
promised troop pullbacks from the West Bank unless the Palestinians
meet a series of conditions. Those include a renunciation of
Palestinian claims to the right to declare statehood in May 1999
whether or not terms have been agreed on with Israel.
	   But the Palestinian Cabinet said in a statement following its
meeting that it would continue making preparations for a statehood
declaration in May.
	   The Palestinians also said they would seek help from the Arab
world and the rest of the international community to ``confront the
freezing of the peace process.
	   The Cabinet called Israeli noncompliance with the accord a
``dangerous development which was initiated by the Israeli
government without any reason besides its rejection of peace.''

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A group of 40 exhausted illegal migrants
were discovered Friday on the eastern Aegean island of Ikaria after
being stranded in rough seas for four days, news reports said
Saturday.
	   The migrants, 33 Iraqis and seven Afghanis, told police they had
crossed from the Turkish coast about 70 kilometers (45 miles) away.
They said they had been heading to Italy but were stopped by gales.
	   The migrant smugglers apparently sailed back to Turkey.
	   Tens of thousands of illegal migrants, mainly Iraqi Kurds, cross
from Turkey into Greece each year.
	   Some of those arrested are sent back to Turkey but many are
allowed seek work in Greece or other European Union countries.
	   The 40 migrants, including 15 children, are being held by
authorities in Ikaria. They will be led to the nearby island of
Samos, where a court will decide whether they will be allowed to
stay in Greece.

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's backup pace bowlers
kept the West Indies in enough trouble at 156 for five wickets at
tea on the first day of the third test at Kingsmead Saturday.
	   Captain Brian Lara scored only the West Indies second half
century in tests on the tour as he made 51 attractive runs before
falling to his second mistimed pull shot in as many innings for 51
to David Terbrugge. Lara was understandably furious with himself,
with his dismissal being the fourth to a bad stroke in the innings.
	   South Africa's star strike bowler, Allan Donald, and Lara had
had a fascinating duel earlier in the visitor's innings, with Lara
coming off the better of the two. While that battle raged, it
looked as if Lara was approaching his best, but, at tea, the West
Indies were left with two inexperienced players at the crease in
Darren Ganga, not out on 24, and wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs on 14.
	   Earlier, Carl Hooper had gone for 10 to an atrocious flash
outside the off stump off the bowling of Jacques Kallis, easily the
best of the South African bowlers with three for 18.
	   With the West Indies using their ninth opening pair in 23 test
matches in Philo Wallace and retreaded wicketkeeper Junior Murray,
South African captain Hansie Cronje won the toss and sent the
tourists in to bat on a well-grassed pitch that looks likely to
take turn as the match progresses.
	   The West Indies are in a must-win situation, being two down in
the five-match series, and have made five changes to the team which
was beaten inside three days in the last match in Port Elizabeth.
In addition to Murray and Wallace, who returns after illness,
19-year-old Ganga makes his debut, leg spinner Rawl Lewis returns,
and Franklyn Rose is included in place of Nixon McLean.
	   After putting on 50, the opening pair fell in quick succession,
Wallace falling to a poor shot to Kallis for 21, and Murray being
trapped in front by Terbrugge just two runs later for 29. It seemed
as if all the good work was to be undone when the form man,
Shivnarine Chanderpaul, succumbed to the wiles of Kallis and an
uncharacteristically injudicious shot for four.
	   At lunch, Lara was not out on 10, and Hooper on two. There were
glimmerings of some Lara form early on, after he survived a snorter
of an opening delivery from Terbrugge which could have had him
trapped in front had it not been called a no-ball. He flicked
Donald off his hip for a lovely legside boundary, and then stroked
him through the covers gloriously just before lunch.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's economic growth rate for the year
1998 is expected to amount to 2.2 percent, an official of the
International Monetary Fund was quoted Saturday as saying.
	   Antonio Fertido, director of the IMF Middle East department,
made the comment in an interview with the Jordanian daily Al-Ra'i.
	   He also said an IMF delegation will visit the kingdom next month
to study the economy and discuss ways of speeding up growth.
	   The IMF estimate is in line with projections from Jordan's
planning minister, Nabil Amari.
	   The economy grew 1.8 percent last year after it was set back by
the U.N. trade embargo on Iraq and the barriers put by Israel on
Jordanian products destined for the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

	   Ali al-Bader, who heads the Kuwait Investment Authority, told
the Kuwaiti daily Al-Rai Al-Amm that some of the money was also
used to bridge Kuwait's budget deficits. The investment authority
is the government arm that manages the country's state investments,
which are worth an estimated dlrs 40 billion, mostly abroad.
	   The official said the funds were used to increase the capital of
the state-owned Credits and Loans Bank, the Housing Authority and
other government firms. He did not provide details.
	   The government has for four years been selling its stake in
scores of local companies, part of a plan to boost the private
sector and energize the economy which is dominated by oil revenues
and government spending.
	   The value of holdings it still intends to sell off is around 800
million dinars (dlrs 2.64 billion).
	   Kuwait has for years been reaching into its foreign investments
to bridge budget shortfalls. The small Gulf state, which has been
hard hit by falling oil prices, expects a net deficit of more than
1.92 billion dinars (dlrs 6.35 billion) in the fiscal year that
started July 1.
 &UR; ___
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian expert says he expects no rise in
future oil prices and urged Iran to revamp is taxation system and
diversify its industries to reduce the budget deficit, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency said Saturday.
	   The agency said Mohammad Qoli Yusefi, a university lecturer,
told the English-language Tehran Times that one reason he expected
no great rise in oil prizes is that the industrialized nations have
turned into service economies.
	   He also said that he expected no increase in demand for oil
because energy-saving devices were reducing the need for oil and
that natural gas was proving to be a good alternative.
	   Yusefi pointed out that reliance on oil revenues as the main
source of income by oil-producing states has resulted in an ailing
taxation system. He said Iran should deregulate industry and
facilitate export of non-oil goods.

Palestinians demand Israeli compliance with peace pact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians are demanding that Israel
lift its suspension of the Wye River peace accord, saying the
ongoing election campaign is no reason to freeze the process.
	   ``This Israeli government continues to be a government,
responsible for its commitments,'' chief Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said after Friday night's meeting of the Palestinian
Cabinet in the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   Israel has said its election timetable _ direct balloting for
prime minister is expected by late April _ is not affecting the
peace process.
	   However, the call for early elections was triggered by
lawmakers' rejection of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's peace
policies, and how and whether to implement the peace pact is
already a major campaign issue.
	   Israel says it froze the 2-month-old U.S.-brokered accord
because of Palestinian violations, and has refused to go ahead with
promised troop pullbacks from the West Bank unless the Palestinians
meet a series of conditions. Those include a renunciation of
Palestinian claims to the right to declare statehood in May 1999
whether or not terms have been agreed on with Israel.
	   But the Palestinian Cabinet said in a statement following its
meeting that it would continue making preparations for a statehood
declaration in May.
	   The Palestinians also said they would seek help from the Arab
world and the rest of the international community to ``confront the
freezing of the peace process.
	   The Cabinet called Israeli noncompliance with the accord a
``dangerous development which was initiated by the Israeli
government without any reason besides its rejection of peace.''

Indonesian students pray for activists killed in street clashes

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 100 people, many of them
students, held a Muslim prayer session Saturday to commemorate the
deaths of student protesters in clashes last month with security
forces.
	   It was the first gathering of political activists since the
beginning a week ago of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, during
which anti-government protesters have pledged to refrain from
street rallies. Indonesia is predominately Muslim.
	   The night prayer was held in the parking lot of Atma Jaya
Catholic University, the scene of fighting between anti-riot
officers and students who were trying to march to Parliament.
	   The Nov. 13 clashes left nine students dead and triggered
rioting in several parts of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, on the
following day.
	   ``We hope that the dead students are accepted by God and we
gather here in the hopes of avoiding more victims in the future,''
a student said in a speech at the university, which is beside
Jakarta's main thoroughfare.
	   Other students knelt on prayer mats and intoned, ``God is
great.''
	   Last month, students had been protesting against a government
assembly on political reforms, which they rejected because many of
its members were appointed by former President Suharto. The
authoritarian leader was ousted in May after 32 years in power.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has implemented some
reforms and has scheduled parliamentary elections in June. But he
has not yielded to student demands to put Suharto on trial and
strip the military of its powerful political role.

Nuclear reactor stopped in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A nuclear reactor was stopped for
unscheduled repairs at Ukraine's Yuzhnaya power plant, forcing a
delay in repairs that had been planned at another nuclear facility,
officials said Saturday.
	   The repairs at Yuzhnaya's reactor No. 3 were prompted by growing
hydrogen leaks from its cooling system and are expected to be
finished by Monday, the Nuclear Regulation Administration said.
	   The reactor shutdown led to an electricity shortage in Ukraine's
energy system and forced energy officials to postpone repairs at
the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant, where one reactor was to have
been stopped Saturday for a week.
	   Ukraine's power plants, which are owed more than dlrs 1 billion
by electricity consumers, have been working below capacity since
October because they don't have enough money for fuel. As a result,
they cannot meet increased winter energy demands. Many villages and
enterprises throughout Ukraine suffer hours-long power cuts every
day.
	   Energy shortages forced the Energy Ministry to delay lengthy
repairs on the only operational reactor at the Chernobyl power
plant earlier this month, despite growing international concerns
over its safety.
	   Ukraine's five nuclear power plants provide more than 40 percent
of the former Soviet republic's energy needs. Four of the country's
14 operational reactors are currently undergoing repair.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Solidifying his support among the
military, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has appointed a new
air force chief and promoted loyalists who back his Kosovo
policies, media here reported Saturday.
	   The moves followed last month's sacking of the chief of
Yugoslavia's army, who was reportedly critical of Milosevic's
handling of the Kosovo crisis and his replacement with a
neo-communist supporter of the Yugoslav president.
	   The appointments and promotions came amid a dangerous escalation
in clashes in Kosovo this week that threaten to return the
Albanian-majority province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's major republic,
to all-out war.
	   The promotions were announced after a session late Friday of the
Supreme Defense Council, the country's five-member decision-making
body for top defense issues, headed by Milosevic.
	   The daily Politika carried a front-page announcement that
Lt.-Gen. Spasoje Smiljanic was appointed commander of the air
force, a position that had been vacated in October when the former
air force chief was deposed.
	   Milosevic also promoted seven generals, including three who were
involved in the Yugoslav army campaign against Kosovo's separatist
Albanian guerillas this year.
	   A commander of the army corps in provincial capital Pristina was
moved up to head a regional section of the Yugoslav army, while a
former chief of special forces in Kosovo was made his aide.
	   Another loyalist was appointed new commander in the region of
Pristina.
	   Milosevic also relieved three high-ranking army officers of
their duties but it was not immediately clear whether they were
purged for suspected disloyalty.
	   Last month's deposition of the former army chief, Gen. Momcilo
Perisic, was a result of his opposition both to the neo-communist
party run by Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, and of Milosevic's
hard-line stand on Kosovo.
	   There had also been growing rumors in Belgrade that the ruling
couple feared a coup attempt by Perisic and the secret police
chief, the second most powerful man in Yugoslavia, whom Milosevic
dismissed earlier in November.
	   In Kosovo on Saturday, the government-run Media Center said that
the Kosovo Liberation Army killed an elderly Serb farmer _ one of
the few Serbs who had not left the area, near the town of Podujevo.
	   Serb and Yugoslav forces launched an offensive in the region on
Thursday, reportedly killing at least nine people. The crackdown
poses the gravest threat yet to the Oct. 12 agreement that halted
months of violence between Serbs and guerrillas trying to gain
Kosovo's independence.
	   William Walker, head of an international force monitoring the
Kosovo situation, said the newest fighting _ just south of Podujevo
_ had led to the ``tensest period since the agreement was signed.''
	   The United States, France and the European Union have warned
both sides not to continue the violence. Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov on Friday warned the West against using force to halt
the latest violence.
	   In October, NATO threatened airstrikes against the Serbs as
punishment for their crackdown begun last February, in which
hundreds died and some 300,000 were forced to flee their homes. The
NATO attacks were put on hold after a cease-fire was reached and
Milosevic pulled out some of his forces.

	   In Kosovo on Saturday, violence appeared to be on the upswing
after a brief lull, with Serbs accusing the ethnic Albanian
guerrillas of killing an elderly Serb and the Albanians claiming a
new police sweep against them.
	   The farmer was killed in his home in Obranca village, some 30
kilometers (about 20 miles) north of the province's capital
Pristina, by the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation army, the rebel
force that controls much of the area, the government-run Media
Center said.
	   The Kosovo information Center, close to ethnic Albanian
pro-independence leaders, said that shortly before noon, Serb
police approached the Obranca village and opened fire on nearby KLA
positions.
	   The reports could not be immediately confirmed. But a spokesman
for international peace monitors in Kosovo, Jorgen Grunnet, said
there was ``increased activity'' by government forces in the area.

Calm seas off Italy draws illegal immigrants to shore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Encouraged by calm seas, more than 200 illegal
immigrants from Kosovo, Iraq and other places sailed to Italy's
southeastern coast over a 24-hour period, Italian news reports said
Saturday.
	   A group of 150 clandestine immigrants, more than half of them
children, arrived Friday night in two big rubber dinghies, and were
taken to detention centers, where they will stay until authorities
decide if they must be sent back home.
	   In the early hours of Saturday, more than 50 people, most of
them from Kosovo, turned up in the Gargano area, the ``spur'' of
the Italian boot-shaped peninsula. The arrivals included a pregant
woman from Kosovo and a Filipino family of seven.
	   Most immigrant hopefuls see Italy as a gateway to relatives and
jobs in northern Europe. They pay smugglers money to bring them
from Asia, eastern Europe and Africa to take them to Italian
shores, but organizers commonly abandon their charges in the seas
off Italy to avoid being caught by navy and coast guard patrols.

New Basque government to rely on party linked to ETA separatists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Two nationalist Basque parties signed a
pact Saturday to form a minority regional government whose survival
looks certain to depend on support from a group linked to the armed
separatist organization ETA.
	   Two months after elections were staged, Xabier Arzalluz of the
region's leading Basque Nationalist Party signed a four-year deal
with Carlos Garaikoetxea from the Euskal Alkartasuna party.
	   Arzalluz's party won 21 seats in the 75-seat regional parliament
while Euskal Alkartasuna garnered six.
	   The two have acknowledged they will be banking on outside
support from Euskal Herritarrok, a political group which won 14
seats, and which is dominated by Herri Batasuna, long recognized as
the political wing of ETA.
	   It will be the first time a Basque government has been pacted
entirely by pro-independence parties since the Basque region was
given autonomous powers in 1979 following the death of dictator
Francisco Franco.
	   The accord comes as Spain enjoys its fourth month of peace as
ETA continues to uphold its unilateral cease-fire begun Sept. 18.
The cease-fire followed months of talks between the Basque
Nationalist Party and Herri Batasuna.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for
independence.
	   Euskal Herritarrok has said it will not form part of a new
government, but would lend support on certain votes. The deal's
first test comes Tuesday when the parliament meets to vote in a new
regional president with the Basque Nationalist Party's Juan Jose
Ibarretxe tipped to win.
	   The new coalition excludes Spain's two main parties _ Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar's ruling center-right Popular Party and
the opposition Socialists, both of whom are steadfast in their
opposition to a split in Spanish unity.
	   The Popular Party placed second in the Basque elections with 16
seats, while the Socialists took 14. Both parties have strongly
criticized the Basque Nationalist Party's dealings with Herri
Batasuna and insist Herri Batasuna and ETA must renounce the armed
campaign.
	   Six Popular Party members have been killed by ETA over the last
three years.
	   The nationalists argue that bringing Euskal Herritarrok and
Herri Batasuna into the fold will help with cement the peace
process.
	   Prime Minister Aznar has said he is open to talks to permanently
resolve the Basque conflict but demands that ETA should give
greater proof that it intends ending the violence.

Prominent Armenian nationalist buried Saturday

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ The former leader of a secretive
nationalist party was buried in Yerevan's most honored cemetery on
Saturday, five years after he was sent into exile.
	   Grair Marukhian, who led the Dashnak Party from the mid-1980s
until he went into a coma in 1994, died Monday in Athens, Greece.
His body was brought back to Armenia for burial.
	   In 1993, then-President Levon Ter-Petrosian exiled Marukhian,
and suspended the party the following year. Armenia's Supreme Court
banned the party in 1995 but allowed it to resume operations
earlier this year.
	   Dashnak, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, is Armenia's
oldest political grouping. It was founded as a secret organization
in 1890 to fight for a united, independent Armenia.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A group of 40 exhausted illegal migrants
were discovered Friday on the eastern Aegean island of Ikaria after
being stranded in rough seas for four days, news reports said
Saturday.
	   The 33 Iraqis and seven Afghans told police they had crossed
from the Turkish coast about 70 kilometers (45 miles) away. They
said they had been heading to Italy but were stopped by high winds.
	   The migrant smugglers apparently sailed back to Turkey.
	   Tens of thousands of illegal migrants, mainly Iraqi Kurds, cross
from Turkey into Greece each year.
	   Some of those arrested are sent back to Turkey but many are
allowed seek work in Greece or other European Union countries.
	   The 40 migrants, including 15 children, are being held by
authorities in Ikaria. They will be led to the nearby island of
Samos, where a court will decide whether they will be allowed to
stay in Greece.

Yemen tribe refuses ransom offer for release of German hostages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMAD AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A Yemeni tribe holding four Germans hostage
has refused a ransom of two million riyals (dlrs 16,000) offered by
the German embassy, a tribal leader said Saturday.
	   German Ambassador Helga Strathwitz made the offer through
intermediaries earlier this week, said the tribal leader, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   He added that the supposed German offer does not meet the
minimum demands of the Bani Dhabyan tribe.
	   The Germans, three women and a man, were abducted Dec. 7 by Bani
Dhabyan gunmen and taken to Marib province, 170 kilometers (105
miles) northeast of San`a.
	   The tribal leader said that Strathwitz had expressed her concern
for the health of the hostages, especially one of the women who is
sick, and asked for their immediate release.
	   The German Embassy refused to comment on the report.
	   A Yemeni newspaper identified the hostages as Norbert Degen,
Petra Penglista, Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner. The names have
not been confirmed by the German Embassy.
	   The tribesman said the health of 64-year-old Brunner, who
suffers from high blood pressure, is deteriorating.
	   A German-speaking cardiologist dispatched Sunday to examine her
was not able to reach the isolated area where the hostages are
being held and has returned to San`a, the tribal leader said.
	   But he said the hostages received medicine for Brunner along
with Christmas gifts of chocolates and cigarettes from the embassy
Thursday.
	   The Bani Dhabyan are asking the government for more schools,
hospitals, telephone lines and roads in their poor province.
	   Kidnappings occur frequently in Yemen, large parts of which are
controlled by armed tribesmen who do not hesitate to take the law
in their hands to get their demands fulfilled. The hostages are
usually treated well and released unhurt.

Poles complain new penal code is too lenient
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA  &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ When legislators began rewriting Poland's
penal code to replace a 1969 communist-era law, Poles thought the
result would be less crime and speedier justice.
	   But the new system that took effect in September has raised
complaints among judges, police, the news media and the public that
it favors criminals by reducing prison terms and eliminating
capital punishment.
	   ``The defenders of the new code assure they want to fight the
rising crime, but they promote provisions that allow criminals to
leave prison early,'' said Robert Sichulski, a construction
engineer.
	   Opinion polls find increasing support for bringing back the
death penalty, which was suspended in 1989 and left out of the new
code.
	   ``Can our strapped state afford to board convicts for a
lifetime?'' asked Alicja Frackiewicz, a housewife.
	   The unhappiness reflects the general difficulties of the
economic and social changes in the nine years since communist rule
was toppled and Poland shifted to a multiparty democracy and market
economy.
	   Gone are the staples of the communist system, including
guaranteed employment, free education and health care, along with
the pervasive police and military presence that limited personal
freedom while preventing much street crime.
	   With high unemployment, rising costs and fewer police patrols,
crime has increased in recent years in most categories. Police say
1,038 murders were recorded in the first 11 months of 1998,
compared to 971 in all of 1991.
	   The old penal code enacted by communist rulers targeted
political dissenters and secured a surface stability by banning
demonstrations and rallies, except for official May Day parades.
	   New freedom and opportunity have produced new kinds of crime _
gangs that require new members to murder for their initiation;
widespread auto theft; robberies; burglaries.
	   The new law, drawn up by criminal justice professors and legal
experts, was intended to reduce police bureaucracy and simplify
judicial procedures in a country where an average case takes 2 1/2
years to complete.
	   One change avoids a trial if the defendant confesses and agrees
to a penalty chosen by the judge. Crimes have been subdivided into
categories, according to the circumstances of the case, with
precise penalties for conviction.
	   ``The sanctions are more flexible. There is a choice between a
fine or prison in many cases,'' said Barbara Makosa-Stepkowska,
spokeswoman for the Justice Ministry. ``The judges are given wide
possibilities and a greater credit of trust.''
	   But Judge Barbara Piwnik, a 16-year veteran, called the system
too rigid and said it ``strikes with a lack of trust in the
judges,'' who know what works and what doesn't.
	   ``If I am told that homicide is from eight years to life
imprisonment, but when a dangerous tool was used it is from 12
years up, is that a sign of trust in my knowledge and life
experience?'' she asked.
	   Piwnik complains that maximum sentences for some serious crimes
were reduced, such as the new 12-year limit for a gang rape, from
15 years previously. She also dislikes the new obligation to reduce
the sentence of convicts who aid investigators.
	   In a recent case, Judge Malgorzata Mojkowska expressed
frustration in giving a 15-year sentence to one member of a group
of young people who killed a teen-ager, while the others got life
terms. The one with the shorter sentence helped police.
	   She was required to be lenient, but realized that ``cooperation
with the police will not atone for the injuries,'' the judge said
in handing down the sentence.
	   Makosa-Stepkowska, the Justice Ministry spokeswoman, said lesser
penalties like that will result in more criminals being brought to
justice by turning criminals against each other.
	   Tadeusz de Virion, a lawyer who defended opposition figures
during the communist era, considers the new penal code a ``return
to normalcy.''
	   ``The judge's heart, intellect and knowledge are the foundations
of a good justice system,'' he said. ``A wise, compassionate judge
will hand just verdicts even if the code is not of prime quality.''
	   De Virion said police presence, not a penal code, is the best
weapon against street crime.
	   But police spokesman Pawel Biedziak argued the opposite.
	   ``Why are perpetrators hiding from us?'' he asked. ``Because
they fear long prison terms.''

1,038 murders were recorded in the first 11 months of 1998,
compared to 971 in all of 1991.
	   The old penal code enacted by communist rulers targeted
political dissenters and secured a surface stability by banning
demonstrations and rallies, except for official May Day parades.
	   New freedom and opportunity have produced new kinds of crime _
gangs that require new members to murder for their initiation;
widespread auto theft; robberies; burglaries.
	   The new law, drawn up by criminal justice professors and legal
experts, was intended to reduce police bureaucracy and simplify
judicial procedures in a country where an average case takes 2 1/2
years to complete.
	   One change avoids a trial if the defendant confesses and agrees
to a penalty chosen by the judge. Crimes have been subdivided into
categories, according to the circumstances of the case, with
precise penalties for conviction.
	   ``The sanctions are more flexible. There is a choice between a
fine or prison in many cases,'' said Barbara Makosa-Stepkowska,
spokeswoman for the Justice Ministry. ``The judges are given wide
possibilities and a greater credit of trust.''
	   But Judge Barbara Piwnik, a 16-year veteran, called the system
too rigid and said it ``strikes with a lack of trust in the
judges,'' who know what works and what doesn't.
	   ``If I am told that homicide is from eight years to life
imprisonment, but when a dangerous tool was used it is from 12
years up, is that a sign of trust in my knowledge and life
experience?'' she asked.
	   Piwnik complains that maximum sentences for some serious crimes
were reduced, such as the new 12-year limit for a gang rape, from
15 years previously. She also dislikes the new obligation to reduce
the sentence of convicts who aid investigators.
	   In a recent case, Judge Malgorzata Mojkowska expressed
frustration in giving a 15-year sentence to one member of a group
of young people who killed a teen-ager, while the others got life
terms. The one with the shorter sentence helped police.
	   She was required to be lenient, but realized that ``cooperation
with the police will not atone for the injuries,'' the judge said
in handing down the sentence.
	   Makosa-Stepkowska, the Justice Ministry spokeswoman, said lesser
penalties like that will result in more criminals being brought to
justice by turning criminals against each other.
	   Tadeusz de Virion, a lawyer who defended opposition figures
during the communist era, considers the new penal code a ``return
to normalcy.''
	   ``The judge's heart, intellect and knowledge are the foundations
of a good justice system,'' he said. ``A wise, compassionate judge
will hand just verdicts even if the code is not of prime quality.''
	   De Virion said police presence, not a penal code, is the best
weapon against street crime.
	   But police spokesman Pawel Biedziak argued the opposite.
	   ``Why are perpetrators hiding from us?'' he asked. ``Because
they fear long prison terms.''

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Italian club Juventus has made a dlrs-12
million offer to entice Galatasaray striker Hakan Sukur, news
reports said Saturday.
	   Istanbul club Galatasaray, suffering from a financial crisis,
left the decision up to Sukur, daily Hurriyet said.
	   But sports daily Foto Mac reported that Sukur was not eager to
go back to Italy.
	   ``I already closed the Italian venture,'' Foto Mac quoted Sukur
as saying. ``I want to conclude my soccer career in a Galatasaray
uniform.''
	   Sukur joined Galatasaray three years ago after a brief stint
with Turin club Juventus. He scored 32 league goals last season for
the reigning champion Galatasaray.

Iraq says allied aircraft attacked air defense unit

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Saturday that ``enemy'' planes
flying from the airspace of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia had attacked an
Iraqi anti-aircraft unit and were driven off.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency did not identify the nationality
of the aircraft, but it usually uses the word ``enemy'' for the
United States and Britain. Some U.S. warplanes are based in Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, and Britain also stations aircraft in Kuwait.
	   The agency said that at 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT) a formation of
warplanes ``attacked one of our air defense sites, which confronted
it and forced it to drop its load randomly.''
	   The report did not say where the apparent attack took place and
gave no other details.
	   In Washington, U.S. Defense Department spokesman Glenn Flood
said the United States had ``no involvement in the alleged
incident.'' In London, no British Defence Ministry spokesman was
available for comment.
	   Saturday's report was the second such incident reported by the
Iraqi News Agency since the United States and Britain began four
days of air attacks against Iraq on Dec. 16 in a bid to punish
Baghdad for its alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The attacks were aimed at military and government targets. Iraq
says that 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were killed in the
bombardment.
	   The news agency reported on Tuesday that U.S. and British
aircraft fired two ``stray missiles'' near the southern city of
Basra. U.S. and British officials denied their planes were involved
in any such incident.
	   U.S. and British warplanes routinely patrol ``no-fly zones''
over northern and southern Iraq.

More voices added to debate over Germany's Holocaust Memorial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Stepping into Germany's debate over whether to
build a national Holocaust Memorial, famed Nazi-hunter Simon
Wiesenthal said he believes a stone monument is not the right way
to remember the murder of 6 million Jews.
	   ``The Holocaust has too many faces for a memorial,'' he said in
an interview to be published Sunday in the Welt am Sonntag
newspaper.
	   ``In any case, remembrance is not only about the dead, but above
all with the life that was destroyed. Therefore I'm also against a
Holocaust memorial in Berlin.''
	   For the past decade, Germany has been debating building a
Holocaust memorial on a giant plot of government-donated land in
the heart of Berlin. Construction was supposed to begin next year,
when the federal government starts its move from Bonn back to its
historic capital.
	   But the defeat of project backer Helmut Kohl by skeptic Gerhard
Schroeder in September's elections has thrown the memorial into
doubt. The new chancellor, Schroeder, wants to let parliament
decide how to proceed next year.
	   This month, his new culture chief, Michael Naumann, proposed
scrapping plans for a massive monument in favor of a Holocaust
museum, research center and memorial garden.
	   Schroeder has praised Naumann's idea as more educational, but
some German Jewish have criticized it as not powerful enough and as
an excuse not to have a memorial.
	   The chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Ignatz
Bubis, notes that Germany already has museums in former
concentration camps and a documentation center at the site of the
former SS and Gestapo headquarters in Berlin.
	   ``You can either build the memorial or don't build it, but one
shouldn't hide behind a museum,'' he told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung,
a Munich-based newspaper, in a weekend interview.
	   But one of Germany's best-known writers, Stefan Heym, spoke out
against a memorial in an interview in the new Der Spiegel
newsmagazine.
	   Referring to the leading design, a cemetery-like field of about
2,500 stone pillars, Heym said building it would ``create a giant
installation for dogs, who'll poop there.''
	   Heym, a Jew who fled the Nazis in 1933 and joined the U.S. Army,
suggested instead building a school ``where history can be
taught.''
	   Wiesenthal, a Nazi death camp survivor who leads the Jewish
Documentation Center in Vienna, Austria, did not make a specific
proposal.
	   ``That's a matter of feeling,'' he said. ``In any case nothing
out of stone. Jewish memorials were never out of stone or wood or
iron. They were out of paper. Our memorials are books, for example.
Not for nothing are we called the people of books.''

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Low oil prices will deepen Kuwait's projected net
deficit by about 200 million dinars (dlrs 662.25 million), the
finance minister told parliament Saturday.
	   The shortfall for fiscal 1998-99, which started July 1, is
estimated to be about 1.92 billion dinars (dlrs 6.35 billion).
	   It was based on oil revenues of dlrs 10 a barrel, but ``we have
to make our calculations at dlrs 8 a barrel if we are to be
realistic,'' the minister, Sheik Ali Salem al-Ali al-Sabah, told
the legislature.
	   The house was discussing economic reform and the effect of
sagging oil prices. Sales of crude oil are the backbone of the
economy of this small Gulf state.
	   The deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Sheik Sabah
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, warned ``the situation was serious and needed to
be remedied as soon as possible.''
	   He called on his countrymen to accept the growing need for
charging for some public services and cutting state subsidies on
others. Most lawmakers oppose such unpopular steps and demand the
government should first clamp down on wasteful spending and the
theft of public money.

Japanese doomsday cult trying to regroup, report says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese doomsday cult accused of a 1995 gas
attack on Tokyo subways is trying to regroup and recruit new
members, a news report said Saturday.
	   The Aum Shinri Kyo religious cult is one of several groups
monitored by Japan's Public Security Investigation Agency in a
report released Saturday, Kyodo News service said.
	   ``Aum is actively attempting to bring back former members and
recruiting new members on a nationwide basis, while initiating
advertising campaigns and acquiring necessary capital,'' Kyodo
quoted the report as saying.
	   The agency's report also discussed Japanese right-wing and
international terrorist groups, Kyodo said.
	   A top Aum member was sentenced to death in October for the
murder of a lawyer and his family. Other members including guru
Shoko Asahara are on trial for the subway attack, which killed a
dozen.

Deputy prime minister: Russia won't go hungry in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will not go hungry in 1999, and there will
be no food shortages in spite of Russia's agricultural crisis, a
top Russian official declared in an interview published Saturday.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik painted a grim picture of
decline in the agricultural sector. Prices of agricultural products
haven't kept pace with the astronomically rising prices of inputs
such as feed, energy and manure. Farmers have been forced to cut
back production, leading to shortages of domestically produced food
including meat.
	   ``If in 1990 we had about half a cow per person, now we have
one-quarter that number,'' Kulik told the Komsomolskaya Pravda
daily.
	   He said that the August financial crisis, which erupted when the
government defaulted on short-term debts and the ruble's value
plummeted, had only accelerated the nation's food-production
troubles. The cost of Russia's tremendous dependence on imported
food skyrocketed.
	   ``There couldn't be a stable situation when a huge country was
receiving grub from abroad, waving away its domestic producers,''
Kulik was quoted as saying. ``On the contrary, a powerful
agricultural sector stimulates development of the whole economy.''
	   Kulik said that the government had taken measures to ensure
there would not be food shortages in 1999. Its primary task is to
keep the food market running at the same level as in 1998, he said.
	   ``We're depending in part on growth in domestic production _ for
example, in poultry,'' he said.
	   The government has cut import taxes on meat, poultry feed and
edible oils to keep up food supplies, Kulik said. He added that
plans were being developed to support domestic producers, including
citizens who grow food on garden plots.

Defections by top leaders pull plug on dying Khmer Rouge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with king's response to Hun Sen in 8th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two leaders of the Khmer Rouge reign
of terror in the 1970s defected to the government Saturday in a
deal marking the death rattle of the bloodstained revolutionary
group but unlikely to bring them to justice.
	   Prime Minister Hun Sen said he personally negotiated the final
touches on the defections Friday night _ the 20th anniversary of
the Christmas 1978 invasion by Vietnam that toppled the genocidal
regime.
	   Khieu Samphan, long the nominal Khmer Rouge leader while others
held real power, and political chief Nuon Chea said in letters read
by Hun Sen on national radio that they wished to become ``ordinary
citizens.''
	   Hun Sen later brushed aside questions whether they would be
brought to trial for the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians,
indicating a deal had been struck allowing them to surrender in
exchange for not being tried.
	   ``We should not talk about any court,'' Hun Sen said. ``This is
a time when we should talk about reconciliation.''
	   The defections leave at large only one major Khmer Rouge figure,
the one-legged general Ta Mok, known as ``The Butcher,'' and fewer
than 100 die-hard loyalists. Om Yentieng, an aide to Hun Sen, said
that Ta Mok's arrest is still sought.
	   Hun Sen said in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he
``would like to warmly welcome the two'' in the interests of
``national reconstruction and peace.''
	   The king, who is in Beijing receiving medical treatment,
expressed his ``profound gratitude about this good news'' in a
response to the prime minister broadcast Saturday night on national
radio.
	   The defectors were key players in the Khmer Rouge's rule after
the Maoist revolutionaries won a civil war in 1975.
	   The Khmer Rouge emptied the cities and sent the populations to
agricultural labor camps in the countryside. Perhaps one Cambodian
in five died of overwork, disease, starvation and systematic
executions.
	   Cambodia's current leaders and the United States have said in
the past that they wanted Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea and Ta Mok
captured and tried for genocide and crimes against humanity.
	   Longtime Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot _ purged in a bloody power
struggle last year _ died of a purported heart attack in April
under house arrest by his ex-comrades.
	   A team of legal experts appointed by the United Nations visited
Cambodia last month to assess evidence for a possible international
tribunal. Local U.N. officials said the report was due to reach
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a few weeks.
	   Om Yentieng said the prime minister supports a tribunal but that
justice should be left to local courts _ woefully unequipped for
such a task.
	   Over the past two years, the government has adopted a policy of
negotiating de facto amnesty with Khmer Rouge leaders to persuade
them to end nearly two decades of stalemated civil war.
	   The strategy brought peace to large areas of Cambodia for the
first time in a generation, but means that none of the group's most
bloodstained chieftains has been taken into custody.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea have surfaced in Pailin in
Cambodia's rugged northwest. The area is controlled by one of their
old comrades, Pol Pot's brother-in-law Ieng Sary, the first Khmer
Rouge leader to make peace with the government.
	   Their letters said they had sealed their defection by telephone
Friday with Hun Sen, who formed a new government last month
expected to curb the political instability long exploited by the
Khmer Rouge.
	   ``I have no other request except a request to be allowed to live
as a simple citizen,'' Khieu Samphan wrote.
	   The defections come weeks after Khmer Rouge chief of staff Khem
Ngun and seven other generals surrendered. Khem Ngun said that
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea had not attached conditions to their
surrender.
	   In Thailand, which closely monitors Khmer Rouge activities, Maj.
Gen. Wiwat Sattarak, chief of the border task force, said that
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea moved to defect a month ago.
	   ``Ta Mok remains with a handful of loyalist troops willing to
die for him. There's no more than 100,'' Wiwat said. ``The
Cambodian government's attitude is to let him grow old and die by
himself, it's not worth the money to chase him.''
	   Youk Chhang, director of a Cambodian research center devoted to
gathering evidence against the Khmer Rouge, said Hun Sen risks
losing support from Cambodians if he prevents a trial.
	   ``With Nuon Chea, it is very clear he was involved in dealing
with security, prisoners and torture,'' Youk Chhang said. `Khieu
Samphan, however, was more involved in making government policy.''

Iraqi legislator says Arab nations must defy U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Arab states should break the U.N. sanctions
on Iraq which are inflicting ``great suffering'' on the Iraqi
people, the speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly said Saturday.
	   Speaking to reporters after arriving in Amman for an emergency
meeting of the Arab Parliamentary union, Saadoun Hammadi said he
hoped the session would produce a unified call for the lifting of
the sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``All Arab nations must lift the sanctions imposed on Iraq,'' he
said.
	   He said the meeting scheduled for Sunday was a ``reflection of
Arab masses' condemnation of the U.S.-British aggression on Iraq
and a demand for governments to break the embargo.''
	   Last week the United States and Britain carried out four nights
of air strikes on Iraq to punish the Baghdad government for its
alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The attacks were aimed at military and government targets. Iraq
says that 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were killed in the
bombardment.
	   Iraqi Cabinet ministers have often toured Middle Eastern
capitals to encourage Arab governments to defy the sanctions
regime. But so far no Middle Eastern state has done more than turn
a blind eye to smuggling into Iraq.
	   ``The embargo on Iraq has caused great suffering to the Iraqi
people,'' Hammadi said.
	   Eighteen out of the Parliamentary Union's 19 member-states are
due to send delegations to the meeting. Kuwait has said it will not
take part.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said it will not lift the
sanctions until Iraq proves to the U.N. inspectors it has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Holding candles and laying flowers in
the street, about 200 students held a Muslim prayer session
Saturday to commemorate the deaths of student protesters in clashes
last month with security forces.
	   It was the first student rally since the beginning a week ago of
the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. The activists ignored a pledge
by some student organizers to refrain from demonstrating during
Ramadan to avoid offending worshippers in predominately Muslim
Indonesia.
	   The mourners filed briefly into Jakarta's main thoroughfare
after holding a night prayer in the parking lot of Atma Jaya
Catholic University. The area was the scene of fighting on Nov. 13
between anti-riot officers and students that left nine people dead
and triggered rioting in several parts of Jakarta.
	   The students had been demonstrating against a government
assembly on political reforms, which they rejected because many of
its members were appointed by former President Suharto. The
authoritarian leader was ousted in May after 32 years in power.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, has implemented
some reforms and has scheduled parliamentary elections in June. But
he has not yielded to student demands to put Suharto on trial and
strip the military of its powerful political role.
	   ``We hope that the dead students are accepted by God and we
gather here in the hopes of avoiding more victims in the future,''
a student said in a speech at the university.
	   Other students knelt on prayer mats and intoned, ``God is
great.''

Italian sculptor, part of '30s movement, dies in Turin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Sandro Cherchi, a sculptor who was a founder
of an anti-fascist artistic movement in Italy in the 1930s, has
died in his home in Turin, Italian RAI state TV reported Saturday.
	   No cause of death was given for Cherchi, who was 87.
	   Born in Genoa in 1911, he moved to Milan in 1936, where, two
years later, he helped found, along with painter Renato Guttoso,
sculptor Giacomo Manzu, writer Ernesto Treccani and others, the
dynamic artistic and literary movement known as ``Corrente''
(Italian for current as well as for electricity).
	   Cherchi's scuptures included work in plastic. They were
exhibited at the Venice Biennale art exhibit in years 1948 through
1956. Among those holding works permanently of the artist is
Florence's Uffizi museum.
	   While considered to be in the abstract genre, his works
reflected a streak of realism as well.
	   Details on funeral arrangements and any survivors were not
immediately available.

Minority party chooses not to participate in 1999 election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERIC NURSE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ The minority National Democratic
Party will not contest the elections expected in early 1999, the
party's leader and sole member of Parliament announced Saturday.
	   In explaining his decision not to run, party leader Dr. Richie
Haynes cited a lack of resources and an inability to gain
additional seats or significantly affect the outcome of the vote.
	   The party, formed in 1989 by members disaffected with the
Democratic Labor Party, ``was not formed just to be another
power-seeking election machine, but as a party devoted to the
development and promotion of values,'' Haynes said.
	   ``This has been a very difficult decision, but the only
realistic one,'' he said.
	   Prime Minister Owen Arthur of the ruling Barbados Labor Party is
expected to announce the date for the election within days. Most
politicians in Barbados expect elections will come in the first
months of 1999.
	   Arthur's party holds 18 seats in Parliament while the opposition
Democratic Labor Party holds nine and Haynes holds the remaining
seat.
	   Polls indicate Arthur will win another term, and Haynes
concurred. ``It is clear the people of Barbados will give strong
support to the present government,'' he said.
	   University of the West Indies political science professor
Neville Duncan said Haynes' party did not have a credible shot at
becoming the main opposition party and was wise not to spend
limited resources on the election.
	   ``It was a sensible decision by Dr. Haynes and the NDP, given
the state of political play in Barbados today,'' said Duncan.
	   Haynes was finance minister for the Democratic party in the
1980s but broke away to form his own party in 1989.

Belarus opposition says merger agreement unconstitutional
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Opposition leaders accused President
Alexander Lukashenko of violating the Belarusian constitution by
agreeing to merge his country with Russia as early as next year.
	   President Boris Yeltsin and Lukashenko agreed in a Kremlin
meeting Friday to put the proposed merger up for public discussion
by mid-1999. Without waiting for popular approval, they will also
move early next year to introduce a single currency and harmonize
taxes, they said.
	   Members of the former elected parliament, which Lukashenko
dissolved two years ago, and opposition party leaders issued a
joint statement Saturday criticizing the Russian-Belarusian
agreement. They said that Lukashenko was motivated in part by a
desire to avoid national elections, which are scheduled for next
year.
	   ``Lukashenko is afraid of free elections. That's why he is going
to surrender our country's independence, in hopes of acquiring
supreme power in the united state,'' the statement said.
	   Mechislav Grib, a retired, high-ranking police officer and
former parliamentary speaker, said the agreement violated seven
articles of Belarus' constitution.
	   ``Lukashenko's actions are illegal, and the agreement in the
juridical sense is written in sand,'' Grib said.
	   Lukashenko, an admirer of the Soviet Union, has long pushed for
uniting his nation of 10 million people with Russia's 147 million
people. He and Yeltsin signed the first union agreement in 1996,
boosting political, economic and military ties between the two
nations, but stopping short of creating one state.
	   The two leaders have long pledged to take further integration
steps but have in fact done little. It remains unclear whether
Friday's agreements will be implemented, as many Russian
politicians oppose merging their already poor country with even
poorer Belarus.
	   Russian liberals and the West have assailed Lukashenko for his
crackdown on the opposition and the independent media. Russian
Communists and other hardliners publicly hail the proposed merger,
but tacitly oppose it, fearing that Lukashenko would push them to
the sidelines if he were to join Russia's presidential race in
2000.

Teeton Mill emulates Desert Orchid, One Man

Mill ahead and moved smoothly to away to make a tough race look
easy.
	   Imperial Call, winner of the Cheltenham Gold Cup two years ago,
was a long way back third with last season's King George runner up,

West Indies batsmen fail again in cricket match with South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with end of day's play
 &UR; AP Photos DUR101-103

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies batsmen failed to
grasp the initiative as South Africa dismissed them for 198 on the
first day of the third test at Kingsmead Saturday. At the close of
play, South Africa was on 46 without loss.
	   After glimpses of what might have been for the tourists if their
batsmen had knuckled down and played no-risk cricket, they ended up
losing their last five wickets for 42 runs in a poor display in the
hour after tea. Until then, South Africa's backup pace bowlers had
kept the West Indies in check, with Jacques Kallis and David
Terbrugge taking five between them as strike bowlers Allan Donald
and Shaun Pollock seemed unable to make the breakthrough although
Pollock was perhaps unlucky.
	   And then, towards the end of the innings it was the unlikely
bowling of captain Hansie Cronje which wrapped up the tail as he
took three wickets for 19 in his 4.1 overs. Ridley Jacobs (39) Rawl
Lewis (0) and Franklyn Rose (6) were his victims, and Curtly
Ambrose was run out by a direct hit from Jonty Rhodes.
	   South Africa saw out the final 16 overs of the day with Gary
Kirsten not out on 15, and Hershelle Gibbs on 26. With their
opening pair averaging just 15.1 in the last 19 test innings, and
passing 25 just once, this little cameo by Gibbs and Kirsten could
be very valuable for South Africa.
	   There was not too much to worry the South African batsmen,
although their entire stint at the crease was under floodlights.
Both teams agreed to this playing condition, something which has
been tried in South African domestic cricket with a degree of
success.
	   Captain Brian Lara scored only the West Indies second half
century in tests on the tour as he made 51 attractive runs before
falling to his second mistimed pull shot in as many innings for 51
to Terbrugge. Lara was understandably furious with himself, with
his dismissal being the fourth to a bad stroke in the innings.
	   South Africa's star strike bowler, Donald, and Lara had had a
fascinating duel earlier in the visitors' innings, with Lara coming
off the better of the two. While that battle raged, it looked as if
Lara was approaching his ominous best, but, at tea, the West Indies
were left with two inexperienced players at the crease in Darren
Ganga, not out on 24, and wicketkeeper Jacobs on 14.
	   Earlier, Carl Hooper had gone for 10 to an atrocious flash
outside the off stump off the bowling of Kallis easily the best of
the South African bowlers with three for 18.
	   With the West Indies using their ninth opening pair in 23 test
matches in Philo Wallace and retreaded wicketkeeper Junior Murray,
South African captain Cronje won the toss and sent the tourists in
to bat on a well-grassed pitch that looks likely to take turn as
the match progresses.
	   The West Indies are in a must-win situation, being two down in
the five-match series, and have made five changes to the team which
was beaten inside three days in the last match in Port Elizabeth.
In addition to Murray and Wallace, who returns after illness,
19-year-old Ganga makes his debut, leg spinner Lewis returns, and
Franklyn Rose is included in place of Nixon McLean.
	   After putting on 50, the opening pair fell in quick succession,
Wallace falling to a poor shot to Kallis for 21, and Murray being
trapped in front by Terbrugge just two runs later for 29. It seemed
as if all the good work was to be undone when the form man,
Shivnarine Chanderpaul, succumbed to the wiles of Kallis and an
uncharacteristically injudicious shot for four.
	   At lunch, Lara was not out on 10, and Hooper on two. There were
glimmerings of some Lara form early on, after he survived a snorter
of an opening delivery from Terbrugge which could have had him
trapped in front had it not been called a no-ball. He flicked
Donald off his hip for a lovely legside boundary, and then stroked
him through the covers gloriously just before lunch.
	   Play resumes at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) Sunday.

Dortmund gets Inter keeper Jens Lehmann
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DORTMUND, Germany (AP) _ Borussia Dortmund announced Saturday
the Bundesliga club has ended months of effort by finally getting
Inter Milan keeper Jens Lehmann.
	   The German international, a backup at the Italian club, will
transfer for 7 million marks (dlrs 4.3 million) and sign a
three-year contract.
	   Lehmann replaces his national team rival Stefan Klos, who agreed
to terms with the Glasgow Rangers shortly before Christmas.
	   The 29-year-old Lehmann stayed in Italy just four months after
transferring over the summer from Schalke, where he was one of the
heroes in the German club's 1997 UEFA Cup triumph.
	   Lehmann chafed over being benched in favor of Sebastiano Rossi
at Inter after just a few matches.
	   ``I can't take it anymore. I'm not willing to have an existence
as Rossi' subsitute,'' Lehmann told the German sports agnecy SID.
	   Veteran defender Juergen Kohler, another former Serie A player,
extended his contract at Dortmund another year until June 30, 2000.

Minority party chooses not to participate in 1999 election

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ The leader of the minority National
Democratic Party and its sole member of Parliament said Saturday he
won't run in upcoming elections.
	   Dr. Richie Haynes cited a lack of resources and an inability to
gain additional seats or significantly affect the outcome of the
vote.
	   The party, formed in 1989 by members disaffected with the
Democratic Labor Party, ``was not formed just to be another
power-seeking election machine, but as a party devoted to the
development and promotion of values,'' Haynes said.
	   Prime Minister Owen Arthur of the ruling Barbados Labor Party is
expected to announce the date for the 1999 election within days.
	   Arthur's party holds 18 seats in Parliament while the opposition
Democratic Labor Party holds nine. Haynes holds the remaining seat.
	   Polls indicate Arthur will win another term, and Haynes
concurred. ``It is clear the people of Barbados will give strong
support to the present government,'' he said.
	   University of the West Indies political science professor
Neville Duncan said Haynes' party didn't have a credible shot at
becoming the main opposition party and was wise not to spend
limited resources on the election.
	   Haynes was finance minister for the Democratic party in the
1980s but broke away to form his own party in 1989.

	   LAPASTICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fleeing fighting in northern
Kosovo, Kosovo's newest refugees congregated in a regional ethnic
Albanian guerrilla stronghold on Saturday, crowding into houses by
the dozens to escape bitterly cold weather.
	   Most of the hundreds of refugees in the area west of Podujevo
made their way to Lapastica, a village still held by the Kosovo
Liberation Army after a two-day crackdown by Serb police and
Yugoslav army units.
	   A Serb farmer was killed west of Podujevo by the guerrillas on
Saturday, said members of the Organization of Security and
Cooperation team monitoring Kosovo developments. Albanian sources
reported a police attack in the same region.
	   Otherwise, the province was reported calm in the wake of two
days of fierce fighting in the Podujevo area that threatened to
unravel an already shaky de-facto truce reached Oct. 12.
	   Several villages were in the region were destroyed, and
abandoned by inhabitants who often fled on foot as they sought
shelter elsewhere in temperatures that plummeted to - 20 C. ( - 4
F) overnight. In a typical scene in Lapastica, one room of 20
square meters (yards) sheltered more than 60 refugees.
	   ``It's a shame that we have to beg for food and beds,'' said one
of the refugees, who asked for anonymity.
	   The farmer was killed in his home in Obranca village, some 30
kilometers (about 20 miles) north of the province's capital
Pristina, by the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation army, the rebel
force that controls much of the area, the government-run Media
Center said.
	   The Kosovo information Center, close to ethnic Albanian
pro-independence leaders, said that shortly before noon, Serb
police approached the Obranca village and opened fire on nearby KLA
positions.
	   The reports came after Serb and Yugoslav forces launched an
offensive in the region on Thursday, reportedly killing at least
nine people. The crackdown posed the gravest threat yet to the Oct.
12 agreement that halted months of violence between Serbs and
guerrillas trying to gain Kosovo's independence.
	   William Walker, head of an international force monitoring the
Kosovo situation, said the newest fighting had led to the ``tensest
period since the agreement was signed.''
	   The United States, France and the European Union have warned
both sides not to continue the violence. Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov on Friday cautioned the West against using force to
halt the latest violence.
	   In October, NATO threatened airstrikes against the Serbs as
punishment for their crackdown begun last February, in which
hundreds died and some 300,000 were forced to flee their homes. The
NATO attacks were put on hold after a cease-fire was reached and
Milosevic pulled out some of his forces.
	   In Belgrade, meanwhile, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
consolidated his support among the military by appointing loyalists
to senior positions and promoting others who did his bidding in
Kosovo during a prolonged anti-guerrilla campaign that preceded the
Oct. 12 agreement.
	   The daily Politika said Lt.-Gen. Spasoje Smiljanic was appointed
commander of the air force, a position that had been vacated in
October when the former air force chief was deposed.
	   Milosevic also promoted seven generals, including three who were
involved in the Yugoslav army campaign against Kosovo's separatist
Albanian guerillas this year.
	   A commander of the army corps in provincial capital Pristina was
moved up to head a regional section of the Yugoslav army, while a
former chief of special forces in Kosovo was made his aide.
	   Another loyalist was appointed new commander in the region of
Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
	   Milosevic also relieved three high-ranking army officers of
their duties but it was not immediately clear whether they were
purged for suspected disloyalty.
	   Last month's ouster of the former army chief, Gen. Momcilo
Perisic, was a result of his opposition both to the neo-communist
party run by Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, and of Milosevic's
hard-line stand on Kosovo.
	   There had also been growing rumors in Belgrade that the ruling
couple feared a coup attempt by Perisic and the secret police
chief, the second most powerful man in Yugoslavia, whom Milosevic
dismissed earlier in November.

Rebels claim 60 killed; Freetown prepares for attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY &QC;

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Fearing an impending rebel assault
on Sierra Leone's capital, angry residents surged through the
streets Saturday and sought out mob justice against least two men
accused of being rebel spies.
	   The rebel Revolutionary United Front, meanwhile, reported they
had killed 60 Nigerian soldiers belonging to the West African
intervention force known as ECOMOG while capturing the town of
Makeni. On Saturday the rebels dragged the bodies through the
streets with an armored car ``as an example to everyone,'' rebel
Gen. Sam Bockarie said. His claims could not be independently
confirmed.
	   The government bolstered Freetown's defenses by trucking in
traditional militiamen known as Kamajors from rural villages and
flying in soldiers from Nigeria and Ghana to reinforce ECOMOG
troops.
	   Chanting marchers thronged through a downtown square in the
capital where government officials addressed them calling for calm,
before the mob singled out two young men accused of being rebels in
civilian disguise.
	   The victims were severely beaten before the crowd thrust
gasoline-filled tires around their necks and set them alight. Their
charred remains were carried away by police, who did not attempt to
stop the killings.
	   Several other mob attacks were reported around Freetown but
could not be confirmed.
	   The Kamajor militiamen, members of a secret society of hunters
and traditional fighters, wore leather tunics and carried rusty
guns and machetes in the bustling city streets, setting up
checkpoints and carrying out random searches of pedestrians and
drivers.
	   Together with ECOMOG, the militia has been given defense duties
by Sierra Leone's government which dissolved the country's
rebellious military earlier this year.
	   Remnants of that military and their rebel allies who took power
for a 10 month period following a bloody May 1997 coup have over
the past week launched lightning attacks against loyalist forces
throughout the country.
	   Refugees fleeing the fighting have flooded into Freetown and
rebels have threatened to attack the capital unless the government
releases their imprisoned leader, Foday Sankoh, who is awaiting an
appeal on a death sentence handed down for treason.
	   On Saturday, Bockarie, one of the rebels' top generals, demanded
that Sierra Leone's President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah resign or the
rebels would storm and capture Freetown before the New Year.
	   ``Failure of Kabbah to resign, and we will start bombarding
Freetown and will not stop until victory is won,'' Bockarie told
The Associated Press.
	   That was a change from a day earlier when Bockarie demanded only
talks and Sankoh's release, or rebels would attack on New Year's
Day.
	   By late Friday a British-led evacuation had airlifted to 100
foreigners, mostly Britons, from Freetown to London and Senegal's
capital of Dakar. Many British citizens were expected to remain in
Freetown for the time being, a High Commission official said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The U.S. Embassy was expected to close soon, although only a
handful of staff were in the country and most Americans have been
advised to stay out of Sierra Leone for security reasons since
1997.
	   United Nations observer mission has withdrawn some of its
military observers in the interior to Freetown while non-essential
staff were evacuated to neighboring Guinea.
	   In a state radio broadcast, President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's
government condemned the British airlift, saying it played into
rebel designs to spread panic.
	   The rebels are widely believed to have killed, maimed and raped
thousands of unarmed villagers in a revenge campaign against the
government aimed to spreading fear among the country's civilian
population.

	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Prime Minister Owen Arthur called
elections for Jan. 20, 1999, the earliest date possible.
	   Arthur announced the elections Saturday in a radio address after
meeting with Governor General Sir Clifford Husbands.
	   Politicians of all three parties had expected Arthur to call
elections within the next few days at the latest.
	   ``The calling of elections is not a surprise and the nation is
ready,'' Arthur said in his brief comments.
	   Earlier Saturday, the leader of the minority National Democratic
Party announced it will not contest the elections.
	   In explaining his decision not to run, party leader Dr. Richie
Haynes cited a lack of resources and an inability to gain
additional seats or significantly affect the outcome of the vote.
Haynes is the party's sole member of Parliament.
	   The party, formed in 1989 by members disaffected with the
Democratic Labor Party, ``was not formed just to be another
power-seeking election machine, but as a party devoted to the
development and promotion of values,'' Haynes said.
	   With the economy in good shape, Arthur is expected to return for
another term as prime minister. His Barbados Labor Party currently
holds 18 seats while the opposition Democratic Labor Party holds
nine and Haynes fills the remaining seat.
	   Polls show Arthur's party leading and Haynes concurred. ``It is
clear the people of Barbados will give strong support to the
present government,'' he said.
	   University of the West Indies political science professor
Neville Duncan said Haynes' party did not have a credible shot at
becoming the main opposition party and was wise not to spend

	   ``It was a sensible decision by Dr. Haynes and the NDP, given
the state of political play in Barbados today,'' said Duncan.
	   Haynes was finance minister for the Democratic party in the
1980s but broke away to form his own party in 1989.

Leftist terrorist pardoned by Italian president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A convicted Italian terrorist has left prison after
a Christmas Eve pardon by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Italian
news reports said Saturday.
	   Giorgio Panizzari had served 28 years of a life sentence for
terrorism. He was one of the founders of the leftist terrorist
organization Armed Proletarian Nuclei, one of several domestic
terror groups that operated in Italy in the late 1960s, the 1970s
and early 1980s.
	   Among the crimes he claimed was the kidnapping of a judge. He
was one of the inmates the Red Brigades terrorist group tried in
vain to have freed in exchange for former Christian Democrat
Premier Aldo Moro, kidnapped in 1978. Moro was killed later that
year by his Red Brigades captors.
	   Italian heads of state occasionally issue pardons at holiday
time. Last year, Scalfaro pardoned six terrorists, five of them
leftists and the other a rightwing extremist.

Congolese rebels, Kabila meet Gadhafi in Tripoli

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Congolese President Laurent Kabila and the
rebels fighting to oust him on Saturday were in the Libyan capital,
Tripoli, where their host Moammar Gadhafi was acting as a peace
mediator in Congo's five-month war.
	   It wasn't immediately clear if Kabila met face-to-face with the
rebel leaders, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba and Bizima Karaha, although a
rebel source said the two sides were expected to engage in a series
of ``discrete'' meetings.
	   So far, Kabila's repeated refusal to meet the rebels has
torpedoed efforts to broker a cease-fire and open political
negotiations in Congo. Earlier in the week, African negotiators
postponed another round of peace talks originally scheduled for
Dec. 27-28 in Lusaka, Zambia.
	   Kabila is demanding the withdrawal from Congo of troops from
Rwanda and Uganda, who have supported the rebels since they took up
arms in August accusing Kabila of mismanagement, corruption and
ethnic warmongering. Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent
troops and arms on the government side.
	   The war appears headed for a stalemate in the vast Congolese
forests dotted by rivers and swamps where the Rwandan-backed rebels
took control of much of eastern Congo but faced resistance from
government-allied troops and aircraft.
	   A peace plan put forward by the Organization of African Unity
includes a cease-fire, withdrawal of foreign forces and talks on
the future of Congo.
	   Little was known about the meetings in Tripoli and officials on
both sides remained tightlipped.
	   Libyan TV on Friday reported on Kabila's arrival on Friday night
and a meeting with Gadhafi. It quoted Kabila as thanking Gadhafi
for his continuous efforts to contact ``all the parties to the
conflict in Congo with a view to reaching a peaceful solution to
this issue within an African framework.''
	   Gadhafi has supported Kabila and, according to Chadian press
reports, bankrolled the involvement of Chadian troops fighting on
Kabila's behalf in northern Congo.
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected Congolese
soldiers and opposition politicians _ have in principle agreed to a
cease-fire but only if negotiated directly with Kabila.
	   Kabila, however, has maintained he is the victim of an outside
aggression and says he can negotiate only with Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Both countries, which installed Kabila in power in May 1997
after ousting former longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, say they
will keep their troops in Congo as long as their security is
threatened.
	   Uganda and Rwanda accuse the Congolese president of enlisting
thousands of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels with bases eastern Congo.

Albanian premier's baby flown to Greece for treatment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The prematurely-born baby of Albanian
Premier Pandeli Majko was due to be flown to Greece for treatment
Saturday because of poor medical facilities in Albania, news
reports said.
	   The baby boy, born one month premature on Friday, was to be
transported to Athens on a Greek military transport plane,
accompanied by Majko's 28-year-old wife, the reports said.
	   Doctors said the baby suffered a respiratory infection and that
his condition was stable.
	   Hospitals in Albania, Europe's poorest country, lack many basic
facilities.
	   Majko, a 30-year-old senior official of the governing Socialist
party, became premier three months ago after his predecessor, Fatos
Nano, resigned amid political turmoil.

Iraq says allied aircraft attacked air defense unit

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Saturday that ``enemy'' planes
flying from the airspace of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia had attacked an
Iraqi anti-aircraft unit and were driven off.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency did not identify the nationality
of the aircraft, but it usually uses the word ``enemy'' for the
United States and Britain. Some U.S. warplanes are based in Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, and Britain also stations aircraft in Kuwait.
	   The agency said that at 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT) a formation of
warplanes ``attacked one of our air defense sites, which confronted
it and forced it to drop its load randomly.''
	   The report did not say where the apparent attack took place and
gave no other details.
	   In Washington, U.S. National Security Council spokesman P. J.
Crowley said that while American aircraft did fly over Iraq on
Saturday, ``they reported no incidents of fire directed against
them.
	   ``One aircraft reported anti-aircraft fire well off in the
distance, but it was not directed at them,'' Crowley said.
Referring to British and French planes, which help patrol ``no-fly
zones'' over Iraq, he said: ``We have no reports of any incidents
against coalition aircraft.''
	   Saturday's report was the second such incident reported by the
Iraqi News Agency since the United States and Britain began four
days of air attacks against Iraq on Dec. 16 in a bid to punish
Baghdad for its alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The attacks were aimed at military and government targets. Iraq
says that 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were killed in the
bombardment.
	   The news agency reported on Tuesday that U.S. and British
aircraft fired two ``stray missiles'' near the southern city of
Basra. U.S. and British officials denied their planes were involved
in any such incident.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Saturday that ``enemy'' planes
flying from the airspace of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia had attacked an
Iraqi anti-aircraft unit and were driven off.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency did not identify the nationality
of the aircraft, but it usually uses the word ``enemy'' for the
United States and Britain. Some U.S. warplanes are based in Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, and Britain also stations aircraft in Kuwait.
	   The agency said that at 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT) a formation of
warplanes ``attacked one of our air defense sites, which confronted
it and forced it to drop its load randomly.''
	   The report did not say where the apparent attack took place and
gave no other details.
	   In Washington, U.S. National Security Council spokesman P. J.
Crowley said that while American aircraft did fly over Iraq on
Saturday, ``they reported no incidents of fire directed against
them.
	   ``One aircraft reported anti-aircraft fire well off in the
distance, but it was not directed at them,'' Crowley said.
Referring to British and French planes, which help Washington
patrol ``no-fly zones'' over Iraq, he said: ``We have no reports of
any incidents against coalition aircraft.''
	   Saturday's report was the second such incident reported by the
Iraqi News Agency since the United States and Britain began four
days of air attacks against Iraq on Dec. 16 in a bid to punish
Baghdad for its alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The attacks were aimed at military and government targets. Iraq
says that 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were killed in the
bombardment.
	   The news agency reported on Tuesday that U.S. and British
aircraft fired two ``stray missiles'' near the southern city of
Basra. U.S. and British officials denied their planes were involved
in any such incident.

Angolans in Kuito venture onto the streets amid rebel shelling on
</HEADLINE>
outskirts &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ People ventured out onto the streets of
Kuito on Saturday, avoiding the northern side of the besieged
Angolan city targeted by rebel artillery for a second day, a Roman
Catholic bishop said.
	   ``Today's a sunny day ... and people have come out for a walk,''
Bishop Jose Nambi said by phone from Kuito. ``They're taking the
risk.''
	   His voice was cheerful despite the tension in the central
highland city which has been the center of fighting between UNITA
rebels and the Angolan army for nearly a month.
	   Both sides have launched intense attacks throughout the central
highlands of the vast southwest African country for the past three
weeks, undermining a 1994 U.N.-brokered peace accord aimed at
ending a two-decade civil war.
	   Rebels on Saturday targeted the village of Cunji, overlooking
the northern outskirts of Kuito, which lies some 500 kilometers
(310 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda, Bishop Nambi said.
	   ``Yesterday and the day before we had serious problems,'' the
bishop said, referring to the heaviest rebel attack on Kuito in two
weeks in which thirty people were killed and 37 wounded.
	   Kuito's hospital, Bishop Nambi said, was functioning with hardly
any medicine and nurses and volunteers were taking in newly wounded
people, mostly civilians, every day.
	   Observers fear a humanitarian crisis as stocks run low. Relief
agencies have stopped flying to Kuito because the airport has been
targeted by rebel artillery to prevent the government sending in
reinforcements.
	   ``It's very tough for the displaced in terms of food. They left
everything behind, and there isn't enough medicine, or blankets to
go round,'' the bishop said.
	   The seminary where Bishop Nambi was speaking from has served as
shelter for part of the 30,000 displaced people that have poured
into Kuito. People have also taken refuge in the hospital, in
churches, abandoned houses, or simply under street balconies.
	   The November-April rainy season has also worsened the plight of
the some 130,000 people now in the city.
	   Kuito was reduced to rubble in a brutal year-long siege until
government forces ousted UNITA rebels in 1994, prior to the
U.N-brokered pact.
	   That period of war came after UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
rejected his defeat in the country's first elections in 1992, which
both sides had agreed to in a previous peace agreement the year
before.
	   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ began fighting against President Jose Eduardo dos Santos' ruling
MPLA party after the country's 1975 independence from Portugal.
	   The 1994 U.N.-brokered pact required UNITA to disarm and hand
over control of almost half the country of 10 million people to the
government.
	   UNITA claimed it had disarmed and demobilized its forces, under
U.N. supervision, over the past four years.
	   However, the rebels are estimated to have about 30,000 guerrilla
soldiers hidden in the bush, compared with the government's
100,000-strong army.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with prime minister calling elections for Jan. 20;

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Prime Minister Owen Arthur on
Saturday set Jan. 20 as the date for elections he is expected to
win _ the earliest possible date.
	   ``The calling of elections is not a surprise and the nation is
ready,'' Arthur said in a radio address after meeting with Governor
General Sir Clifford Husbands.
	   Earlier Saturday, the leader of the minority National Democratic
Party and its sole member of Parliament said the party won't
contest the elections. Dr. Richie Haynes cited a lack of resources
and an inability to gain additional seats or significantly affect
the outcome of the vote.
	   The party, formed in 1989 by members disaffected with the
Democratic Labor Party, ``was not formed just to be another
power-seeking election machine, but as a party devoted to the
development and promotion of values,'' Haynes said.
	   With the economy in good shape, Arthur is expected to return for
another term as prime minister. His Barbados Labor Party currently
holds 18 seats while the opposition Democratic Labor Party holds
nine with Haynes filling the remaining seat.
	   Polls show Arthur's party leading and Haynes concurred. ``It is
clear the people of Barbados will give strong support to the
present government,'' he said.
	   University of the West Indies political science professor
Neville Duncan said Haynes' party did not have a credible shot at
becoming the main opposition party and was wise not to spend
limited resources on the election.
	   Haynes was finance minister for the Democratic party in the
1980s but broke away to form his own party in 1989.

Chelsea downed Saints to go temporarily top while Reds down Forest
</HEADLINE>
3-0 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Unbeaten since the opening day of the season,
Chelsea returned to the top of the Premier League with a 2-0
victory at struggling Southampton on Saturday although Aston Villa
had the chance to regain top place by beating Blackburn in an
evening match.
	   Norwegian striker Tore Andre Flo and Uruguayan midfielder
Gustavo Poyet scored the Blues' goals at The Dell. The result means
that Gianluca Vialli's team is unbeaten in 18 Premier League games
in a row.
	   Chelsea moved to the top on goal difference but Villa, which
kicked off six hours later, would regain its three-point lead by
winning at Blackburn.
	   After six games without a win, Manchester United revived its
title chances with a 3-0 win over last place Nottingham Forest at
Old Trafford.
	   Norwegian defender Ronny Johnsen scored the first two and Ryan
Giggs added the other.
	   Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson were together on the Newcastle
lineup for the first time since last month's arrival of Ferguson
from Everton had set up a 22 million pound (dlrs 36.74 million)
strikeforce.
	   But the Magpies tumbled 3-0 at home to fourth place Leeds, who
netted through Australian striker Harry Kewell, Lee Bowyer and
Dutch striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink despite having several
players missing through injury.
	   Ian Wright returned to Highbury as a West Ham player but his new
team went down 1-0 after an early strike by the Gunners' Dutch
winger Marc Overmars to move up to fifth.
	   Liverpool ended Middlesbrough's nine-game unbeaten home record
by scoring a 3-1 win at the Riverside stadium with goals by Jamie
Carragher, Jamie Redknapp and Vegard Heggem. Brian Deane replied
for Boro from Paul Gascoigne's free kick but Bryan Robson's team
slipped to sixth.
	   A first half goal by veteran Tony Cottee earned Leicester a 1-0
win at Sheffield Wednesday while Everton and Derby ground out a 0-0
tie at Goodison Park.
	   Charlton, sliding down towards the relegation zone, went ahead
through Neal Redfearn's curling 25-meter shot at Selhurst Park but
Wimbledon hit back through Jason Euell and Michael Hughes for a 2-1
win.
	   All 20 teams will be in action on Monday or Tuesday before
getting involved in FA Cup games Jan. 2-3.
	   Division One leader Sunderland, which had an 11-point lead last
weekend, had that cut to five after losing 1-0 at Sunderland.
Second place Ipswich crushed Portsmouth 3-0.
	   Scottish Premier League leader Rangers struggled to a 1-0
victory over St. Johnstone while second place Kilmarnock, three
points behind, edged Hearts 1-0. Defending titlist Celtic, 10
points behind its Glasgow rival, visits Dundee on Sunday.
	   Scottish World Cup center-back Colin Hendry was sent off for
deliberate handball in the area but St. Johnstone's John O'Neil
fired the ensuing penalty kick against the bar and Rangers clinched
the three points through a goal by Italian defender Sergio Porrini
19 minutes from the end.

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Fearing an impending rebel
assault, the government bolstered the capital's defenses Saturday
while enraged residents surged through the streets, burning alive
two accused rebel spies.
	   The rebel Revolutionary United Front, meanwhile, reported they
had killed 60 Nigerian soldiers belonging to the West African
intervention force known as ECOMOG while capturing the town of
Makeni. On Saturday the rebels dragged the bodies through the
streets with an armored car ``as an example to everyone,'' rebel
Gen. Sam Bockarie said. His claims could not be independently
confirmed.
	   Hundreds of traditional militiamen known as Kamajors were being
trucked into Freetown from rural villages. Soldiers from Nigeria
and Ghana were flown in to reinforce ECOMOG troops defending Sierra
Leone's government.
	   The government denied Makeni's capture and said ECOMOG forces
continued to battle rebels for the town. In a written statement,
the Information Ministry accused journalists of ``allowing the
rebels to use them as propaganda tools.'' Pro-government forces had
put ``severe pressure'' on rebel bases in recent days and remained
firmly in control of the country, the statement said.
	   Chanting marchers thronged through a downtown square in the
capital where government officials addressed them calling for calm,
before the mob singled out two young men accused of being rebels in
civilian disguise.
	   The victims were severely beaten before the crowd thrust
gasoline-filled tires around their necks and set them alight. Their
charred remains were carried away by police, who did not attempt to
stop the killings.
	   Several other mob attacks were reported around Freetown but
could not be confirmed.
	   The Kamajor militiamen, members of a secret society of hunters
and traditional fighters, wore leather tunics and carried rusty
guns and machetes in the bustling city streets, setting up
checkpoints and carrying out random searches of pedestrians and
drivers.
	   Together with ECOMOG, the militia has been given defense duties
by Sierra Leone's government which dissolved the country's
rebellious military earlier this year.
	   Remnants of that military and their rebel allies who took power
for a 10 month period following a bloody May 1997 coup have over
the past week launched lightning attacks against loyalist forces
throughout the country.
	   Refugees fleeing the fighting have flooded into Freetown and
rebels have threatened to attack the capital unless the government
releases their imprisoned leader, Foday Sankoh, who is awaiting an
appeal on a death sentence handed down for treason.
	   On Saturday, Bockarie, one of the rebels' top generals, demanded
that Sierra Leone's President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah resign or the
rebels would storm and capture Freetown before the New Year.
	   ``Failure of Kabbah to resign, and we will start bombarding
Freetown and will not stop until victory is won,'' Bockarie told
The Associated Press.
	   That was a change from a day earlier when Bockarie demanded only
talks and Sankoh's release, or rebels would attack on New Year's
Day.
	   By late Friday a British-led evacuation had airlifted about 100
foreigners, mostly Britons, from Freetown to London and Senegal's
capital of Dakar. Many British citizens were expected to remain in
Freetown for the time being, a High Commission official said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The U.S. Embassy was expected to close soon, although only a
handful of staff were in the country and most Americans have been
advised to stay out of Sierra Leone for security reasons since
1997.
	   United Nations observer mission has withdrawn some of its
military observers in the interior to Freetown while non-essential
staff were evacuated to neighboring Guinea.
	   In a state radio broadcast, President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's
government condemned the British airlift, saying it played into
rebel designs to spread panic.
	   The rebels are widely believed to have killed, maimed and raped
thousands of unarmed villagers in a revenge campaign against the
government aimed to spreading fear among the country's civilian
population.

Iraq says allied aircraft attacked air defense unit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that incident is second since attacks ended, sted

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Saturday that ``enemy'' planes
flying from the airspace of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia had attacked an
Iraqi anti-aircraft unit and were driven off.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency did not identify the nationality
of the aircraft, but it usually uses the word ``enemy'' for the
United States and Britain. Some U.S. warplanes are based in Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, and Britain also stations aircraft in Kuwait.
	   The agency said that at 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT) a formation of
warplanes ``attacked one of our air defense sites, which confronted
it and forced it to drop its load randomly.''
	   The report did not say where the apparent attack took place and
gave no other details.
	   In Washington, U.S. National Security Council spokesman P. J.
Crowley said that while American aircraft did fly over Iraq on
Saturday, ``they reported no incidents of fire directed against
them.
	   ``One aircraft reported anti-aircraft fire well off in the
distance, but it was not directed at them,'' Crowley said.
Referring to British and French planes, which help patrol ``no-fly
zones'' over Iraq, he said: ``We have no reports of any incidents
against coalition aircraft.''
	   Saturday's report was the second such incident reported by the
Iraqi News Agency since the United States and Britain ended four
days of air attacks against Iraq on Dec. 19 in a bid to punish
Baghdad for its alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The attacks were aimed at military and government targets. Iraq
says that 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were killed in the
bombardment.
	   The news agency reported on Tuesday that U.S. and British
aircraft fired two ``stray missiles'' near the southern city of
Basra. U.S. and British officials denied their planes were involved
in any such incident.

Poles complain new penal code is too lenient

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ When legislators began rewriting Poland's
penal code to replace a 1969 communist-era law, Poles thought the
result would be less crime and speedier justice.
	   But the new system that took effect in September has raised
complaints among judges, police, the news media and the public that
it favors criminals by reducing prison terms and eliminating
capital punishment.
	   ``The defenders of the new code assure they want to fight the
rising crime, but they promote provisions that allow criminals to
leave prison early,'' said Robert Sichulski, a construction
engineer.
	   Opinion polls find increasing support for bringing back the
death penalty, which was suspended in 1989 and left out of the new
code.
	   ``Can our strapped state afford to board convicts for a
lifetime?'' asked Alicja Frackiewicz, a housewife.
	   The unhappiness reflects the general difficulties of the
economic and social changes in the nine years since communist rule
was toppled and Poland shifted to a multiparty democracy and market
economy.
	   Gone are the staples of the communist system, including
guaranteed employment, free education and health care, along with
the pervasive police and military presence that limited personal
freedom while preventing much street crime.
	   With high unemployment, rising costs and fewer police patrols,
crime has increased in recent years in most categories. Police say
1,038 murders were recorded in the first 11 months of 1998,
compared to 971 in all of 1991.
	   The old penal code enacted by communist rulers targeted
political dissenters and secured a surface stability by banning
demonstrations and rallies, except for official May Day parades.
	   New freedom and opportunity have produced new kinds of crime _
gangs that require new members to murder for their initiation;
widespread auto theft; robberies; burglaries.
	   The new law, drawn up by criminal justice professors and legal
experts, was intended to reduce police bureaucracy and simplify
judicial procedures in a country where an average case takes 2 1/2
years to complete.
	   One change avoids a trial if the defendant confesses and agrees
to a penalty chosen by the judge. Crimes have been subdivided into
categories, according to the circumstances of the case, with
precise penalties for conviction.
	   ``The sanctions are more flexible. There is a choice between a
fine or prison in many cases,'' said Barbara Makosa-Stepkowska,
spokeswoman for the Justice Ministry. ``The judges are given wide
possibilities and a greater credit of trust.''
	   But Judge Barbara Piwnik, a 16-year veteran, called the system
too rigid and said it ``strikes with a lack of trust in the
judges,'' who know what works and what doesn't.
	   ``If I am told that homicide is from eight years to life
imprisonment, but when a dangerous tool was used it is from 12
years up, is that a sign of trust in my knowledge and life
experience?'' she asked.
	   Piwnik complains that maximum sentences for some serious crimes
were reduced, such as the new 12-year limit for a gang rape, from
15 years previously. She also dislikes the new obligation to reduce
the sentence of convicts who aid investigators.
	   In a recent case, Judge Malgorzata Mojkowska expressed
frustration in giving a 15-year sentence to one member of a group
of young people who killed a teen-ager, while the others got life
terms. The one with the shorter sentence helped police.
	   She was required to be lenient, but realized that ``cooperation
with the police will not atone for the injuries,'' the judge said
in handing down the sentence.
	   Makosa-Stepkowska, the Justice Ministry spokeswoman, said lesser
penalties like that will result in more criminals being brought to
justice by turning criminals against each other.
	   Tadeusz de Virion, a lawyer who defended opposition figures
during the communist era, considers the new penal code a ``return
to normalcy.''
	   ``The judge's heart, intellect and knowledge are the foundations
of a good justice system,'' he said. ``A wise, compassionate judge
will hand just verdicts even if the code is not of prime quality.''
	   De Virion said police presence, not a penal code, is the best
weapon against street crime.
	   But police spokesman Pawel Biedziak argued the opposite.
	   ``Why are perpetrators hiding from us?'' he asked. ``Because
they fear long prison terms.''

	   Details of English Premier League games:
 &UR; Arsenal 1 West Ham 0 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Marc Overmars scored the only goal of the game after eight
minutes, beating two players on the left and cutting inside before
shooting home from just inside the area. Ian Wright, playing
against Arsenal for the first time since his move to West Ham, had
few chances to shine as the Gunners dominated.
 &UR; Coventry 1 Tottenham 1 (0-1) &QC; 
	   Defender Sol Campbell turned the ball home in the 17th minute
after Les Ferdinand had touched on a corner by Darren Anderton.
John Aloisi came off the bench 16 minutes from the end to score the
equalizer in the 81st.
 &UR; Everton 0 Derby 0 &QC; 
	   Everton made it six goal-less draws out of 10 home games in the
Premier League this season. Derby's Estonian goalkeeper, Mort Poom,
fumbled a 20-meter free kick from Olivier Decourt and then
recovered to dive at the feet of Danny Cadamarteri. And Everton's
Norwegian 'keeper Thomas Myhre cleared the ball straight to Derby's
Jacob Laursen while well off his line and was glad to see the Dane
miss an empty net from 35 meters.
 &UR; Manchester United 3 Nottingham Forest 0 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Ronny Johnsen gave United a 28th minute lead with a header from
David Beckham's corner. Johnsen made it 2-0 with a close range shot
in the 59th minute after Henning Berg had headed across the face of
the goal. Three minutes later it was 3-0 when Ryan Giggs lobbed the
ball over Forest 'keeper David Beasant from Paul Scholes' pass.
Forest, without suspended striker Pierre van Hooijdonk, tied its
worst of 16 Premier League games without a win.
 &UR; Middlesbrough 1 Liverpool 3 (1-2) &QC; 
	   Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher slid the ball home in a
scramble in front of goal in the 17th minute after Paul Ince had
headed on a corner. Brian Deane leveled in the 32nd minute from
Paul Gascoigne's well-placed free kick. Liverpool regained the lead
through Jamie Redknapp after a short free kick inside the box in
the 35th minute. It was awarded when Boro goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer
was forced to handle a poor back pass from Gary Pallister. Vegard
Heggem scored the third two minutes from the end after a 30-meter
break.
 &UR; Newcastle 0 Leeds 3 (0-1) &QC; 
	   Harry Kewell scored with the first Leeds shot on target after 38
minutes. Lee Bowyer prodded the second in the 62nd after
Newcastle's Irish international goalkeeper Shay Given had fumbled a
shot from Kewell. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink scored again in the final
minute, turning past defender Steve Howey before shooting home.
 &UR; Sheffield Wednesday 0 Leicester 1 (0-1) &QC; 
	   Tony Cottee fired Leicester ahead with an angled shot in the
34th minute after a weak back pass from England international Andy

Report: Moscow firm developing new, cheaper space shuttle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Moscow research and development firm is
developing a new space shuttle that can deliver cargo into orbit at
a fraction of the price of existing U.S. and Russian shuttle
systems, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
	   Moscow's city government plans to help fund the project by
purchasing 34 percent of the Molniya company's shares, Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov said during a visit to the company, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Molniya has designed a smaller copy of the Soviet Buran space
shuttle that can carry eight to nine tons of cargo to a satellite,
Interfax said. The original Buran, modeled after the U.S. space
shuttles, was scrapped for lack of funds after its only unmanned
space flight in 1988.
	   Unlike its prototype, which needed the powerful Energiya booster
to be carried into space, the new shuttle is to be launched
horizontally from a flying space station called Mriya, Interfax
said. It will be able to fly both with and without pilots.
	   It will cost between dlrs 1,000 and dlrs 1,500 to deliver one
ton of cargo to orbit, in contrast to the dlrs 10,000 to dlrs
20,000 it costs to send cargo on current Russian and U.S. systems,
Interfax said.

Arc de Triomphe staff walks off job, demanding more hirings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Holiday visitors were barred from entering the Arc
de Triomphe on Saturday, after museum attendants there walked off
the job to demand the government hire more staff, officials said.
	   The strike that began Saturday morning was expected to last
through the weekend and into the following week, pending talks
between unions and the Culture Ministry, a ministry spokesman said.
	   Like employees at other Paris museums in recent weeks, the staff
went on strike to press the government to hire more employees to
keep up with a rising number of visitors, the spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
	   Employees have also complained that conditions were more
difficult than at other Paris cultural sites, due to the noise and
pollution from the traffic circle surrounding the monument and the
cramped spaces inside the Arc, the spokesman said.
	   Officials expected to reach an agreement early in the week, he
said. Union officials could not be reached for comment.
	   The exact number of employees was not immediately available, but
a guard at the Arc said the monument has about 15 employees on a
typical day.
	   Strikes in recent weeks have also hit the Orsay, Louvre and
Grand Palais museums, with employees making similar demands for
more staff to handle larger crowds.
	   A recent strike at the Eiffel Tower, operated by the city of
Paris, was staged by workers demanding more hirings to comply with
the leftist government's 35-hour work week law.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Saturday that ``enemy'' planes
flying from the airspace of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia had attacked an
Iraqi anti-aircraft unit and were driven off.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency did not identify the nationality
of the aircraft, but it usually uses the word ``enemy'' for the
United States and Britain. Some U.S. warplanes are based in Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, and Britain also stations aircraft in Kuwait.
	   The agency said that at 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT) a formation of
warplanes ``attacked one of our air defense sites, which confronted
it and forced it to drop its load randomly.''
	   The report did not say where the apparent attack took place and
gave no other details.
	   In Washington, U.S. National Security Council spokesman P. J.
Crowley said that while American aircraft did fly over Iraq on
Saturday, ``they reported no incidents of fire directed against
them.
	   ``One aircraft reported anti-aircraft fire well off in the
distance, but it was not directed at them,'' Crowley said.
Referring to British and French planes, which help patrol ``no-fly
zones'' over Iraq, he said: ``We have no reports of any incidents
against coalition aircraft.''
	   Saturday's report was the second such incident reported by the
Iraqi News Agency since the United States and Britain ended four
days of air attacks against Iraq on Dec. 19 in a bid to punish
Baghdad for its alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The attacks were aimed at military and government targets. Iraq
says that 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were killed in the
bombardment.
	   The news agency reported Tuesday that U.S. and British aircraft
fired two ``stray missiles'' near the southern city of Basra. U.S.
and British officials denied their planes were involved in any such
incident.

Italy's Telecom confirms deal with Murdoch, French TV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Telecom Italian on Saturday confirmed that
it has reached an agreement in principle to sell up to 80 percent
of its digital pay TV unit to Rupert Murdoch's media empire.
	   On Thursday evening, Italy's ANSA news agency had reported that
the stakes would be sold to the Murdoch empire and to France's TF1.
	   ``The dialogue to include other partners, Italian and European,
is continuing, said a Telecom statement. In reaching the agreement,
both sides pledged to ``develop a digital pay TV offer of elevated
interest for the market, including transmissions of Italian major
league soccer games,'' the statement said.
	   The long-anticipated accord has been much debated in Italy,
where some in government and media have argued against foreign
ownership of the pay TV industry.
	   Murdoch was especially interested in the lucrative soccer
broadcast rights in Italy.
	   Telecom owns 100 percent of the pay television unit, Stream,
which has about 120,000 subscribers.
	   The Italian news agency AGI said the accord between Telecom and
NewsEurope Corp. was expected to be signed in early January.
	   Italy's undersecretary of communications, Vincenzo Vita,
expressed concern that the Italians wouldn't hold the majority
share.
	   Italian investors have been scared off by the high investments
the operation would need.
	   The accord would establish an alternative in Italy to pay-TV
network Tele Piu, which is 10 percent controlled by the media
empire of former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi.
	   Earlier in the month, Italy's state broadcaster RAI signed a
memorandum of understanding with France's pay-television Canal Plus
for the creation of a digital TV platform.
	   RAI's accord with Canal Plus seemed to indicate that the Italian
broadcaster would be a partner in the digital TV unit Stream, along
with Telecom Italia and New Corp.

	   LAPASTICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fleeing fighting in northern
Kosovo, Kosovo's newest refugees congregated in a regional ethnic
Albanian guerrilla stronghold on Saturday, crowding into houses by
the dozens to escape bitterly cold weather.
	   Most of the hundreds of refugees in the area west of Podujevo
made their way to Lapastica, a village still held by the Kosovo
Liberation Army after a two-day crackdown by Serb police and
Yugoslav army units. Some fled on foot, shivering in subfreezing
overnight temperatures.
	   A Serb farmer was killed west of Podujevo by the guerrillas on
Saturday, said members of the Organization of Security and
Cooperation team monitoring Kosovo developments. Albanian sources
reported a police attack in the same region.
	   Otherwise, the province was reported calm in the wake of two
days of fierce fighting in the Podujevo area that threatened to
unravel an already shaky de-facto truce reached Oct. 12.
	   Several villages were in the region were destroyed, and
abandoned by inhabitants seeking shelter elsewhere in temperatures
that plummeted to - 20 C. ( - 4 F) overnight. In a typical scene in
Lapastica, one room of 20 square meters (yards) sheltered more than
60 refugees.
	   ``It's a shame that we have to beg for food and beds,'' said one
of the refugees, who asked for anonymity.
	   His 7-year-old son, identified only as Agron, couldn't speak a
word, his teeth chattering after hours on the march in the cold.
The only warm member of the family of four appeared to be the
youngest _ a 3-month old girl bundled in wool and asleep in a
wooden cradle carried by her father.
	   Others in and near Lapastica combed the surroundings in the
winter sun for firewood as they looked ahead to another freezing
night.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Four hostages held by inmates at a Mexican
prison were freed Saturday and a fifth escaped, but a standoff
continued, authorities reported. One inmate surrendered.
	   The four inmates took hostages at the Reclusorio Sur prison
Friday afternoon after being foiled in an escape attempt, said
Jaime Alvarez Ramos, the city's director of prisons. News reports
said they have grenades and guns.
	   There were no reports of serious injuries.
	   Officials don't know the exact number of hostages, said a
spokesman for the prison system, speaking on condition of
anonymity. News reports gave varying figures, ranging from eight to
more than 20.
	   Four hostages were released over a three hour period Saturday
morning, the prison system said in a statement. They included two
prisoners, a 76-year-old woman and a pregnant woman who had been
visiting relatives in the prison.
	   A fifth hostage, a nurse, managed to escape.
	   One of the inmates holding hostages surrendered and negotiations
were continuing with the remaining three.
	   Alvarez and city police chief Alejandro Gertz had entered the
prison Friday evening to hear the inmates' demands for the release
of the hostages. Alvarez said that, for the moment, the captors
were only asking for cigarettes, food and water.
	   The hostages were reportedly being held in the prison infirmary
and medical personnel were among the captives.
	   The prison was filled with Christmas visitors at the time. About
200 adults and 150 children were gradually evacuated during the
day.
	   Hundreds of police continued to surround the prison Saturday.

	   Facts about Sierra Leone:
	   ___
	   GEOGRAPHY: West African nation covering 28,680 square miles
(74,300 square kilometers); bound by Guinea to north and east,
Liberia to southeast and Atlantic Ocean to southwest. Tropical
climate.
	   PEOPLE: 4.7 million people; 30 percent of population from Temne
ethnic group in the north and Mende in the south. Other groups
include Krio, Lokko, Sherbo, Limba, Susu, Fulani and Kono.
	   LANGUAGES AND RELIGIONS: Official language is English, but
English derivative called Krio more widely spoken; there are 12
main tribal languages. 75 percent Muslim, 23 percent Christian and
2 percent animist and other.
	   HISTORY: Settled two centuries ago by freed slaves from Britain,
the United States and Jamaica. Britain ruled from 1808 until April
27, 1961.
	   GOVERNMENT: First elections in 1952. All People's Congress party
ruled from 1971-92, when Maj. Gen. Joseph Momoh was ousted as
president in a coup.
	   After about six years of intermittent fighting between
government and the rebel Revolutionary United Front that left more
than 10,000 dead, President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah was elected and
signed a peace treaty with the rebels in November 1996. But he was
ousted in a May 25, 1997 military coup with rebel support. Kabbah's
government returned to power 10 months later in March after the
ECOMOG Nigerian-led West African intervention force drove the junta
into the interior.
	   Since then, Kabbah has disbanded the military and empowered
ECOMOG and the Kamajor traditional militia to fight the rebels.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been left homeless and
thousands killed, maimed and raped by the rebels, who began a
counterattack campaign against key towns outside Freetown last
week.
	   LIVING STANDARDS AND NATURAL RESOURCES: The United Nations ranks
Sierra Leone as the world's least developed nation. Per capita
income is dlrs 171 a year; life expectancy, 34 years; infant
mortality rate, 164 per 1,000 live births. Although rich in
diamond, gold, bauxite and other mineral resources, mining has been
at a relative standstill since 1995 as a result of fighting.

121 prisoners escape from three Sao Paulo police lockups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Taking advantage of lax holiday
vigilance, 121 prisoners escaped from three Sao Paulo police
lockups Saturday, Brazilian media reported.
	   At a police holding cell in the northern part of the city, 89
inmates escaped at dawn through a hole they had pounded through a
wall before climbing onto the jail roof and leaping to freedom. At
the time, not one guard was on duty, reported Globo TV News.
	   The Globo report couldn't immediately be confirmed; local police
confirmed the jailbreaks but said they had no details.
	   At the Santa Isabel jail, 22 escaped while 10 more escaped at
another police facility, police said.
	   Sao Paulo, Brazil's richest and most populous state, has the
most prisoners in the nation _ an estimated 70,000, about half of
whom are held in police lockups and jails, according to Human
Rights Watch.
	   In most cases, outbreaks are sparked by overcrowding and delays
in moving state inmates to prisons with more space. Sao Paulo jails
and lockups are often filled to three times their capacity, human
rights groups say.
	   ``These are holding cells that should be used for 5-6 hours and
not long-term detention,'' James Cavallaro, head of the Brazil
office of Human Rights Watch told The Associated Press on Saturday.
``It's a miracle that there aren't more escapes and riots.''
	   In 1997, Sao Paulo suffered the most rebellions and escape
attempts in jails and lockups than any other state _ 195.

Yeltsin vows to protect press freedom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a rare television interview, President Boris
Yeltsin vowed Saturday to fight extremism and protect freedom of
the press against attempts to restore censorship and other
restrictions.
	   In the interview with ORT public television, Yeltsin reviewed
the struggles and successes of the past year. He said that Russia
had suffered through tough times because of the world financial
crisis, but ``the fact that we preserved political stability,
that's the main thing.''
	   Recently, Yeltsin's television appearances have been limited
mostly to formal appearances and clips of his meetings with Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other officials. On occasion, he has
looked fatigued and disoriented.
	   This time, viewers had a chance to see him handle questions, and
he was in good form.
	   Yeltsin sat in a straight chair, his black loafers planted
firmly on the floor. He alternately scowled and smiled playfully at
his interviewer, as if to signal that he would not let any question
catch him up, and he spoke in a strong, steady voice.
	   He said the 2000 presidential campaign had begun ``a little
early,'' and said candidates would regret that because voters would
start scrutinizing them carefully for shortcomings. He said he saw
no reason for early presidential elections _ making no mention of
his poor health, which his opponents say has prevented him from
carrying out his presidential duties _ and refused to reveal when
he would endorse a successor.
	   Yeltsin said he was preparing an ``offensive'' on extremism, and
said the first step would be passage of new legislation. With new
laws, the state could act more harshly against extremists, he said.
	   He said he would not allow attacks against the media.
	   ``We will be defending, we will use all our strength to defend
freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of the mass
media,'' Yeltsin said. ``I promise you this as president and as
guarantor of the Constitution.''
	   Yeltsin's promise come amid calls by Communists and other
hardliners in the parliament to reintroduce censorship and put
television under control of government supervisory committees.
	   Last month, Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov and his
allies sent a letter to Primakov, accusing Russian television of
``manipulating public opinion against the interests of the state''
and becoming ``the main destabilizing force in society.''
	   Earlier this month, the Communists called for pulling the
parliamentary accreditation from Russia's three biggest television
stations after their cameras recorded a Communist deputy's
anti-Semitic remarks during a committee meeting.
	   The deputy's defenders accused the television stations of
reporting on the comments out of context _ although they had
recorded the deputy, Viktor Ilyukhin, reading a prepared text.
	   Yeltsin reiterated his opposition to amending the Constitution
to trim the strong presidential powers.
	   ``If we were to turn into a parliamentary republic, we'd lose
Russia,'' he said.

Angolans venture onto the streets amid rebel shelling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CRISTIANA PEREIRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ People ventured out onto the sunny
streets of a besieged central Angolan city Saturday despite a rebel
bombardment pummeling the northern outskirts, a Roman Catholic
bishop said.
	   ``People have come out for a walk,'' Bishop Jose Nambi said in a
telephone interview from Kuito. ``They're taking the risk.''
	   Kuito has been the center of fighting between UNITA rebels and
the Angolan army for nearly a month. On Thursday, rebels launched
their heaviest attack yet on the city in the renewed fighting,
killing 30 people and wounding 37 others.
	   Both sides have launched intense attacks in the central
highlands of the vast southwest African country, undermining a 1994
U.N.-brokered peace accord aimed at ending a two-decade civil war.
	   Nambi said rebels on Saturday targeted the village of Cunji, on
the northern outskirts of Kuito, which is 300 miles (480
kilometers) southeast of the capital, Luanda.
	   Kuito's hospital has little medicine, and newly wounded people _
mostly civilians _ are admitted every day, Nambi said.
	   Observers fear a humanitarian crisis as stocks run low. Relief
agencies have stopped flying to Kuito because the airport has been
targeted by rebel artillery to prevent the government sending in
reinforcements.
	   Kuito's population of about 100,000 has been swollen with a
further 30,000 displaced in the past two weeks. People have taken
refuge in the hospital, in churches, abandoned houses _ even under
balconies.
	   ``It's very tough for the displaced in terms of food,'' said the
bishop, speaking from a seminary that has offered shelter to some
refugees. ``(They) left everything behind, and there isn't enough
medicine, or blankets to go round.''
	   Civil war between the government and UNITA broke out in 1975
after Angola's independence from Portugal. A 1991 peace deal
collapsed the following year when UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
rejected his defeat in Angola's first elections.
	   Before the 1994 U.N.-brokered cease-fire, Kuito was reduced to
rubble in a yearlong siege that ended when government forces ousted
UNITA rebels.
	   The 1994 pact required UNITA to disarm and hand over control of
almost half the country it effectively ruled.
	   UNITA claimed it had disarmed and demobilized its forces under
U.N. supervision over the past four years. However, the rebels are
estimated to have about 30,000 guerrilla soldiers still hidden in
the bush. The government army has 100,000 soldiers.

Mexican prisoners release hostages and surrender
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with inmates surrendering &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Three Mexican prisoners released hostages
they had held for than 20 hours and surrendered Saturday, a prison
systems official said.
	   The siege at the Reclusorio Sur prison ended peacefully about
12:30 p.m., the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Prison officials still had no information about how many
hostages had been held. News reports gave varying figures, ranging
from eight to more than 20.
	   According to officials, four inmates, hoping to escape, started
a riot Friday afternoon while the prison was filled with Christmas
visitors. When the escape plans were foiled, they took hostages.
	   The prisoners were said to be armed with guns and grenades,
according to news reports. There were no reports of serious
injuries.
	   Four hostages were released over a three hour period Saturday
morning, the prison system said in a statement. They included two
prisoners, a 76-year-old woman and a pregnant woman who had been
visiting relatives.
	   A fifth hostage, a nurse, managed to escape.
	   One of the inmates surrendered Saturday morning and officials
continued to negotiate with the remaining three.
	   It was not known what the inmates were demanding. After
negotiating with them Friday night, Jaime Alvarez Ramos, the city's
director of prisons, said that at that moment they were only asking
for cigarettes, food and water.

Leader of Italian monarchists dies in Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Alfredo Covelli, who founded a party of monarchists
in 1946, the year the country voted against continuing the Italian
monarchy, has died in Rome, Italian news reports said Saturday.
	   Covelli, 84, died on Friday. No cause of death was given.
	   Italians in a 1946 referendum voted to establish the present
republic. Corbelli's National Monarchical Party appealed to some of
the 11.5 million Italians who had voted in favor of keeping the
royal family.
	   In 1972, the party was folded into the neofascist Italian Social
Movement.
	   Covelli served for more than 30 years in the Italian Parliament.
	   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, in a condolence message, praised
Covelli's ``defense of the values of the human person and of all
that which inspires love for the country.''
	   There were no immediate details about funeral arrangements or
survivors.

	   LAPASTICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of refugees fleeing
renewed fighting in northern Kosovo congregated Saturday in a
regional ethnic Albanian guerrilla stronghold, crowding into houses
by the dozens to escape bitterly cold weather.
	   Most of the refugees in the area west of Podujevo made their way
to Lapastica, a village still held by the Kosovo Liberation Army
after a two-day crackdown by Serb police and Yugoslav army units.
	   A Serb farmer was killed west of Podujevo by the guerrillas on
Saturday, said members of the Organization of Security and
Cooperation team monitoring Kosovo developments. Albanian sources
reported a police attack in the same region.
	   Otherwise, the province was reported calm in the wake of two
days of fierce fighting in the Podujevo area that threatened to
unravel an already shaky de-facto truce reached Oct. 12.
	   Several villages in the region were destroyed and abandoned by
inhabitants who often fled on foot to find shelter elsewhere in
temperatures that plummeted to -20 C. ( -4 F.) overnight. In a
typical scene in Lapastica, one room of 20 square meters (24 square
yards) housed more than 60 refugees.
	   ``It's a shame that we have to beg for food and beds,'' said one
of the refugees, who asked for anonymity.
	   His 7-year-old son Agron couldn't speak a word, his teeth
chattering after hours on the march in the cold. The only warm
member of the family of four appeared to be the youngest _ a
3-month old girl bundled in wool and asleep in a wooden cradle
carried by her father.
	   Others in and near Lapastica combed the surroundings in the
winter sun for firewood as they looked ahead to another freezing
night.

Iraq says allied aircraft attacked air defense unit

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Saturday that its anti-aircraft
gunners drove off an attack by ``enemy'' warplanes that flew in
from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency did not identify the nationality
of the aircraft, but it usually uses the word ``enemy'' to describe
warplanes from the United States and Britain. The United States has
aircraft in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Britain also bases aircraft in
Kuwait.
	   In Washington, U.S. National Security Council spokesman P. J.
Crowley said U.S. aircraft flew over Iraq on Saturday, but ``they
reported no incidents of fire directed against them.''
	   He said, however, that ``one aircraft reported anti-aircraft
fire well off in the distance, but it was not directed at them.''
	   There were no incidents against British or French aircraft, he
said. The two European powers and the United States maintain a
``no-fly zone'' over southern Iraq that was set up in 1992 to halt
air attacks against Shiite Muslim rebels.
	   State-controlled Iraqi media have issued almost daily reports of
violations of the country's airspace since the United States and
Britain ended four days of airstrikes against Iraq on Dec. 19.
	   The strikes were carried out after U.N. weapons inspectors
released a report saying that Baghdad was blocking their work.
	   Iraq says that 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were
killed in the bombardment.
	   The increased reports of airspace violations and the Saturday
incident may be an indication that Baghdad intends to challenge the
no-fly zone over southern Iraq.
	   Iraq has never recognize the zone and has occasionally
confronted aircraft flying in the area.
	   The last major incident in the zone was in June. A U.S. F-16
warplane fired a missile at an anti-aircraft site after Iraqi radar
targeted British warplanes patrolling the zone.
	   Iraq denied that its forces threatened the British aircraft.
	   The Iraqi News Agency said that at 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT)
Saturday a formation of warplanes ``attacked one of our air defense
sites, which confronted it and forced it to drop its load
randomly.''
	   The report did not say where the apparent attack took place and
gave no other details.
	   Also Saturday, the Babil newspaper criticized Iraq's most
powerful sympathizers on the U.N. Security Council _ France, Russia
and China _ for not taking stronger action toward easing U.N.
sanctions against Iraq.
	   The newspaper, which is owned by a son of President Saddam
Hussein, said that Russia's and China's positions ``did not
accomplish any positive results for Iraq.''
	   It added that the ``fluctuation of the French stand has made us
wonder if they are with us or against us.''
	   Security Council diplomats have said the sweeping sanctions _
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 _ will not be lifted
until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has dismantled its programs
to build weapons of mass destruction.
	   France, Russia and China, along with the United States and
Britain, are permanent members of the Security Council.

Escape expert uses classic technique to flee Milan prison

 &UR; EDS: Joan as first name for man is cq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A Romanian convicted of murder used the
classic knotted bedsheet technique to escape from a Milan prison
when guards were short-staffed for Christmas.
	   The Italian news agency ANSA reported that guards noticed Joan
Ursut, who was serving a 21-year sentence at Opera prison for the
murder of an Italian gangster, missing about lunch time on Friday.
	   Fog hampered the search for the 40-year-old Romanian, who had
been at the prison since 1989. The poor visibility made it
impossible for police helicopters to join in the search, which used
officers and dogs on the ground, ANSA said.
	   The report said that Ursut, who was allowed to have some
movement around the prison, lowered himself out of window opposite
a section of surrounding outside wall where no guards were on duty,
apparently due to the shortage of help on Christmas.
	   According to reports from Sweden, Ursut escaped from jails in
that country twice.
	   A prisoner at a Rome jail recently used the knotted sheet
technique in a successful escape.

Chelsea down Saints to go temporarily top while Villa loses at
</HEADLINE>
Blackburn &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Blackburn beating Villa &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Unbeaten since the opening day of the season,
Chelsea returned to the top of the Premier League with a 2-0
victory at struggling Southampton on Saturday as Aston Villa went
down 2-1 at another lowly team, Blackburn Rovers.
	   Norwegian striker Tore Andre Flo and Uruguayan midfielder
Gustavo Poyet scored the Blues' goals at The Dell. The result means
that Gianluca Vialli's team is unbeaten in 18 Premier League games
in a row.
	   Chelsea moved to the top on goal difference as Villa squandered
its three-point lead with a surprise loss at Blackburn.
	   Kevin Gallacher fired Rovers ahead at Ewood Park but Villa hit
back with a equalizer through Ricardo Scimeca despite being reduced
to 10 men with the second half expulsion of goalkeeper Michael
Oakes for handball.
	   Villa appeared to be staying a point clear until Tim Sherwood
fired the winner for Rovers only two minutes from the end. The
result also lifted Blackburn out of the relegation zone and up two
places to fourth from last.
	   After six games without a win, Manchester United revived its
title chances with a 3-0 win over last place Nottingham Forest at
Old Trafford.
	   Norwegian defender Ronny Johnsen scored the first two and Ryan
Giggs added the other.
	   Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson were together on the Newcastle
lineup for the first time since last month's arrival of Ferguson
from Everton had set up a 22 million pound (dlrs 36.74 million)
strikeforce.
	   But the Magpies tumbled 3-0 at home to fourth place Leeds, who
netted through Australian striker Harry Kewell, Lee Bowyer and
Dutch striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink despite having several
players missing through injury.
	   Ian Wright returned to Highbury as a West Ham player but his new
team went down 1-0 after an early strike by the Gunners' Dutch
winger Marc Overmars to move up to fifth.
	   Liverpool ended Middlesbrough's nine-game unbeaten home record
by scoring a 3-1 win at the Riverside stadium with goals by Jamie
Carragher, Jamie Redknapp and Vegard Heggem. Brian Deane replied
for Boro from Paul Gascoigne's free kick but Bryan Robson's team
slipped to sixth.
	   A first half goal by veteran Tony Cottee earned Leicester a 1-0
win at Sheffield Wednesday while Everton and Derby ground out a 0-0
tie at Goodison Park.
	   Charlton, sliding down towards the relegation zone, went ahead
through Neal Redfearn's curling 25-meter shot at Selhurst Park but
Wimbledon hit back through Jason Euell and Michael Hughes for a 2-1
win.
	   All 20 teams will be in action on Monday or Tuesday before
getting involved in FA Cup games Jan. 2-3.
	   Division One leader Sunderland, which had an 11-point lead last
weekend, had that cut to five after losing 1-0 at Sunderland.
Second place Ipswich crushed Portsmouth 3-0.
	   Scottish Premier League leader Rangers struggled to a 1-0
victory over St. Johnstone while second place Kilmarnock, three
points behind, edged Hearts 1-0. Defending titlist Celtic, 10
points behind its Glasgow rival, visits Dundee on Sunday.
	   Scottish World Cup center-back Colin Hendry was sent off for
deliberate handball in the area but St. Johnstone's John O'Neil
fired the ensuing penalty kick against the bar and Rangers clinched
the three points through a goal by Italian defender Sergio Porrini
19 minutes from the end.
 &UR; Arsenal 1 West Ham 0 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Marc Overmars scored the only goal of the game after eight
minutes, beating two players on the left and cutting inside before
shooting home from just inside the area. Ian Wright, playing
against Arsenal for the first time since his move to West Ham, had
few chances to shine as the Gunners dominated.
 &UR; Blackburn 2 Aston Villa 1 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Scottish international Kevin Gallacher scored with a diving
header in the final minute of the first half after Tim Sherwood had
hit the crossbar. Villa then lost goalkeeper Michael Oakes who was
harshly expelled for handling the ball outside his area but hit
back 12 minutes from the end through Ricardo Scimeca after good
approach work by substitute Stan Collymore. Rovers netted the
winner two minutes from the end through Sherwood's close range shot
after good approach work by Jason Wilcox and substitute Kevin
Davies.

Netanyahu denies elections are stalling peace pact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs with Netanyahu comments, Arafat's meeting with
Mubarak, changes byline
 &UR; Precede HEBRON
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday
denied Palestinian charges that he suspended the Wye River peace
accord because of upcoming elections, saying that Palestinian
noncompliance is responsible for the freeze.
	   Netanyahu told Israel Radio that he would implement the 2-month
old U.S.-brokered accord once the Palestinians did their part,
including collecting illegal weapons held by Palestinian police and
civilians.
	   Netanyahu criticized the Palestinian Authority for releasing
Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin from house arrest on
Wednesday and permitting a Palestinian jailed for killing two
Israelis to have ``passed through the revolving door, exited, and
escaped outside,'' the radio said.
	   The Palestinian Authority was carrying out a manhunt for Jamil
Jidala who escaped from a Nablus jail earlier this week.
	   The Palestinians suggested early elections for prime minister,
expected by late April, were responsible for the freeze.
	   ``This Israeli government continues to be a government,
responsible for its commitments,'' chief Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said after Friday night's meeting of the Palestinian
Cabinet in the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   The call for early elections was triggered by lawmakers'
rejection of Netanyahu's peace policies, and how and whether to
implement the peace pact is already a major campaign issue.
	   Israel has refused to go ahead with promised troop pull backs
from the West Bank unless the Palestinians meet a series of
conditions. Those include a renunciation of Palestinian claims to
the right to declare statehood in May 1999 whether or not terms
have been agreed on with Israel.
	   But the Palestinian Cabinet said in a statement following its
meeting that it would continue making preparations for a statehood
declaration in May.
	   The Palestinians also said they would seek help from the Arab
world and the rest of the international community to ``confront the
freezing of the peace process.
	   The Cabinet called Israeli noncompliance with the accord a
``dangerous development which was initiated by the Israeli
government without any reason besides its rejection of peace.''
	   Saturday, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo to discuss the frozen agreement.

Iraq says allied aircraft attacked air defense unit

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with British saying pilot saw anti-aircraft fire grafs

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Saturday that its anti-aircraft
gunners drove off an attack by ``enemy'' warplanes that flew in
from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency did not identify the nationality
of the aircraft, but it usually uses the word ``enemy'' to describe
warplanes from the United States and Britain. The United States has
aircraft in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Britain also bases aircraft in
Kuwait.
	   In Washington, U.S. National Security Council spokesman P. J.
Crowley said U.S. aircraft flew over Iraq on Saturday, but ``they
reported no incidents of fire directed against them.''
	   He said, however, that ``one aircraft reported anti-aircraft
fire well off in the distance.''
	   In London, a Defense Ministry spokesman said a British pilot
``did sight anti-aircraft fire but he did not consider it
hostile.''
	   ``The Iraqis seem to be loosing off anti-aircraft fire left,
right and center,'' the spokesman said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The United States, Britain and France maintain a ``no-fly zone''
over southern Iraq that was set up in 1992 to halt air attacks
against Shiite Muslim rebels.
	   State-controlled Iraqi media have issued almost daily reports of
violations of the country's airspace since the United States and
Britain ended four days of airstrikes against Iraq on Dec. 19.
	   The strikes were carried out after U.N. weapons inspectors
released a report saying that Baghdad was blocking their work.
	   Iraq says that 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were
killed in the bombardment.
	   The increased reports of airspace violations and the Saturday
incident may be an indication that Baghdad intends to challenge the
no-fly zone over southern Iraq.
	   Iraq has never recognize the zone and has occasionally
confronted aircraft flying in the area.
	   The last major incident in the zone was in June. U.S. officials
have said that a U.S. F-16 warplane fired a missile at an
anti-aircraft site after Iraqi radar targeted British warplanes
patrolling the zone.

Egypt tells Israel to implement the Wye River accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo CAI-101

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Israeli government should implement the
Wye River peace accord because it signed it, Egypt's Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said Saturday after a meeting between Egyptian
and Palestinian leaders.
	   ``We expect the United States to put pressure (on Israel) toward
implementing this agreement,'' especially the part concerning a
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank, Moussa said.
	   Speaking after a series of talks between Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Moussa said the
Israeli handling of the agreement brokered by U.S. President Bill
Clinton in October had created a bad impression.
	   Israel's image, Moussa said, was one of ``when I negotiate, I
negotiate to waste time and, if I sign, don't believe that I will
implement and, when the time for implementation comes, we will
hinder it.''
	   ``The Israeli government is supposed to implement the Wye River
accord because it is the government that signed the agreement,''
the foreign minister said.
	   On Dec. 2, Israel announced it was freezing the accord because
of what it alleged were Palestinian violations. It also refused to
go ahead with scheduled troop pullbacks from the West Bank unless
the Palestinians met certain conditions, including foregoing a plan
to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state in May 1999.
	   On Saturday, Mubarak and Arafat met one-on-one and then held a
meeting accompanied by their officials. The two leaders also broke
their fast together after sunset. Muslims are currently fasting for
the holy month of Ramadan.
	   Neither of the leaders spoke after the talks, but Moussa quoted
Arafat as saying that a failure to implement the accord could
``disturb'' the peace process.
	   Moussa said that, at Mubarak's suggestion, further
Egyptian-Palestinian meetings would be held in Cairo Saturday at
official level.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet demanded Friday that Israel lift its
suspension of the accord, saying that the Israeli election campaign
was no reason to freeze the process.

	   BAGHDAD: in the south.
	   Iraq has never recognized the zones and has occasionally
confronted aircraft flying in the area.
	   The last major incident in the zone was in June. U.S. officials
said that a U.S. F-16 warplane fired a missile at an anti-aircraft
site after Iraqi radar targeted British warplanes patrolling the
zone.
	   Iraq denied that its forces threatened the British aircraft.
	   On Saturday, U.S. National Security Council spokesman P. J.
Crowley said in Washington that U.S. aircraft had flown over Iraq,
but ``they reported no incidents of fire directed against them.''
	   He said, however, that ``one aircraft reported anti-aircraft
fire well off in the distance.''
	   In London, a Defense Ministry spokesman said a British pilot on
Saturday ``did sight anti-aircraft fire but he did not consider it
hostile.''
	   ``The Iraqis seem to be loosing off anti-aircraft fire left,
right and center,'' the spokesman said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   State-controlled Iraqi media have issued almost daily reports of
violations of the country's airspace since the United States and
Britain ended four days of airstrikes against Iraq on Dec. 19.
	   The strikes were carried out after U.N. weapons inspectors
released a report saying that Baghdad was blocking their work.
	   Iraq says that 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were
killed in the bombardment.
	   The Iraqi News Agency said that at 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT)
Saturday a formation of warplanes ``attacked one of our air defense
sites, which confronted it and forced it to drop its load
randomly.''
	   The report did not say where the apparent attack took place and
gave no other details.
	   Also Saturday, the Babil newspaper criticized Iraq's most
powerful sympathizers on the U.N. Security Council _ France, Russia
and China _ for not taking stronger action toward easing U.N.
sanctions against Iraq.
	   The newspaper, which is owned by a son of President Saddam
Hussein, said that Russia's and China's positions ``did not
accomplish any positive results for Iraq.''
	   It added that the ``fluctuation of the French stand has made us
wonder if they are with us or against us.''
	   Security Council diplomats have said the sweeping sanctions _
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 _ will not be lifted
until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has dismantled its programs
to build weapons of mass destruction.
	   France, Russia and China, along with the United States and
Britain, are permanent members of the Security Council.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will fire on the U.S.-British
warplanes patroling the no-fly zones, Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan said Saturday.
	   Speaking on Qatar's Al-Jazeera television, Ramadan was asked if
Iraq would accept the flights of U.S. and British aircraft that
maintain no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq.
	   ``We say frankly now that any violation of Iraqi airspace will
be met by Iraqi fire,'' Ramadan said.
	   The interview was conducted in Baghdad hours after Iraq said
that its anti-aircraft gunners had driven off an attack by
``enemy'' warplanes that flew in from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency did not identify the nationality
of the aircraft, but it usually uses the word ``enemy'' to describe
warplanes from the United States and Britain. The United States has
aircraft in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Britain also bases aircraft in
Kuwait.
	   Asked why Iraq had not fired previously on planes enforcing the
no-fly zones, Ramadan said ``when you want to restore your rights,
you choose the suitable time and circumstances.''
	   Ramadan said that the U.S. and British aircraft were taking off
from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
	   ``It appears, but we cannot confirm it, that France has for
sometime not been participating in these sorties,'' the vice
president said.
	   French aircraft no longer take part in enforcing the no-fly zone
over northern Iraq, but still help to maintain the southern zone.
	   The United States, Britain and France set up the no-fly zones in
the years after the 1991 Gulf War to halt air attacks against
Kurdish rebels in the north and Shiite Muslim rebels in the south.
	   Iraq has never recognized the zones and has occasionally
confronted aircraft flying in the area.
	   The last major incident in the zone was in June. U.S. officials
said that a U.S. F-16 warplane fired a missile at an anti-aircraft
site after Iraqi radar targeted British warplanes patrolling the
zone.
	   Iraq denied that its forces threatened the British aircraft.
	   On Saturday, U.S. National Security Council spokesman P. J.
Crowley said in Washington that U.S. aircraft had flown over Iraq,
but ``they reported no incidents of fire directed against them.''
	   He said, however, that ``one aircraft reported anti-aircraft
fire well off in the distance.''
	   In London, a Defense Ministry spokesman said a British pilot on
Saturday ``did sight anti-aircraft fire but he did not consider it
hostile.''
	   ``The Iraqis seem to be loosing off anti-aircraft fire left,
right and center,'' the spokesman said, speaking on customary

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A Yemeni tribal leader said Saturday that
the German Embassy had offered 2 million riyals (dlrs 16,000) for
the release of four hostages, but the German Foreign Ministry
denied the claim.
	   A leader of the Bani Dhabyan tribe, which has kidnapped four
Germans, said German Ambassador Helga Strathwitz made the offer
through intermediaries earlier this week.
	   The tribe had rejected the ransom as it does not meet their
demands, the leader said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The Bani Dhabyan are pressing the government to provide more
schools, hospitals, telephone lines and roads for their province of
Marib, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of San`a.
	   In Bonn late Saturday, the German foreign ministry denied that
its embassy in San`a had offered any ransom.
	   Bani Dhabyan gunmen abducted the Germans, three women and a man,
on Dec. 7 in Marib.
	   The tribal leader said that Strathwitz had expressed concern for
the health of the hostages, especially a women who is sick, and had
asked for their immediate release.
	   A Yemeni newspaper has identified the hostages as Norbert Degen,
Petra Penglista, Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner. The embassy has
not confirmed the names.
	   The tribal leader said the health of 64-year-old Brunner, who
suffers from high blood pressure, is deteriorating.
	   A German-speaking cardiologist dispatched Sunday to examine her
was not able to reach the isolated area where the hostages are
being held and has returned to San`a, the leader said.
	   But he said the hostages received medicine for Brunner along
with Christmas gifts of chocolates and cigarettes from the embassy
Thursday.
	   Kidnappings occur frequently in Yemen, large parts of which are
controlled by armed tribesmen who do not hesitate to take the law
into their hands to get their demands fulfilled. The hostages are
usually treated well and released unhurt.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will fire on warplanes patroling the
no-fly zones, Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said
Saturday.

Palmeiras beats Cruzeiro 3-1 to force third game in Mercosur Cup.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Palmeiras beat a visibly tired Cruzeiro
3-1 Saturday, forcing a third and decisive game in the first
Mercosur Cup championship final before a partisan crowd at Parque
Antartica stadium.
	   Cruzeiro, which won the first-leg game 2-1, needed only a tie to
capture the title, while Palmeiras had to win to force a final
game. The final will take place Tuesday, also at Parque Antartica.
	   Just last Wednesday, Cruzeiro lost the 1998 Brazilian
Championship 2-0 to the Corinthians in the third-leg of a hard
fought series. The devastating loss _ coupled with an earlier
setback this year in the finals of the Brazil Cup _ caused the
Brazilian media to speculate whether Cruzeiro had anything left.
	   ``Sadness could defeat Cruzeiro,'' said a headline in a Rio
newspaper.
	   But any sadness quickly turned to joy during Saturday's game, at
least initially, when defender Gilberto made a spectacular pass in
front of the net to striker Muller, who was fouled by Palmeiras
goalie Velloso. Striker Fabio Junior then scored on a penalty kick
in just the 2nd minute of play.
	   Palmeiras, however, came back after fullback Cleber took a pass
from Paraguayan defender Arce and scored in the 9th minute with a
head shot past Cruzeiro goalie Dida.
	   For the rest of the first half, a more rested Palmeiras, whose
lineup is laden with current and former members of the Brazilian
national team, kept up a relentless attack against a sluggish
Cruzeiro.
	   To be sure, Cruzeiro was playing in its 80th game of the season
and had not trained since losing last week's title game. Palmeiras,
on the other hand, had been practicing daily since its loss to
Cruzeiro in the opening game.
	   In the second half, Palmeiras striker Oseas scored with the
left-footed shot into the net in the 52nd minute. Soon afterwards,
Cleber was carried off on a stretcher after suffering a leg injury.
	   At the 86th minute, striker Paulo Nunes took a corner kick and
scored with a head shot past Cruzeiro goalie Dida. Nunes then
celebrated with the partisan crowd by donning a green Santa Claus
hat and wiggling with several teammates in an impromptu dance.
	   Despite his team's lackluster play Saturday, Cruzeiro head coach
Levir Culpi says his players will be ready on Tuesday.
	   ``For the past two months, every game has been a life and death
situation, and that has taken a heavy psychological toll,'' he told
reporters. '' But winning the Mercosur Cup is a question of
honor.''
	   It's also a question of finances. The winning team will receive
a record amount of dlrs 3.9 million ( 4.7 million reais) from the
South American Soccer Confederation.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Two Mexican prisoners released the remaining
14 hostages they had held for than 20 hours and surrendered
Saturday, officials said.
	   The siege at the Reclusorio Sur prison ended peacefully shortly
after noon, Jaime Alvarez Ramos, the city's director of prisons,
said at a news conference.
	   According to officials, four inmates, hoping to escape, started
a riot Friday afternoon while the prison was filled with Christmas
visitors.
	   When the escape was foiled, they took 19 hostages in the
infirmary: 11 inmates, four medical workers and four visitors.
	   ``It was a very regrettable event,'' Alvarez said. ``It wasn't
their plan to take hostages.''
	   The four prisoners were all serving time for violent crimes.
They were armed with three pistols, a rifle and a hand grenade,
Alvarez said.
	   Officials were investigating how they got the weapons.
	   The prisoners wanted to leave the country and were demanding an
armored truck and a plane to take them to Cuba, Alvarez said. They
had also asked for cigarettes, food and water.
	   One inmate was captured Friday night and another surrendered
Saturday morning, he said.
	   Over the next several hours, four hostages were freed and a
fifth, a nurse, escaped. Those released were a 76-year-old woman
and a pregnant woman who had been visiting relatives in the prison,
and two prisoners who had been held hostage.
	   Three police commanders negotiated with the two remaining
hostage-takers and persuaded one of them to surrender and to talk
his partner into giving up as well, Alvarez said. He did not say
why the prisoners decided to surrender.
	   All four will face charges from the riot and hostage-taking, he
said.
	   There were no reports of serious injuries, although one
prisoner, who was not involved in the hostage-taking, suffered an
eye injury during the riot, Alvarez said.

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ The Minnesota Vikings are going into
the playoffs in record fashion.
	   Randall Cunningham threw two touchdowns and Gary Anderson added
two field goals as the Vikings beat the Oilers 26-16 Saturday,
becoming the highest-scoring team in the history of the National
Football League.
	   Minnesota (15-1) also tied the 1985 Chicago Bears and the 1984
San Francisco 49ers as the only teams with 15 victories in a
season. And Anderson became the highest-scoring kicker in a season
while extending his record of consecutive field goals to 40 over
two seasons.
	   Anderson became the first NFL kicker to finish a season with a
perfect record _ 35-of-35 on field goals and 59-of-59 on
conversions.
	   Anderson sealed the victory with a 39-yard field goal with 1:10
left. That gave him 164 points this season, topping Mark Moseley's
161 with Washington in 1983.
	   The loss ruined Tennessee's final game as the Oilers. The
franchise's nickname will be the Titans next season after 38
seasons as the Oilers in Houston and Tennessee.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will fire on the U.S.-British
warplanes patroling the no-fly zones, Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan said Saturday.
	   Speaking on Qatar's Al-Jazeera television, Ramadan was asked if

	   ``We say frankly now that any violation of Iraqi airspace will
be met by Iraqi fire,'' Ramadan said.
	   In Washington, National Security Council spokesman P. J. Crowley
said Ramadan's threat would not cause the United States to change
policy.
	   ``We will continue to enforce the no-fly zones in the north and
the south. Iraq knows that it should not interfere with those
flights, and our pilots can act in self-defense if they feel
threatened at any time,'' Crowley said.
	   The United States, Britain and France set up the no-fly zones in
1991-92 to halt air attacks against Kurdish rebels in the north and
Shiite Muslim rebels in the south.
	   The interview with Ramadan was conducted in Baghdad hours after
Iraq said that its anti-aircraft gunners had driven off an attack
by ``enemy'' warplanes that flew in from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency did not identify the nationality
of the aircraft, but it usually uses the word ``enemy'' to describe
warplanes from the United States and Britain. The United States has
aircraft in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Britain also bases aircraft in
Kuwait.
	   Asked why Iraq had not fired previously on planes enforcing the
no-fly zones, Ramadan said ``when you want to restore your rights,
you choose the suitable time and circumstances.''
	   Ramadan said that the U.S. and British aircraft were taking off
from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
	   ``It appears, but we cannot confirm it, that France has for
sometime not been participating in these sorties,'' the vice
president said.
	   French aircraft no longer take part in enforcing the no-fly zone
over northern Iraq, but still help to maintain the southern zone.
	   Iraq has never recognized the zones and has occasionally
confronted aircraft flying in the area.
	   The last major incident in the zone was in June. U.S. officials
said that a U.S. F-16 warplane fired a missile at an anti-aircraft
site after Iraqi radar targeted British warplanes patrolling the
zone.
	   Iraq denied that its forces threatened the British aircraft.
	   On Saturday, National Security Council spokesman Crowley said in
Washington that U.S. aircraft had flown over Iraq, but ``they
reported no incidents of fire directed against them.''

Two likely dead as gales, rain lash Britain and Ireland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police in Britain and Ireland said Saturday that
two people were feared dead and several others injured as both
countries were battered by high wind, rain and snow.
	   Police said one man was killed in County Galway, western
Ireland, when a falling tree crushed his car.
	   In Brighton, southern England, coastguard said that one man was
swept into the sea by a 30 foot (9 meter) wave as he walked along
beach with his girlfriend and a child. A rescue attempt later
failed to winch him to safety.
	   Neither police force immediately gave identities for the men.
	   Elsewhere in Britain, the governmental Environment Agency issued
50 flood warnings after winds up to 100 miles (160 km) per hour and
heavy rainfall lashed parts of western Britain. In Scotland, snows
closed roads.
	   ``Environmental Agency staff have been working throughout
Christmas Day ... and we have currently got 50 flood warnings
out,'' said an agency spokesman speaking on terms of customary
anonymity.
	   In British-governed Northern Ireland, several people needed
treatment for minor injuries after gales lifted the roof off a
three-story block of flats in County Down, in the eastern part of
the province.
	   In southwestern Ireland, floods and fallen electricity and
telephone poles blocked roads.

Southern beats Bethune-Cookman 28-2 in U.S. college Heritage Bowl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: To be LEAD with results of Missouri vs West Virginia in
Insight.com Bowl &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Ryan Lewis ran 57 yards for a touchdown in the
third quarter and added a 13-yard scoring run, leading Southern to
a 28-2 victory over Bethune-Cookman as the two U.S. college teams
met in Saturday's Heritage Bowl.
	   Lewis finished with 84 yards on seven carries. Steve Wofford
gained 119 yards on 27 carries for Southern and had an 11-yard
scoring run in the first quarter.
	   The Jaguars (9-3) were making their fourth straight Heritage
Bowl appearance as the Southwestern Athletic Conference
representative. Southern has won four of five appearances overall
in the battle of historically black colleges in the Georgia Dome.
	   But they gave up a second-quarter safety, when Wofford was
tackled in the end zone for a 2-yard loss by Abdul Yates, and
struggled on offense until Lewis took a pitch, cut back through the
line, then raced down the right sideline, giving Southern a 14-2
lead 2:10 into the second half.
	   The Wildcats (8-3), making their first postseason appearance in
21 years as the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference representative, had
seven fumbles and four interceptions.
	   They lost starting quarterback Pa'tell Troutman to a knee sprain
in the second quarter. Backup quarterback Randell Foster was
intercepted four times, including Jerry Guye's 35-yard touchdown
return in the fourth quarter. Defensive back Jackie Mitchell had
two interceptions.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will fire on warplanes patroling the
no-fly zones, Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said
Saturday.
	   Speaking on Qatar's Al-Jazeera television, Ramadan was asked if
Iraq would accept the overflights of U.S. and British aircraft that
maintain no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq.
	   ``We say frankly now that any violation of Iraqi airspace will
be met by Iraqi fire,'' Ramadan said.
	   The United States, Britain and France set up the no-fly zones
after the 1991 Gulf War to halt air attacks against Kurdish rebels
in the north and Shiite Muslim rebels in the south.
	   In Washington, National Security Council spokesman P. J.
Crowley, said the United States would not change its policy in the
region because of Ramadan's threat.
	   ``We will continue to enforce the no-fly zones in the north and
the south. Iraq knows that it should not interfere with those
flights, and our pilots can act in self-defense if they feel
threatened at any time.''
	   In London, the Foreign Office said it had no immediate reaction
to Ramadan's threat.
	   The interview was conducted in Baghdad hours after Iraq said
that its anti-aircraft gunners had driven off an attack by
``enemy'' warplanes that flew in from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency did not identify the nationality
of the aircraft, but it usually uses the word ``enemy'' to describe
warplanes from the United States and Britain. Washington and London
denied any attack on Iraq.
	   Asked why Iraq had not fired previously on planes enforcing the
no-fly zones, Ramadan said, ``when you want to restore your rights,
you choose the suitable time and circumstances.''
	   Ramadan said that the U.S. and British aircraft were taking off
from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The United States has
aircraft in both countries. Britain bases aircraft in Kuwait.
	   ``It appears, but we cannot confirm it, that France has for
sometime not been participating in these sorties,'' the vice
president said.
	   French aircraft no longer take part in enforcing the no-fly zone
over northern Iraq but still help to maintain the southern zone.
	   Iraq has never recognized the zones and has occasionally
confronted aircraft flying in the area.
	   The last major incident in the zone was in June. U.S. officials
said that a U.S. F-16 warplane fired a missile at an anti-aircraft
site after Iraqi radar targeted British warplanes patrolling the
zone.
	   Iraq denied that its forces threatened the British aircraft.
	   Crowley said Saturday in Washington that U.S. aircraft had flown
over Iraq, but ``they reported no incidents of fire directed
against them.''
	   He said, however, that ``one aircraft reported anti-aircraft
fire well off in the distance.''
	   In London, a Defense Ministry spokesman said a British pilot on
Saturday ``did sight anti-aircraft fire but he did not consider it
hostile.''
	   ``The Iraqis seem to be loosing off anti-aircraft fire left,
right and center,'' the spokesman said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   State-controlled Iraqi media have issued almost daily reports of
violations of the country's airspace since the United States and
Britain ended four days of airstrikes against Iraq on Dec. 19.
	   The strikes were carried out after U.N. weapons inspectors
released a report saying that Baghdad was blocking their work.
	   Iraq says that 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were
killed in the bombardment.
	   The Iraqi News Agency said that at 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT)
Saturday a formation of warplanes ``attacked one of our air defense
sites, which confronted it and forced it to drop its load
randomly.''
	   The report did not say where the apparent attack took place and
gave no other details.
	   Also Saturday, the Babil newspaper criticized Iraq's most
powerful sympathizers on the U.N. Security Council _ France, Russia
and China _ for not taking stronger action toward easing U.N.
sanctions against Iraq.
	   And the speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly urged Arab states
to break sanctions which he said were inflicting ``great
suffering'' on the Iraqi people.
	   Speaking to reporters after arriving in Amman, Jordan for an
emergency meeting of the Arab Parliamentary union, Saadoun Hammadi
said he hoped the session would produce a unified call for the
lifting of the sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   The Babil newspaper, which is owned by a son of President Saddam
Hussein, said that Russia's and China's positions ``did not
accomplish any positive results for Iraq.''

Louisville beats No.3 Kentucky in U.S. college basketball
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOUISVILLE, Kentucky (AP) _ Marques Maybin scored 19 points,
including seven straight late in the second half, as Louisville
upset No. 3 Kentucky 83-74 for the second straight season Saturday.
	   The Wildcats (10-3), coming off a 71-60 loss to second-ranked
Duke Tuesday, hadn't lost consecutive games since falling to
Arkansas and Syracuse during the 1994 season.
	   The Cardinals (5-2) also surprised Kentucky last year, beating
the heavily favored Wildcats 79-76 in Rupp Arena.
	   Kentucky lost only three games all last season en route to its
second NCAA championship in three years. The Cardinals couldn't
match their performance against the Wildcats and finished 12-20,
only the second losing season in coach Denny Crum's 27 seasons.
	   Cameron Murray and Tony Williams each added 14 points as
Louisville, banned from postseason play by the NCAA earlier this
year, won its third consecutive game.
	   ___
 &UR; No. 16 Clemson 67, Furman 54
	   In Greenville, South Carolina, Harold Jamison had 16 points and
16 rebounds, and Vincent Whitt scored 11 of his 13 points in the
second half as No. 16 Clemson beat Furman 67-54 Saturday.
	   Jamison was 7-of-10 from the field for the Tigers (11-1), who
beat the Paladins (6-4) for the 23rd straight time. It was the
first basketball game at the new Bi-Lo Center, a dlrs 63 million
arena that opened in September.
	   Furman pulled within 43-41 in the second half on a 3-pointer by
Kyle Julius, but Jamison's putback with 12:21 left started a 22-4
run by Clemson.
	   Whitt scored seven points and Clemson's top scorer, Terrell
McIntyre, added two baskets during the streak.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney maxi Marchioness on Monday
joined a list of high-profile retirees early on the second day of
the Sydney to Hobart yacht race.
	   Marchioness, which led with American yacht Sayonara and
Brindabella on Saturday night, was forced out with rig damage off
Eden on the New South Wales state south coast. Australian maxi Wild
Thing pulled out a few hours later with similar problems.
	   Six of the 115-fleet are out of the race, with 38-footer King
Billy also pulling out after damaging its rudder to join ABN AMRO
Challenge, Sydney and Sledgehammer back in port.
	   At the front, maxis Brindabella and Sayonara were within sight
of each other near Gabo Island and about to enter Bass Strait for
the journey to island state of Tasmania and its capital Hobart.
	   Challenge Again has resumed racing after recovering a crew
member earlier lost overboard.
	   The leading boats were traveling at 15 knots and well inside the
1996 race record set by German maxi Morning Glory of 2 days, 14
hours, 7 minutes and 10 seconds.
	   On Saturday, a crowd of about 300,000 people on the Sydney
headlands and harbor witnessed the start of the annual blue-water
classic. (djp)

 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Saturday denied Palestinian charges that he had suspended the Wye
River peace accord because of upcoming elections, saying the
Palestinians were responsible for the freeze.
	   Netanyahu told Israel Radio he would implement the 2-month-old
U.S.-brokered accord once the Palestinians did their part,
including collecting illegal weapons held by Palestinian police and
civilians.
	   Netanyahu criticized the Palestinian Authority for releasing
Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin from house arrest
Wednesday, and for the escape from a Nablus jail earlier this week
of Jamil Jidala, a Palestinian jailed for killing two Israelis.
	   On Dec. 2, Israel announced it was freezing the accord because
of what it alleged were Palestinian violations. It also refused to
go ahead with promised troop pullbacks from the West Bank unless
the Palestinians met a series of conditions, including renouncing
plans to declare statehood in May.
	   The Palestinians have suggested that early elections for prime
minister, triggered by lawmakers' rejection of Netanyahu's peace
policies, were responsible for the freeze. How the peace pact
should be implemented _ or whether it should be implemented at all
_ is already a major campaign issue in the elections, expected by
late April.
	   Speaking after Friday night's meeting of the Palestinian Cabinet
in the West Bank town of Hebron, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat said the Israeli government was still responsible for
carrying out its commitments under the accord.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet said in a statement following the
meeting that it would continue making preparations for a statehood
declaration in May. The Palestinians also said they would seek help
from the Arab world and the rest of the international community
over the freezing of the peace process.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet called Israeli noncompliance with the
accord a ``dangerous development which was initiated by the Israeli
government without any reason besides its rejection of peace.''
	   Meanwhile, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo on Saturday to discuss the frozen
agreement.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The well-known Lebanese belly dancer
Danny Bustros died of a gunshot wound to the head Saturday, police
said.
	   Bustros, who was in her early forties, died in a hospital north
of Beirut from a brain hemorrhage caused by a pistol bullet.
	   Police were investigating the death to see whether it was a case
of suicide or murder, a policeman said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The private television channel Murr reported that police were
questioning a male foreigner and a Filipino maid who were at
Bustros' house, north of Beirut, when the shooting occurred.
	   The channel did not elaborate.
	   Bustros, who came from a prominent Lebanese Christian family,
began her dancing career at a young age.
	   She was well known in the Arab world for mixing traditional Arab
belly dancing with her own modern style of dancing.
	   Her most famous role was in a musical based on the opera Carmen
that was staged in 1996 and featured the Lebanese singer Melhem
Barakat.

U.N. plane with 14 on board crashes in Angola
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A U.N. aircraft with 14 people on board
reportedly crashed Saturday in Angola in an area where the
government's army has been fighting UNITA rebels, a U.N. spokesman
said.
	   There was no word on whether any of the four crew members and 10
passengers had survived. There was also no immediate information on
the cause of the crash.
	   The Portuguese news agency Lusa said the aircraft burst into
flames shortly after take-off at noon (1100 gmt) from Huambo, some
500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda, and
crashed 40 kilometers (25 miles) away in Vila Nova.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed to the Angolan government
and UNITA to enable members of the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola
to go to the crash site and assist in search and rescue operations.
	   According to preliminary information from government sources in
Huambo, the C-130 probably went down in an area east of Vila Nova,
the U.N. spokesman said.
	   The Portuguese news agency said U.N. military observers were
among the passengers. There was no confirmation from the United
Nations.
	   The plane, owned by TransAfric and chartered by the U.N., was
headed for Saurimo, in the province of Lunda Sul, about 630
kilometers (390 miles) east of Huambo, according to the news
agency.
	   The secretary-general also called on the two parties to
cooperate in a full investigation of the crash, the spokesman said.
	   The U.N. Security Council has expressed dismay that Angola
appears headed back to civil war, which has ravaged the southern
African nation for most of its nearly quarter-century of
independence.
	   The fighting has sent more than 50,000 people fleeing from their
homes in the central highlands.
	   Diplomats have been unable to get both sides to adhere to a 1994
peace accord. It called for UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence for Angola _ to hand
areas under its control to the government. However, lingering
hostility between the two sides has hindered implementation of the
deal.
	   The council on Wednesday again accused Angolan rebel leaders of
undermining the peace process and demanded an immediate end to the
fighting.
	   A statement adopted by consensus reaffirmed the council's firm
commitment to preserve Angola's unity and reiterated that ``only a
political settlement ... will bring a lasting peace to Angola.''

Clinton extended the zone in response to Saddam's military
intervention in northern Iraq in support of one Kurdish faction
against another. The zone now covers the southern third of Iraq,
reaching the 33rd parallel, and touches the outskirts of Baghdad.
	   NORTHERN NO-FLY ZONE: In April 1991, the United States, France
and Britain declared a 19,000-square-mile (49,210-square-kilometer)
area of northern Iraq a haven for Kurds and imposed a no-fly zone
above the 36th parallel. U.S. and British warplanes still patrol
the skies of northern Iraq. France withdrew from the mission in
1996.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will fire on U.S. and British
warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones that the United States and
its allies imposed after the Persian Gulf War, Iraq's vice
president said Saturday.
	   Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan told Qatar's Al-Jazeera
television that Iraq would not allow the flights of U.S. and
British aircraft in the zones over northern and southern Iraq.
	   ``We say frankly now that any violation of Iraqi airspace will
be met by Iraqi fire,'' Ramadan said.
	   The United States, Britain and France set up the no-fly zones in
1991-92 to halt air attacks against Kurdish rebels in the north and
Shiite Muslim rebels in the south.
	   French aircraft no longer take part in enforcing the no-fly zone
over northern Iraq, but still help to maintain the southern zone.
	   Ramadan, however, seemed unclear about French participation.
	   ``It appears, but we cannot confirm it, that France has for
sometime not been participating in these sorties,'' he said.
	   Iraq has never recognized the zones and has occasionally
confronted aircraft flying in the area.
	   In Washington, National Security Council spokesman P. J. Crowley
said the threat would not compel the United States to change its
policy in the region.
	   ``We will continue to enforce the no-fly zones in the north and
the south,'' Crowley said. ``Iraq knows that it should not
interfere with those flights, and our pilots can act in
self-defense if they feel threatened at any time.''
	   Crowley said U.S. aircraft had flown over Iraq but ``reported no
incidents of fire directed against them,'' although one aircraft
``reported anti-aircraft fire well off in the distance.''
	   Defense Department spokesman Army Maj. Paul Phillips said there
would be no change in the pilots' mission in sourthern Iraq.
	   ``Iraq understands its responsibilities. Our aircraft maintain a
high level of capablity and the ability to respond to threats,'' he
said.
	   In London, a Defense Ministry spokesman said on condition of
anonymity that a British pilot Saturday ``did sight anti-aircraft
fire but he did not consider it hostile.''
	   There was no immediate reaction from Britain's Foreign Office.
	   Ramadan's interview was conducted in Baghdad hours after Iraq
said its anti-aircraft gunners had driven off an attack by
``enemy'' warplanes that flew in from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency did not identify the nationality
of the aircraft, but it usually uses the word ``enemy'' to describe
warplanes from the United States and Britain. Washington and London
denied any attacks on Iraq.
	   The United States has aircraft in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
Britain also bases aircraft in Kuwait.
	   Asked why Iraq had not fired previously on planes enforcing the
no-fly zones, Ramadan said, ``When you want to restore your rights,
you choose the suitable time and circumstances.''
	   State-controlled Iraqi media have issued almost daily reports of
violations of the country's airspace since the United States and
Britain ended four days of airstrikes against Iraq on Dec. 19.
	   The strikes were carried out after U.N. weapons inspectors
released a report saying that Baghdad was blocking their work.
	   Iraq has said 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were killed
in the bombardment.
	   The Iraqi News Agency said a formation of warplanes Saturday
``attacked one of our air defense sites, which confronted it and
forced it to drop its load randomly.''
	   The report did not say where the apparent attack took place and
gave no other details.
	   Also Saturday, the Babil newspaper criticized Iraq's most
powerful sympathizers on the U.N. Security Council _ France, Russia
and China _ for not taking stronger action toward easing U.N.
sanctions against Iraq.
	   The newspaper, owned by a son of President Saddam Hussein, said
that Russia's and China's positions ``did not accomplish any
positive results for Iraq.''
	   It added that the ``fluctuation of the French stand has made us
wonder if they are with us or against us.''
	   Security Council diplomats have said the sweeping sanctions _
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 _ will not be lifted
until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has dismantled its programs
to build weapons of mass destruction.
	   France, Russia and China, along with the United States and
Britain, are permanent members of the Security Council.
	   The last major incident in the no-fly zone was in June. U.S.
officials said that a U.S. F-16 warplane fired a missile at an
anti-aircraft site after Iraqi radar targeted British warplanes
patrolling the zone. Iraq denied that its forces threatened the
British aircraft.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Police in Britain and Ireland said Saturday that
one man was dead with two more feared dead and several injured as
both countries were battered by high wind and rain.
	   Police said one man was killed in County Galway, western
Ireland, when a falling tree crushed his car.

author (1875-1955).

Netanyahu denies elections are stalling peace pact

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 13-14 with comments from Egyptian foreign
minister after Mubarak-Arafat meeting &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday
denied Palestinian charges that he suspended the Wye River peace
accord because of upcoming elections, saying that Palestinian
noncompliance is responsible for the freeze.
	   Netanyahu told Israel Radio that he would implement the 2-month
old U.S.-brokered accord once the Palestinians did their part,
including collecting illegal weapons held by Palestinian police and
civilians.
	   Netanyahu criticized the Palestinian Authority for releasing
Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin from house arrest on
Wednesday and permitting a Palestinian jailed for killing two
Israelis to have ``passed through the revolving door, exited, and
escaped outside,'' the radio said.
	   The Palestinian Authority was carrying out a manhunt for Jamil
Jidala who escaped from a Nablus jail earlier this week.
	   The Palestinians suggested early elections for prime minister,
expected by late April, were responsible for the freeze.
	   ``This Israeli government continues to be a government,
responsible for its commitments,'' chief Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said after Friday night's meeting of the Palestinian
Cabinet in the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   The call for early elections was triggered by lawmakers'
rejection of Netanyahu's peace policies, and how and whether to
implement the peace pact is already a major campaign issue.
	   Israel has refused to go ahead with promised troop pull backs
from the West Bank unless the Palestinians meet a series of
conditions. Those include a renunciation of Palestinian claims to
the right to declare statehood in May 1999 whether or not terms
have been agreed on with Israel.
	   But the Palestinian Cabinet said in a statement following its
meeting that it would continue making preparations for a statehood
declaration in May.
	   The Palestinians also said they would seek help from the Arab
world and the rest of the international community to ``confront the
freezing of the peace process.
	   The Cabinet called Israeli noncompliance with the accord a
``dangerous development which was initiated by the Israeli
government without any reason besides its rejection of peace.''
	   Saturday, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo to discuss the frozen agreement.
	   Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said afterwards that he
expects the United States to put pressure on Israel to implement
the agreement, especially the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the
West Bank.
	   ``The Israeli government is supposed to implement the Wye River
accord because it is the government that signed the agreement,''
Moussa told reporters in Cairo.

New Zealand 132 for three at lunch on the second day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ India dropped four catches but
took two crucial wickets in New Zealand's run chase on day two of
their test match at Basin Reserve on Sunday.
	   After India had been shot out for 208 on the first day, New
Zealand resuming on 52 for one, progressed to 132 for three at
lunch on the second day.
	   Leg spinner Anil Kumble produced a crucial blow before the
break, removing an obdurate Matthew Horne, who scored 38 runs in
190 minutes.
	   Horne and skipper Stephen Fleming (42) continued where they left
off Saturday in the second wicket stand, extending it to 72 before
disaster struck.
	   The pair came together after test debutant Matthew Bell was
dismissed for four on the first evening.
	   Fleming, who had batted faultlessly for almost two hours was
needlessly run out going for a second run which was never on.
	   Fleming failed to beat an Ajay Jadeja throw from square leg and
New Zealand was 79 for two in the 46th over.
	   New Zealand would have been in further trouble hadn't the
Indians grassed four catches, three of them by vice-captain Jadeja.
	   Horne dropped on 22 and 27 was finally beaten by a Kumble top
spinner that hurried on the opener and bowled him.
	   Craig McMillan dropped by Jadeja at short leg off Kumble was
unbeaten on 13 while an out-of-form Nathan Astle has batted for 80
minutes for his unbeaten 20 runs.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Holiday visitors were barred from entering the Arc
de Triomphe on Saturday, after museum attendants there walked off
the job to demand the government hire more staff, officials said.
	   The strike that began Saturday morning was expected to last
through the weekend and into the following week, pending talks
between unions and the Culture Ministry, a ministry spokesman said.
	   Like employees at other Paris museums in recent weeks, the staff
went on strike to press the government to hire more employees to
keep up with a rising number of visitors, the spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
	   Employees have also complained that conditions were more
difficult than at other Paris cultural sites, due to the noise and
pollution from the traffic circle surrounding the monument and the
cramped spaces inside the Arc, the spokesman said.
	   Officials expected to reach an agreement early in the week, he
said. Union officials could not be reached for comment.

	   AUGUSTA, Georgia (AP) _ The Godfather of Soul is feeling more
like a grandfather these days.
	   ``I got an upper plate put in,'' James Brown said during his
sixth annual Christmas Party. ``I used to have a gap between my
front teeth. Now that that's gone, I can't hit the high notes. I
lost two octaves.''
	   However, the 65-year-old singer claimed at his midweek party in
Augusta that he can still do on-stage splits.
	   ``But I don't have to,'' he said.
	    &UR; ___
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ A German couple out for a Christmas
drive near Berlin ended up in a river _ apparently because their
luxury car's computer forgot to mention they had to wait for a
ferry.
	   The 57-year-old driver and his passenger were not injured in the
accident, police said Saturday.
	   Several companies sell computer navigators, some of which are
attached to dashboards and serve as electronic road maps. Some
offer traffic updates and Internet connections.
	   The German couple was out driving Friday night when they came to
a ferry crossing at the Havel River in Caputh, six miles from
Berlin.
	   That information, however, was never stored in the
satellite-steered navigation system they were using, police said.
The driver kept going straight in the dark, expecting a bridge, and
ended up in the water.
	   River traffic was stopped for two hours while the car was fished
out about 4 meters (13 feet) from the river bank.
	   ``You can't always blindly rely on technology,'' a coast guard
police officer said.
	    &UR; ___
	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ After a bout with the flu and the
demands of Christmas appearances, Pope John Paul II bantered with
pilgrims Saturday as he began a brief holiday southeast of Rome.
	   John Paul scheduled a late morning helicopter flight Saturday
for Castel Gandolfo, a lakeside town where he will spend his
holiday break.
	   The pope, who is to spend a few days in the town, seemed rested
and in good spirits in the crisp, sunny day. Last week, the Vatican
announced that the pope had canceled some private audiences because
of a light flu and fever.
	   On Christmas Eve, the pope celebrated midnight Mass, which
lasted into the early hours of the next day. He also addressed the
public gathered in St. Peter's Square at noon on Christmas Day.
	    &UR; ___
	   IRVINE, California (AP) _ Taco Bell's Chihuahua is one hot dog.
	   So far, consumers have bought 13 million promotional plush toys
modeled on the pop-eyed TV mascot, and the Irvine-based fast-food
chain has ordered another 10 million at up to dlrs 3.99 each.
	   ``Everybody I know wants them,'' said Trasia Barnes, whose
9-year-old daughter, Shannon Bloom, owns a Chihuahua that gives the
Christmas greeting ``Feliz Navidad, amigos.''
	   Three other versions repeat catch phrases from the TV
commercials: ``Yo quiero Taco Bell,'' ``Viva gorditas'' and ``Here,
lizard, lizard'' _ which the pooch says as he tries to trap
Godzilla in a tie-in with the movie.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ Iraq will fire on U.S. and British warplanes
patrolling the no-fly zones that the United States and its allies
imposed after the Gulf War, Iraq's vice president said Saturday.
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan told Qatar's Al-Jazeera
television that Iraq would not allow the flights of U.S. and
British aircraft in the zones over northern and southern Iraq. The
United States, Britain and France set up the no-fly zones in
1991-92 to halt air attacks against Kurdish rebels in the north and
Shiite Muslim rebels in the south. U.S. officials said say they
will continue to enforce the no-fly zone. ``Our pilots can act in
self-defense if they feel threatened at any time,'' said National
Security Council spokesman P. J. Crowley. (IRAQ)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The defections of two key Khmer
Rouge guerrilla leaders Saturday left only the brutal, one-legged
general Ta Mok holding out in Cambodian jungles. Known as ``The
Butcher,'' Ta Mok is hiding with less than 100 die-hard loyalists,
said a military official in Thailand, which closely monitors Khmer
Rouge activities. ``The Cambodian government's attitude is to let
him (Ta Mok) grow old and die by himself. It's not worth the money
to chase him,'' Thai Maj. Gen Wiwat Sattarak said. The two Khmer
Rouge leaders who defected to the Cambodian government included
Khieu Samphan, who for decades posed as a moderate front man for a
gang counted among history's worst killers. The other leader was
Nuon Chea, once the second-in-command to the late Khmer Rouge
leader Pol Pot. (CAMBODIA-KHMER ROUGE)
	   UNITED NATIONS _ A U.N. aircraft with 14 people on board
reportedly crashed in Angola Saturday in an area where heavy
fighting was continuing between UNITA rebels and government forces,
a U.N. spokesman said. There was no word on whether the four crew
members and 10 passengers had survived. There was also no immediate
information on whether the plane was shot down or suffered
mechanical failure. The Portuguese news agency Lusa said the
aircraft burst into flames shortly after take-off from Huambo, some
500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda, and
crashed 40 kilometers (25 miles) away in Vila Nova.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged the Angolan government and UNITA
to allow members of the U.N. Observer Mission to go to the scene to
assist in search and rescue operations. (UN-ANGOLA)
	   LAPASTICA, Yugoslavia _ Hundreds of refugees fleeing renewed
fighting in northern Kosovo congregated Saturday in a regional
ethnic Albanian guerrilla stronghold, crowding into houses by the
dozens to escape bitterly cold weather. After a two-day crackdown
by Serb police and Yugoslav army units, most refugees in the area
west of Podujevo made their way to Lapastica, a village still held
by the Kosovo Liberation Army. A Serb farmer was killed near
Podujevo and Albanian sources reported a police attack in the same
region. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday denied
Palestinian charges that he suspended the Wye River peace accord
because of upcoming elections, saying that Palestinian
noncompliance is responsible for the freeze. Netanyahu told Israel
Radio that he would implement the 2-month old U.S.-brokered accord
once the Palestinians did their part, including collecting illegal
weapons held by Palestinian police and civilians. The Israeli
president criticized the Palestinian Authority for releasing Hamas
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin from house arrest on Wednesday
and permitting a Palestinian jailed for killing two Israelis to
have ``passed through the revolving door, exited, and escaped
outside,'' the radio said. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Shootouts between drug traffickers
and police in two shantytowns left five people dead, including a
gang leader, police said Saturday.
	   The violence began after police arrived at the Cerro Cora slum
to investigate gunfire at a local dance and were shot at by
traffickers who control the slum's drug trade, police said.
	   The confrontation continued into nearby Pereirao slum for
another two hours and ended with the death of gang leader Claudio
Passos da Rocha and four other traffickers.
	   In the aftermath, police seized several machine guns, pistols
and large quantities of marijuana.
	   Drug traffickers control Rio's estimated 600 slums. As a result,
many police are afraid to enter slums.
	   ___
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ An Argentine federal judge has
asked Syria to extradite a former customs director at Buenos Aires'
international airport to stand trial on charges of money
laundering.
	   The Buenos Aires daily newspaper Clarin on Saturday quoted
Argentina's ambassador to Syria, Juan Pardo Argerich, as saying he
relayed the request 20 days ago for the extradition of Ibrahim al
Ibrahim.
	   Ibrahim, a Syrian citizen and former brother-in-law of Argentine
President Carlos Menem, was named director of customs at Ezeiza
International Airport in 1989.
	   A year later, a drug trafficker arrested in Spain told a judge
that Ibrahim and his then-wife Amira Yoma, sister of former
Argentine first lady Zulema Yoma, were part of a gang of money
launderers.
	   Ibrahim fled the country in 1992 using a forged passport.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Taking advantage of lax holiday
vigilance, prisoners escaped from three Sao Paulo police lockups
Saturday, the Brazilian media reported.
	   At a police holding cell in the northern part of the city, 89
inmates escaped at dawn through a hole they had pounded through a
wall before climbing onto the jail roof and leaping to freedom.
	   At the time, not one guard was on duty, reported Globo TV News.
	   Twenty-two prisoners escaped from the Santa Isabel jail, while
10 more escaped from another police facility.
	   Sao Paulo, Brazil's richest and most populous state, has the
nation's most prisoners _ some 70,000 _ of whom 30,000 are held in
police lockups and jails, according to Human Rights Watch.
	   In most cases, outbreaks are caused by overcrowding.
	   Brazil's prisons are usually full, so authorities send convicts
to jails or lockups meant to hold suspects awaiting trial for a
short time. It is not uncommon for such lockups to have 200 people
in a space designed for 40, human rights groups say.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican authorities said Saturday they have
arrested a U.S. insurance company executive accused of
participating in a bankruptcy fraud scheme in Oklahoma.
	   Donald Phillip Havenar was arrested in the northwestern city of
Hermosillo, Sonora, outside an insurance business he owned,
Servicios Administrativos de la Frontera de R.L de C.V., the
Mexican attorney general's office said in a statement.
	   It did not say when the arrest took place.
	   Havenar, chief executive officer and president of First
Assurance and Casualty Co. Ltd, is one of five executives accused
of diverting nearly dlrs 7 million in policyholder payments to
themselves and companies they controlled.
	   The defendants allegedly sold insurance policies through First
Assurance but did not maintain enough funds to pay claims.
	   The other four suspects have pleaded innocent.
	   Havenar was transferred to a prison in Mexico City to facing
extradition proceedings.

Former IRA chief of staff dies aged 75
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Cathal Goulding, former chief of staff of
the Irish Republican Army, died in a Dublin hospital Saturday aged
75, Britain's national news agency, Press Association, has
reported.
	   A cause of death, and funeral details, were not immediately
known.
	   Goulding, a committed Marxist, was the IRA's commander in 1969
when the paramilitary group split.
	   Goulding's poorly armed and organized IRA was unwilling to
launch insurrection in British-ruled Northern Ireland in the late
1960s, and after a bloody feud younger Catholic militants such as
Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness broke away to form the
``Provisional'' IRA and Sinn Fein.
	   Under Goulding's direction Official IRA called a ceasefire in
1972. He became highly critical of the ''Provisionals,'' saying
that violence in Northern Ireland was sectarian, and made Irish
unity more difficult.
	   Gouldling was born in Dublin in 1922 from a family with strong
IRA links, and was interned by the Irish government during World
War II for his membership of the group. He was involved in the
revival of the organization after 1945, and in 1953 was jailed for
eight years in Britain for an arms raid on a school in England.
	   After its ceasefire, the Official IRA was involved in feuds with
other anti-British militant gangs such as the Irish National
Liberation Army, after that small but violent group shot dead an
Official IRA member in February 1975.
	   Today, the Official IRA is affiliated with the Workers' Party,
and has a small number of gunmen running rackets in Catholic parts
of Belfast.
	   Goulding was also a member of the Workers' Party ruling
executive, eventually formed by the ``official'' arm of Sinn Fein.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ What a world we live in. So many lawyers who
want to be famous. So many actors who want to play lawyers. And why
not? As the entertaining ``A Civil Action'' shows, schools of
lawyering are not so different from schools of acting. In fact,
they can remind you of entire civilizations.
	   As a Boston personal-injury attorney, John Travolta embodies the
external school of lawyering/acting. Let's say he represents the
West. His voice is thin, hard, impatient. You always know what he's
thinking about, which is himself. He has a short temper. He wears
nice clothes. He wants to be famous. He is a very rich man.
	   His rival, a trial litigator and Harvard University professor,
is played by the cagey Robert Duvall. His is the internal, Eastern
style. His voice is soothing, but confounding. Everything he does
is meant to distract you from what he's thinking about, which is
also himself. He smiles a lot. He carries an old briefcase. He
likes to toss tennis balls. He is a very rich man.
	   Both are bad when the story begins, and one will be good when
it's over. You can figure that out by guessing who's played by the
bigger star. That he becomes good with no real change in
personality shouldn't surprise you. Studio bosses probably think it
works that way.
	   Travolta's character is named Jan Schlichtmann (pronounced, at
times, as ``Slickman''). He has agreed reluctantly to meet with
some residents in the city of Woburn, Massachusetts. Several fatal
cases of leukemia have been reported there in the past few years
and the community is sure toxic solvents have seeped into the
water.
	   Schlichtmann is ready to give them the brush-off, but he learns
that two major corporations, Beatrice Foods and W.R. Grace and Co.,
may be responsible. Money is to be had. But it soon becomes about
principle.
	   Like so many crusaders of the West, Schlichtmann must detach
himself from worldly possessions. All the firm's resources go into
this case. He loses his staff, his office furniture, his partners.
His house is mortgaged. You expect him to show up for work in his
underwear. You expect almost anything, which is really part of the
fun.
	   The story, set in the 1980s, is based on Jonathan Harr's
nonfiction best seller. That's also part of the fun. Only Hollywood
can take a true story and make it seem like fiction. Why, for
example, does Schlichtmann get so moved by these people when he's
spent his entire career making money off of suffering clients? And
if he's so moved, how come he never seems to spend time with them?
	   Steve Zaillian, screenwriter for ``Schindler's List,'' wrote and
directed this time. To his credit, he does not mistake ``A Civil
Action'' for the previous film. He just keeps the story moving and
lets the actors work. Travolta's narration sets a cynical tone:
feeling the pain of your clients, he warns, is like a doctor
recoiling at the sight of blood.
	   The supporting performances are a real bonus: William H. Macy as
Schlictmann's long-suffering accountant, John Lithgow as an
imperious judge, Bruce Norris as a lawyer named William Cheeseman
and, best of all, Sydney Pollack as an unnervingly confident
corporate executive, the kind who negotiates settlements with his
feet resting on a creaky antique table.
	   The real Jan Schlichtmann, by the way, is still practicing in
Boston and now has a wife and two sons. They live, according to the
production notes, ``in a beautiful home overlooking the ocean in
the suburb of Beverly.''
	   ``A Civil Action,'' a joint release of Touchstone Pictures and
Paramount Pictures, was produced by Scott Rudin, Robert Redford and
Rachel Pfeffer. The running time is 113 minutes.

`Civil Action' lawyer has moved on in life

 &UR; With ARTS-Film Review-Civil Action &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM KIRCHOFER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ As a young lawyer in the early 1980s, Jan
Schlichtmann wore dlrs 1,000 suits, drove a late model Porsche and
took what he now recognizes as unnecessary risks as he fought for
justice.
	   It was a game of win or lose, and in representing clients
injured in accidents, he passed up reasonable settlement offers
from defendants to gamble on getting bigger paybacks from juries.
	   But then a case landed on his desk that shattered his finances,
nearly cost him his sanity and ultimately led him to realize that
there is a better way to practice law.
	   That case involved children in Woburn who were dying of
leukemia; parents suspected drinking water wells had been
contaminated with industrial waste. Schlichtmann took their case
and sued two corporate behemoths. As he put it, ``Woburn was a
war.''
	   The story of the courtroom showdown became the subject of the
best-selling book, ``A Civil Action.'' It comes to the big screen
this month as a Touchstone Pictures film, with John Travolta
starring as Schlichtmann.
	   ``Woburn was a defining moment in my life,'' Schlichtmann said.
``I came out with a whole different way of looking at the world
which has fundamentally changed me as a human being and as a
lawyer.''
	   The case pitted Schlichtmann and the parents of several children
killed by leukemia against Beatrice Foods and multinational
chemical corporation W.R. Grace, which were accused of improperly
disposing of toxins.
	   Schlichtmann's colleagues warned him the case was a ``black
hole,'' but he pursued it for more than five years. It consumed
him, leaving both him and his firm bankrupt.
	   A jury never found the companies liable. Beatrice was let off
the hook, and W.R. Grace settled with the families for dlrs 8
million, but the company never admitted any wrongdoing.
	   ``I realize now that while that would have been nice, there are
more sustaining victories,'' he said. ``The greatest victories are
those that can be shared with everyone.''
	   Schlichtmann, 47, still takes environmental cases. He is now
representing 60 families in Toms River, New Jersey, who believe
their water was contaminated by two companies, causing a cluster of
cancer cases.
	   A woman from Toms River contacted him after reading ``A Civil
Action,'' but he says he is approaching the latest case in a much
different way.
	   ``We went and knocked on the doors of the lawyers for the
companies,'' he said. ``We would try and be cooperative, in the
hopes that by the sharing of information, we'll all be able to help
each other.''
	   And he says the strategy seems to be working. The parties agreed
to an 18-month moratorium on lawsuits as they work toward an
agreement.
	   While today's Schlichtmann still has a fiery intensity and
speaks passionately about his belief in the law and the pursuit of
truth, he seems to have mellowed with age.
	   Schlichtmann, 47, drives a station wagon with two car seats in
the back to chauffeur around his sons, 3-year-old Max and
2-year-old Zak. His Porsche was repossessed during the Woburn case.
	   He lives with the boys and his wife, Claudia, in Beverly and
seems far removed from the flashy young lawyer he once was.
	   ``I loved life. I was successful, I liked my profession. I had
great confidence in my talents and abilities,'' he said. ``I liked
representing people, and if I won, being well paid for it. I liked
all the things that money could buy.''

Stewart digs in against Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ England captain Alec Stewart made
the most of his return as an opening batsman by taking the fight up
to Australia on the second day of the fourth cricket test at the
MCG on Sunday.
	   Stewart watched his team slump to four for two wickets in the
third over but scored an unbeaten 78 in a first session extended by
30 minutes after Saturday's opening day was washed out.
	   At lunch, England was 127 for three with Mark Ramprakash on 19.
	   With England 2-0 down with two games to play in the series,
Stewart gave up the wicketkeeping gloves to give a debut to Warren
Hegg. The decision allowed him to reunite with Mike Atherton at the
top of the order.
	   Their union lasted just five balls before Atherton (0) fell to
Glenn McGrath for the 10th time in his past 19 innings against the
Australians.
	   Atherton was clearly upset by the decision after he was given
out edging through to Ian Healy.
	   McGrath struck again in his next over when No. 3 Mark Butcher
(0) played forward and nicked an inside edge onto his front pad and
Justin Langer snared a sharp catch at short leg.
	   Stewart played a positive innings, hooking and pulling strongly
whenever the Australians dropped short.
	   He brought up his 50 off just 66 balls, slapping a full toss
from leg-spinner Stuart MacGill down the ground for four.
	   Stewart put on 77 with Nasser Hussain (19) before the No.4 gave
Matthew Nicholson a first test wicket on debut.
	   Nicholson was smashed for 11 off his opening over but recovered
in his fifth to get an edge from Hussain which gave world
record-holder Healy his 350th test dismissal.
	   Australian captain Mark Taylor won the toss Saturday before the
entire day's play was lost and the pitch appeared to be settling
into a good batting strip. An extra half hour will be added to the
start and finish of each day to make up for lost time.

In new challenge, Iraq says it will fire on planes in no-fly zone
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs and UPDATES with British Defense Ministry statement
in 4th graf
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101-106 &QL; 
 &UR; By LOUIS MEIXLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In its latest challenge to the United
States and Britain, Iraq declared that it will fire on warplanes
patrolling the no-fly zones that Washington and its allies imposed
after the Gulf War.
	   The United States and Britain said their aircraft would continue
to enforce the no-fly zones and pilots would respond to any
threats.
	   ``Iraq knows that it should not interfere with those flights,
and our pilots can act in self-defense if they feel threatened at
any time,'' National Security Council spokesman P. J. Crowley said
in Washington.
	   A Ministry of Defense spokesman in London said all British and
American aircraft ``operate to a very strict set of rules of
engagement. If aircraft are threatened those rules of engagement do
allow the return of fire.''
	   The United States, Britain and France set up the no-fly zones in
1991-92 to halt air attacks against Kurdish rebels in the north and
Shiite Muslim rebels in the south. French aircraft no longer patrol
the northern zone, but still help to maintain the southern zone.
	   A week after a U.S.-British bombing campaign against Iraq ended,
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said his government would
not allow flights over northern and southern Iraq.
	   ``We say frankly now that any violation of Iraqi airspace will
be met by Iraqi fire,'' Ramadan told Qatar's Al-Jazeera television
Saturday.
	   Iraq has never recognized the zones and has occasionally
confronted aircraft flying in the area.
	   Asked why Iraq had not fired previously on planes enforcing the
no-fly zones, Ramadan said, ``When you want to restore your rights,
you choose the suitable time and circumstances.''
	   State-controlled Iraqi media have issued almost daily reports of
violations of the country's airspace since the United States and
Britain ended four days of airstrikes on Dec. 19.
	   Ramadan's interview was conducted in Baghdad hours after Iraq
said its anti-aircraft gunners had driven off an attack by
``enemy'' warplanes trying to hit an air defense site.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency said the planes flew in from
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait but it did not identify their nationality.
	   Iraq usually uses the word ``enemy'' to describe warplanes from
the United States and Britain. The United States and Britain base
aircraft in Kuwait and the United States also has aircraft in Saudi
Arabia.
	   Washington and London denied any attacks on Iraq.
	   In London, a Defense Ministry spokesman speaking with customary
anonymity said a British pilot Saturday ``did sight anti-aircraft
fire but he did not consider it hostile.''
	   The United States and Britain launched the attacks after U.N.
weapons inspectors released a report saying Baghdad had not fully
cooperated as it promised in November when airstrikes were called
off.
	   Iraq has said the inspectors will not be allowed to return.

Lawyers express doubt about police claims that drug suspect killed
</HEADLINE>
himself &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Police said an alleged drug lord who
accused three prominent police officials of having ties to the drug
world hanged himself in a detention center Saturday, but the man's
lawyers expressed doubts about whether he committed suicide,
according to the Anatolia news agency.
	   Huseyin Uzun, who was wanted by police on drug smuggling
charges, surrendered to police last week and immediately accused
the three police officials of links to the drug world, igniting a
controversy over ties between state officials and organized crime.
	   A court refused to investigate the officers saying the evidence
against them was insufficient, Anatolia said.
	   Turkey is a major transit point for drugs moving from
Afghanistan through Europe and North America.
	   Police said Uzun hanged himself in a toilet with strips of his
blanket.
	   ``I saw the scene, it is very surprising,'' said Zekai Sems, one
of Uzun's lawyers.
	   Another lawyer, Haci Ibrahimoglu, said that committing suicide
with pieces of a blanket was quite difficult, the news agency said.
	   Istanbul police chief Hasan Ozdemir said an investigation has
been launched into Uzun's death.
	   A car crash two years ago confirmed for the first time what many
Turks long suspected _ that state officials entertained close
relations with mobsters. A fugitive terrorist, a police chief and a
deputy were all riding in the same car.
	   The wreck set off a chain reaction of investigations and
allegations which led to the sacking of several policemen, the
trial of two deputies including a former interior minister, and the
collapse of the government of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz last
month.

New studios push Australia onto the mainstream moviemaking stage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ In the upcoming science fiction
thriller ``The Matrix,'' Keanu Reeves' character comes to believe
the city in which he lives has been generated by evil computers.
The backdrop is Australia's largest city: Sydney.
	   In the gothic ``Dark City,'' a section of Sydney's oldest
district forms part of the grim location of the title, where aliens
have created a metropolis floating in space to conduct bizarre
experiments on human behavior.
	   In each case, the scene is generic, anonymous: it could be
anywhere.
	   But the relative anonymity of Sydney, and Australia more
generally, as a film location may be about to change as a rash of
new major production facilities and movie deals with big Hollywood
studios push Australia out of the wings and onto center stage as an
international filmmaking center.
	   Already known as a source of quirky independent films such as
the Academy Award-winning ``Shine'' and ``Strictly Ballroom,''
Australia is increasingly a place where Hollywood blockbusters are
made.
	   The recent announcement by ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas
that the next two chapters in his six-part space epic will be made
in Australia, each with a budget of around U.S. dlrs 120 million
(Australian dollars 190 million), has confirmed Sydney's future as
a film-making center.
	   ``This is one of the most competitive screen making capitals in
the world,'' said Rick McCallum, producer of the Star Wars prequel
trilogy, during a Sydney visit in November.
	   ``It's not about the exchange rate, it is about the talent that
we can get.''
	   McCallum spent more than 12 months negotiating with executives
of Fox Studios Australia, a 50-50 joint venture between global
media magnate Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and property development
company Lend Lease Corp.
	   The studio, boasting six sound stages and comprehensive post
production services, is in large part behind the surge in
international film production in Australia.
	   It officially opened only this year, but already the two biggest
films made in Australia to date _ the Australian dollars 95 million
(U.S. dlrs 60 million) ``Matrix'' and the Australian dollars 90
million (U.S. dlrs 57 million) sequel to the 1996 hit ``Babe'' _
have been made there.
	   In addition, the multimillion-dollar television series
``Farscape'' is being made by the Jim Henson Co., named after the
late ``Muppets'' creator.
	   Negotiations are reportedly under way for a sequel to ``Mission:
Impossible'' starring Tom Cruise and a version of Ray Bradbury's
``Fahrenheit 451'' by Australian-born star Mel Gibson.
	   At the Warner Bros. Roadshow Movieworld studio and theme park
complex in Queensland state, major U.S.-backed movie productions
have included World War II film ``The Thin Red Line'' starring Sean
Penn and the Australian dollars 31 million science fiction feature
``Pitch Black,'' directed by American David Twohy.
	   HBO movies and television series are also being produced at the
Queensland studios.
	   In Victoria state, Viacom Inc., the owner of Paramount Pictures,
is part of a consortium spending Australian dollars 350 million
(U.S. dlrs 220 million) on an entertainment complex that will
include film and television studios.
	   Fox Studios' deal with Lucasfilm Ltd. to produce Episodes II and
III in the Star Wars trilogy is expected to push production film
levels in Australia past the record set in financial year 1997-98.
	   ``Episode I: The Phantom Menace,'' the first of the planned
prequels, was filmed in Britain in 1997 and is due for release in
the United States in May.
	   Announcing the Fox deal in Sydney, Lucas likened the Australian
industry now to that of Britain in the 1970s, which was
significantly boosted when Lucas shifted his production team there
for the original ``Star Wars.''
	   ``I could go anywhere in the world and shoot and we could use
any warehouse for a studio,'' Lucas said. ``In the end it is the
talent that is here. I go where the talent is.''
	   ``We are very keen to help bring in (to Australia) and update
some of the more esoteric crafts that that are necessary for large
stage productions and to expand that part of the industry,'' Lucas
said.
	   The U.S productions overshadow a busy local industry, which
continues to produce internationally acclaimed independent releases
despite a declining level of government arts funding.
	   Some 115 Australian feature films were selected for screening at
international festivals in 1997-98, including Cannes, Sundance and
the Berlin Film Festivals. Thirty-three features won awards,
according to the Australian Film Commission.
	   ``Babe: Pig in the City'' and ``Matrix,'' a Warner Bros./Village
Roadshow Pictures collaboration that has opened in U.S. cinemas,
pushed film and television production values in Australia to an
all-time high in the financial year to June 30 1998 of Australian
dollars 421 million (U.S. dlrs 265 million).
	   The ``Babe'' sequel, which was counted as a local production
despite being financed by U.S. company Universal Pictures, was
chiefly responsible for a record high for local feature films of
Australian dollars 166 million (U.S. dlrs 105 million), up from
Australian dollars 130 million (U.S. dlrs 82 million) in 1996-97
and just Australian dollars 43 million (U.S. dlrs 27 million) three
years ago, according the annual national production survey of the
Australian Film Commission.

	   Almost Australian dollars 500 million (U.S. dlrs 315 million)
was spent on production and post production services for the year
to the end of June 1998, up from Australian dollars 410 million
(U.S. dlrs 258 million) in 1996-97 and Australian dollars 375
million (U.S. dlrs 236 million) the year before.
	   The boom in production follows an influx of Australians into
mainstream film making _ most obviously the Oscars won by ``Shine''
star Geoffrey Rush and ``Babe'' director George Miller.
	   Australian faces such as those of actors Rush, Russell Crow and
Cate Blanchett and directors Miller, Philip Noyce and Peter Weir
are no longer strangers to Hollywood. Newcomers such as Baz
Luhrmann, director of ``William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet,''
and ``Dark City's'' Alex Proyas may be seen as a second wave.
	   Some local filmmakers, however, fear greater numbers of big
overseas productions will shut out local producers by pushing up
costs and draining the talent pool of local crews.

Refugees fleeing fighting in Kosovo crowd rebel stronghold

<TEXT>
	   LAPASTICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of refugees fleeing
fighting in northern Kosovo crowded into a rebel stronghold and
rummaged for firewood to help get through another subfreezing
night.
	   Most of the refugees in the area west of Podujevo made their way
by foot Saturday to Lapastica, a village still held by the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army after a two-day crackdown by Serb
police and Yugoslav army units.
	   Several villages in the region were destroyed in the fierce
fighting that threatened to unravel an already shaky truce reached
Oct. 12.
	   The province was reported to be largely calm Saturday, but a
Serb farmer was killed west of Podujevo by the KLA, according to
international peace monitors. Ethnic Albanian sources reported a
police attack in the same region.
	   The farmer was killed by the KLA in his home in Obranca, 20
miles (32 kms) north of the province's capital Pristina. The rebel
force controls much of the area.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to ethnic Albanian
pro-independence leaders, said that shortly before noon, Serb
police approached Obranca and opened fire on nearby KLA positions.
	   The rebels want independence for Kosovo, a province of Serbia,
the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians make up 90
percent of the province's population.
	   In a typical scene in Lapastica, one room sheltered more than 60
refugees.
	   One 7-year-old boy, identified only as Agron, couldn't speak a
word, his teeth chattering after hours walking in the cold.
	   His father lamented the family's situation.
	   ``It's a shame that we have to beg for food and beds,'' said the
man, who refused to give his name. The only warm member of the
family of four appeared to be the youngest, a 3-month old girl
bundled in wool and asleep in a wooden cradle carried by her
father.
	   Others in and near Lapastica combed the surroundings in the
winter sun for firewood.
	   The Serb and Yugoslav offensive launched Thursday reportedly
killing at least nine people.
	   The crackdown posed the gravest threat yet to the agreement that
halted months of violence between Serbs and guerrillas trying to
gain Kosovo's independence.
	   The United States, France and the European Union have warned
both sides not to continue the violence.
	   In October, NATO threatened airstrikes against the Serbs as
punishment for their crackdown that began in February, in which
hundreds died and 300,000 were forced to flee their homes.
	   The NATO attacks were put on hold after a cease-fire was reached
and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pulled out some of his
forces.

Riefenstahl redux: Hitler's filmmaker gets first German
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ For the first time in Germany, a museum
has organized a retrospective of the controversial work of Leni
Riefenstahl, filmmaker, photographer and Nazi-era propagandist.
	   The show has brought record numbers of visitors to the Film
Museum, which was crowded on a recent weekday with people of all
ages checking out the stages of Riefenstahl's life and career: Her
early obsession with mountain climbing. Her fascination with Adolf
Hitler's charisma. Her artistic innovations and quest for visual
perfection, which reached a high point with the Nazi masterpiece,
``Triumph of the Will,'' renowned and despised as the best
propaganda film ever made.
	   Riefenstahl was a pariah after the war but regained respect with
her photographs of the African Nuba tribe. Now 96, she remains
under scrutiny for her past. Was she a fascist or a visionary, an
artist ignorant of politics, as she claims, or a knowing aide to
the terror of the Third Reich?
	   Fifty years after the war, enough time has passed for a
comprehensive exhibition that lets Germans decide for themselves.
	   Other German exhibits have showcased Riefenstahl's work, mostly
alongside other Nazi propaganda or art from the Nazi period. A
private art gallery in Hamburg last year mounted a show of her Nuba
photos without reference to her work for Hitler, drawing protests
from Jewish groups that the gallery was glorifying a Third Reich
criminal.
	   So far, the show at the Film Museum in Potsdam, a city on the
outskirts of Berlin, has been protest free _ apparently because of
its bald presentation of Riefenstahl's Nazi films in context with
her entire career.
	   Some observers see the exhibit as part of a discussion going on
in Germany about how the nation can be ``normal,'' conscious and
reflective of its fascist past without feeling defined by guilt.
Centered mostly on plans for a national Holocaust memorial, the
discussion got louder with the recent election of Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, the first leader too young to be burdened with
memories of World War II.
	   ``It has become normal to deal with the Nazi period the way
historians do _ neither pointing to the guilt nor making it a
perverse, sensationalized attraction,'' says Bernhard Schulz,
cultural editor of the daily Berlin newspaper Tagespiegel.
	   Organizers of the Film Museum show say it gives older Germans a
chance to consider Riefenstahl anew while at the same time
introducing her to younger generations that might know her name but
not her work.
	   The rarely seen ``Triumph of the Will,'' for example, is one of
four Riefenstahl films being shown from start to finish on
televisions at the beginning of the exhibit.
	   Her idealized depiction of the 1934 Nazi party rally at
Nuremberg _ with its tremendous goose-stepping parades and
round-cheeked children giving flowers to Hitler _ is banned in
Germany unless presented with facts of the Holocaust. The museum
offers one of the first public viewings of a film until now seen
almost exclusively in postwar Germany in university classrooms or
excerpted in documentaries.
	   Show coordinator Ines Walk says she was looking for ways to
explore the relationship between art and politics when she started
planning the Riefenstahl exhibit two years ago. She also was
thinking of the year 2000 and how Riefenstahl's extraordinary life
reflects the passing century.
	   Riefenstahl was a dancer _ with swooping, Isadora Duncan-like
moves _ when she saw one of Arnold Fanck's silent films set in the
mountains. She presented herself to him as his new star, and he
accepted, as much for her high-cheekboned beauty as her daredevil
spirit. She rock climbed barefoot for the camera and was buried in
an avalanche for the death scene in the 1926 film ``Mountain of
Destiny.'' Soon, she was making her own films, fairy tales
celebrating Germany's Alpine mystique in which she was star,
screenwriter and director. She heard Hitler speak for the first
time in 1932 and wrote to him _ again, offering her talents to a
powerful, inspirational man. She believed, almost until the end,
that he was helping the country.
	   As the Fuehrer's filmmaker, she was the only woman to help shape
the rise of the Third Reich. And yet she insists, against all
plausibility, that she knew nothing about the Holocaust while it
was happening. This has always been her claim: She was an artist
not a Nazi.
	   She made ``Triumph of the Will'' only because Hitler asked her;
she tried to resist, but how could she? She also made ``Olympia,''
about the 1936 Berlin Olympic games, a gorgeous meditation on
muscle and movement suggesting the athletic master race of Hitler's
fantasies. It also presented the Nazis to the world as peaceful and
tolerant.
	   Riefenstahl says she regrets those films, largely because they
made her life miserable. She never made another film after the war,
turning instead to still photography in Africa and under the sea,
taking up scuba diving at age 72. The Allies and eventually Germany
cleared her as a Nazi, yet she is widely held responsible for
helping Hitler seduce the German public with her hypnotic films.

	   Despite _ or perhaps because of _ her notorious image,
Riefenstahl has a certain pop star status outside of Germany. She
photographed Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger and his wife, Bianca, in
the 1970s. Clips from ``Olympia'' appear in music videos. Leni
Riefenstahl computer screen savers can be found on the Internet.
She attended Time magazine's 75th anniversary gala earlier this
year and has received several honors for lifetime achievement.
	   With 500 visitors a day, the Film Museum show could signal that
Riefenstahl's popularity is growing in her native country. Some
visitors say the exhibit's many historical documents and photos
from the war increased their empathy for Riefenstahl.
	   ``It's so easy for us to judge today, but you really have to try
to put yourself back in those times,'' says Uta Kutzer, 60, of
Berlin. ``How do you know you'd have done any better? How do you
know you wouldn't have done the exact same as Leni Riefenstahl?''
	   Today, Riefenstahl lives just outside Munich but has not yet
seen her first German retrospective. Her health is poor, and she
wanted to make sure the show was well-received by the public before
coming to Potsdam, show coordinator Walk says.
	   For now, she appears at the Film Museum in the 1993 documentary
about her life, ``The Power of Pictures: Leni Riefenstahl,'' which
is on view. (Shown in the United States, it's called ``The
Wonderful, Terrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl.'')
	   At the end, documentary-maker Ray Mueller tells Riefenstahl he
thinks the German public is still waiting for her to apologize, to
admit guilt for her role in the Third Reich.
	   ``What am I guilty of?'' she asks, angered. ``No words of
anti-Semitism ever passed my lips, nor did I write any. I was never
anti-Semitic and never joined the Nazi party. So what am I guilty
of, tell me that?''

Country music industry relies on superstars in 1998
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY337 &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Tammy Wynette died and Garth Brooks
again proved his marketing acumen, selling 27 million albums by
repackaging his old hits _ twice.
	   That was country music in a nutshell in 1998, a year in which
the very rich got richer and everybody else fought for a smaller
piece of the pie.
	   When the final tally is done, 1998 country music sales are
expected to be up as much as 12 percent. But that figure is
deceiving. While Brooks and other superstars like Shania Twain had
banner years, sales for other acts stalled or took a dip.
	   ``A lot of those mid-level artists were selling a million
records a few years ago,'' said Jay Knowles, a staff songwriter at
Sony ATV. ``But now there's four or five that are selling 6 million
records and everybody else is selling 400,000 or so.''
	   The problem is an old one.
	   Record sales are primarily the result of airplay on country
music radio stations, which account for roughly one in four of all
U.S. radio stations (2,368 of 10,394), by far the most popular
format.
	   The people who decide what music country stations play are
getting more conservative as the radio industry consolidates.
	   ``Some of these radio people don't know if they're going to have
a job next week, so it's not likely they'll take too many
chances,'' Brooks said. ``I think it would help things a lot if
those guys started feeling more secure in their jobs.''
	   The radio industry is still chaotic because of the federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996, which freed companies to acquire
stations in the same city. The new law led to an avalanche of
sales, with more than 4,000 stations changing hands.
	   The result is a fewer number of programmers deciding what music
to play and working under increased pressure to produce maximum
profits because of the debt their bosses took on to acquire more
stations.
	   When radio programmers feel insecure, it's not a good time for
new artists to try to break through. It's easier to rely on
established stars like Brooks, Twain, Reba McEntire, Brooks and
Dunn, Vince Gill, Alan Jackson, George Strait, Tim McGraw and Faith
Hill.
	   Only the Dixie Chicks sang their way into the top ranks of
country music in 1998. Family act The Wilkinsons were the only new
act to score a No. 1 record all year (``26 Cents'').
	   ``Country is due a new superstar,'' veteran broadcaster Ralph
Emery said. ``I think the business needs a new guy to come along
like when Elvis came along. You know _ he's different, he's unique.
	   ``With the cookie-cutter approach (country music executives are)
using now, I don't know whether we're going to find him right
away.''
	   There's no shortage of charismatic artists out there, but record
companies generally resist anything they consider less than a sure
bet so they either ignore them or don't promote them much.
	   Nashville-based Lucinda Williams put out the superb ``Car Wheels
on a Gravel Road,'' which wasn't even marketed as a country record
by Mercury Records. Instead, it was a hit in the far less lucrative
Americana format, which concentrates on roots rock.
	   Bluegrass-leaning releases from Sam Bush and Jerry Douglas
contained exciting music. And Robbie Fulks and Dale Watson are just
the tip of an ``alternative country'' genre popular enough to
support its own magazine _ No Depression _ and record label _
Bloodshot, out of Chicago.
	   Oddly, very little of this talent seems to be taken seriously by
the executives at Nashville record companies.
	   Instead of supporting rawer, independent-minded artists who fit
snugly into the country music tradition, executives develop young
talents who are willing to be molded. They also love to get singers
like LeAnn Rimes and Trisha Yearwood to compete with Whitney
Houston and Celine Dion with bombastic power ballads like ``How Do
I Live.''
	   The mainstream industry does deserve credit for taking a bit of
a chance and releasing records by artists like The Lynns (Loretta
Lynn's twin daughters), Randy Scruggs and Allison Moorer in 1998.
	   The best news in '98 was that the superstars could have coasted,
but didn't.
	   Brooks' ``Sevens,'' released late in 1997, sold 6 million copies
during 1998 and was a return to form. Gill and Jackson, who went
through a divorce and separation, respectively, released brave new
albums that mined those setbacks for moving new songs.
	   Hill earned a pop smash with the irresistible single ``This
Kiss.'' Deana Carter showed that the success of her debut was no
fluke, following ``Did I Shave My Legs for This?'' with an even
better ``Everything's Gonna Be Alright.'' Twain crossed over to pop
with ``Come on Over,'' and embarked on a high-profile tour.
	   National interest in country music remained strong, as evidenced
by CNN's decision to broadcast Wynette's memorial service live from
Nashville's famed Ryman Auditorium. Brooks drew fans to Wal-Marts
across the country to see a closed-circuit television concert that
launched ``Garth Brooks Double Live.''
	   Many fans did as Brooks hoped and bought the album on the way
out, helping him sell more than 1 million copies the first week,
breaking debut- and one-week sales records set by Pearl Jam and
``The Bodyguard'' soundtrack, respectively.
	   Earlier in the year, Brooks released a box set of his first six
albums, and sold 2 million.
	   ``In Nashville, we have two businesses,'' Emery said. ``We have
the Garth business and the country music business. Garth is a
phenomenon like we could not have imagined in the '60s and '70s _
and part of the '80s. I think the marketing that has been done with
him has been unbelievable.''
	   In 1999, other country artists would do well to think of ways to
emulate Brooks' self-promotion. The Judds already have done so,
announcing a reunion concert on Dec. 31, 1999, in Phoenix, Arizona.
Expect more surprises from the media-savvy mother-daughter duo as
1999 wears on.

<TEXT>
	   Among the early treats of 1999 will be a new album from
Nashville outlaw Steve Earle, backed by a bluegrass band. It would
be interesting to see what happens if a record like that gets even
a small percentage of the marketing thought and promotional dollars
Brooks routinely demands and receives.
	   Some help from radio may come soon, speculates Jeff Walker,
president of Aristo Media, a Nashville company that does marketing
and publicity, and promotes songs to country music radio stations.
	   Walker thinks it's a matter of time before album-orientated
country radio stations start to appear in cities where the same
owner has more than one country music station. That could give
deserving artists like Earle and Lucinda Williams more airplay.
	   ``Album-orientated rock is certainly one of the main reasons pop
music got relaunched,'' Walker said. ``I can't see why in some
markets where there's two and three country stations, why they all
have to play this young, hit-driven hot country format ... .
	   ``We've plateaued and perhaps we've even come down a notch or
two. So it's time to roll up the sleeves now and be creative.''

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ The Minnesota Vikings are going into
the playoffs in record fashion.
	   Randall Cunningham threw two touchdowns and Gary Anderson added
two field goals as the Vikings beat the Oilers 26-16 Saturday,
becoming the highest-scoring team in the history of the National
Football League.
	   Minnesota (15-1) also tied the 1985 Chicago Bears and the 1984
San Francisco 49ers as the only teams with 15 victories in a
season. And Anderson became the highest-scoring kicker in a season
while extending his record of consecutive field goals to 40 over
two seasons.
	   Anderson became the first NFL kicker to finish a season with a
perfect record _ 35-of-35 on field goals and 59-of-59 on
conversions.
	   Anderson sealed the victory with a 39-yard field goal with 1:10
left. That gave him 164 points this season, topping Mark Moseley's
161 with Washington in 1983.
	   The loss ruined Tennessee's final game as the Oilers. The
franchise's nickname will be the Titans next season after 38
seasons as the Oilers in Houston and Tennessee.
 &UR; Chiefs 31, Raiders 24
	   OAKLAND, California (AP) _ Derrick Thomas returned a fumble 44
yards for a score and Tony Gonzalez caught a 20-yard touchdown pass
to break a fourth-quarter tie as the Kansas City Chiefs defeated
the Oakland Raiders 31-24 Saturday in their season finale.
	   Kansas City has won 17 of its last 19 games against the Raiders,
who lost two quarterbacks to groin injuries in the contest and
finished the game with a third quarterback who has missed most of
the season with a groin injury.
	   Bam Morris had two 1-yard scoring runs and Pete Stoyanovich
added a 30-yard field goal for the Chiefs (7-9). Elvis Grbac, in
his first start since Nov. 8, was 20-of-32 for 254 with two
interceptions and the scoring toss to Gonzalez.
	   Jeff George had a 15-yard scoring pass to James Jett and Wade
Wilson threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to Tim Brown for the Raiders
(8-8), who have not had a winning season since 1994 _ the year
before they returned to Oakland from Los Angeles.
	   Randy Jordan added a 10-yard scoring run and Greg Davis kicked a
44-yard field goal for Oakland, which lost six of its final eight
games.

Defecting Khmer Rouge leader was moderate front-man for killers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The defection of Khmer Rouge
intellectual Khieu Samphan to the Cambodian government brings an
end to decades of posturing in which he played the moderate, public
front-man for a gang of history's worst killers.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, the mysterious ideologue who was
second-in-command behind longtime leader Pol Pot, hammered two of
the final nails in the coffin of their movement Saturday by
defecting _ in reality, surrendering _ to the Phnom Penh
government.
	   After two years of ruptures in which the once-feared guerrilla
group dwindled to almost nothing, the defections leave only the
brutal one-legged general, Ta Mok, still holding out in the
Cambodian jungles with perhaps 100 loyalists.
	   The death knell comes eight months after Pol Pot, the supreme
Khmer Rouge leader until he was purged in a power struggle in 1997,
succumbed to a purported heart attack.
	   The faces of Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ta Mok were hardly known to
the world during the Khmer Rouge's secretive, bloody reign of
terror from 1975 to 1979, when as many as 2 million Cambodians
perished.
	   Instead, Khieu Samphan was the smiling, polite figurehead put
forward as head of state of what was called Democratic Kampuchea.
	   But researchers who have studied Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge
say that Khieu Samphan bore much more responsibility for the deaths
of his countrymen than is often attributed to him.
	   In particular, he helped encourage intellectuals to return from
abroad. Most were murdered.
	   ``Khieu Samphan's political star rose literally on heaps of
corpses,'' said Steven Heder, an expert on the Khmer Rouge who
lectures at London's School of Oriental and African Studies.
	   Born in 1931 and the son of a provincial judge, Khieu Samphan
won a government scholarship to study in Cambodia's colonial-ruler
France, where he became involved in communist politics. So did Pol
Pot and other top leaders of what became the Khmer Rouge.
	   The doctoral thesis he submitted at the University of Paris in
1959 is seen as a blueprint of Khmer Rouge economic policy once it
seized power in 1975 _ economic self-reliance and the
collectivization of agriculture.
	   On his return to Cambodia, Khieu Samphan became a professor and
helped establish a left-wing newspaper. He established a reputation
as a principled, honest intellectual and built up a student
following.
	   His activities and popularity alienated then-ruler Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, whose police stripped and beat Khieu Samphan on
the streets of the capital in July 1960 and detained him for a
month.
	   In 1962, Khieu Samphan won a seat in the National Assembly.
	   Sihanouk, hoping to corrupt him and dent his reputation,
appointed Khieu Samphan secretary of state for commerce. He lost
his position for refusing to accept a bribe to overlook illegal
meat trading.
	   Khieu Samphan was re-elected in 1966 but worsening repression
drove him underground into the jungle. Most Cambodians believed
Sihanouk had had him killed.
	   After Sihanouk was overthrown by a U.S.-backed coup in 1970, the
prince formed an alliance with the Khmer Rouge.
	   Khieu Samphan surfaced in 1973 when, as the guerrillas' military
commander-in-chief _ one of his first front-man roles _ he hosted a
visit by the prince to the guerrilla zone.
	   The Khmer Rouge seized Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975, and cut
Cambodia off from the world. All forms of a market economy were
banned and the cities emptied. Residents were force-marched to the
countryside to labor on agricultural collectives.
	   A year later, they dispensed with Sihanouk _ who was kept
prisoner in his palace _ as figurehead and made Khieu Samphan head
of state to preside over the deaths of as many as 2 million of his
countrymen.
	   Vietnam invaded Cambodia on Christmas Day, 1978, and toppled the
Khmer Rouge two weeks later. Khieu Samphan became chief spokesman
and representative in the decade of maneuverings that followed.
	   The Khmer Rouge joined royalist and republican factions in an
alliance to drive out the Vietnamese, Cambodia's traditional enemy.
Under international pressure, Hanoi pulled out its troops in 1989.
	   Khieu Samphan negotiated multilateral peace accords reached in
1991. But he was attacked by a government-orchestrated mob in Phnom
Penh that year and withdrew to the jungles. The Khmer Rouge
boycotted U.N.-organized elections in 1993.
	   The movement began breaking up in 1996, but Khieu Samphan stayed
with the hard-liners _ against his will, some believed. He remained
the most authoritative voice on clandestine radio broadcasts.
	   Sihanouk, Prime Minister Hun Sen and other leaders often drew a
distinction between Khieu Samphan and other Khmer Rouge chieftains.
	   A small number of younger Cambodians fed up with corruption even
to this day voice admiration for his perceived personal honesty.

Lemaire hired by Canadiens as consultant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Former New Jersey Devils coach Jacques Lemaire
has rejoined the Montreal Canadiens as a consultant to general
manager Rejean Houle.
	   ``Jacques will be a real asset to our team,'' Houle said at a
news conference prior to the Canadiens' game against the Maple
Leafs on Saturday night.
	   ``His knowledge of the league combined with his experience of
coaching will help me on a daily basis to get a stronger evaluation
of our own personnel as well as a better evaluation of the current
and future players of the NHL.''
	   The 53-year-old Lemaire signed a three-year deal with Montreal.
	   Lemaire played his entire 12-year career with the Canadiens,
winning eight Stanley Cups. He coached the team for the last 17
games of the 1983-84 season and the entire 1984-85 season, before
moving to the front office. Montreal won two more Cups, in 1986 and
1993, while Lemaire was an assistant GM.
	   He joined the Devils in 1993 and was named the league's coach of
the year in 1994, before leading the club to its only championship
in 1994.
	   Lemaire resigned at the end of the 1997-98 season when the
Devils were ousted in the first round of the playoffs after winning
the Atlantic Division with a 48-23-11 record.
	   With two years remaining on his contract, Lemaire had been
serving as a scout with the Devils this season.
	   ``The relationship that Jacques had with the organization and
with me personally has been outstanding,'' New Jersey GM Lou
Lamoriello said. ``The five years he has been here have been just
tremendous.''
	   Houle said his team has to deal with major decisions in the near
future and Lemaire, who will spend most of his time outside
Montreal, will be ``a great asset around the team.''
	   Going into their game against the Maple Leafs, the Canadiens
were on an 11-game winless streak (0-6-5), the club's longest since
1935-36, and were last in the Northeast Division with an 8-18-7
mark.
	   ``I've been watching the team, mostly on TV, and what I see is
simple and hard to explain at the same time,'' Lemaire told
reporters in the corridor outside the Canadiens dressing room. ``It
is a matter of confidence.
	   ``This team lacks confidence. There are good players here, lots
of talent, but even if you have talent you can't succeed without
confidence.''

Fearing rebel assault, capital residents burn two accused spies

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Fearing an impending rebel assault
on Sierra Leone's capital, angry residents surged through the
streets and burned alive at least two men accused of being rebel
spies.
	   The rebel Revolutionary United Front, meanwhile, reported
Saturday that it had killed 60 Nigerian soldiers from a West
African intervention force while capturing the town of Makeni, 60
miles (96 kms) east of the capital, Freetown.
	   Fighting has intensified in recent weeks in the West African
nation, settled two centuries ago by freed slaves from the United
States, Britain and Jamaica. It has a population of 4.7 million.
	   The rebels, who controlled Freetown after a bloody May 1997
coup, are seeking revenge for their ouster from the capital in
February by the Nigerian-led intervention force which returned
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to power.
	   Rebel commander Sam Bockarie said Saturday his forces dragged
the bodies of the dead Nigerian soldiers through the streets of
Makeni with an armored car ``as an example to everyone.''
	   But Kabbah's government, which has been waging war against the
rebels, denied that Makeni had been captured and said the
intervention force, known as ECOMOG, continued to fight for the
town.
	   Government troops remained firmly in control of the country, the
Information Ministry said in a statement.
	   The government bolstered Freetown's defenses Saturday by
trucking in Kamajors, traditional militiamen from rural villages.
It also flew in soldiers from Nigeria and Ghana to reinforce ECOMOG
troops.
	   At a downtown square in the capital, a mob singled out two young
men accused of being rebels in civilian disguise.
	   The men were severely beaten before some in the crowd thrust
gasoline-filled tires around their necks and set them on fire.
Their charred remains were carried away by police, who did not
attempt to stop the killings.
	   The Kamajor militiamen, members of a secret society of hunters
and traditional fighters, wore leather tunics and carried rusty
guns and machetes in the bustling city streets, setting up
checkpoints and carrying out random searches of pedestrians and
drivers.
	   Together with ECOMOG, the militia has been given defense duties
by Sierra Leone's government, which dissolved the country's
rebellious military earlier this year.
	   Remnants of that military and their rebel allies have over the
past week launched lightning attacks against loyalist forces
throughout the country.
	   The rebels are widely believed to have killed, maimed and raped
thousands of villagers.
	   Refugees fleeing the fighting have flooded into Freetown and
rebels have threatened to attack the capital unless the government
releases their imprisoned leader, Foday Sankoh, who is awaiting an
appeal of a death sentence handed down for treason.
	   On Saturday, Bockarie, one of the rebels' top commanders,
demanded that Kabbah resign or face a rebel assault on Freetown
before New Year.
	   ``Failure of Kabbah to resign, and we will start bombarding
Freetown and will not stop until victory is won,'' Bockarie told
The Associated Press.
	   That was a change from a day earlier when Bockarie demanded only
talks and Sankoh's release.

Hunter anxious to close deal but scared of getting burned

 &UR; With Sports-Basketball-NBA Lockout Glance &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Union director Billy Hunter, anxious to close a
deal but fearful of getting burned, said negotiations to end the
NBA lockout should resume later this week.
	   Hunter, speaking by telephone from Oakland, California, said he
plans to return Sunday to New York.
	   ``Once I get back, I'll reach out to David (Stern),'' Hunter
said Saturday, adding that the next negotiation session probably
will include only one or two representatives from each side.
	   No talks have been held since Wednesday night, when Stern and
Hunter met for several hours in Los Angeles at the office of agent
Leonard Armato. There was an expectation that talks might resume
this weekend, but nothing ever came to fruition.
	   ``There's nothing new,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said
Saturday.
	   Stern hasn't commented publicly in more than a week, but Granik
used a familiar line after the Los Angeles meeting in saying the
discussions ``went nowhere.''
	   The opposing sides, fighting over how to distribute some dlrs 2
billion in annual revenue, must make a deal by mid-January to save
a 45- to 50-game season. The league has scheduled a Board of
Governors meeting for Jan. 7, and Granik said he will recommend
canceling the season if a deal isn't reached by then.
	   Although many complicated issues remain in dispute, it has
become apparent that the one critical area that is the key to a
settlement is the league's insistence on setting an absolute
maximum salary for players with more than six years of experience.
The owners want the maximum salary tied to a percentage of the
salary cap, while the players have proposed a luxury tax on any
owner who signs a player to a multiyear contract starting at more
than dlrs 15 million.
	   The union has already offered a dlrs 10 million limit on the
starting salary for any player with less than seven years of
experience.
	   Hunter has said he will not accept a maximum salary on veteran
players unless the league reciprocates with an equally
concessionary gesture that brings the sides to closure. Presumably,
that would include the union's proposed minimum salaries and an
additional salary cap exception tied to the median salary.
	   The union also would want the league to withdraw several
proposed changes to salary cap rules, including the elimination of
opt-out clauses, the toughening of trade rules, the reduction of
performance bonuses and the elimination of signing bonuses and
trade kickers.
	   Hunter admitted Saturday he is wary of giving the owners another
concession and then having them walk away from the bargaining table
saying it isn't enough.
	   Some agents are counseling Hunter to wait until the Jan. 7
deadline before trying to close the deal.

Brothers arrested in 1997 execution of human rights couple
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Two brothers were arrested Saturday in
connection with the 1997 slayings of two human rights workers and
one worker's father.
	   Juan Carlos and Fernando Gonzalez were captured in Medellin,
Colombia's second-largest city, and charged in the execution-style
killings of Mario Calderon, Elsa Alvarado and her father, Carlos
Alvarado, said police operations chief Gen. Alfredo Salgado.
	   The couple was killed along with Alvarado's father in their
Bogota apartment in May 1997 by hitmen suspected of working for a
right-wing paramilitary group.
	   The gunmen gained entry posing as federal agents, then forced
the victims to kneel on the floor before spraying them with
machine-gun fire. The woman's mother survived eight gunshot wounds,
and the couple's 18-month-old son escaped injury by hiding in a
closet.
	   Calderon, a former Jesuit priest, and Alvarado worked at the
Center for Research and Popular Education, a nongovernmental
organization that promotes peace and human rights.
	   Their murders, followed by the killings this year of two other
prominent rights workers, prompted outrage and government promises
to crack down on the right-wing militias.

101-year-old Indian author looks back with disdain, ahead with

<TEXT>
	   OXFORD, England (AP) _ Age is supposed to mellow, but in this,
as in everything else, Nirad C. Chaudhuri defies convention.
	   At 101, the historian looks back on his contemporaries in India
with disdain, and looks ahead with dismay at the approaching end of
the world as we know it.
	   ``In 200 to 400 years, earlier rather than later, all
civilization will disappear from the face of this Earth. That we
categorically know. Completely disappear,'' he says. ``I cannot see
anything before me, or see anything coming. I can only see a
vacuum, emptiness, and nothing.''
	   Chaudhuri speaks from the perspective of a century of observing
what he calls the decay of civilization. His first book, ``The
Autobiography of an Unknown Indian,'' published at age 54, was
hailed as a classic of English letters, even though he had never
been outside India. The second volume of autobiography, a
1,000-page tome called ``Thy Hand, Great Anarch,'' was completed at
age 90. Yet another book, ``Three Horsemen of the New Apocalypse,''
was written when he was 99.
	   Chaudhuri never enjoyed the acclaim in India that he won in
England. He was suspiciously Anglophile, sometimes called the last
British imperialist. He admired Western culture equally with his
own. Unlike most Indians of his time, he found much to praise in
the 300 years of British colonial rule.
	   He has no kind words for any Indian leader, even the icons of
its history. Mohandas Gandhi was ``the world's most successful
humbug,'' he says, quoting and agreeing with a former colonial
ruler. ``Mahatma Gandhi did nothing for Indian independence. It was
Hitler who broke the back of the British,'' he says. ``I despised
him. His only goal was to feed his vanity, him in his loincloth!''
	   Today, Chaudhuri's slurred speech is less distinct than his
thoughts, which tumble out in a clutter like the bits and pieces of
information scattered in disarray around his small house on a side
street of Oxford, where he has lived for three decades.
	   He was controversial from the very first words he published, the
dedication of ``Unknown Indian'': ``To the memory of the British
Empire in India which conferred subjecthood on us but withheld
citizenship ... All that was good and living within us was made,
shaped, and quickened by the same British rule.''
	   Still angry nearly 50 years later, Chaudhuri says the dedication
was misunderstood by ``these wretched, idiotic, uneducated
Indians.'' It was, in fact, a tongue-in-cheek condemnation of
British insensibility.
	   He is no more charitable to his fellow Bengali, Amartya Sen, who
was awarded the 1998 Nobel prize for economics and who was last
year made a Master at Trinity College at Cambridge University.
	   ``It was utterly wrong. Being a Master of Trinity is not merely
being a good scholar. One seeks certain other things consistent
with an English life. Amartya Sen doesn't have that.''
	   His conversation, laced with impish humor, is a challenge for
his visitors. He is not bothered seeing them squirm at their own
ignorance when he fires questions at them: ``Do you know the Lord's
Prayer ... no, no, in the original, in Greek?'' What are the five
rivers of Punjab? What was the service rifle of the first World
War? How many provinces did the Moghul Empire have? Then, thumping
in time on the table, he breaks into a Bengali love song, written
by the only Indian he admits admiring, the Bengali Nobel laureate
Rabindranath Tagore.
	   His devoted friend and caretaker, Padu Mylvaganam, a former
Ceylonese army officer, scrabbles around in a drawer stuffed with
papers and pulls out a plain brown envelope. From it he extracts
Chaudhuri's CBE _ Commander of the British Empire, which he has not
mounted on the wall to go with his antique lithographs of India.
	   Chaudhuri came from East Bengal, in what is now Bangladesh, the
son of a small town lawyer with a love of Shakespeare. ``Unknown
Indian'' begins with a fond description of Kishorganj, a town
dominated by its river, where the turning of the seasons was marked
by the depth of mud on the road in the monsoons and the height of
the dust kicked up by children's feet in summer.
	   It ends with a penetrating ``essay on the course of Indian
history.'' Written just three years after independence, he
concludes with the unpopular prediction that India would again fall
under western domination or face national extinction.
	   ``Today, the doom is again knocking on our door. The hand of the
mummy is beckoning to us, and we have only to surrender ourselves
to the hour to become an archaeological site,'' he wrote. ``At this
moment of our history, the instinct of life impels me to look
abroad, for it is only through a renewed affiliation with the
countries which stand in the mainstream of human evolution that we
can hope to live.''

U.N. plane with 14 on board crashes in Angola
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS to update with U.N. confirmation that most passengers
are members of U.N. Observer Mission &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A U.N. aircraft with 14 people on board
reportedly crashed in Angola in an area where the government's army
has been fighting UNITA rebels, a U.N. spokesman said.
	   There was no word on whether any of the four crew members and 10
passengers had survived Saturday's crash. There was also no
immediate information on the cause of the crash.
	   Most of the passengers were members of the U.N. Observer
Mission, said deputy U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida E Silva.
	   The military observers are charged with monitoring a 1994 peace
accord that is severely threatened by the current offensive.
	   The Portuguese news agency Lusa said the aircraft burst into
flames shortly after take-off at noon (1100 gmt) from Huambo, some
500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda, and
crashed 40 kilometers (25 miles) away in Vila Nova.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed to the Angolan government
and UNITA to enable members of the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola
to go to the crash site and assist in search and rescue operations.
	   He expressed ``great sadness'' at reports of the crash, a U.N.
spokesman said in a statement.
	   According to preliminary information from government sources in
Huambo, the C-130 probably went down in an area east of Vila Nova,
the U.N. spokesman said.
	   The Portuguese news agency said U.N. military observers were
among the passengers. There was no confirmation from the United
Nations.
	   The plane, owned by TransAfric and chartered by the U.N., was
headed for Saurimo, in the province of Lunda Sul, about 630
kilometers (390 miles) east of Huambo, according to the news
agency.
	   The secretary-general also called on the two parties to
cooperate in a full investigation of the crash, the spokesman said.
	   The U.N. Security Council has expressed dismay that Angola
appears headed back to civil war, which has ravaged the southern
African nation for most of its nearly quarter-century of
independence.
	   The fighting has sent more than 50,000 people fleeing from their
homes in the central highlands.
	   Diplomats have been unable to get both sides to adhere to a 1994
peace accord. It called for UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence for Angola _ to hand
areas under its control to the government. However, lingering
hostility between the two sides has hindered implementation of the
deal.
	   The council on Wednesday again accused Angolan rebel leaders of
undermining the peace process and demanded an immediate end to the
fighting.
	   A statement adopted by consensus reaffirmed the council's firm
commitment to preserve Angola's unity and reiterated that ``only a
political settlement ... will bring a lasting peace to Angola.''
	   The civil war broke out following Angola's 1975 independence
from Portugal and some 500,000 people were killed in the fighting.

Taiwan's indigenous people hit right notes in music business

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ As a reigning pop diva, Chang Hui-mei must
fight to keep her private life private. But when asked about her
childhood in an indigenous tribal village, her wariness dissolves
into a wide smile.
	   ``I've always considered myself lucky that I could not only be a
singer, but also that my personal background could permit more
people to understand indigenous people,'' Chang says. ``I think
that's great.''
	   Chang comes from a new generation of musicians from Taiwan's
indigenous tribes finding success in the island's entertainment
business _ and highlighting the vibrancy of this island's native
non-Chinese culture.
	   Indigenous performers have emerged as chart favorites in a
variety of musical styles _ from traditional vocal music to Chang's
dance records and the modern rock of Chang Chen-yueh and Power
Station.
	   And though they sing in the dominant Mandarin Chinese dialect
spoken throughout Taiwan, the natural ease and depth of emotion of
their performances sets them apart from the island's overwhelming
Chinese majority, music critics say.
	   They're also selling millions of records _ in Taiwan and
throughout the Chinese-speaking world.
	   ``Indigenous people, when they sing, when they dance, when
they're making music, it's a very natural feeling,'' said Landy
Chang, president of Magic Stone Records, which features several
indigenous singers in its lineup.
	   Ethnic Chinese tend to be more stilted in their performances, he
said.
	   Singing and dancing were a natural extension of Puyuma tribal
life in southeastern Taitung county, says Chang, the island's
undisputed top female star who mixes aboriginal chants into her
trademark pop.
	   ``People think I took years of lessons, but everything you see
on stage is what I learned growing up,'' she said in an interview
conducted between takes of her new music video.
	   Though tribal music has long been a fixture in Taiwan's music
scene, being an aboriginal performer has never carried such cachet.
The recent surge of interest in indigenous singers may be the
result of an an accident of licensing, critics say.
	   The German group Enigma's 1995 hit ``Return to Innocence''
lifted a recording of a melody sung by Amis tribesman Difang that
popularized indigenous music in a modern format _ though Difang
didn't know of his new-found fame until a friend heard the song on
the radio.
	   Lawyers for Difang, a 76-year-old farmer from Taitung, are now
fighting for a share of the royalties, while his own album of
traditional chants set to a world music beat has won steady record
sales and critical praise.
	   Taiwan's tribal music can also be heard on numerous ethnological
CDs, and sampled on albums by bands such as world music group Deep
Forest.
	   The notoriety brings new attention to the 380,000 indigenous
tribal people who make up less than 2 percent of Taiwan's
population and still face an uphill battle in mainstream society.
	   Descendants of Pacific island hoppers who migrated to Taiwan
thousands of years ago, the tribal people speak a variety
Austronesian languages similar to native tongues of the
Philippines, New Zealand and Hawaii.
	   For many, the Mandarin and Taiwanese Chinese spoken by most
people on the island are second languages.
	   Highland groups mostly held out against assimilation during 400
years of Chinese immigration to the island, until the 1980s sparked
a wave of migration to the cities where the tribal people found
work on government infrastructure projects.
	   Recent changes have had their ups and downs, says Kao
Cheng-shang, director of Taipei city's Commission for Native
Taiwanese Affairs
	   Traditional jobs in mines, on fishing boats and at construction
sites have been lost to industrial upgrading or cheaper foreign
workers, causing aboriginal incomes to lag behind those of most
Taiwanese, he says.
	   Without steady income, many urban tribal people can't afford
rent, so they live in shanty communities without electricity and
running water.
	   Life in the mountains sometimes isn't much better.
	   In Wufeng township two hours south of Taipei, Presbyterian
church social worker Chien Ching-nan says poverty, alcoholism and
low education levels have caused tribal people to miss out on much
of Taiwan's recent prosperity.
	   But music abounds in the villages, schools and dozens of tiny
churches that dot the area.
	   ``For a lot of people, a career in music or as a baseball player
offers the best chance to escape poverty,'' says Chien. ``It's
something God has given us.''

Hooker's 50th anniversary a real reason to celebrate

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The latest album from venerable bluesman John
Lee Hooker boasts an all-star cast of collaborators: Eric Clapton,
Bonnie Raitt, Carlos Santana, Van Morrison.
	   But there's one notable absence from Hooker's wish list of
friends on this celebration of his half-century in the music
business.
	   ``There ain't no way I could get him,'' Hooker says from his
California home, his voice a barely audible croak. ``Stevie Ray.
Stevie Ray Vaughan, he would be No. 1. I loved Stevie.''
	   ``It's just too bad,'' he says with the wisdom acquired from
five decades of singing and playing the blues. ``That's the way it
goes, though.''
	   It's a single sad note in an upbeat year for Hooker. The son of
a Mississippi sharecropper has reaped an assortment of riches in
1998: his new album, ``The Best of Friends''; a 50th anniversary
tribute concert arranged by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; a pair
of Grammy awards for a tune he did with Morrison, ``Don't Look
Back''; and the announcement of a lifetime achievement award from
the Rhythm and Blues Foundation.
	   ``I'm hanging on, like a vine. ... It's just nice to be
around,'' Hooker says. ``I'm still kicking and hopping. I'm not as
young as I used to be, but I'm still kicking. I'm young at heart.''
	   Hooker, who turned 81 in August, credits his longevity to one
core belief: ``I believe in the great maker. I believe in that. I
could be wrong, but it's working so far. I still got my mojo
working.''
	   Hooker's mojo dates way back. The Clarksdale, Mississippi,
native, born in 1917, wound up working as a janitor in a Detroit
auto factory by day and playing the blues by night.
	   Hooker signed a record deal in 1948, and quickly scored a
million-selling hit with ``Boogie Chillen'' _ a tune remade for the
new album with Clapton helping out on guitar.
	   It was English kids of Clapton's generation who rediscovered
Hooker in the early 1960s, when the delta bluesman's sound was
copped by the Yardbirds and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Mayall's
band backed Hooker on a 1964 tour of England.
	   That influence still reverberates today _ Robert Plant and Jimmy
Page titled their most recent album ``Walking into Clarksdale.''
And Hooker recently performed on a track for Mayall's upcoming
album.
	   Hooker's touring continued over the years, but he stopped
recording during the late 1970s and didn't start against until
1989. His studio drought ended with ``The Healer,'' which received
critical praise while selling more than 1 million copies.
	   That same year, he joined the Rolling Stones for a pay-per-view
show on their ``Steel Wheels'' tour. Stones guitarist Keith
Richards is among the legion of guitarists who take a little bit of
Hooker's style on stage with them.
	   ``There's a continuity there,'' Richards said recently. ``With
John Lee Hooker, you feel the continuity of a long tradition. ...
You get in the dressing room and realize you've known each other
forever.''
	   Hooker knows the feeling _ and he can explain it, too.
	   ``People related to the blues, because the blues have been there
since the world was here,'' he says. ``All music comes from the
blues. The blues are always the same. They will never die.''
	   Hooker says he doesn't play much guitar these days _ ``Just once
in a while,'' he confesses. ``I've got a whole roomful of guitars.
I can't hardly walk without tripping over 'em.''
	   But he's well aware of younger performers like teen-age blues
sensation Jonny Lang: ``I know him real well.'' And he keeps in
touch with old friends like Bonnie Raitt: ``Ooooh, she loves me,
and I love her. She's big now. She's a good person, too.''
	   Raitt's Rhythm and Blues Foundation _ she's one of its founders
_ honors Hooker with a lifetime achievement award Feb. 25 in Los
Angeles. Smokey Robinson will be host of the event.
	   ``What am I most proud of? That's a good question,'' Hooker
says. ``There's so many things I'm proud of. I'm proud that I'm
famous. I'm proud that I'm fond of people, and people love me.
	   ``Lots of things.''

Rights group: Chinese police prevent protests at dissident trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police prevented dissidents from going to the
court where a labor activist accused of endangering state security
was due to be tried Sunday, a human rights group said.
	   Zhang Shanguang was to be tried in southern Hunan province's
Huaihua city reportedly on charges that he provided intelligence to
people overseas. The charge apparently relates to interviews Zhang
gave about farmers' protests to the U.S. government-funded Radio
Free Asia.
	   There was no immediate word Sunday whether the trial was going
ahead as planned. Telephone calls to court officials, Zhang's wife
and his lawyer were unanswered.
	   But Human Rights in China, a New York-based rights group, said
police in Hunan had mobilized ``a large number'' of officers to
watch dissidents at home and prevent them from going to the court
to show support for Zhang.
	   Police even watched people in Changsha, the provincial capital
300 kilometers (180 miles) to the east of Huiahua, the group said.
	   Despite the tight security, it said some people from as far away
as Beijing, 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) to the north, had given
police the slip and were in Huaihua to show support for Zhang.
	   Zhang, who earlier spent seven years in jail for labor rights
campaigning, was detained in July, following U.S. President Bill
Clinton's visit to China, as he was preparing to set up an
association to protect laid-off workers' rights.
	   His trial comes amid a crackdown that last week saw three
prominent dissidents given heavy jail terms. Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin
and Wang Youcai were charged with endangering state security and
sentenced to 13 years, 12 years and 11 years respectively for
trying to organize the China Democracy Party.
	   Chinese leaders have declared they will destroy challengers to
Communist Party rule and have ordered law enforcers to eliminate
any threats to social stability.
	   Despite the crackdown, 274 people in more than 20 provinces and
major cities signed an open letter calling on Chinese leaders to
release Zhang, Human Rights in China said.
	   The letter was addressed to President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu
Rongji and Mary Robinson, the U.N.'s top human rights official who
visited China in September.
	   Zhang was charged with illegally providing intelligence to
people overseas because he told Radio Free Asia about farmers'
protests, according to the group. It said the charge was
unjustified.
	   ``If you are out to condemn somebody, you can always trump up a
charge,'' it said.

Bad movies have been good to Conrad Brooks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY316 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOANN LOVIGLIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAGERSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ He's been called the Sir John
Gielgud of bad cinema and he has the resume to back it up:
``Deathrow Gameshow,'' ``Plan 9 From Outer Space.''
	   It's a bad, bad, bad, bad world when you're Conrad Brooks, King
of the Bs. But low-budget films, featuring paper-plate flying
saucers and not-so-scary monsters, have been Brooks' livelihood for
more than four decades.
	   Born Conrad Biedrzycki in east Baltimore, he and his brother
moved to Hollywood in the late 1940s. He had no acting ambitions
but, after meeting now-infamous director Edward D. Wood Jr., he
changed his name to Brooks and wound up appearing in virtually
every film Wood directed.
	   He was Jamie, the bumbling police officer in 1959's ``Plan 9.''
He had two (yes, two) plum parts in 1953's ``Glen or Glenda?,'' a
peculiar tale about the travails of transvestitism _ something Wood
knew about.
	   ``My brother and I went into his apartment once and he was
walking around in a dress. We just figured that's Hollywood,'' says
Brooks, who recently left California to be near his family in
Maryland. ``But Eddie was a good man, bless his soul. ... He was my
mentor.''
	   In 1980, a book called ``The Golden Turkey Awards'' listed
``Plan 9'' as the worst movie ever made. It has everything: a
nonsensical plot, very unspecial effects (like tossed paper plates
doubling for UFOs), cardboard sets, bizarre dialogue and horrendous
acting. When falling star Bela Lugosi died early in the filming, a
local chiropractor was cast in the role and simply covered his face
with a cape. (Martin Landau won an Academy Award for best
supporting actor for his portrayal of Lugosi.)
	   The worst-ever distinction earned the film and Wood, who died in
1978, a new generation of devotees for whom the simply bad wasn't
good enough. And Brooks, energetic and animated at 68, revels in
his ties to the worst director and films of all time.
	   ``They also call me the low-budget John Barrymore. I love it!
And I agree,'' says Brooks. ``It tells me they've seen the movies _
that's what I want to hear.''
	   Brooks had a cameo role in 1994's ``Ed Wood,'' Tim Burton's
homage to the director with a heart of gold and a penchant for
angora. But it wasn't a comeback. Except for a dry spell in the
1960s, Brooks has been plugging away in the theater of the peculiar
all along.
	   ``Life is beautiful, kid,'' he gushes during an interview in his
ex-wife's memorabilia-filled trailer home in rural western
Maryland. ``I'm an actor; it's in me. I just do it for the love of
it. Can you believe I'm still in the movies with a mug like this?''
	   Brooks' staying power is unique in the B-movie world, says Gary
Svehla, president of Baltimore-based Midnight Marquee Press Inc., a
publisher of books about horror and sci-fi movies.
	   ``He made these films, but nobody recognized him because he'd
have a scene in a bar or as part of a crowd and was billed 25th in
the credits,'' Svehla said. ``But he's one of the few who survived
from that time, so he can talk about his work with people like Wood
and Lugosi. That's why he's still known, loved, recognized and very
important in cult films.''
	   More recently, Brooks has become an auteur of the absurd _
directing, producing and starring in a slew of straight-to-video
and limited-release films including ``Blood Slaves of the Vampire
Wolf'' and ``Misfit Patrol,'' a slapstick police comedy he predicts
``is going to be a classic.''
	   Brooks says he has appeared in 199 movies over the last half
century.
	   ``The films, to be quite honest, are not very good _ not to put
them down,'' Svehla says gingerly. ``But what they do have is
honesty and a certain charm. There's not a lot of money to make
them but there is a real love and a passion involved.''
	   Svehla says Brooks' films recall the 1950s heyday of low-budget
filmmaking _ little or no script, all-in-the-family casting and
bare-bones budgets.
	   ``It's like a breath of fresh air. No Hollywood gloss, no
special effects,'' Svehla says. ``Today ... you've got to make dlrs
50 million or it's a bomb.''
	   When he's not filming or appearing at East Coast sci-fi and
monster movie conventions, Brooks lives in Falling Waters, W.Va.,
and spends much of his time at the Hagerstown home of his ex-wife,
Ruthie, and daughter, Connie Granda. Both have starred in his films
and Mrs. Brooks has written music for several, which she willingly
plays for a visitor along with such favorites as Bobby Vinton's
``Melody of Love.''
	   Brooks is working in western Maryland on a horror movie
tentatively titled ``Jan-Gel: The Beast From the East.''
	   ``The beast is my neighbor, Dale Clukey,'' Brooks deadpans.
``Hey, you've got to keep your costs down, so you bring in
everybody you know.''
	   Spoken like a true Wood protege. Brooks says he wishes the
director, who died in poverty and obscurity, could see the
adoration his films achieved, but says he's proud to be following
in the master's footsteps.
	   ``And let me tell you, I've got plenty more in me,'' Brooks
says. ``You ain't seen nothing yet!''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Standing in front of Louis Armstrong's home on a
blustery November day, Kate Iscol closed her eyes for a moment and
tried to block out the sound of the wind. She was listening for the
memory of the late king of jazz blowing his horn.
	   ``If you close your eyes, you can almost hear him,'' she said.
	   For Ms. Iscol and more than 30 others gathered around
Armstrong's home, this was the first stop on a tour of an unlikely
jazz mecca: the New York City borough of Queens.
	   Tucked away in the heart of Queens, a short subway ride from
Manhattan's tourist haven of Broadway and Times Square, hundreds of
jazz artists _ singers, musicians and composers _ made their homes
next to one another, raising their children and jamming with
friends.
	   ``It's probably the best kept secret in New York City, maybe the
country,'' said JoAnn Jones, director of Flushing Town Hall's
Queens Jazz Trail, a five-hour tour that offers a glimpse into the
private lives of jazz music's very public figures.
	   It visits the homes of Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Dizzy
Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald and ``Fats'' Waller.
	   Then there's the ``jazz nightclub experience'' _ a meal of fried
chicken, barbecue ribs, potatoes, collard greens and peach punch
served at the cramped, dimly lit Blue Goose during a live
performance by saxophonist Harold Ousley.
	   ``Who thinks Queens? I've lived here 30 years and had no idea,''
said Ruth Davis, an author and editor.
	   The migration of jazz artists to Queens, according to jazz
archivist Marc H. Miller, was planned in the 1920s by Clarence
Williams, a producer, composer and pianist.
	   Williams moved to southeast Queens with the intention of
attracting a ``colony of black artists,'' creating another Harlem
in New York, Miller said. He invited ``The Charleston'' composer
James P. Johnson and band leader Fess Williams to follow him. Both
did.
	   The three men became the anchor of a community that offered jazz
performers a chance to buy inexpensive, spacious homes in the midst
of segregation.
	   Bass player Milt Hinton, who gained fame as part of the Cab
Calloway Band and later for his candid photographs of life on the
road, followed Johnson to Queens in 1947.
	   ``Me and my wife had been living in hotels and staying at
people's houses because we were on the road all the time. Then when
she got pregnant, we wanted a nice, clean place to raise a child,''
he said. ``We had visited (Johnson) and thought it was a nice
place.''
	   Within a few years, the borough became a colony of sorts for
jazz artists looking to stay close to the Manhattan jazz scene but
also have a place to relax.
	   ``We didn't think that much of all of it like they do now. They
were people we worked with in the business. It was kind of natural
to hang out together,'' said saxophonist Jimmy Heath, who recorded
with Dizzy Gillespie and lived next door to trumpet player Clark
Terry and the horn-blowing Adderly brothers, Nat and Cannonball.
	   Many of the jazz greats settled in a 60-block section of Queens
known as Addisleigh Park, known for spacious, tudor- and
colonial-style homes.
	   A recent walking tour through the neighborhood _ where Lena
Horne lived around the corner from Count Basie and Russell Jacquet
lived next door to his brother, Illinois _ gave fans a sense of the
tight-knit jazz community of the 1920s, '30s, '40s and '50s.
	   ``Count Basie was living out here before me. He told me it was a
nice neighborhood and I better get in while I can,'' said tenor
saxophonist Illinois Jacquet, who gained fame for his 1942 solo on
Lionel Hampton's classic, ``Flying Home.''
	   Jacquet, who still lives in the house he bought in 1949 a few
blocks from Basie's, said Ella Fitzgerald followed him a few years
later.
	   ``I was delighted when Ella moved here. I could go up to her bar
at her house and drink up all of her whiskey, and then go through
somebody's yard and go home,'' he said. ``That's what it was like
back then.''
	   It is the personal stories _ some sad, some funny _ told by
guides Jeff Gottlieb and local musician Coby Knight that are the
real gems of the tour.
	   There's the story about how a white policeman who was mad at his
neighbors sold his house in 1938 to ``Fats'' Waller, integrating
the exclusive white neighborhood of Addleighs Park.
	   Then there's the one about the infamous eating contests at
clarinetist Herbie Hall's house and the parties at Basie's backyard
pool, a monstrosity that took up nearly a city block.
	   Best of all, there's the tale about the time vocalist Mildred
Bailey threw a party where she introduced Benny Goodman to pianist
Teddy Wilson. They went on to form the legendary Goodman Quartet.
	   By the 1960s, the community began to dwindle as musicians moved
away or died.
	   ``All the clubs that supported jazz closed, and then it just
kind of ended. The crime and drugs and stuff like that took over,''
said Knight, 56, who grew up down the street from Armstrong's
house.
	   But the tours are helping to restore the area's image, Knight
said. ``This may be what brings pride in the cultural history being
made here.''
	   The Armstrong archives at Queens College, home to thousands of
hours of Armstrong's unpublished recordings and taped
conversations, also have benefited from the tour. The number of
people visiting the archives has risen from 400 in 1994 to more
than 1,200 last year, said archivist Michael Cogswell.

New technology could change music industry, consumer habits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY199 &QL; 
 &UR; By RON HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ The future of the music industry can now be
heard through your own home computer, where a new technology called
MP3 could reshape the way we buy and hear music.
	   In the time it would take to drive to the record store, spend
dlrs 16.99 on the latest CD, bring it home and pop it in a stereo,
a music lover could download the same high-quality recordings over
the Internet _ often for free.
	   Musicians can use MP3 to market their songs directly to
consumers, bypassing fickle agents, record companies and
distributors by putting audio files on their own Web sites, a
practice that recently got rap artist Chuck D in trouble with his
record label, Def-Jam.
	   If that weren't troubling enough for the recording industry,
just in time for Christmas there's Rio, a Walkman-like music player
that carries about an hour's worth of CD-quality MP3 music on a
computer chip. It sells for dlrs 199, weighs under three ounces and
runs for 12 hours on one AA battery.
	   The technology works like this: Users can download songs from
the Internet or copy them from CDs and store them on their home
computer. An entire album takes about two hours to download, while
popping downloaded files onto the Rio takes only a few seconds.
	   The Rio lets listeners skip, scan and shuffle through numerous
song tracks, all on the go.
	   The Recording Industry of America Association says artists will
be hurt most as bootlegged MP3 files siphon off royalties. The RIAA
reported losing dlrs 300 million annually prior to the advent of
online piracy.
	   Then again, the RIAA said the same thing about cassette tapes,
and the music business survived.
	   ``It's a freight train coming down the tracks, and instead of
getting on the freight train and going for a nice ride, they're
standing in front with their hand out. And it could get ugly,''
said Ken Wirt, a spokesman for Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc.,
makers of Rio.
	   Some MP3 songs proliferating on the Internet are perfectly legal
and endorsed by the record labels. There's also a boom in
bootlegged tracks, moving that illicit industry from the streets to
the Internet.
	   ``Unfortunately, most of the music they're going to copy is
pirated,'' said Cary Sherman, general counsel for the RIAA. The
association is hoping a federal appeals court will overturn a
judge's refusal to halt Rio sales.
	   Rio ``encourages consumers to infringe the rights of artists by
trafficking in unlicensed music recordings on the Internet,'' the
RIAA said.
	   MP3 stands for Motion Picture Experts Group (``MPEG'') 1 layer
3, a method of compressing audio files into digital format that
takes up as much as one-tenth the computer memory than previous
technologies.
	   What MP3 can do in one hour, it takes 20 hours for an earlier
technology, WAV.
	   MP3.com, a popular Internet site that provides MP3 software and
music files, legally gives away thousands of full-length MP3 songs
from well known artists such as Peter Cetera (formerly lead singer
for Chicago), Kansas, The Beach Boys and Willie Nelson.
	   There's a slew of lesser-known artists getting heard, too, such
as dance music artist Lucas and funk band 790 Robot Head.
Currently, there are an estimated 150,000 songs in MP3 format
available on Internet Web sites.
	   ``What the Internet does is decentralize the market. On the
Internet, it really empowers the artists to sell direct,'' says
Michael Robertson, president of MP3.com.
	   Take Ron Sunshine and Full Swing, a New-York-based swing band.
Sunshine's marquee tune, ``Enough For You,'' is the most popular
swing selection on the MP3.com site.
	   ``I think it's definitely helped quite a lot, especially with
the younger people,'' Sunshine said. ``I get thousands of e-mails
from kids who say they heard our song on the Internet.''

Theater operators embrace big screen commercials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Going out to see a movie once offered, if
nothing else, entertainment without those annoying commercials that
dominate television. Not anymore.
	   Commercials pitching products such as Levi's jeans and Nike
shoes are one of the theater industry's fastest growing businesses.
If you haven't already seen them, they're probably coming soon to a
theater near you.
	   Advertisements similar to the ones on television play on about
60 percent of the country's movie screens, and by industry
estimates, have become a dlrs 60 million business.
	   Big advertisers like BMW, Lincoln Mercury and Sony Corp. love
theaters because moviegoers, unlike TV viewers, don't turn the
channel or head for the refrigerator when the commercials start.
	   Exhibitors like them because they don't have to share the
profits from commercials with a movie studio.
	   ``I think everybody understands that it's vital to the
industry,'' said Dennis Fogarty, president and chief executive
officer of ScreenVision Cinema Network, a New York company that
distributes commercials shown on nearly 12,000 screens.
	   ``In order to go on building these beautiful multiplexes with
stadium seating and wraparound screens, exhibitors need money,'' he
said. ``They can no longer make it on just concession revenue and
film revenue.''
	   While television commercials consume up to a quarter of each
hour, movie commercials run in blocks of only two or three minutes
before the previews. Typically, they're slickly produced 90-second
spots of music and images with little talking.
	   They join two older forms of theater advertising: slides that
are shown to early birds before the theater lights go down and
radio-style ads played over the public address system.
	   Initially, theater owners were reluctant to add filmed
commercials to the lineup, fearing audiences would be annoyed. In
recent years, that reluctance has given way to enthusiasm from many
big chain operators.
	   Denver-based AMC Entertainment has even formed it own
subsidiary, National Cinema Network, to compete with ScreenVision.
	   In addition to AMC theaters, National Cinema distributes filmed
commercials, slides and audio ads to AMC competitors such as
General Cinema and Cinemark.
	   ScreenVision's business increased 300 percent during 1998, and
Fogarty said he expects similar growth during 1999. ScreenVision
limits its ad blocks to no more than three minutes. Fogarty is
convinced the audience doesn't mind, as long as the ads are
interesting.
	   That was the case among moviegoers who watched a Los Angeles
Times commercial one recent evening while waiting to see ``Star
Trek Insurrection'' at an Edwards cinema in suburban LaVerne. In
the ad, a young girl refuses to let her father videotape her
birthday party unless he promises to give her a film contract. Her
tactics, of course, are inspired by movie industry stories in the
Times.
	   ``The commercials are cool. They should put them on TV,'' said
Robby Krug, 14. ``They're funny.''
	   The commercial seemed to work for grownups, too.
	   ``I didn't mind it,'' said Sam Simmons, 40. ``I don't like
commercials as a rule, but I like commercials that are well done.''
	   National Cinema, whose filmed ads run on about 5,000 screens
weekly, also expects big growth in the coming years, but the
company's approach is more conservative. National Cinema's ad
packages run no more than two minutes. And the audience is warned
at the outset what they're about to see and how long it will last.
	   Oddly enough, the philosophy originated in part with the
reaction of National Cinema President Bob Martin when he sat down
in a Colorado theater a few years ago.
	   ``Something came on screen and I wasn't sure what it was, and it
turned out to be a commercial,'' he said. ``I felt a little bit
tricked, and I was annoyed and I didn't know how long it was going
to last. It aggravated me as a movie patron.''
	   For some exhibitors and studios, even a short block of carefully
crafted commercials is too much.
	   The Walt Disney Co. asks exhibitors not to show ads with its
movies. Ads are especially unpopular with exhibitors in the Los
Angeles area, where the influence of the movie industry is deep.
	   For example, Los Angeles-based Pacific Theaters, a fast-growing
chain with 400 screens in California and Hawaii, has resisted
filmed commercials despite the financial rewards.
	   ``We feel any kind of advertising takes away from the
experience,'' said Chan Wood, Pacific's executive vice president
and chief film buyer. ``It's a personal belief that when those
lights dim the audience wants to be entertained. We even have a
limit on the number of trailers, or coming attractions. We try to
get to the movie as soon as possible.''

Five questions with Cathy Rigby: former gymnast takes flight as
</HEADLINE>
Peter Pan &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Cathy Rigby attracted worldwide attention as a
15-year-old in pigtails on the balance beam. Now, 30 years later,
she flies across the stage as Peter Pan.
	   Rigby was the darling of the U.S. Olympic women's gymnastic team
in 1968 and 1972. When her days of strenuous athletic competition
ended, she had to learn how to cope with the rigors of celebrity.
	   ``When the 1972 Olympics was over, I said, `I'm retired.' I just
knew that was it,'' Rigby recalls.
	   But her life in the public eye was just beginning.
	   ``After the '72 Olympics, the whole idea of celebrity came into
my life. Suddenly you're a household name. You're getting
endorsements and people are offering you parts on TV. I'd never
thought of going into the entertainment field,'' she says.
	   Rigby was a sports commentator for the U.S. ABC television
network and a familiar face on commercials. She became interested
in doing theater after appearing in a few TV sitcoms.
	   ``By the time I did a few episodic things on TV, I went, `Oh,
this is interesting and fun,''' she says.
	   Her approach to training for the theater was much the same as
training for the Olympics.
	   ``If you work at singing, you get better, like training any
other muscle,'' she says. ``After three years, I heard a huge
difference in my voice. In 1981, I auditioned for Dorothy in `The
Wizard of Oz' and got the part _ at the Civic Light Opera in
Sacramento, California. I knew at that point I was hooked on
theater.''
	   Her acting and singing lessons paid off. In 1991, she received a
Tony nomination for ``Peter Pan,'' based on J.M. Barrie's timeless
tale of a young boy who wouldn't grow up.
	   The diminutive Rigby, who stands 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall and
weighs 98 pounds (44 kilos), soars and spins like the youthful
Peter Pan she is supposed to be, working the sophisticated flying
rigs to great effect. Her expressive, lively face and childish
chortle add to the general youthful feeling of her performance as
she flies, sings and dances across the stage.
	   ``The first time I flew, it was fabulous, soaring from one side
of a stage to the other, spinning, turning, doing dips. It was a
thrill. Everybody says, `Were you scared?' No. After back-flips on
a balance beam, this was not frightening,'' she says.
	   ``It's like riding a roller coaster. If you like a roller
coaster, it's lots of fun.''
	   With all her Peter Pan charm, it's hard to believe that Rigby is
45 and the mother of four. Buck Mason, who was born when Rigby was
married to pro football player Tommy Mason, is 20. He plays three
parts in the show: a big fluffy dog (nanny to the children Peter
Pan visits), a slithering crocodile (who is always stalking Captain
Hook) and a pirate.
	   Her youngest child, Kaitlin, 11, is with Rigby in New York.
Ryan, 16, and Theresa, 13, are in school and at home with their
father, Tom McCoy, in La Habra Heights, near Los Angeles.
	   Rigby and McCoy are co-producers of ``Peter Pan,'' currently
running at the Marquis Theater. The show will go on the road early
next year before returning for a second Broadway run in April.
	   1. What did you dream about when you were growing up?
	   Rigby. I only thought about gymnastics. I started ballet classes
at 7 and gymnastics at 10. By the time I was 13, I started training
for the future. I was in my first Olympics at 15 and my second
Olympics at 19. It was pretty intense from 13 to 20. Once you get
to where you're trying out for the Olympics, you're training six to
eight hours a day. You have to do four events. My best event was
the balance beam.
	   2. How did you pursue your entertainment career?
	   Rigby: I had about seven years of voice lessons before I stepped
out onstage to sing. I still study when I get home. Learning how to
sing and act is much more intense, complicated and demanding than I
expected. To be able to hold your own onstage takes major work,
great focus, very hard training.
	   3. How does acting compare with gymnastics?
	   Rigby: It's such an emotional difference from gymnastics. In
gymnastics, you shut down emotionally to deal with the pressure.
You don't let any fear get in the way. Emotions tend to make you
think too much about `What if?' (as in) `What if you don't stay on
the apparatus.' In acting it is just the opposite; it's about
feeling everything. It's a fabulous thing to be able to tap into
that part of my life that I hadn't used for a while.
	   4. Where did you first do Peter Pan?
	   Rigby: In Long Beach, California. The part is a perfect fit. I
love the physicality of the part, the tomboyishness. The songs are
wonderful. As an adult, you get to go back every night and really
be a kid. There's a lot of fun in that. As an actress, to be
believable as a boy, a child, and have the vulnerabilities that
Peter has, as well as his joy, fun and mischief, is wonderful.
	   5. Does your gymnastics training help you when you ``fly''?
	   Rigby: I think so, for the type of flying I do. It's not just
back and forth. What I do is a lot more spinning and dipping. It
gets faster all the time. When I have to stop myself on the other
side of the stage, I know when to come out of the flight. And I
know how to straighten out my body when I'm flying so I'm facing
the audience.

Sean Penn brings uncompromising passion to work
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL FLEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Entertainment Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, California (AP) _ As the sleazy, coke-sniffing,
self-destructive Hollywood casting agent in ``Hurlyburly,'' Sean
Penn offers the audience a dare as much as a performance.
	   ``'Hurlyburly' speaks to a lot of things that I'm most
interested in talking about as an actor,'' Penn said. ``And if it
turns out that it's something people what to listen to, then I
might find that acting is still a way to get through to people. If
not, I think I'll find myself quite discouraged in the audiences.''
	   Penn is sitting in a Beverly Hills hotel room, firing up the
latest link in a chain of cigarettes. He's ostensibly here to
promote ``Hurlyburly,'' though he'll have none of that TV
talk-show, let's-go-the-clip happy talk. Acting means too much to
him.
	   Away from the paparazzi, the 38-year-old Penn is obviously not
the Hollywood bad-boy caricature of the tabloids, and yet something
seems to simmer. Call it passion, anger, an obsessive refusal to
compromise. It's always there with Penn, popping up at the oddest
times.
	   Ask about how he chooses his roles and Penn will go on a tirade
about how ``sick and tired and angry'' he is about the films ``some
of my peers seem so anxious to do.''
	   ``You don't want to do things where for a paycheck they make you
look all pretty, put dramatic music behind the most vile aspects of
human nature, and sell an audience a dog and pony show that has
them going on the street afterwards feeling that their life is less
than anything they see in the movie,'' Penn said.
	   Lately, Penn has been cranking out movies the way he goes
through cigarettes, and it's left him out of breath. Two films are
out this Christmas, ``Hurlyburly'' and Terrence Malick's epic war
poem, ``The Thin Red Line.''
	   Both have Academy Award buzz for Penn, a nominee for ``Dead Man
Walking'' in 1996. The performances may be worlds apart, a
loquacious Hollywood lech vs. a quietly cynical soldier, though
they reflect his attention to roles with power, emotion and
complexity _ and his willingness to go against the commercial
mainstream.
	   The work has left him drained, ambivalent.
	   ``I can't say what I'm going to do _ or not going to do _ as an
actor at this point,'' he said.
	   Penn is speaking long-term. The immediate future is much more
clear: back to writing and directing, as he did with ``The Indian
Runner'' in 1991 and ``The Crossing Guard'' in 1995. A binge
writer, he pounded out a script after ``Hurlyburly,'' and he's in
discussions to direct a prison drama called ``Monsters Ball.''
	   ``I'm going to try to avoid the acting part of this business for
as long as I can,'' he said. ``I've acted in a bunch of movies this
year and last, and it kind of came as a rush in a sense. I did this
even though I knew I had only so much energy, and I was going to
burn out.''
	   Penn said his dedication to his work comes from his parents. His
mother, Eileen Ryan, is an actress (she recently appeared on the
television show ``Ally McBeal''), and his late father, Leo Penn,
was a blacklisted actor who became a prolific television director.
	   Leo Penn died in September, and Sean Penn says his father is ``a
continuing influence,'' a man who taught him the ``sober
decision-making processes that go into the craft.''
	   While his father was a Hollywood veteran, directing hundreds of
hours of television, from ``Kojak'' to ``Little House on the
Prairie,'' he left it to his sons to discover the pitfalls of the
entertainment business.
	   Certainly, Sean Penn's much-publicized battles with the
limelight, his volatile marriage to Madonna, his tangles with
photographers, speak to tough lessons outside his arts-supportive
family.
	   Penn doesn't go into any of the craziness in much detail, except
to say: ``I think the things that we look back on with any kind of
conflict about or regret is those circumstances when you
inadvertently hurt somebody or let down your work. You learn from
that.''
	   It is the darkest depths of Hollywood that Penn plumbs in
``Hurlyburly,'' the screen version of David Rabe's 1984 play. The
movie co-stars Kevin Spacey, Chazz Palminteri, Robin Wright Penn
(Penn's wife), Garry Shandling and two actresses in unexpected
performances: a very grown-up Anna Paquin as a runaway and a
decidedly un-bubbly Meg Ryan as a slutty stripper.
	   Penn hangs out with men exhibiting extremely bad behavior as he
goes on a cocaine-fueled search for some glimmer of hope and
humanity. It is a role he first played on stage 10 years ago and
said that ``what people don't like to face is that the social
content of the play has not changed a bit.''
	   ``What you always have to remember about Hollywood is it's a
town where for every dream there's desperation for the dream to be
accomplished,'' he said. ``You have a heightened level of colorful
people, a heightened level of frightened people, a lot of people
chasing their tail worrying about being found out as a fraud, a lot
of people who are feeling lucky, a lot of people who are feeling
unlucky and resentful.''
	   In short, he said, ``There's a lot on the line every day
emotionally for people here.''

	   In the spotlight: Anthony Hopkins
	    &UR; Image: Anthony Hopkins is a dark and stormy knight of Welsh
acting.
	   ``I've always been turbulent,'' Hopkins says. ``I've never been
one of those peaceful characters.''
	   Hopkins has portrayed many of what he calls ``people who aren't
very tightly wrapped.'' He has played Adolf Hitler, the Lindbergh
baby kidnapper Bruno Hauptmann and the disturbed ventriloquist in
the cult favorite, ``Magic.'' He's less proud of his work in
fluffier films like ``International Velvet'' with Tatum O'Neal.
	    &UR; Personal Stats: Hopkins was born on Dec. 31, 1937, in South
Wales. ``I was an oddball when I was a kid,'' he says. ``I hated
school. In the postwar period, we didn't have good teachers. Our
education was hideous, a lot of corporal punishment. I was terrible
in everything.''
	   Hopkins' teachers told him he was a failure, and he took those
feelings of inadequacy with him when he became an actor. ``I used
to feel like a closed fist on the stage,'' he recalls. ``I'd be
angry at the audience and angry at the other actors. That anger has
stayed with me all my life.''
	   Although Hopkins was a poor student, he won a scholarship to the
Welsh College of Music and Drama. He also attended the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art in London.
	    &UR; Debut: Hopkins made his stage debut in ``Julius Caesar'' in
1964. His first film was ``The Lion in Winter'' in 1968 with Peter
O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn.
	   Hopkins was an understudy to Laurence Olivier in the London
stage production of ``Dance of Death'' in 1966. When Olivier became
ill, Hopkins stepped into the role. Olivier said Hopkins ``walked
away with the part like a cat with a mouse between its teeth.''
	    &UR; Film Roles: In ``Howards End'' and ``The Remains of the Day,''
Hopkins perfected a polite holding back of emotion, made up of
syncopated pauses and gentlemanly mutterings.
	   But he is best-known for his chilling performance as Hannibal
Lecter, a psychopathic psychiatrist who devours his patients, in
Jonathan Demme's ``The Silence of the Lambs.'' Hopkins played the
evil Dr. Lecter opposite Jodie Foster, a fledgling FBI agent who
must enlist his help in tracking down a serial killer. Lecter was
behind bars for most of the movie, but he managed to terrify Foster
(and the film's audiences) with his eerie, chilling portrayal of a
soft-spoken madman.
	   ``It was easy to get into the character,'' Hopkins recalls. ``I
saw the external of the man, I saw he would be economical in his
movements. And I saw he would have no sense of uncertainty, which
of course is a true symptom of madness.''
	   He won an Oscar for the role.
	   Hopkins was nominated again as an English gentleman in ``The
Remains of the Day,'' in the title role in ``Nixon,'' and as the
benign but cantankerous John Quincy Adams in ``Amistad.''
	   His most recent films include ``The Mask of Zorro'' and ``Meet
Joe Black.''

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Entertainment highlights during the week of Dec. 27-Jan. 2:
	   55 years ago: Fans crowded New York City's Times Square as Frank
Sinatra opened his singing engagement at the Paramount Theater.
	   And Cary Grant and John Garfield starred in ``Destination
Tokyo.''
	   30 years ago: Chuck Berry, Three Dog Night, Fleetwood Mac and
Richie Havens performed at the Miami Pop Festival. It was the first
big East Coast rock festival.
	   10 years ago: TV Guide magazine presented its eighth annual J.
Fred Muggs Awards. The awards were named after the chimpanzee who
appeared on the original ``Today'' show. The Peacock Award for
Olympic Splendor went to Bryant Gumbel, who took 18 designer suits
with him to cover the Games in Seoul, Korea, for NBC.
	   And William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and other starship Enterprise
crew members gathered in Hollywood to toast the near-completion of
the movie, ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.'' Cast members sipped
a mixture of champagne and green melon liqueur. There were only a
few special-effects sequences left to be filmed.
	   Five years ago: The Beach Boys' ``Good Vibrations'' and Tony
Bennett's ``I Left My Heart in San Francisco'' were added to the
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences' Hall of Fame.
	   Barbra Streisand ended a 22-year break from paid stage
appearances with two concerts. Streisand gave two well-received
performances at the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve
and New Year's night. She wound up her New Year's Eve show by
shouting to the audience: ``I did it, I did it, I did it!''
	   And Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger starred in Richard
Attenborough's ``Shadowlands.''
	   Spoken 10 years ago:
	   ``I love animation. I've always considered it an idealized form
of filmmaking. And I really dig the Tito character.'' _ Comedian
Cheech Marin, referring to his role in the Disney film, ``Oliver
and Company.''
	   Spoken five years ago:
	   ``I'm a big movie fan. Sometimes I'd go two or three times a
week. I used to think, 'I can do that.' I didn't admit it because
my friends would think I was crazy. I didn't look like Cary Grant.
They'd say, 'YOU'RE going to be a movie star?''' _ Actor Danny
DeVito.
	   Spoken one year ago:
	   ``I'm definitely not funny. I know what's not funny, I know what
a hack is, and I laugh at all the right things, but you'd never
characterize me as a `funny person.''' _ Comedian-actress Janeane
Garofalo.

Police investigating suicides after poison ordered on Internet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KELLY OLSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Seven people apparently ordered cyanide on the
Internet from a man who offered suicide consultations and later
took his own life, Japanese police and media reports said Sunday.
	   Police said they were investigating two other suicides.
	   The cyanide suicide reports are the latest in a year of bizarre
poisoning cases that have raised anxiety levels in Japan, which
once prided itself on relative freedom from indiscriminate crime.
	   A police spokesman in Tokyo who gave only his surname, Fujii,
said the seven people who ordered cyanide transferred money to the
bank account of the man.
	   His body was discovered at his home in the city of Sapporo on
Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido on Dec. 15.
	   Media reports said the man offered suicide consultations on the
Internet under the name ``Dr. Kiriko,'' a character who carried out
euthanasia in a popular series of comics titled ``Black Jack.''
	   Quoting police sources it not identify, Kyodo News agency
identified him as a 27-year-old pharmacist with a history of mental
illness. Media reports said he committed suicide.
	   ``At the close of a dark year yet another poisoning incident
symbolic of it has occurred,'' lamented the Yomiuri newspaper,
Japan's largest, in a Sunday editorial.
	   ``It was the Internet that brought together people who wanted to
commit suicide with a person who had poison,'' editorialized the
influential Asahi newspaper.
	   Fujii said police are investigating the suicide of a 21-year-old
Tokyo woman who died from an apparent overdose of sleeping pills
and another person who died after taking cyanide.
	   The Asahi newspaper reported she was a 24-year-old Tokyo
resident and committed suicide on Dec. 15.
	   Fujii said three others who made cash transfers have been
confirmed alive, while two remain unaccounted for. Media reports,
however, said four have been confirmed alive.
	   In July, four people died and 63 became ill after eating curry
rice laced with arsenic in a mass poisoning at a summer festival in
southwestern Japan. A former insurance saleswoman was arrested
earlier this month on murder and attempted murder charges in those
deaths.
	   The poisoning drew widespread attention in a society that boasts
relatively low crime. It also set off a spate of copycat crimes
with drinks at stores and in vending machines, including a can of
tea that killed a man.
	   In 1995, 12 people were killed and thousands sickened after
lethal sarin gas was released on the Tokyo subway system during
morning rush hour.

Report: Boy kills ex-convict with machete
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A 15-year old armed with a machete
stabbed to death an ex-convict who barged into the boy's house on
Christmas Day, a news report said Sunday.
	   Police found the body of Aripin Salat slumped on the stairway of
the boy's house, clutching the machete in his hands, The Star daily
reported.
	   According to police, the boy and his two-year-old sister were at
home in the rural town of Sandakan on northern Borneo island when
the man, in his 30s, came by their house on Dec. 25 asking for a
cup of water, which the teenager provided.
	   The man then asked for a cigarette but the boy said his father,
who was working at a farm some distance away, wasn't able to give
him one.
	   Police said the ex-convict then barged into the house and
threatened to shoot the boy and his sister. The boy grabbed a
machete lying in the hallway, struggled with the intruder and
stabbed him at the waist.
	   The boy grabbed his sister and fled. When he returned with his
father, they found the intruder slumped in the house, the machete
still embedded in his body.
	   Police said the ex-convict was released from prison in July.

Next around the world balloon attempt will fly close to space
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Launch tentatively scheduled for 6 a.m. Tuesday local time,
1900 GMT Monday. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ An Australian-U.S. team is readying for
its shot at the first nonstop around-the-world balloon flight, with
liftoff planned for just days after Chicago millionaire Steve
Fossett's team splashed down in the Pacific Ocean.
	   Denver real estate magnate Dave Liniger's team is making final
preparations in the Australian Outback town of Alice Springs. The
team expects to succeed where others failed by taking the high
road, flying on the outer edge of the atmosphere where weather
shouldn't be an issue.
	   Weather conditions, however, can affect takeoff and landing, and
dictate a launch between late December and mid-January. Tuesday
morning local time, Monday in the United States, is the first
scheduled launch.
	   The team is making its first attempt at what balloon enthusiasts
describe as the last great adventure in aviation. Fossett, British
millionaire Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand of Sweden abandoned
their more conventional balloon flight Friday about 10 miles (15
kilometers) off Kahuku Point at the northeast tip of Oahu, Hawaii.
They have tried a total of 11 times.
	   Fossett's team ditched about midway through its journey after
losing the high-altitude 200 mph (320 kph) winds needed to carry
the combination helium and hot-air balloon across the Pacific to
North America. They got caught in a low-pressure system and feared
they would be stuck for a week.
	   ``In the stratosphere, there is no significant weather features,
so once we get up there we don't get the storms that have brought
down previous attempts,'' said Dan Pedersen, a former U.S. Navy
test pilot and the Liniger team's mission control director.
	   ``At this time of year, the winds are exactly east to west and
at 130,000 feet (40,000 meters) they can go clear around the
globe,'' he said Thursday by telephone from control headquarters in
Alice Springs.
	   Though spared the weather concerns, flying in subspace poses its
own dangers. The biggest threat is a sudden leak in the gondola _ a
7-foot (2-meter) by 8-foot (2.5 meter) pressurized,
temperature-controlled capsule.
	   ``Our equipment has to be like a mini-spacecraft,'' said
Australian John Wallington. He, journalist Bob Martin of
Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Liniger, who is chairman of Re/Max
International Inc., will pilot the balloon.
	   The team will fly in a polyethylene balloon thin as lunch wrap
that is 460 feet (140 meters) in diameter at ``full float'' and 700
feet (210 meters) high, large enough to envelope the Houston
Astrodome.
	   They will wear pressure suits made by Russian space engineers
and rise 1,000 feet (300 meters) a minute during takeoff to reach a
cruising altitude of 130,000 feet (40,000 meters), or about 24
miles (39 kilometers), above sea level.
	   There, they expect to catch winds that will carry them west at
up to 80 mph along a route that almost directly follows the Tropic
of Capricorn.
	   Sixteen to 18 days and 22,800 miles (37,000 kilometers) later,
they hope to return to earth somewhere in the Australian Outback,
hopefully near Alice Springs.
	   The NASA-developed balloon type has been used before, but only
to carry unmanned scientific payloads to heights of about 80,000
feet (24,000 meters).
	   ``They will have about 2.5 percent of the atmosphere we have on
the ground,'' Pedersen said. ``Go much higher than that and guess
where you are _ you're out of it (the atmosphere).''
	   ``Where these guys are going there is no second chance,'' he
said, ``the life-support systems have to work.''

Sabres 2, Devils 0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Dominik Hasek continued his
December shutout surge and Miraslav Satan scored both goals as the
Buffalo Sabres beat the New Jersey Devils 2-0 Saturday night.
	   The shutout was the second straight and fourth of the month for
Hasek, who made 34 saves. Hasek, who leads the NHL with seven
shutouts, has not allowed a goal in 163:35.
	   The shutout was the 40th of Hasek's NHL career.
	   The Northeast Division-leading Sabres, 10-1-1 in their last 12
games, improved to 19-6-5 overall. The Atlantic Division-leading
Devils dropped to 19-9-4.
 &UR; Islanders 4, Bruins 2
	   In Uniondale, New York, Mike Watt and Claude Lapointe scored in
the third period to lead the New York Islanders over the Boston
Bruins.
	   Watt's shot from the left circle at 9:50 beat goalie Byron Dafoe
while two players were wrestling in front of his crease to break a
2-2 tie. Lapointe clinched the victory with a shorthanded breakaway
at 14:51.
	   Zigmund Palffy and Trevor Linden also scored for New York. Chris
Taylor and Dmitri Khristich scored for the Bruins, who have lost
two straight.
 &UR; Rangers 6, Hurricanes 3
	   In Greensboro, North Carolina, Petr Nedved had two goals and two
assists, and the New York Rangers scored six times in the second
period for a victory over the Carolina Hurricanes.
	   Adam Graves also scored two goals, and Jeff Beukeboom, Sean
Pronger and Niklas Sundstrom had two assists apiece for New York.
The six goals fell two shy of the Rangers' record for goals in a
period, set in a 12-1 win over the California Golden Seals in 1971.
	   Carolina gave up six goals in a period for the second time in
its existence.
	   Sami Kapanen, Gary Roberts and Nelson Emerson scored for
Carolina, which beat the Rangers 1-0 on Wednesday night in New
York.

<TEXT>
	   In Toronto, Stephane Quintal scored with 4:58 remaining as the
Montreal Canadiens stopped the second-longest winless streak in
team history with a victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs.
	   The Canadiens were winless in 11 (0-6-5) skating into the game
against the Maple Leafs, and the score was tied at 1-1 with the
third period quickly disappearing when Quintal scored his
game-winner.
	   The Canadiens fell one game short of tying the longest winless
streak in franchise history, shared by the 1925-26 and 1935-36
teams.
	   Eric Weinrich also scored for the Canadiens (9-18-7). Steve
Thomas scored for the Maple Leafs (19-13-2).
 &UR; Panthers 3, Lightning 1

had two goals as Florida beat Tampa Bay, handing the Lightning
their ninth straight home loss.
	   Lindsay scored the game-winner in the second period and added an
empty-netter with 27.3 seconds left to play.
	   Burke was especially strong during the second period, when he
turned aside 14 of 15 shots. The goalie, who is 3-0 this season
against Tampa Bay while allowing just three goals, made point-blank
saves on Craig Janney, Cory Cross and Darcy Tucker.
	   Alex Selivanov scored for the Lightning.
 &UR; Penguins 2, Senators 1, OT
	   In Pittsburgh, Jaromir Jagr scored at 1:18 of overtime to lead
the Pittsburgh Penguins over the Ottawa Senators.
	   The Penguins, who had been outshot 13-1 in the third period,
remained unbeaten on home ice against Ottawa. The Senators are
0-13-3 in Pittsburgh since joining the NHL in 1992.
	   Backup goalie Peter Skudra played brilliantly, particularly in
the third period, to give the Penguins a chance to get their second
overtime win of the season.
 &UR; Flyers 3, Blackhawks 2
	   In Chicago, Eric Lindros and Eric Desjardins scored in the first
four minutes as the Philadelphia Flyers beat the Chicago Blackhawks
to extend their unbeaten streak to seven games.
	   Valeri Zelepukin also scored for the Flyers, 4-0-3 in their last
seven games.
	   With the win, the Flyers also improved their record this season
against Western Conference teams to 6-0-2 and stretched their
unbeaten streak against the Blackhawks to five games (4-0-1).
	   Doug Gilmour scored both Chicago goals _ and recorded his
1,200th NHL career point.
 &UR; Blues 4, Red Wings 3
	   In St. Louis, Scott Pellerin scored twice as the St. Louis Blues
extended Detroit's losing streak to a season-high five games.
	   The five-game losing streak is the longest for the two-time
defending Stanley Cup champions since the 1990-91 season. However,
the Red Wings have a long way to go before reaching the team record
of 14 straight losses, which took place from Feb. 24-March 25,
1982.
	   Detroit will look to snap the current slide Monday night when it
meets the Blues at Joe Louis Arena.
 &UR; Predators 3, Capitals 1
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, rookie goaltender Tomas Vokoun earned
his second straight win against a 1998 Stanley Cup finalist as the
expansion Nashville Predators knocked off the Washington Capitals.
	   Vokoun, who had made 50 saves in the Predators' 5-3 victory over
Detroit on Wednesday, needed to stop just 26 of 27 shots against
the struggling Capitals. Washington is just 3-9-0 in its last 12
games.
	   James Black's goal with 7:07 left in the game spoiled the
shutout bid of Vokoun, a 22-year-old from the Czech Republic who is
4-3-2 in relief of the injured Mike Dunham.
	   Bob Boughner, Vitali Yachmenev and Greg Johnson scored for
Nashville.

King welcomes defections by top Khmer Rouge leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk has approved
the defections of two key leaders of the Khmer Rouge reign of
terror in a deal marking the death rattle of the revolutionary
group.
	   Prime Minister Hun Sen negotiated the final touches on the
defections Friday night _ the 20th anniversary of the Christmas
1978 invasion by Vietnam that toppled the genocidal regime.
	   Khieu Samphan, long the nominal Khmer Rouge leader while others
held real power, and political chief Nuon Chea said in letters to
the prime minister and king that they wished to live out the rest
of their lives as ``ordinary citizens.''
	   Hun Sen passed on the messages to the king, who is receiving
medical treatment in Beijing. Sihanouk was held prisoner in his
palace during the Khmer Rouge regime and lost a dozen family
members.
	   Sihanouk's response late Saturday echoed conciliatory language
used by Hun Sen and did not mention bringing the pair to trial for
causing the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians after seizing
power in 1975.
	   The king expressed ``deep gratitude about this good news'' and
praised Hun Sen's `` success in applying the Royal Government's
policy of national reconciliation to provide our people with a
complete peace and happiness and to speed national reconstruction
and progress.''
	   Hun Sen has brushed aside questions whether Khieu Samphan and
Nuon Chea would be tried by Cambodian courts or an international
tribunal, indicating a deal was struck allowing them to surrender
in exchange for not being punished.
	   The defections leave at large only one major Khmer Rouge figure,
the one-legged general Ta Mok, known as ``The Butcher.'' A Thai
army general whose troops monitor the Cambodian border estimated
that Ta Mok had no more than 100 die-hard guerrillas with him.
	   A Hun Sen aide, Om Yentieng, said Ta Mok's arrest is still
sought. But Thai Maj. Gen. Wiwat Sattarak said the Cambodian
government was more prepared to ``let him grow old and die'' in the
jungle.
	   The Cambodian government and the United States have said in the
past that they wanted Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea and Ta Mok captured
and tried for genocide and crimes against humanity.
	   Longtime Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot _ purged in a bloody power
struggle last year _ died of a purported heart attack in April
under house arrest by his ex-comrades.
	   A team of legal experts appointed by the United Nations visited
Cambodia last month to assess evidence for a possible international
tribunal. Local U.N. officials said the report was due to reach
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a few weeks.
	   Om Yentieng said the prime minister supports a trial but that
justice should be left to woefully unequipped local courts.
	   Over the past two years, the government has adopted a policy of
negotiating de facto amnesty with Khmer Rouge leaders to persuade
them to end nearly two decades of stalemated civil war since they
were overthrown.
	   The strategy brought peace to large areas of Cambodia for the
first time in a generation, but means that none of the group's most
bloodstained chieftains has been arrested.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea have surfaced in Pailin in
Cambodia's rugged northwest. The area is controlled by one of their
old comrades, Pol Pot's brother-in-law Ieng Sary, the first Khmer
Rouge leader to make peace with the government.

Wild weather greets fleet

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The fleet in the annual
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race was encountering what the skippers
described as ``extreme'' weather as it battled its way across Bass
Strait on Sunday.
	   Race leaders Sayonara and Brindabella were encountering heavy
seas and winds of up to 45 knots as they led the fleet toward
Flinders Island, with American yacht Sayonara 3.1 nautical miles
ahead.
	   Further back in the fleet the South Australian yacht Doctor
Rager reported winds of 50 to 60 knots and gusting to 70 knots.
	   Organizers said they were the worst conditions the race had
struck since the gale-swept 1993 event.
	   The destination in the 630-nautical mile race is Hobart, capital
of the island state of Tasmania.
	   Only nine yachts in the original 115-boat fleet had retired, the
latest being the Sydney pocket maxi Innkeeper. Others out of the
race were Wild Thing, Sydney, ABN AMRO Challenge, Sledgehammer,
King Billy, Marchioness, Assassin and Red Jacket.
	   Sayonara and Brindabella remained many miles ahead of the
position reached by German maxi Morning Glory in the same time when
she set the race record of 2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10
seconds in 1996. (djp)
