<HEADLINE> Fig Industry Struggles To Survive / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- At the turn of the century, an  
enterprising young lawyer from Kansas moved to town and literally 
blasted his way onto the fig scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Using about 1 million sticks of dynamite, J.C. Forkner drilled  
holes into the hardpacked soil of northwest Fresno and planted acre 
after acre of trees in a region that became known as the nation's 
fig garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, most are just skeletons, scattered in dusty orchards fast  
becoming graveyards or paved over by housing subdivision and malls. 
</P>
<P>
	The big worry for fig farmers is that shrinking acreage could be  
a sign of things to come if the industry cannot restore the 
popularity of fig cookies and find new markets for the dried fruit 
and its paste. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't succeed in new product development and expansion  
of fig bar consumption, that could be a problem,'' said Paul 
Mesple, whose family has been in the business for more than 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Jew, vice president of industrial sales and technical  
services for Valley Fig Growers, a farming cooperative, said the 
biggest obstacle is that ``consumers don't know what figs are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although considered a fruit, the fig is actually a flower  
inverted onto itself. The seeds are drupes -- the real fruit. The 
tree is a member of the mulberry family, with a broad, spreading 
canopy. 
</P>
<P>
	Figs have the highest dietary fiber content of any common fruit,  
nut or vegetable. They are also free of fat, sodium and 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	As legend has it, the soft, sweet, droplet-shaped fig was  
introduced to mankind by Bacchus, the ancient Roman God who is 
often depicted wearing a crown of fig leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Forkner brought figs to Fresno County in the early 1900s,  
planting 600,000 trees on 12,000 acres now being swallowed up or 
turned into urban islands by subdivisions and shopping malls. The 
last planting was in 1995 on five acres. The amount of fig land 
actively farmed in the county is estimated between about 1,000 and 
2,300 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	California's total fig acreage has remained at 16,000 or so  
acres the past 10 years. The state is the only commercial producer 
of dried figs in the nation and normally yields 15,000 tons a year, 
said Ron Klamm, head of the California Fig Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the world's fig crop is sun dried after the ripened figs  
are picked. But in California, the fruit usually remains on the 
tree until they are semidry and drop. They are then gathered at 
frequent intervals and further dried. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to grow as many figs as possible that can be  
packaged as whole fruit, as high consumer demand provides a better 
profit margin in comparison to fig paste. 
</P>
<P>
	But even in a good year, well over half of California's dried  
figs are turned into a chewy, seedy paste, used by Nabisco Inc. and 
other bakeries for cakelike cookies and fruit bars. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, farmers could not seem to keep up with the  
demand, helped by promotions geared toward health-conscious 
Americans. But then all types of fat-free fruit cookies and other 
health bars became popular. 
</P>
<P>
	The fig industry, which says it lost market share because of the  
expansion and ended up with more paste than it could sell, then had 
to drop prices even lower after last year's El Nino season. It 
could be a year before the surplus is unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, farmers and others in the business are trying to broaden  
the market by developing a concentrated extract for flavoring and 
baking; adding colors and flavors to diced figs; and grounding figs 
into a powder for use as a health and dietary supplement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have our work cut out for us,'' Klamm said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Most Major Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against most major currencies  
Wednesday, gaining against the yen on falling Japanese interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's rise against the euro came as European economic  
fundamentals remained stagnant, its major stock markets falling 
Wednesday on negative sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not surprising to see the dollar strong,'' said  
Guillermo Estebanez, a foreign exchange economist at the Bank of 
America in San Francisco, noting recent reports indicating strength 
in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 121.77  
Japanese yen, up from 120.23 on Tuesday. Also in late trading, the 
euro was quoted at $1.0890, down from $1.0925. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders jumped at the opportunity to dump yen and buy dollars  
during Asian trading when the Bank of Japan flooded the interbank 
loan market with cash by buying short-term government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	That action drove the call rate, used by big banks making  
overnight loans to each other, down to a miniscule 0.02 percent 
from 0.07 percent the day before. Long-term bond rates fell as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is fighting its worst recession in decades. Lowering  
interest rates makes cheap cash available in the hope of spurring 
spending and building, but the steps are receiving mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to see the Japanese flailing their arms, trying to  
make monetary policy work,'' Estebanez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4597 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4571, and 1.5267 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5208. The British 
pound fell to $1.6134, down from $1.6145. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7960 German 
marks, up from 1.7902; 6.0241 French francs, up from 6.0024; and 
Italian lire, 1,779.36, up from 1,773.05.

	First Lady Visits New York  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton is in the city today,  
speaking at a public school about art education. She had nothing to 
say about the possibility of running for the Senate. At 
Intermediate School 25 in the borough of Queens, the first lady 
unveiled a new national report plugging arts education. Polls taken 
a few weeks ago gave her a commanding lead in a hypothetical 
match-up with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the Senate seat being 
vacated by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 2000.

	Uganda Apologizes for Killings

<P>
	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- The FBI is investigating the murder of  
eight foreign tourists in a gorilla reserve investigating the 
killings. Apologizing for the deaths, President Yoweri Museveni 
promised to capture or kill the rebels who used machetes to slay 
the tourists -- including two Americans -- Monday in the mountainous 
rain forest near the Rwandan area made famous in the 1988 film 
``Gorillas in the Mist.''

	Execution of German Still Planned

<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- Gov. Jane Hull ignored international  
pleas to halt today's scheduled execution of convicted killer 
Walter LaGrand, a German citizen whose brother was put to death 
last week for the same crime. Germany sued last night in the 
International Court of Justice to try to halt LaGrand's execution, 
scheduled for this afternoon. LaGrand's 35-year-old brother, Karl, 
was executed last week for fatally stabbing Marana bank manager 
Kenneth Hartsock and slashing his throat during a botched robbery 
in 1982.

	Court: Schools Must Pay Nurses

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal law requires the nation's public  
school districts to pay for professional nurses to accompany some 
disabled students throughout the school day, the Supreme Court 
ruled today in the case of an Iowa teen-ager. The court, by a 7-2 
vote, said such continuous care is not medical treatment, and 
therefore must be publicly funded under the federal Individuals 
with Disabilities Education Act.

	Lewinsky Says Clinton Is Sorry  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky, in an interview clip aired  
today, said she felt President Clinton was ``sorry he got caught'' 
when their affair was revealed to the nation. Ms. Lewinsky revealed 
that she felt like a piece of trash the day Clinton was forced to 
admit their affair on national television and apologized to the 
nation -- but not to her. Portions of Ms. Lewinsky's interview with 
Barbara Walters played on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' The full 
interview is to be aired tonight at 9 p.m. EST.

Taliban soldiers used knives to slash the leather jackets young men 
were wearing in Kabul today, saying the jackets were prohibited 
under Islam, witnesses said. Since taking power in 1996, the 
Taliban have imposed their brand of harsh Islamic laws. They have 
banned music, video cassette recorders, televisions, cameras and 
books published outside of Afghanistan.

fueled such 1960s hits as ``Son of a Preacher Man'' and ``Wishin' 
and Hopin','' has died after a long battle with breast cancer. She 
was 59. Springfield died last night at her home in 
Henley-on-Thames, about 30 miles west of London, said her agent,

	MONACA, Pa. (AP) -- Mike Webster, the Pittsburgh Steelers center  
who was elected to the NFL Hall of Fame, has been accused of

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky: I Had a 'Foolish Dream' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking back, Monica Lewinsky says, her hope  
of living happily ever after with Bill Clinton was ``a pretty 
foolish dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As moony as a romance novel, occasionally self-pitying,  
sometimes angry or sniping, Ms. Lewinsky's version of events is 
full of the emotional melodrama America has come to expect from its 
most famous former intern. It's also spiced with confessional 
detail: her other affairs, an abortion, antidepressants and 
thoughts of suicide, chronic angst about her weight, frequent 
crying jags. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some days that I regret that the relationship ever  
started,'' Ms. Lewinsky told interviewer Barbara Walters. ``And 
there are some days that I just regret that I ever confided in 
Linda Tripp'' -- the former friend who disclosed the affair to 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky comfortably and almost cheerfully fielded questions  
on national TV, sporting a new, slicked-back hairstyle, laughing 
softly and occasionally looking down at embarrassing moments. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABC interview was part of a promotional blitz for ``Monica's  
Story,'' written by Andrew Morton with her extensive help, which 
goes on sale Thursday. In 288 pages, the book covers her life from 
birth in San Francisco 25 years ago through her videotaped 
testimony Feb. 1 for Clinton's Senate impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	At that deposition, one of Clinton's attorneys read Ms. Lewinsky  
a statement saying the president was ``very, very sorry for what 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hit by the fact that I don't have him in my life  
anymore,'' she later told Morton tearfully. ``I just miss him so 
much right now,'' she said of the man she sometimes thought of as 
her ``little boy lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she also called Clinton ``a selfish man who lies all the  
time'' and said sometimes ``I have to turn off the TV because I 
feel sick looking at him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In some passages she portrays herself as a bungee-jumping,  
leg-waxing, e-mail-joking Beverly Hills girl of the '90s; in others 
she comes across as emotionally overwrought. 
</P>
<P>
	The path to her affair with the president -- Ms. Lewinsky says  
they ``fooled around'' in an Oval Office bathroom and inner office 
-- began when a friend of her mother helped arrange a White House 
internship. 
</P>
<P>
	There was lots of gossip at the White House about presidential  
womanizing, but the new intern thought of Clinton as an old guy 
with a ``big red nose and coarse, wiry-looking hair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then she saw him in person, and nearly swooned from the  
``butterflies fluttering in my tummy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a glow about him that was magnetic,'' Ms. Lewinsky  
gushes about watching the president from a distance. ``He exudes a 
sexual energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She began pursuing brief opportunities to flirt with him along  
rope lines and at a staff party. She read up on Gennifer Flowers' 
account of her own alleged relationship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The flirtation was mutual, she says: ``He undressed me with his  
eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She says it was her now-famous come-on, in which she lifted her  
jacket to reveal a glimpse of her thong panties, that prompted 
their first sexual encounter on Nov. 15, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was the president, she says, who initiated their  
late-night, sexual phone chats. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months after their first encounter, on Jan. 21, Ms. Lewinsky  
boldly demanded more emotional intimacy. Clinton provided it. 
According to the book, the president became misty-eyed as he told 
her how anguished he was to learn that day about the death of an 
American soldier in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brought me one step further to falling in love with him,''  
Ms. Lewinsky said. At one point, he suggested he might be divorced 
after leaving office, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton says Ms. Lewinsky ``never really considered that he was a  
married man'' until Clinton briefly broke off their trysts in 
February 1996, saying he didn't want to hurt his wife Hillary and 
daughter Chelsea. Ms. Lewinsky's guilt, according to the book, was 
``muted by the exhilaration of the affair'' and by her thoughts 
that the Clintons' marriage might well end when he left office. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton cried the day in May 1997 when he finally broke things  
off for good, Ms. Lewinsky told ABC. ``It was an intense 
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's low self-esteem, especially her fear that she was  
too fat to be attractive, is a recurring motif. At one point, when 
her earlier affair with a married man in Oregon was discovered, Ms. 
Lewinsky told the wronged wife that ``the relationship had only 
come about because of her insecurity about her weight,'' the book 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's view of sexuality is unabashedly liberal. It's  
not ``something to hide away in the dark or be ashamed of,'' she 
says. She reveals a three-month romance with a Pentagon employee in 
1996 (at the same time she was secretly meeting the president) that 
resulted in an abortion. She called the procedure ``horrible and 
very depressing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her self-acknowledged sense of melodrama permeates the book. The  
chapter about her questioning by Kenneth Starr's investigators, at 
a suburban Ritz-Carlton, is titled ``Terror in Room 1012.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with the prospect of betraying the president's trust, she  
considered throwing herself out the hotel room window to her death, 
Morton writes. 
</P>
<P>
	She was stung by his harsh tone when the president publicly  
denied sexual relations with ``that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.'' And when 
she learned that Clinton had told a presidential aide she was a 
``stalker'' who threatened her, she told Walters: 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the defining moment when I really knew and fell out  
of love with him.''

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Moves To Buy Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- He knew how to get a puck past Andy Moog, but  
can he assemble a multimillion-dollar business deal? 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Lemieux, who led the Pittsburgh Penguins to two Stanley  
Cup championships, wants to rescue the team from bankruptcy, keep 
it in Pittsburgh and collect the $31.4 million he said he is owed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux is seeking investors to raise $40 million to $50 million  
and said he wants to assume more than $60 million in the team's 
bank loans to buy the Penguins and ensure they don't move to 
another city. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has filed papers indicating he is owed $31.4 million in  
deferred compensation, which makes him the club's largest unsecured 
creditor. He said he is willing to exchange some of those millions 
for equity in the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``My objective is to, obviously, get paid and keep the team here  
in Pittsburgh where it belongs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins are about $125 million in debt, or more than the  
franchise's total value. The team filed for bankruptcy protection 
in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux said he expects to submit a plan to buy the team to U.S.  
Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz at a March 19 hearing in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz last week threatened to place the team into  
receivership unless he saw a finance reorganization plan soon. The 
judge said if he converted the Penguins' bankruptcy into a Chapter 
7 liquidation, he would appoint a trustee to run the club until a 
buyer is found. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Marino, current co-owner of the franchise, also plans to  
submit a reorganization plan to Markovitz, even though he has lost 
nearly $40 million operating the club the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Baldwin, the Penguins' primary owner from 1991-97 and  
still a co-owner, also is looking at trying to reorganize the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux offered Marino, a Boston multimillionaire, little  
sympathy for his financial losses. He said Marino isn't a creditor, 
and he made a bad investment. Lemieux is chairman of the committee 
representing the team's unsecured creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino had hoped that Lemieux would join him in rescuing the  
club, which declared bankruptcy in October. But Lemieux, who has 
sued Marino to recover money owed to him in a contract approved by 
Baldwin, said last week he would not work with Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has met with city, county and state leaders to rally  
support for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	At the March 19 hearing, Markovitz is slated to rule on motions  
dealing with whether the team can leave Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Gun Makers Forcing Out Top Lobbyist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In trying to fight lawsuits against the gun  
industry, lobbyist Richard Feldman may have created too many 
enemies by trying to make a few friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman is expected to resign this week as executive director of  
the American Shooting Sports Council, forced out by gun makers who 
perceive him as too conciliatory toward cities suing the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman met last week with attorneys representing New Orleans --  
the first city to sue the industry. Some saw the meeting as a step 
toward settling, which many firearms manufacturers have vowed will 
never happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notion that the association was caving into demands is  
absolutely ridiculous,'' said Richard Rucker, director of 
governmental affairs for the council. ``If Richard does go, I think 
it will be just a difference of opinion over the direction of where 
the industry needs to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The council's board took no action during a teleconference  
meeting Tuesday, but another meeting was scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman did not return several phone calls Tuesday, but was  
quoted in The Wall Street Journal as saying his status was 
``subject to change within the next 24 hours to 48 hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry insiders say Feldman was ousted because of his  
aggressive personality, not the New Orleans meeting. One gun 
company official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said 
Feldman's habit of ``grandstanding'' on positions not approved by 
most council members spelled his doom. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to oust Feldman reportedly came at the request of  
Jim Baker, the chief lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, 
after several clashes over policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can say we had differences on the issues relative to  
political and legislative strategy, but that's about as much as I 
want to say,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman, a former activist for the NRA, was working to try and  
consolidate the industry's position on suits involving gun safety, 
gun-related medical costs and alleged unethical gun marketing 
strategies filed by New Orleans, Chicago, Bridgeport, Conn., and 
Miami-Dade County. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta has also sued, but the Georgia Legislature passed a law  
banning such suits last month. Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell has 
pledged to go forward with the suit and challenge the 
constitutionality of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman's strategy worked in getting some gun makers to  
voluntarily ship their products with child-proof trigger locks.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Tops Book-Seller Website </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky's memoir may make a big splash  
on best-seller lists, but many in the publishing world believe the 
hyped confessional -- unlike the scandal that spawned it -- will 
vanish quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monica's Story'' will likely ride the wave of Lewinsky media  
mania, which peaks with Barbara Walters' heavily promoted two-hour 
interview with the former White House intern on ABC tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, industry experts say, sales could fall fast.  
</P>
<P>
	``It will be very popular for as long as it's being chatted  
about in the media, and then it will recede,'' predicted Bill 
Curry, a spokesman for Amazon.com, the Internet book-seller. 
``That's typical of a book that's kind of in and out of popular 
discourse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (the book's) shelf life is somewhere between yogurt  
and milk,'' said Lucianne Goldberg, the literary agent who urged 
Linda Tripp to tape telephone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. 
``It'll probably be about 10 days. ... There's a great curiosity 
about her, and I think it will be totally satisfied between the 
book and the Barbara Walters interview.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book, which goes on sale Thursday, was off to a strong  
start, hitting No. 1 on the Amazon.com best seller list today on 
the strength of advance orders. Publisher St. Martin's Press was 
shipping 450,000 copies to booksellers, and ``we're ready to 
reprint in a second,'' said Sally Richardson, president and 
publisher of the company's trade division. 
</P>
<P>
	But readers claimed to be uninterested in seeing even a single  
word more about Ms. Lewinsky's affair with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's not worth reading and I wouldn't waste my time,''  
Barbara Dolan said as she browsed in a midtown Manhattan bookstore. 
``I find it very sad that there is a market for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Tobin, editor in chief and vice president of the  
Book-of-the-Month Club, said his company decided not to offer

<HEADLINE> Rock Beat: Paul Westerberg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There's no escape these days for Paul  
Westerberg. 
</P>
<P>
	When he sits down at the piano and 8-month-old Johnny Paul is  
anywhere within earshot, his son screams to join him. The boy loves 
nothing more than to sit on dad's lap and tunelessly pound the 
keys. 
</P>
<P>
	Westerberg secretly welcomes the distraction, though, and he  
even straps his son on his back sometimes when he's playing guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm already wishing that I can play an instrument better so I  
can teach him something,'' Westerberg says. ``A baby might improve 
my skills. One of these days I may have to sit down and show him a 
scale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's been little escape for Westerberg professionally,  
either. Many of his fans won't let go of the boozy, bash-'em-out 
persona he created with the Replacements more than a decade ago. 
The Replacements loved to have a good time, but what set them apart 
was the smart punk at the band's center, the one with a heart and a 
wickedly creative pen. 
</P>
<P>
	That Westerberg hasn't disappeared; he's just grown up. And he's  
opened up, with a strong new album born of the darkness in his 
soul. ``Suicaine Gratifaction'' reveals a songwriter who reaches 
the top of his game when he hits an emotional bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the songs date back to 1996, when Westerberg ended a  
concert tour and returned home to Minnesota. He'd just lost the 
security of his record deal, faced an uncertain future, and he sank 
into a depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have a clue and I sought comfort in my recording  
machine in the basement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He came up with some of his most starkly beautiful music,  
exploring the mood without wallowing in it. On ``Sunrise Always 
Listens,'' the brooding narrator talks to himself but admits, ``I 
believe I have just started to bore the only guy who's listening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in a very manic mode when the initial part of this  
record was born,'' he said. ``I was not sleeping and becoming sort 
of obsessive and dark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A series of songs about missed connections reaches an emotional  
depth some of his peers can only hint at. Westerberg also takes a 
hard look at himself and the barriers that a rock 'n' roll 
lifestyle places between him and his fans on ``It's a Wonderful 
Lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't pin your hopes or pin your dreams,'' he sings, ``to  
misanthropes or guys like me. The truth is overrated, I suppose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westerberg said the song is addressed to fans and friends who  
have tried but failed to get close to him. ``It was my way of 
saying, `This is the reason why,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It sounds like many of these songs were born in the hours before  
sunrise, but Westerberg sticks to daylight. ``I have this theory 
that if it's sad in the afternoon, it will tear your heart out at 
two in the morning,'' he said. ``If you write at two in the 
morning, sometimes at noon it's kind of like, `Oh, that's 
pathetic.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Westerberg took his time turning the songs into a record and  
signing a new deal with Capitol Records. He turned to producer Don 
Was, known for his work with Bonnie Raitt and the Rolling Stones, 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Was is known for his highly polished sound, that was  
something of an odd choice. But he and Westerberg agreed that Paul 
had finished half the album by himself in his basement and not much 
else was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a line drawing as opposed to a painting,''  
Westerberg said. ``It's just one simple line, and to try to add 
color would be to distract from the shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disc's quieter, more contemplative sound -- particularly its  
emphasis on the piano -- will be one more shock to the system for 
old fans obsessed with the Replacements. They might as well get 
over it. Westerberg doesn't spend much time reminiscing about those 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think of it so rarely, except now when I do interviews and  
I'm asked to think about it,'' he said. ``If it were up to me, I'd 
no more think of my old band than I think of my high school 
schoolmates. It's like something I did, it's over with, it was good 
fun and it's gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westerberg is wrestling now with whether he wants to perform  
these songs publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never made a batch that lend themselves less to  
performing than these,'' he said. ``It's already been a while and 
some of these are so fragile. I listened to the record again 
recently, late at night, and there was a tear in my eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I can distance myself from it and look at it as a work of  
art, I'm very proud of it,'' he said. ``At the time I was doing it 
I wasn't proud, I was just trying to survive the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They aren't the sort of songs you take to a crowded, noisy bar  
with a rock band. That's all he's known, though, and it's what he 
still likes. So he's trying to find a middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I'll hire a dance troupe or something,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Book Sales May Fade Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky's memoir may make a big splash  
on best-seller lists, but many in the publishing world believe the 
hyped confessional -- unlike the scandal that spawned it -- will 
vanish quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monica's Story'' will likely ride the wave of Lewinsky media  
mania, which peaks with Barbara Walters' heavily promoted two-hour 
interview with the former White House intern on ABC tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, industry experts say, sales could fall fast.  
</P>
<P>
	``It will be very popular for as long as it's being chatted  
about in the media, and then it will recede,'' said Bill Curry, a 
spokesman for Amazon.com, the Internet book-seller. ``That's 
typical of a book that's kind of in and out of popular discourse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (the book's) shelf life is somewhere between yogurt  
and milk,'' said Lucianne Goldberg, the literary agent who urged 
Linda Tripp to tape telephone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. 
``It'll probably be about 10 days. ... There's a great curiosity 
about her, and I think it will be totally satisfied between the 
book and the Barbara Walters interview.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book, which goes on sale Thursday, was off to a strong  
start, hitting No. 5 on the Amazon.com best-seller list Tuesday on 
the strength of advance orders. Publisher St. Martin's Press was 
shipping 450,000 copies to booksellers, and ``we're ready to 
reprint in a second,'' said Sally Richardson, head of the company's 
trade division. 
</P>
<P>
	But readers claimed to be uninterested in seeing even a single  
word more about Ms. Lewinsky's affair with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's not worth reading and I wouldn't waste my time,''  
Barbara Dolan said as she browsed in a midtown Manhattan bookstore. 
``I find it very sad that there is a market for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Tobin, editor in chief and vice president of the  
Book-of-the-Month Club, said his company decided not to offer 
``Monica's Story'' to its readers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our members get their information on these things from  
magazines and television and other things than books,'' he said. 
``The story is so well covered in other media ... this particular 
title wouldn't sell well enough to our particular membership.''

<HEADLINE> GM February U.S. Sales Up 17 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. reported sharply higher U.S.  
sales in February, due in part to an aggressive, last-minute 
incentive campaign to get employees, their relatives and the 
automaker's retirees to buy more GM cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 automaker said Wednesday that its light vehicle sales  
increased 17 percent, compared with February 1998. The growth came 
across the board: car sales rose 19 percent, while sales of sport 
utility vehicles, pickups, vans and minivans combined were up 15 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's report capped a string of strong sales figures for  
February: Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday that its sales were up 8.5 
percent; DaimlerChrysler AG posted an 8 percent gain; Toyota Motor 
Corp. improved 19 percent; and Honda Motor Co. was up 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures for GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler exclude U.S. sales of  
their European brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrywide sales increased 12.5 percent over a flat  
performance in February 1998, with car sales up 9 percent and truck 
sales up 17 percent. European automakers again posted the biggest 
percentage gain -- up 28 percent. Asian automakers improved 12 
percent, as did GM-Ford-DaimlerChrysler combined. 
</P>
<P>
	February's totals equate to a seasonally adjusted annual sales  
rate of 17 million light vehicles, said analyst David Healy of 
Burnham Securities Inc. Automakers sold 15.6 million vehicles in 
the United States last year, second only to 16 million in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's kind of incredible,'' Healy said. ``I don't think they  
can keep it up. But March is apparently off to a strong start and 
it doesn't look like there's anything in the short term to get in 
the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said GM's February sales growth appeared unsustainable  
because much of it was due to an unusual month-end campaign to 
generate sales among the 2 million GM employees, relatives and 
retirees eligible for company discounts. During last weekend only, 
they were offered an extra $1,000 rebate on most GM vehicles, on 
top of the regular discount of 10 percent to 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	GM also expanded its regular employee discount program last  
month to employees of its franchised dealers, which added thousands 
more potential buyers. Dealer employees also were eligible for last 
weekend's discount. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's one incentive program that made a difference, it  
was that one,'' said analyst Nick Colas of Credit Suisse First 
Boston. ``GM had something to prove in its ability to regain share 
in cars and trucks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM's U.S. market share fell to 29 percent last year, partly due  
to a pair of damaging strikes. It has remained at that level in the 
first two months of 1999, despite the incentives. The automaker has 
set a goal of 32 percent of the market this year. 
</P>
<P>
	GM played down the effect of the rebates and declined to say  
what percentage of its sales were attributable to employee 
discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our incentives are just competitive with what's in the  
marketplace,'' said Darwin Clark, vice president of field sales, 
service and parts. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts wonder whether GM is getting desperate. Its  
vast North American manufacturing operations are designed to supply 
at least 30 percent of the U.S. market. If its share remains below 
that level, plant closures or layoffs are likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something very strange about a car company that, in a  
red-hot vehicle market, has to depend on discounted sales to its 
employees,'' said analyst Maryann Keller of ING Baring Furman Selz. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all of GM's February sales were influenced by incentives.  
Its new generation of full-size pickups continued to be hot 
sellers, posting their best February sales in 21 years even though 
inventories remained below normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Don DeVeaux, GM's director of North American market analysis,  
said the strength of February sales surprised everyone in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody saw this one coming,'' he said. ``How long this will go  
on, nobody knows. You know there has to be a payback.''

<HEADLINE> Doral Golf Losing Its Old Prestige  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- David Duval is home for the first time since New  
Year's Day. Mark O'Meara is skiing in Utah and Tiger Woods is 
filming commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the top seven players in the world are not playing golf  
this week, a sure sign that the Doral Ryder-Open, which Greg Norman 
once called the unofficial start of the PGA Tour season, is not 
what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's changed,'' Norman said Wednesday afternoon while  
waiting out a brief thunderstorm that interrupted the pro-am. ``I 
think you're going to find the entire Florida swing suffer because 
guys can't do everything. They've got to have a delicate balance in 
the schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule, of course, was turned upside down by the Match  
Play Championship last week in California, which offered a $5 
million purse for the top 64 players in the world with a guarantee 
of $25,000 for last. 
</P>
<P>
	Golf's elite could no longer wait until Doral to start getting  
their games in shape for the Masters, not with a $1 million carrot 
dangling at the end of the stick at La Costa. And not even a $1 
million increase in the purse at Doral could change some players' 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods played for the fifth straight week at La Costa and was  
ready for a break. Duval, who normally takes his break after Doral, 
has been skiing in Idaho when he hasn't been shooting 59. He 
decided last week it was time to get home to Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Montgomerie, who has started his run to the Masters at  
Doral three of the past four years, went back to Scotland after his 
abrupt departure from La Costa and won't return until Bay Hill in 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a good field,'' said tournament director Scott  
Montgomery. ``We're trying to emphasize the players we have, not 
the ones we don't have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Doral has is four of the top 10 players in the world --  
Justin Leonard, Nick Price, Vijay Singh and Ernie Els, who only 
decided to enter Doral after he was bumped out in the first round 
of Match Play. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one way to look at it. On the other hand, Els (No. 4) is  
the only player in the top seven who was willing to tackle the 
``Blue Monster'' this week. Only six of the top 20 are at Doral, 
and 10 of the top 30 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of PGA Tour events would kill for this field,'' said PGA  
commissioner Tim Finchem. 
</P>
<P>
	But this isn't just any tour event. Doral for years was the  
landmark tournament that kicked off the Florida swing and 
traditionally has been considered the start of the road to Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Doral featured five of the top six in the world  
ranking and 18 of the top 30. Last year, nine of the top 10 on the 
money list came to Doral. This year, only three of the top 10 are 
playing this week -- Leonard, John Huston and Gabriel Hjertstedt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think we've got a very good field here,'' Price said.  
``It's just not maybe the great field that we're accustomed to 
having here. Obviously with the last two weeks, you find a lot of 
guys tried to play their games into shape, then they just need some 
time off now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But timing isn't everything. Doral lost some of its shine when  
Raymond Floyd added a bevy of fairway bunkers during his redesign 
of the Blue Course prior to the '97 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys were disappointed in the changes,'' Bradley  
said. ``For a tournament that people used to love to come to, I 
think they were a little more hesitant to come just because of what 
they had done to the course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether it was the Match Play Championship last week or the  
changes to the course, Doral's field isn't what it used to be. One 
of the last players to get in on Tuesday was Brett Quigley, who 
failed to earn his card in Q-school. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Jack Nicklaus, who has not missed Doral since 1970, is  
having to sit this one out because of hip replacement surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a number of years where Doral stood out from  
everybody else primarily because of its purse and the golf 
course,'' Finchem said. ``It's leveled off a bit. We will look at 
it, but honestly, I can't be overly concerned. We'll have a great 
leaderboard and a great tournament.''

<HEADLINE> UNC Frustrated As Tourney Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Ed Cota looks around and this is what he  
sees: mistakes, and more mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go over the same stuff (in practice), but some of the guys  
still ain't getting it,'' the North Carolina point guard said. ``I 
don't know if it's boring to them or what.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is no time to be bored. The Atlantic Coast Conference  
tournament begins Thursday, and the No. 15 Tar Heels (22-8) are 
two-time defending champions. 
</P>
<P>
	But that does not count for much now. After starting 8-0 and  
winning 12 of their first 13 games, the Tar Heels have taken 
several steps back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see if we were out there running the plays correct and  
not playing well, but we're out there looking like chickens with 
our heads cut off,'' Cota said. ``It's like somebody is always 
forgetting the play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cota's comments came in the wake of a 20-point home loss last  
weekend to No. 1 Duke -- a game he called ``an embarrassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the frustration goes beyond Saturday's loss for Cota, who  
enjoyed playing with the likes of Antawn Jamison, Vince Carter and 
Shammond Williams during consecutive Final Four runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, North Carolina's scoring average of 70.6 points a game is  
the lowest in 17 seasons. The team's 47 percent shooting is the 
worst since 1968. And to top it off, the Tar Heels have been last 
in the ACC in turnover margin most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am frustrated with the way we're playing. I can't believe  
we're playing at this level right now,'' said Cota, who has watched 
the Tar Heels close the regular season with an 8-5 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches are trying to have patience with us. I don't know  
if they're frustrated or not, but I know they are disappointed with 
the way we're playing right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Guthridge has said he's pleased, suggesting fans may  
have gotten hopes too high when the team won the Preseason NIT back 
in November with wins over Purdue and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told our team before the season started they shouldn't feel  
any pressure to keep any of our streaks going,'' he said. ``For the 
most part, they've worked hard and gone about their business 
hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There were so many question marks. I can't remember a team  
going into the season that had so many question marks as this 
year's team did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina has played in 10 of the last 12 ACC title games,  
winning four titles in the '90s. But Cota isn't too sure at this 
point if the Tar Heels can even get by first-round opponent Georgia 
Tech on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar Heels have been limited to 68 points or less in each of  
their last five games. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Duke and Maryland each scored 81 and 89 points in a  
pair of wins over North Carolina. They are the two teams the Tar 
Heels probably will have to beat to become the first team since the 
North Carolina (1967-69) to win three straight ACC crowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, not only is our offense hurting us, but our defense  
is killing us out there. It's like we can't stop nobody,'' said 
Cota. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the younger players said the Duke loss still lingers --  
and that irks Cota. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the guys are mature enough to concentrate on the next  
game and not the past,'' he said. ``If they are that worried about 
the Duke game they will come out fired up and ready to play and 
show some improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we go out there and play another lazy game I don't know  
what our chances are.''

<HEADLINE> Met Announces 1999-2000 Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The world premiere of American composer John  
Harbison's ``The Great Gatsby'' is the marquee event on the 
Metropolitan Opera's 1999-2000 schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Artistic director James Levine will conduct the ``The Great  
Gatsby'' on Dec. 20. Based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, Harbison 
composed and wrote the libretto, with Murray Horwitz contributing 
popular song lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawn Upshaw will sing Daisy Buchanan and Jerry Hadley will sing  
Jay Gatsby. Mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt will make her Met debut as 
Myrtle Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	Another highlight of the season announced Wednesday will be the  
new production of Boito's ``Mefistofele,'' which opens Nov. 6 with 
Samuel Ramey in the title role, Richard Leech as Faust and Maria 
Guleghina as both Margherita and Elena. 
</P>
<P>
	The Met also will present Lehar's ``The Merry Widow'' for the  
first time, starring mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade in the title 
role, written for a soprano, and Placido Domingo. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be three complete ``Ring'' cycles during the 32-week  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Levine also conducts ``Tristan und Isolde,'' not heard at the  
Met since the 1983-84 season, beginning Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The season will opens Sept. 27, with ``Cavalleria Rusticana''  
and ``Pagliacci.'' Domingo, singing Canio in ``Pagliacci,'' will be 
making his 18th opening night performance, breaking Enrico Caruso's 
Met record of 17, set in 1920.

<HEADLINE> Stars' Hull To Miss Two Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

reserve list Wednesday, and the right winger is expected to miss 
two weeks with a hamstring strain. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Seeks To Fix Indian Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt is pledging  
to clean up $3 billion in Indian trust funds and cooperate in a 
lawsuit that landed him in trouble with a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. district judge found Babbitt and Treasury Secretary  
Robert Rubin in contempt of court over their delay in producing 
documents sought by Indian account holders who are suing the 
government over its admitted mismanagement of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll be the judge. I will do my best,'' to fix the funds,  
Babbitt said at a Senate hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt agreed to appear at the hearing after the Senate Indian  
Affairs Committee threatened last week to subpoena him. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who say they've lost confidence in the government's  
ability to manage the funds, suggested turning over the money to 
outside banking professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no excuses. There should be no excuses,'' said Sen.  
Larry Craig, R- Idaho. ``Why can't we be smart enough to hire the 
right people to do the job?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In issuing the contempt ruling last week, U.S. District Judge  
Royce Lamberth said he was fed up with bureaucratic foot dragging 
and ``outright false statements'' in connection with the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has been under pressure for years to reconcile  
the funds. They include 300,000 accounts held by individual 
Indians, subjects of the lawsuit, and an additional 1,600 tribal 
accounts worth $2.5 billion. The money includes lease revenue, 
royalties and court settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	The official in charge of the cleanup effort, Paul Homan,  
abruptly resigned in January after Babbitt ordered his office 
reorganized. The reorganization included removal of Homan as the 
official in charge of the office's day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt acknowledged today he took the action because he feared  
that he was about to face the contempt citation. 
</P>
<P>
	Homan, a former federal bank regulator, told the senators that  
Interior officials repeatedly undermined congressionally ordered 
reforms by turning down his requests for money and staff ``in favor 
of higher departmental priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interior ``can no longer be trusted to keep and produce trust  
records,'' Homan said, recommending that the accounts be turned 
over to a new, independent agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt has asked Congress for $100 million next year, a $60  
million increase from this year, to work on the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the department has so far reconciled about two-thirds of  
the accounts held by individuals and that a new accounting system 
will be in place by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Tells ABC-TV About Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barbara Walters played the role of a stern  
mother to a frank Monica Lewinsky in their long-awaited interview, 
a two-hour show Wednesday that ABC treated as a prime-time soap 
opera. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most soap operas, the ``20/20'' episode climaxed with tears  
and a moral lesson of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
	America's premier television interviewer, Walters led Ms.  
Lewinsky gently but bluntly through the story of the former White 
House intern's affair with the president. She began with broad 
questions, giving Ms. Lewinsky a chance to introduce herself and 
deliver a message to the country, before getting specific. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where do you get the nerve? Who does this?'' Walters wondered  
as Ms. Lewinsky explained how she first gave Bill Clinton a peek at 
her thong underwear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you ever say to yourself, `I'm doing something wrong?'''  
Walters asked. 
</P>
<P>
	When Walters asked Ms. Lewinsky whether Clinton was a sensuous  
man, she answered, ``I'll get in trouble.'' Responded Walters: 
``Not in any more trouble than you've already been in, Monica. You 
have immunity here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walters carefully worded some sexually blunt questions, asking  
at one point whether things were done ``that made you feel, as a 
woman, happy and content.'' Other times she was more direct: ``Did 
you ever try to have intercourse?'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, Walters asked the sort of personal questions  
most Americans would ask if they spent a few hours with Ms. 
Lewinsky. Many were insightful: ``Do you think he was genuinely 
remorseful or do you think he is just sorry he got caught?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial and the saga's impact on the nation's  
political process were barely mentioned, however. ABC also made no 
apparent effort to get others in the drama, either in the White 
House or Kenneth Starr's office, to give their viewpoint during the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	With enough compelling material, it was curious that ABC needed  
to relentlessly hype the interview as a cliffhanger and tawdry 
tale. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may understand the president as you never have before and  
the woman who loved him,'' a breathless announcer said at the 
outset. Twice, ABC urged viewers to stay tuned for the ``secret 
never before revealed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The secret -- that Ms. Lewinsky had an affair with another man  
while working at the Pentagon and had an abortion -- stuck out 
awkwardly in a story about a relationship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Before each commercial break, ABC felt it necessary to tease  
viewers as if they might quickly escape: ``When we come back, the 
infamous blue dress!'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC had no trouble finding advertisers for the show, despite  
asking for prices as much as five times what sponsors would 
normally pay during ``20/20.'' There were eight ads during the 
first break -- for an investment company, a movie, a restaurant 
chain, a hair coloring treatment and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice during the special, ABC ran ads for weight reduction  
treatments -- jarring considering Ms. Lewinsky's battle with the 
bulge. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters aggressively promoted her interview earlier Wednesday,  
with appearances on ``Good Morning America,'' ``Live with Regis and 
Kathie Lee'' and her own show, ``The View.'' She revealed that Ms. 
Lewinsky had knitted her a scarf. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's Web site also was busy finding tie-ins, including a Ms.  
Lewinsky trivia test that asked where the former intern had her 
hair done in Washington and what she ordered when she visited a 
certain restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Ms. Lewinsky was ultimately brought to tears  
when she talked about her and her parents considering suicide 
during the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	For her final question, Walters asked what Ms. Lewinsky would  
tell her children in the future about the incident. ``Mommy made a 
big mistake,'' she answered. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that,'' Walters concluded, ``is the understatement of the  
year.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Fines Northwest, Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government fined Northwest Airlines and  
Delta Air Lines on Wednesday for failing to tell passengers that 
tickets they were buying actually would be filled with service on 
another airline's planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under so-called code share arrangements, partner airlines can  
market another carrier's flights as their own. That allows the two 
carriers to coordinate service and provide for seamless passenger 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
	But federal rules state the airlines must tell passengers at the  
earliest opportunity that a ticket on Northwest, for example, 
actually will be fulfilled with flights on a code share partner, 
such as the commuter airline Northwest Airlink. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Department investigators called reservation  
agents for both Delta and Northwest and found that in a number of 
instances, the agents failed to disclose that a flight would be 
fulfilled with service on a partner carrier -- even when 
specifically asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest was assessed a civil penalty of $45,000, half of which  
will be forgiven if the carrier does not commit additional 
violations in the next year. Delta was penalized $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	While neither carrier admitted any wrongdoing, both agreed to  
cease and desist from violations in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The code share disclosure violations were Delta's second and  
Northwest's third over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said he had ordered his  
Aviation Enforcement Office to increase scrutiny in the area. The 
department soon will take action on a rule that would expand 
code-share disclosure requirements.

<HEADLINE> Jury To Decide Fate of Marine Pilot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- An eight-man military jury began  
deliberating manslaughter charges Wednesday against a Marine pilot 
accused of flying recklessly into Italian ski gondola cables, 
sending 20 people to their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was too low, too fast, too aggressive,'' Maj. Daniel  
Daugherty, a prosecutor, said in his closing statement. ``He was 
outright dangerous. ... He's on a rocket sled through there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was at the  
controls of the EA-6B Prowler jet when it hit the cable Feb. 3, 
1998, near the Alpine town of Cavalese, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Frank Spinner said it ``was a training accident  
and nothing more'' caused by a visual misperception that drew Ashby 
too low just before he flew into the cables, suspended about 370 
feet above the valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated for about four hours Wednesday afternoon  
and planned to continue Thursday morning. Six jurors must find 
Ashby guilty for there to be a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby is charged with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter. He  
also faces one count each of dereliction of duty, failure to plan 
the flight properly, destruction of government property and 
destroying private property. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces 206 years in prison if convicted of all charges.  
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened on the final leg of a 42-minute training  
route the four-man radar-jamming jet flew through the Italian Alps. 
Italians responded by demanding that U.S. landing rights be revoked 
at bases in their country. 
</P>
<P>
	Daugherty said Ashby ignored the mission speed limit of 517 mph  
and was traveling at 621 mph when he hit the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor, who at one time referred to a chart labeled  
``The Blame Game'' to list Ashby's excuses, also said the pilot 
ignored altitude restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses testified the altitude limit was 2,000 feet; Ashby  
said he thought it was 1,000 feet and didn't know the mission had a 
speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
	While defense experts questioned whether Ashby could know how  
low he was and judge his speed, Daugherty said there were plenty of 
cues. He dismissed the theory that Ashby experienced an optical 
illusion as ``psychobabble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have the roads, the cars, the houses, the humanity of it  
all,'' Daugherty said. ``Captain Ashby ignores it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner said the case revolves around ``six to eight seconds in  
the life of Captain Richard J. Ashby and a decision he had to make, 
if he was aware of what was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, faces similar  
charges and is scheduled to stand trial this month.

<HEADLINE> Leisure World Wants To Be City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAGUNA HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Leisure World residents voted to  
turn their retirement enclave into an incorporated city, creating 
what activists call the nation's first gated municipality strictly 
for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	By late Tuesday, 10,336 ballots had been counted with 51.7  
percent voting in favor of cityhood, while 48.3 percent voted 
against. A final count -- including some absentee ballots -- was 
expected today, said Evelyn Bell of the Orange County Registrar of 
Voters office. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15,489 registered voters also elected to rename the city  
Laguna Woods, though the gated portion will be called Leisure World 
at Laguna Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of cityhood touted the change as a way to give this  
18,000-member retirement community more control over local issues, 
such as long-term economic goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents feared turning the community into a place where  
political leaders would add bureaucratic hassle to their previous 
self-governing system. 
</P>
<P>
	The community, about 50 miles south of Los Angeles, advertises  
itself as the largest retirement center on the West Coast. The 
minimum age for residents is 55, and the average is 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Laguna Woods will be run by a five-member city council that  
begins official operations March 24, taking over for Orange County 
officials who controlled the community's public safety services, 
traffic enforcement, street maintenance and building and planning 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Laguna Woods officials will also be in charge of social and  
recreational services that had been controlled by the county. The 
transfer of services and name change is not expected to be 
completed until the end of this month, Ms. Bell said.

<HEADLINE> Intern: Clinton Sorry He Got Caught </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky, in an interview clip aired  
today, said she felt President Clinton was ``sorry he got caught'' 
when their affair was revealed to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky revealed that she felt like a piece of trash'' the  
day Clinton was forced to admit their affair on national television 
and apologized to the nation -- but not to her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt dirty and I felt used and I was disappointed,'' Ms.  
Lewinsky said in a portion of her interview with Barbara Walters, 
played on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' The full interview is to 
be aired tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by Ms. Walters whether Clinton really cared for her, Ms.  
Lewinsky said, ``Some days I think yes and some days I think no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky was shown on the clip watching Clinton's televised  
apology to the nation last Aug. 17, the day he gave his grand jury 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by Ms. Walters whether she believes Clinton felt remorse,  
Ms. Lewinsky said that as a politician, ``I think he's sorry he got 
caught.'' But she added that ``when I think of the person I thought 
Bill Clinton was, he had genuine remorse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The short portion was the first videotape aired of the  
interview, although partial transcripts have leaked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walters asked the former White House intern whether Clinton  
really cared for her. ``Some days I think yes and some days I think 
no,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But she also said, ``I felt like a piece of trash'' after  
Clinton gave his Aug. 17 address. ``I felt dirty and I felt used 
and I was disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Clinton gave the impression that she simply  
serviced him, Ms. Lewinsky replied. ``That was the impression he 
gave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In material that leaked out earlier, Ms. Lewinksy said she  
regrets her role in causing pain and suffering not only for her own 
friends and family, but for Clinton's family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've apologized in private to my family and to my friends ...  
I would like to publicly acknowledge that I recognize the pain and 
the suffering that they've gone through because of this,'' Ms. 
Lewinsky says in an interview with ABC News to be aired tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't dream of asking Chelsea and Mrs. Clinton to forgive  
me,'' she says. ``But I would ask them to know that I am very sorry 
for what happened and for what they've been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Walters of ABC won the first interview with Ms. Lewinsky  
since the former White House intern's affair with Clinton burst 
into the headlines on Jan. 21, 1998. Ms. Lewinsky, who received 
immunity from prosecution for cooperating with investigators, was 
prohibited from speaking publicly until Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr's office gave the go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview was timed to help promote her book -- ``Monica's  
Story,'' written with Princess Diana biographer Andrew Morton -- 
which goes on sale Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported in today's editions that Ms.  
Lewinsky is so critical of Starr in the book that several of her 
friends and associates fear Starr will try to revoke her immunity 
agreement and prosecute her. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times says she told Morton she was so despondent at her  
treatment by prosecutors who initially confronted her at a hotel in 
suburban Virginia that she briefly considered jumping out of a 10th 
floor window in their presence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times report said prosecutors had confronted her with a copy  
of her false affidavit in which she swore that she had not had an 
affair with Clinton, even though it had not been filed yet with a 
federal court in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said Starr has said his office was sent the affidavit  
anonymously by James A. Moody, a lawyer for Linda Tripp, who had 
obtained it from lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones, who had a sexual 
harassment suit pending against the president at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office learned of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair from Mrs.  
Tripp. The extent, timing and nature of any contacts between 
Starr's office and the Jones lawyers are under review by the 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv refused to comment on the  
Lewinsky interview and book. But asked on Tuesday whether Ms. 
Lewinsky's words would finally bring an end to the story, Toiv 
said, ``I think I can safely say 'No' to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC released brief excerpts from the interview on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Is Bill Clinton a sensuous, passionate man?'' Walters asked  
the 25-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gosh, I'll probably get in trouble for saying this,'' Ms.  
Lewinsky began, before describing the president as ``a very sensual 
man'' who feels conflicted because of his ``strong religious 
upbringing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he struggles with his sensuality because I don't think  
he thinks it's OK,'' she said. ``I think he tries to hold himself 
back. And then can't any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky had stinging words for her former friend, Mrs.  
Tripp, who secretly tape-recorded their telephone conversations 
about the president and turned them over to Starr's investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pity her,'' Ms. Lewinsky said. ``I would hate to be her.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky said she was drawn to Mrs. Tripp at the Pentagon  
because both of them had worked at the White House, where Ms. 
Lewinsky longed to return. She said she confided the affair to Mrs. 
Tripp after her co-worker kept saying such things as ``You're just 
the type of girl the president would like'' and ``I bet you could 
have an affair with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News in New York reported in today's editions that Ms.  
Lewinsky was questioned Walters about a brief affair she had with a 
42-year-old Pentagon official after she was assigned there in the 
spring of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd tease him (Clinton) about it and tell him he had  
competition,'' the paper quoted her as saying on an audio tape of 
part of the Walters interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News obtained the tape Monday and reported in  
Tuesday's editions on other details contained on it. It was not 
clear how much, if any, of the matters covered on the audio tape 
will be broadcast by ABC, which is trying to determine who leaked 
the audio tape to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with the Pentagon official, who was  
unmarried at the time, has been reported previously.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Selection Group To Meet Thurs. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The meetings will begin Thursday with nine  
members being sequestered in their own floor of a Kansas City hotel 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	They are not a jury discussing a trial, but the NCAA men's  
basketball committee in charge of determining the field of 64 in 
next week's tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	C.M. Newton, athletic director at Kentucky and chairman of the  
committee, and the other eight members will begin discussing 
administrative issues the early part of the day and then toss 
around terms like ``bubble teams'' and ``RPI'' during the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Newton, in his seventh year on the committee, said Wednesday  
there is no clear formula to determine what teams are selected and 
how they are seeded in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I was scared to death and in awe of the  
process,'' Newton said. ``The longer you're involved, the more 
serious you take the charge and the charge is to select the right 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke of good losses, records against top 25 opponents and  
tough non-conference schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	Newton also said a sub-.500 conference mark won't automatically  
eliminate a school from contention for the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a huge concern for me,'' Newton said. ``What I  
personally look at is the entire year and who they chose to play in 
their non-conference schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newton and the committee will meet about 14 hours a day until  
the 64-team field is revealed Sunday night.

<HEADLINE> Cheaper or Free Internet Entry Seen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- By now, whether it's $21.95 or $9.95, it seems  
to be an Internet fact of life: No one roams for free. 
</P>
<P>
	But the World Wide Web is still too new to presume that anything  
is set in stone, and monthly dial-up fees could become another 
Internet dinosaur if others keep giving away what America Online is 
trying to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gateway announced that it would throw in a free year  
of its Internet service with any computer purchase of more than 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But even more threatening to the stranglehold of the  
pay-for-service providers has been the early success of some new 
rivals that let you dial up for free. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a million British have signed on with a service named  
Freeserve, which began operating in September, but has already 
surpassed America Online as Britain's most popular Internet access 
provider. 
</P>
<P>
	NetZero, brought to the Web by the same venture capitalists who  
sparked an online stampede by giving away ad-rigged computers at 
Free-PC.com, has signed up 400,000 customers since it launched a 
free service in October. 
</P>
<P>
	That's just a fraction of the more than 2 million subscribers  
added since mid-November by AOL, the king of connectivity with 16 
million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's hardly a marginal development in an industry that made  
a relic of Netscape Communications, the very first Internet 
powerhouse, in less than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for free Web access, these services want free access  
to your eyeballs -- and a fixed portion of your computer screen -- so 
they can show you a continuous parade of advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is already the Glitter Gulch of advertising, so an  
ever-present box or banner isn't a deal-breaker for most Web users. 
</P>
<P>
	If the free services are successful, Internet access could be  
reduced from a revenue-producing business to a mere marketing 
gimmick -- a throw-in like PC software or rust-proofing for a 
pick-up truck. 
</P>
<P>
	But, because most of these new services have meager resources  
and little experience, some people wonder whether they'll get 
exactly what they bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would always pay for access, because I don't want  
problems,'' said David Meier, who normally loves a good 
cyber-bargain, guiding people to ``free stuff'' on the Internet 
with his y4i.com Web site. ``I don't want to worry about getting 
online or them being too busy, and I don't want that little box on 
my screen. I'd rather pay the 20 bucks a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even among those who seem happy with their switch to a free  
Internet service provider, or ISP, doubts persist. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent e-mail to NetZero, which is based in Westlake  
Village, Calif., a new female subscriber said, ``I plan on 
canceling my troublesome $19.95 a month Internet account.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, fearful of companies ``that go out of business within a  
few months and leave the users or subscribers standing with a blank 
look on their face,'' the woman also felt compelled to ask, ``How 
long have you been operating, and if you DO go out of business 
anytime in the forseeable future, will you let all the users know 
well in advance?'' 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, which charges $21.95 a month for unlimited  
Internet access, has no plans to get into a price war with these 
new services. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is certainly a very competitive industry, but we believe  
we offer the best value,'' said AOL spokesperson Wendy Goldberg. 
``We offer a community, a community we program an experience for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there's plenty of doubt as to whether ad revenue  
alone can cover the huge costs of running an Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not funded big time, there's no way you can provide  
good service,'' said Ilan Klein, president of Vizooal Inc., a New 
York-based Internet marketing firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Those pondering a free Web service would be well advised to  
remember that they'll be moving to a new playing field. 
</P>
<P>
	Most new services are far more vulnerable to financial pressures  
and technological problems than big players like AOL, AT&AMP;T, 
Microsoft Network, EarthLink and MindSpring. 
</P>
<P>
	That could mean little or no customer support and the risk that  
the service might suddenly vanish along with your e-mail address. 
</P>
<P>
	A browser search for ``free Internet access'' will produce a  
discouraging list of bum steers, ``earn-at-home'' schemes and 
``bait-and-switch'' offers -- including one for a revolutionary new 
water pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	An overwhelming number of those Web sites feature links to a  
Freewwweb.com, a service which isn't exactly free. The 
Connecticut-based company charges a one-time fee of about $120, but 
seems to be one of the few NetZero rivals with local dial-up 
numbers across most of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Another service, webCOMBO.com, charges a one-time fee of $149.95  
for otherwise free access to its national network. Others such as 
zDial.com, FreePPP.com, and FreeI.com charge nothing, but only have 
local dial-up numbers in a specific region.

<HEADLINE> Leyland, Rockies Ready for Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Jim Leyland peered over the top of his  
reading glasses and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	It was hard to find fault in the Colorado Rockies' lineup that  
features the 1997 National League MVP (Larry Walker), the 1998 NL 
Rookie of the Year runner-up (Todd Helton), and three guys who have 
hit 40 homers in a season (Walker, Dante Bichette and Vinny 
Castilla). 
</P>
<P>
	``Not bad,'' Leyland said. ``That's pretty impressive right  
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado fans will recognize the names and batting order when  
the Rockies play their first spring game Thursday against the 
Arizona Diamondbacks. The eight position players are unchanged from 
the way they lined up for last year's season finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Center fielder Darryl Hamilton will lead off, followed by  
shortstop Neifi Perez, right fielder Walker, left fielder Bichette, 
third baseman Castilla, first baseman Helton, second baseman Mike 
Lansing and catcher Kirt Manwaring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only question I have with the lineup right now is  
(swapping) Lansing and Neifi,'' Leyland said. ``That would be the 
only situation I might look at a little bit. Other than that, it's 
pretty basic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Left-hander Brian Bohanon, who signed with the Rockies in  
November, will be Thursday's starting pitcher, although Darryl Kile 
will start the regular-season opener April 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get tired of telling the hitters what's coming,'' Bohanon  
said of ending the monotony of throwing batting practice. ``I 
prefer to go out there and mix my pitches up, not tell them. 
There's nothing better than making hitters look bad. That's what 
they're trying to do to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's offense made a lot of pitchers look bad last year as  
the Rockies hit a major league-leading .291. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland decided not to tinker with success after receiving  
positive feedback from Lansing, Bichette and Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter to me,'' said Lansing, Colorado's  
opening-day leadoff hitter last year. ``Wherever he feels is the 
best place for me in this lineup to help us win, then that's where 
I'm going to be. That's all that matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 3 spot has been a sweet one for Colorado hitters over  
the past four years. Bichette hit .340 with 40 homers and 128 RBIs 
-- both league highs -- out of the third spot in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, who has a fondness for the number 3 or anything  
divisible by three, won the National League MVP hitting third in 
1997 and followed with a batting title last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Lansing, both Bichette and Walker willingly went along with  
Leyland's initial game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good spot to hit in,'' Bichette said of being fourth.  
``I'm fine with it. It's great. That's where I hit last year and 
the year before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You're making way too much out of this third and fourth  
thing,'' Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland said he prefers Walker hitting third because of his  
baserunning instincts. Despite his size -- 6-foot-3, 235 pounds -- he 
has the ability to turn singles into doubles and goes from first to 
third without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
	With Walker, Bichette, Castilla and Helton creating havoc in  
front of him, Lansing has a good chance to top his career-high 70 
RBIs he had with Montreal in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have plenty of opportunities,'' he said. ``I may  
get more than the guys that are batting 3, 4 and 5.''

	German's Execution Delayed  
</P>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- Amid pleas of mercy from the German  
government, a federal appeals court today ordered Arizona not to 
use the gas chamber to execute a German man whose brother was put 
to death last week. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to 
issue a stay for Walter LaGrand, 37, who was scheduled to die today 
for his role in the 1982 murder of a bank manager. But the judges 
did say that the gas chamber is cruel and unusual punishment, and 
therefore unconstitutional. The state appealed to the Supreme 
Court, but it was unclear when the execution would proceed.

	Starr Got Lewinsky Memo Early

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky has assailed Kenneth Starr's  
office for ``dubious methods'' and raised new questions about the 
origins of his investigation of President Clinton's affair with her 
and the following cover-up. Ms. Lewinsky asserts in ``Monica's 
Story'' that the independent counsel's investigators had obtained a 
copy of her false affidavit denying an affair with Clinton before 
the document had been filed with a court. Starr acknowledges he had 
the affidavit early, but he says he got it from a source other than 
Paula Jones' lawyers.

	Supreme Court Rules on School Care  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public schools must finance one-on-one nursing  
care for some disabled students throughout the school day, the 
Supreme Court ruled today in a decision that may strain educational 
budgets across the nation. Voting 7-2 in the case of an Iowa 
teen-ager, the court said public financing is required under the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act because the federal 
law's exemption for ``medical services'' applies only when a 
doctor's help is needed.

	Anti-Smoking Pill Said To Top Patch

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the first head-to-head comparison, the  
anti-smoking drug Zyban proved twice as good as the nicotine patch 
in helping people kick the habit, and both together were even more 
effective. Used together, they helped more than 35 percent of 
smokers stay off cigarettes for a year. The patch had disappointing 
results, working no better than a dummy pill or patch. But the 
researchers themselves disagreed over whether the findings were a 
fluke, since other studies have shown the patch works. The maker of 
Zyban paid for the study by University of Wisconsin researchers.

	U.S. Levies Sanctions in Trade Fight  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration said today that  
more than $500 million worth of European imports will be subject to 
eventual punitive trade sanctions because of an ongoing trade fight 
between the United States and Europe over bananas. The sanctions 
would take effect immediately but would be paid retroactively when, 
and if, a World Trade Organization panel approves the United 
States' request to penalize the importers. The 100 percent punitive 
duties, by doubling prices, could effectively knock products 
ranging from French handbags to German coffeemakers out of the U.S. 
market.

measure, endorsed by the Commerce Committee on a party-line 11-9

<HEADLINE>  Jets Sign Atwater to $8.3M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- It worked with Bryan Cox, so why not with  
Steve Atwater? 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Jets signed the veteran free safety, an eight-time  
Pro Bowl player for Denver, to bolster their secondary and provide 
leadership for the defense. That was exactly what linebacker Cox 
did in last season's Jets turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he feels like he has something to prove again. I can  
sense it in the player, just like Bryan had it when he came here,'' 
coach Bill Parcells said of Atwater, who signed a three-year, $8.3 
million contract that includes a $1.8 million bonus. ``What you're 
always curious about when you have a player like this is, is the 
fire still burning? Does he still want to do it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater says there will be no problems in that area after he was  
cut by the two-time champion Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``The former team I played with, I think they felt like I  
couldn't play anymore,'' he said. ``I'd like to show them and show 
the world that Steve Atwater can still play football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Known as an aggressive tackler, Atwater, 32, sometimes was  
replaced on passing downs in Denver. The Broncos apparently felt 
they could do just as well with younger players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets struggled at the position last year, using rookie Kevin  
Williams and journeyman Jerome Henderson, who was released last 
week. Their other safety, Victor Green, had a good season and is 
similar to Atwater in style. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater had five tackles in the AFC title game against the Jets,  
with a forced fumble and a tipped pass that resulted in an 
interception. He plans to be just as active with the Jets, whose 
defense he praised. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I noticed was guys flying around to the  
ball,'' Atwater said. ``That's my characteristic. I like coming to 
the ball, and I like to get there full-speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons -- who lost to the Broncos in the Super Bowl -- the  
Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles also expressed an 
interest in Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, if I didn't have full confidence that he was able  
to do what we're asking him to do, he wouldn't be here,'' said 
Parcells, who noted that Atwater was on the field for 96 percent of 
the Broncos' defensive snaps last season. ``You can watch a guy 
play and know what you've got. This guy is involved in heavy 
traffic most of the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The signing came a day after the Jets committed $19.5 million to  
quarterback Vinny Testaverde in a three-year contract extension. 
The club, aggressive as promised during the offseason, also has 
signed quarterback-punter Tom Tupa, tight end Eric Green and 
defensive end Mike Frederick. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said the Jets are not finished with offseason  
transactions, including trades. Only 15 players remain from the 
roster Parcells inherited when he took over the ballclub in 
February 1997.

<HEADLINE> AP's Herbert Kelley Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REVERE, Mass. (AP) -- Herbert C. Kelley, the head of technical  
services for The Associated Press in Massachusetts and Rhode 
Island, has died. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley died Tuesday of a heart attack at his home on Revere  
Beach. He had worked for the wire service for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Herb was the best, a class act,'' said John Reid, AP vice  
president for technology. ``He was justifiably proud of all his 
accomplishments during his three decades with the AP, but he was 
even prouder of the people he worked with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley began with the AP when it moved stories over land lines  
at 55 words a minute. He helped oversee its transition to the 
computer age, with transmissions via satellite that handle 1,000 
times that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley rose through the ranks of the Boston office, taking  
charge of northern New England operations and then Southern 
California in 1975. He rose to deputy director of communications 
operations for the entire AP before coming back to Boston in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley is survived by daughters Lisa DeGrandis of Boston, June  
Durante of Huntington Beach, Calif., and Kathy Mahoney of Peabody; 
son Herbert of Hopkinton; sister Pat Hawes of Peabody; and seven 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	A wake will be at the Buonfiglio Funeral Home in Revere on  
Thursday, followed by a funeral Friday at St. Anthony's Roman 
Catholic Church in Revere.

<HEADLINE> Test May Cut Colon Cancer Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The death rate from colon cancer, the second  
leading cancer killer in the United States, could be reduced by up 
to a third if more people over 50 started using a simple screening 
test that detects bleeding in the bowel, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published today, Minnesota researchers say that a  
study of the long-term health of 46,000 volunteers shows that 
people who take an annual fecal occult blood test have 33 percent 
fewer deaths from colon cancer than do people who do not take the 
test. Among those who are tested every other year, the death rate 
is reduced by 21 percent, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is published today in the Journal of the National  
Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a positive test for blood, the likelihood of  
finding a growth in the colon is about 35 percent,'' said Dr. John 
H. Bond, the study's co-author. ``About 9 percent will have cancer, 
and the rest will have significant precancerous polyps in the 
colon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An analysis of data from the study in 1993 suggested that annual  
tests could reduce deaths from colon cancer, and a new analysis 
shows that even biennial tests can have a dramatic effect, said 
Bond, a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota and a 
staff physician at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very valuable way to identify people who are healthy  
and have no symptoms, who nevertheless have a developing cancer in 
their colon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results confirm findings from two earlier studies in Europe,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prompted by the research results, federal health agencies on  
Tuesday announced a new campaign to encourage all Americans over 50 
to take the fecal occult blood test. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that we can prevent many deaths from  
colorectal cancer through screening,'' said Surgeon General David 
Satcher. ``If you've celebrated your 50th birthday and have never 
been screened for colorectal cancer, start now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a program that went into effect last year, Medicare now  
pays for the screening, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 129,000 Americans, most past the age of 50, are diagnosed  
each year with colorectal cancer, and about 56,000 die each year. 
It is the second most common cancer killer, just behind lung 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The fecal occult blood test used in the Minnesota research has  
long been a common part of physical examinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a card with small inserts, patients collect specimens for  
the tests at home. Fecal specimens from several bowel movements are 
placed into the insets, and the self-sealing card is then mailed or 
delivered to a doctor's office where a chemical is applied to each 
specimen. If the chemical turns blue, it is evidence of blood. 
</P>
<P>
	If the test is positive, patients then undergo a full colon  
examination with a flexible tube, Bond said. This exam, called a 
colonoscopy, will find any evidence of cancer or of precancerous 
growths called polyps. 
</P>
<P>
	Removing the polyps, performed during the full colon exam, stops  
the growth from becoming cancer in most cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This type of cancer is preceded in 95 percent of the cases by  
slowly growing polyps,'' Bond said. ``By taking out the polyps, one 
can reduce subsequent development of cancer by 90 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fecal blood tests give false positives 65 percent of the  
time, Bond noted. But he said ``that 35 percent (where a growth is 
found) is sufficiently high to warrant the examination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fecal blood test costs about $10, said Bond. The follow-up  
colonoscopy examination can cost several hundred, but he said it is 
``very cost effective'' from a public health viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost of the screening and the follow-up tests is much less  
than finding and treating the cancer later, not only in money, but 
in the pain and suffering of the patients,'' said Bond.

<HEADLINE> New York Readies for First Lady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The would-be constituents in this seen-it-all  
city looked for a clue from the could-be candidate on her first 
visit since the word went out that Hillary Rodham Clinton was 
considering running for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	But press secretary Marsha Berry sought to cast today's visit by  
Mrs. Clinton as just another of many forays into the city by the 
first lady and said disappointment awaited those hoping for a 
blockbuster announcement on whether she would run in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Berry characterized today's rounds as first  
lady-business-as-usual -- a drop-in at a school, a luncheon and a 
private dinner, followed Thursday by a talk to a United Nations 
forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Mrs. Clinton's mere presence was turning the mood  
in indifferent New York giddy, at least in Democratic circles. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has held a commanding lead in the polls over Mayor  
Rudolph Giuliani, a potential but also unannounced Republican rival 
for the seat being vacated by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. A 
recent poll from Quinnipiac College Polling Institute showed her 
with an 18-point lead over Giuliani in a hypothetical race. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinnipiac pollster Maurice Carroll said Mrs. Clinton's visit  
isn't likely to boost her polling numbers because ``they're already 
off the charts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe if she could jump in the East River and rescue a  
drowning baby her numbers might get higher,'' Carroll said. ``I 
can't think how else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But pollster Lee Miringoff, of the Marist College Institute for  
Public Opinion, said a new survey he would unveil today would show 
that Mrs. Clinton's lead over Giuliani narrowing somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	``She needs to transition from celebrity to candidate Clinton,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to deliver an address on arts  
education at Intermediate School 25 in Queens. The Democratic 
National Committee Women's Leadership Forum luncheon was next, 
followed by a private dinner at the home of Roger Altman, a Wall 
Street financier. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, she is to talk at the United Nations about the  
forthcoming International Women's Day before returning to a 
classroom to view an HBO documentary on women and sports at a 
school in the Chelsea district of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's flirtation with the Senate race fueled a run on  
tickets for the fund raiser she is headlining this afternoon at the 
Plaza Hotel. Democratic Party organizers, originally expecting a 
crowd of 500, squeezed in 900 instead because of the intense 
interest. Another 300 people were on a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a confidant, said the  
first lady wanted some time to consider whether to run and hoped 
speculation would cool while she weighed her options. 
</P>
<P>
	But an architect of the drive to draft Mrs. Clinton, Rep.  
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., predicted on Tuesday that her arrival on 
the home turf of her most likely rival would touch off another 
heated round of ``will she, won't she.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever she comes into town it turns up the wattage,'' Rangel  
said. ``This adds even more electricity. ... Anything she attends 
now has political overtones.''

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A high-ranking army general charged with  
keeping cash-stuffed suitcases seized from drug traffickers was 
removed from his post, President Alberto Fujimori said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Tomas Marky was named the army's second-in-command in  
January. But he was arrested last month after a lieutenant 
imprisoned on drug charges accused him of walking off with three 
suitcases believed to contain $1 million in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the investigation continues and it will become clear  
what happened,'' said Fujimori, who had previously said he thought 
Marky to be innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Marky, the highest ranking member of Peru's armed forces ever  
implicated in a drug case, is in prison awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Peru is one of the world's largest producers of the coca leaf,

	TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) -- Kidnappers freed a Spanish  
businessman and his Mexican fiancee Wednesday after taking them 
captive last week in southern Chiapas state, relatives said.

<P>
	The kidnappers reportedly demanded a ransom of $600,000. Family  
members would not comment on whether any payment was made and state 
prosecutors refused to comment.

	Between 300 and 400 troops will be sent to the Jinotega,  
Matagalpa and Boaco provinces, the area where a civil war was 
fought in the 1980s. Cuadra said former rebels kidnapped more than 
100 people last year, sometimes killing their victims.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- An inmate opened fire on fellow prisoners at  
a penitentiary in the northern state of Sinaloa on Wednesday,

	The shooting apparently occurred as part of a dispute among  
inmates at the facility in the state capital of Culiacan, 640 miles 
northwest of Mexico City, local media reported.

	It was unclear how the inmate obtained the gun, but the  
Television Azteca network cited the incident as ``one more proof

<HEADLINE> Medical Marijuana Bill Introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress should eliminate federal restrictions  
on states that allow marijuana use for medical purposes such as for 
relieving AIDS-related nausea and glaucoma, Rep. Barney Frank, 
D-Mass., said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The irony is, of course, that many drugs much more harmful,  
much more powerful, much more addictive than marijuana can be 
prescribed,'' said Frank, who introduced legislation -- as he has 
done twice before -- to end the federal restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank's bill, introduced Tuesday, would reclassify marijuana as  
a Schedule II drug, meaning that it could be prescribed by doctors 
under certain conditions, just as cocaine and other controlled 
substances are. Prescriptions for such drugs are subject to federal 
and state review. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona and Nevada have  
permitted medical use of the drug. While persons using marijuana 
for medical purposes don't face state prosecution in the six 
states, they could still face federal prosecution, said Frank. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank isn't hopeful that the Republican-controlled Congress will  
pass his bill. Last fall, the House adopted, 310-93, a resolution 
that said marijuana is a dangerous and addictive drug and should 
not be legalized for medical use. Supporters of that bill said to 
legalize the drug for medical use send the wrong message to 
teen-agers, and that scientific testing has not proved a medical 
use for marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	But the New England Journal of Medicine has editorialized in  
favor of medical marijuana and the American Medical Association has 
urged the National Institutes of Health to support more research on 
the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Canada's health minister authorized clinical  
trials to determine if marijuana is a useful medicine for people 
suffering from terminal illnesses and other painful conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	And a report from the International Drug Control Board concluded  
last month that in-depth and impartial scientific studies should be 
conducted into marijuana's possible medical benefits.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Pledges Labor Rights Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Following a four-day visit by U.S. Labor  
Secretary Alexis Herman, Mexican officials said Tuesday they will 
push for a U.S. worker exchange program, improve Mexico's 
labor-rights record and promote gender equality in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will do all that is possible to follow up on the issues  
that were brought up,'' Mexican Labor Secretary Jose Antonio 
Gonzalez said during a joint public appearance with Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez suggested he would like to see a renewal of a ``guest  
worker'' program in the United States. A 1940s plan, known as the 
Bracero program, allowed Mexicans to immigrate temporarily to the 
United States to perform seasonal labor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been thinking about analyzing what occured between the  
United States and Mexico years ago, when there was a regulated 
interchange of workers,'' Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Suggesting a ``legalized exchange of workers from Mexico to the  
United States,'' Gonzalez said a similar agricultural-worker 
program in Canada would be a model. Proposals for a renewed Bracero 
program have found political support in some U.S. states such as 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman said: ``I expect we can continue our deliberations on the  
passage of goods and services, and our people as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez also promised a federal investigation into the killings  
of scores of working-class women in the northern border town of 
Ciudad Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1993, about 100 women, many of them teen-agers, have been  
found dead in the industrial city across from El Paso, Texas, 
according to police figures. Independent groups have counted 
between 129 and 192 victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the victims were young women who worked in maquiladoras,  
assembly-for-export plants along the border, which prompted civic 
groups to request the intervention of the Mexican labor 
secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
	On the last day of her visit, Herman attended a conference that  
addressed the problems working women face in Mexico and met 
privately with President Ernesto Zedillo.

<HEADLINE> Leading Economic Indicators Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rising stock prices and an increase in orders at  
the nation's factories carried a key gauge of future economic 
activity higher in January, signaling that the U.S. economy will 
continue to thrive through at least the middle of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the gain in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators  
and a separate government report of robust home sales showed that 
the economy remains very healthy, some analysts warned that its 
rate of growth may slow in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private research group, reported Tuesday  
that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.5 percent to 
106.9 in January from a revised level of 106.4 in December and 
106.2 in November. The results were slightly better than the 0.4 
percent increase economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the leading index posting three consecutive sharp  
increases, the U.S. economy does not seem to be ready to settle 
down much from the fast pace of growth it experienced in 1998,'' 
said Michael Boldin, senior economist with the Conference Board. 
``Over the past six months, the index has increased 1.2 percent, 
which is far above its historical average, and the prospects for 
growth in income and employment are very bright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that although new  
home sales slipped for the second straight month in January, they 
nonetheless were very strong. Americans bought new homes at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 918,000, down 5 percent from 
966,000 in December and more than 1 million in November. 
</P>
<P>
	With mortgage rates remaining under 7 percent and jobs  
plentiful, at least so far this year, most economists expect robust 
new home sales in 1999, but not quite as strong as the record 
887,000 for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists found signs in both reports that the economy's recent  
fast rate of growth would decline in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Maury N. Harris, chief economist with PaineWebber Inc. said the  
jump in leading indicators and the continued strength in housing 
sales were the predicted results of last fall's slumping dollar and 
declines in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect that in February, March and April they're going to  
cool off because the dollar is back up and so are interest rates,'' 
he said, referring to a recent increase in mortgage rates. The 
average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose last 
week for the fourth straight week to 6.89 percent, the highest 
level since mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 10 leading indicators that make up the Conference  
Board's index rose in January. Leading the way were increases in 
prices of 500 common stocks and manufacturers' orders of 
non-defense capital goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The sole area of decline was in the average factory work week.  
However, the National Association of Purchasing Management, which 
tracks the health of the nation's factories, reported Monday that 
manufacturing strengthened in February, so the one laggard in the 
January indicators might see an improvement in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading indicators index is designed to forecast economic  
activity six to nine months in advance. It operates from a base of 
100, set in 1992. First calculated in the late 1960s, it is 
periodically fine-tuned and figures from past years are revised.

<HEADLINE> Panel Backs Nursing Home Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nursing homes would be barred from evicting or  
transferring residents solely because they rely on Medicaid, under 
legislation endorsed by a House subcommittee on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nursing homes could still decide to stop accepting new Medicaid  
patients. However, such homes would have to notify any new 
residents who might be able to pay their own way at first, that 
they might have to move if they eventually ran out of money and 
needed to rely on the government health insurance program for the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nursing home residents and their families will not have to  
live with the fear of eviction. Enactment of this legislation will 
remove that threat,'' said Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., chairman 
of the House Commerce health and environment subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is expected to reach the House floor later this spring  
and the Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to vote on similar 
legislation later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a physician, said Tuesday  
that requiring nursing homes to keep Medicaid patients regardless 
of payment levels could have unintended consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	``No new nursing homes are going to be built for Medicaid  
patients,'' said Coburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn said he will offer an amendment that would exempt homes  
from the new rules in states that cut their Medicaid payment rates 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The patient-protection legislation was prompted after one of the  
nation's largest nursing home operators, Vencor Inc., tried last 
year to remove Medicaid patients from some of its homes in several 
states, including Florida and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints caused the Louisville, Ky.-based company to  
reconsider, and Vencor and nursing home industry groups have 
endorsed the proposed safeguards, along with advocates for the 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Vencor executives say inadequate Medicaid payment rates  
are the root of the problem, and have told stockholders they plan 
to try to increase the company's share of wealthy private payers in 
its nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicaid, a health insurance program paid for jointly by the  
federal government and the states, generally is thought of as help 
for poor families and children. However, long-term care for older 
Americans in and out of nursing homes accounts for almost a fifth 
of Medicaid's entire cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of elderly nursing home patients rely on Medicaid to  
help pay for their care, and with nursing home costs averaging 
around $40,000 a year, about half who initially pay their own way 
must turn to Medicaid within three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, state Medicaid programs pay about $27 less per day  
than the amount nursing homes can charge private payers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nursing homes do not have to take Medicaid patients, although  
most now do in part because of the sheer numbers of elderly people 
who must rely on the program.

<HEADLINE> Starr Got Lewinsky Memo Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recounting her story on television and in a  
tell-all book, Monica Lewinsky assails Kenneth Starr's office for 
``dubious methods'' and raises new questions about the origins of 
his investigation of President Clinton's affair with her and the 
following cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky asserts in ``Monica's Story,'' a book by Princess  
Diana biographer Andrew Morton, that the independent counsel's 
investigators had obtained a copy of her false affidavit denying an 
affair with Clinton before the document had been filed with a 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	In making her first personal attacks on the prosecutor after 13  
months of silence, Ms. Lewinsky raises the prospect that Starr had 
been secretly coordinating with Paula Jones' lawyers to catch the 
president in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr acknowledges he had the affidavit early, but he says he  
got it from a source other than Mrs. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Understandably, Starr's tactics have been a matter for grave  
public concern,'' her book says. ``The whole exchange about 
immunity was a waste of time except insofar as it exposed the 
dubious methods employed by Starr's investigators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press obtained excerpts from the book, due out  
later this week, from a source outside the publishing world. 
</P>
<P>
	In both the book and TV interview, Ms. Lewinsky volunteers  
detail about intensely personal matters in her life, including 
acknowledging in the book that she had an abortion after becoming 
pregnant by another man. That occurred during the latter part of 
1996, while she was still seeing Clinton in secret meetings at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	She also expresses disdain for both Linda Tripp, the friend who  
betrayed her confidences, and the prosecutor who transformed her 
affair into an impeachment crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Independent Counsel Jackie Bennett said today he could  
not comment on the book because his office hadn't seen it. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a document obtained by the AP, Starr told Congress in a  
private letter two months ago that his office had gotten Ms. 
Lewinsky's false affidavit, not from Mrs. Jones' lawyers but rather 
in an unmarked fax that was traced to the office of one of Linda 
Tripp's attorneys, James Moody. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp had previously told Starr's office about the  
affidavit, and ``when we received it we understood that it had been 
provided to us by Mr. Moody,'' Starr wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor also disputed claims his office had mistreated  
Ms. Lewinsky, saying that while she was ``understandably upset and 
distraught'' by her first encounter with prosecutors, it was not 
due to ``her treatment by this office'' but rather the ``gravity of 
the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky recounts in unflattering terms her first experience  
with Starr's prosecutors the day they confronted her at a hotel, 
urged her to cooperate with the investigation of Clinton and 
threatened to prosecute her if she didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	She says that encounter was so disturbing that she considered  
hurling herself from the 10th floor window and killing herself. 
</P>
<P>
	She asserts that Starr prosecutor Michael Emmick called her  
attorney, William Ginsburg, during one exchange that day in January 
1998 and ``offered to fax her new attorney a copy of her false 
affidavit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The two FBI agents, however, pulled him roughly away from the  
phone. They realized Ginsburg would instantly understand that the 
OIC had seen a copy before it had been filed, which meant in all 
probability it had come from Paula Jones' lawyers,'' Morton wrote 
based on his interviews with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Though her affidavit had not been filed in court, her lawyer had  
sent it to Mrs. Jones' lawyers earlier that day, Ms. Lewinsky 
asserts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is investigating whether Starr improperly  
detained Ms. Lewinsky and failed to disclose possible contacts with 
Mrs. Jones' lawyer to the department before it gave Starr 
permission to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The book and a separate interview to be aired by ABC tonight  
gave Ms. Lewinsky the first opportunity to tell her story outside 
of a federal grand jury room or the impeachment trial, where she 
testified by videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	In a snippet of the TV interview with Barbara Walters aired this  
morning by ABC, Ms. Lewinsky also questions the sincerity of the 
president's apology for the entire episode, saying she believes he 
was ``sorry he got caught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky said that she felt like ``a piece of trash'' the  
day Clinton was forced to admit their affair on national television 
and apologized to the nation -- but not to her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt dirty and I felt used and I was disappointed,'' Ms.  
Lewinsky said. The full interview will be aired tonight on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by Ms. Walters whether Clinton really cared for her, Ms.  
Lewinsky said, ``Some days I think yes and some days I think no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky was shown on the clip watching Clinton's televised  
apology to the nation last Aug. 17, the day he gave his grand jury 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by Ms. Walters whether she believed Clinton felt remorse,  
she said that as a politician, ``I think he's sorry he got 
caught.'' But she added that ``when I think of the person I thought 
Bill Clinton was, he had genuine remorse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The short portion was the first videotape aired of the  
interview, although partial transcripts have leaked out. 
</P>
<P>
	In the earlier material, Ms. Lewinsky said she regretted her  
role in causing pain and suffering not only for her own friends and 
family, but for Clinton's family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've apologized in private to my family and to my friends ...  
I would like to publicly acknowledge that I recognize the pain and 
the suffering that they've gone through because of this,'' Ms. 
Lewinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't dream of asking Chelsea and Mrs. Clinton to forgive  
me,'' she said. ``But I would ask them to know that I am very sorry 
for what happened and for what they've been through.''

<HEADLINE> Three Houston Octuplets Go Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The family of the Houston octuplets danced and  
sang Wednesday as three of the children finally came home after 
spending the first few months of their lives in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was dancing and rejoicing,'' said the babies' father,  
Ikye Louis Udobi. ``My mother-in-law was kind of singing, rejoicing 
and praising the Lord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Udobi and his wife, Nkem Chukwu, brought home daughters Ebuka  
and Echerem and son Jioke, who have been among the largest and 
healthiest since their births -- Ebuka on Dec. 8, and the others on 
Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``They opened their eyes when they got home, signifying, `We're  
home,''' Udobi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said the three are breathing and maintaining body  
temperature on their own and are on full diets of breast milk and 
formula. 
</P>
<P>
	Chima, a sister who also has progressed well, is fighting off an  
intestinal ailment and should be home within a few weeks, Dr. Patti 
Savrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chidi and Gorom, both girls, continue to get 24-hour care in the  
neonatal intensive care unit at Texas Children's Hospital. The 
weakest and smallest tot is the only other boy, Ikem, who was back 
on a ventilator after surgery overnight to repair an inflamed 
bowel.

<HEADLINE>  Execution of German Still Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- Gov. Jane Hull ignored international  
pleas to halt today's scheduled execution of convicted killer 
Walter LaGrand, a German citizen whose brother was put to death 
last week for the same crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer and Chancellor  
Gerhard Schroeder telephoned the governor Tuesday and asked her to 
delay the execution, but she was not receptive, officials in Bonn 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany also appealed Tuesday night to the International Court  
of Justice to try to halt LaGrand's execution, scheduled for this 
afternoon. The court, which has no enforcement powers and relies on 
voluntary compliance with its rulings, scheduled a special hearing 
today to publicly deliver a ruling on emergency measures aimed at 
staying the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges were expected to officially urge the U.S. government  
to do all it can to halt the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hull rejected Tuesday's recommendation by the state  
clemency board that LaGrand receive a 60-day stay so that his 
government could appeal to the international court in The Hague, 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the interest of justice and with the victims in mind, I  
have decided to allow this execution to go forward as scheduled,'' 
Mrs. Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
	Court judges met behind closed doors today to discuss the  
scheduled execution. 
</P>
<P>
	LaGrand's 35-year-old brother, Karl, was executed last week for  
fatally stabbing Marana bank manager Kenneth Hartsock and slashing 
his throat during a botched robbery in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Both he and Walter, 37, who were born in Germany and moved to  
Arizona as children, requested execution in the gas chamber in an 
effort to have the method ruled cruel and unusual, and therefore 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	It worked briefly for Karl when the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals stayed the execution, but the U.S. Supreme Court overturned 
the stay. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's office says Karl LaGrand was offered, and  
accepted, an offer of lethal injection. Walter LaGrand has turned 
down a similar offer, meaning he would be the first person to die 
in Arizona's gas chamber since voters approved use of lethal 
injection in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wednesday, I'll be ready at 3 o'clock. Gov. Hull doesn't have  
to worry about delaying, because I was killed when you killed my 
brother,'' LaGrand told the clemency panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's lawsuit in the International Court of Justice alleged  
that Arizona failed to advise Walter LaGrand of his right to 
consular assistance during his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona officials conceded that they violated the Vienna  
Convention but insisted the LaGrands were afforded all rights any 
U.S. citizen would have received. 
</P>
<P>
	German officials said last week that they did not appeal to the  
court in their unsuccessful attempt to save Karl LaGrand's life for 
fears of embarrassing the United States.

<HEADLINE> Study Refutes Dopamine Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A new study released today found that dopamine isn't the key  
player in the brain's pleasure process, suggesting that two decades 
of work to unlock the secrets of drug addiction may have been 
off-target. 
</P>
<P>
	The naturally produced brain chemical is only a messenger in  
that process and one of several factors, according to the study 
published in the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly says the picture is much more complicated than  
being just dopamine alone, and it will lead to the search for other 
chemical substances in the brain,'' said the study's author, 
chemist R. Mark Wightman of the University of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Dopamine, first discovered in 1957, came into prominence in the  
early 1960s when scientists discovered that several antipsychotic 
drugs targeted it. In the late 1970s, researchers began looking 
into its role in drug addiction and found that cocaine, heroin and 
other addictive drugs increase levels of dopamine in the body. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, some scientists have tried to develop a medication  
that would cure cocaine addiction by blocking dopamine. The latest 
study is the latest to cast doubt on that approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers attached electrodes to the brains of rats, which  
produced dopamine when they were shocked. The rats were then 
trained to shock themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	As the rats continued to shock themselves, however, researchers  
discovered that the amount of dopamine produced by their brains 
decreased -- even though they continued to seek pleasure by pressing 
the lever that electrically stimulated their brains. 
</P>
<P>
	Dopamine appears to be related to ``novelty, predictability or  
some other aspect of the reward process, rather than to hedonism 
itself,'' the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	What chemical or process is ultimately responsible for the  
pleasure is ``not really clear right now. That's something that's a 
real topic of investigation,'' said Anthony Grace, a professor of 
neuroscience and psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh who was 
not involved in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Grace said that even if dopamine is not the ultimate reward for  
the brain, it might still be the key to curing addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis White, chairman of cellular and molecular pharmacology  
at the Chicago Medical School, said the study adds to the growing 
belief that the pleasure process has been oversimplified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are beginning to understand the complexity of  
the situation and no longer think about things as simply as they 
once did,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some researchers now complain that dopamine's activity in the  
brain has been overstated. Alan Leshner, director of the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse, has criticized what he called ``the 
dopamine religion'' among some scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Caron, a professor of cell biology at the Duke University  
Medical Center, found evidence last year that the effects of 
cocaine are not solely controlled by dopamine. Caron created 
specially bred mice without dopamine transporters, and found they 
still wanted cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Medications that block the transporters in humans, however,  
might be effective if they could block the desire for cocaine long 
enough to break the addiction, Grace said. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina researchers were able to obtain real-time  
results of the effect of the electrical stimulation using 
specially-treated carbon fibers. Caron said the carbon fiber method 
will allow for more sophisticated neurological work.

<HEADLINE> UN: Violence Helps Spread of AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Violence against women is helping to  
spread the virus that causes AIDS, U.N. officials said Wednesday in 
events leading up to next week's commemoration of International 
Women's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Marital abuse, sexual coercion, rape and the trafficking of  
women and children are forms of violence that lead directly to HIV 
infection, experts told the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women. 
</P>
<P>
	``For millions of girls and women worldwide, it is clear that  
violence, AIDS and human rights abuses are experienced as three 
strands of the same traumatic reality,'' said Peter Piot, executive 
director of the joint U.N. program on HIV/AIDS, known as UNAIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Piot also said the subordinate position of women in many  
societies makes it ``difficult if not impossible'' to protect 
themselves from HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	``They often cannot insist on fidelity, demand condom use, or  
refuse sex to their partner, even when they suspect or know that he 
is already infected himself,'' he said. ``And they often lack the 
economic power to remove themselves from relationships that carry 
major risks of HIV infection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Violence against girls and women throughout the world causes  
more death and disability among females between the ages of 15 and 
44 than cancer, malaria, traffic accidents and even war, according 
to the World Health Organization.

<HEADLINE> Kansas City Mayoral Field Narrows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A businesswoman and Kansas City's mayor  
pro tem won the top primary spots to advance to the March 30 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Kay Waldo Barnes, a former member of the City Council who was  
considered the front-runner in a field of six, led the balloting in 
Tuesday's primary with 15,280 votes, or 29 percent, to George 
Blackwood's 13,065, or 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them will succeed Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, who became the  
city's first black mayor eight years ago and by law could not seek 
a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	Waldo Barnes would become Kansas City's first female mayor if  
she beats Blackwood, a member of the City Council for the past 
eight years. The only other time a woman made it past the primary 
was in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very exciting for me,'' Waldo Barnes said. ``I feel ready  
for the challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another local businesswoman, Janice Ellis, finished third with  
11,206 votes, or 21 percent. She was the only black person on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Waldo Barnes, 60, who runs a consulting firm, launched a massive  
campaign, raising about $500,000. She blanketed the city of 430,000 
with her ``Kay for Kansas City'' yard signs and toured 
neighborhoods in a Winnebago, inviting residents inside to discuss 
local issues over a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwood, a 59-year-old attorney, was elected mayor pro tem in  
1995. He has served as chairman of the council's Ethics Committee 
and headed a plan to convert Richards-Gebauer Memorial Airport 
south of the city into an international freight center.

<HEADLINE> Auditors: Clinton Plan Breaks Caps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress' chief fiscal analyst said today that  
President Clinton's budget would bust spending caps for next year 
by $30 billion. Republicans immediately used the report to 
criticize the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In the $1.77 trillion budget for fiscal 2000 that he proposed  
last month, Clinton proposed billions in extra spending for 
schools, health and other areas. He would keep the added spending 
within budgetary limits by paying for them with higher cigarette 
taxes and other revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	But in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, Dan  
Crippen, new director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget 
Office, said Clinton's proposed savings would not keep spending 
within limits because under budget law, those revenues ``do not 
count as offsets'' against such spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending caps, enacted two years ago in the budget-balancing  
pact between Clinton and Congress, were designed to bring 
expenditures under control. Fiscal 2000 begins on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In his prepared remarks, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete  
Domenici, R-N.M., said Clinton's budget continues ``a troubling 
pattern'' from the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Clinton has repeatedly used budget devices ``to make  
promises for new or increased spending in his budget, claim that it 
is paid for no matter how unlikely the offsets, and then throw the 
whole muddle into the lap of the Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CBO study also said Clinton's budget would produce surpluses  
totaling $73 billion less than he claims over the next five years, 
discounting the president's plans for using anticipated federal 
surpluses for shoring up Social Security, Medicare, and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	If Clinton's Social Security plan is factored in, the surpluses  
would be $436 billion smaller through 2004 than he says, CBO said. 
</P>
<P>
	The analysis came as GOP congressional leaders decided to try to  
quickly push a plan through Congress allowing Social Security funds 
to be used only for shoring up the massive pension system or 
shrinking the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	By rushing the measure to Clinton before turning to tax cuts and  
other priorities, Republicans hope to buffer themselves against 
politically potent Democratic accusations that the GOP is plotting 
to divert needed Social Security funds for tax reductions for the 
wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	As the year's budget fight begins, the CBO report is certain to  
be used by Republicans to accuse Clinton of spending more and doing 
less to protect federal surpluses than he claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending limit in question -- $537 billion for fiscal 2000 --  
applies to so-called discretionary spending. This includes 
everything but automatically paid benefits such as Medicare, as 
well as payments to holders of federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman in the White House budget office,  
said Clinton's aides have not seen the CBO figures yet. But she 
added that the two agencies often use different assumptions on the 
pace of spending or collecting revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every element of the president's budget is fully paid for,''  
she said. ``The offsets exist. It is simply a matter of the CBO 
choosing to put our offsets in a different category than we have. 
This is a balanced budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Staying within the spending cap is proving a problem for  
Republicans as well. They are struggling to live within it while 
meeting bipartisan calls for extra spending for defense, schools 
and perhaps other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican lawmakers and aides have acknowledged that it is  
likely they will have to exceed the spending limit eventually. 
Publicly, however, many GOP lawmakers insist they hope to live 
within the cap. 
</P>
<P>
	In its study, the CBO was more optimistic than the White House  
when it came to predicting the size of federal surpluses over the 
next decade if no tax or spending changes were made. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for 2009, the CBO envisions a bigger surplus than Clinton  
did for every year, a total of nearly $200 billion more than he did 
over the decade. For the next five years alone, the CBO sees 
surpluses totaling $953 billion, some $125 billion more than the 
White House projected. 
</P>
<P>
	Without any action, the CBO envisions a 1999 surplus of $111  
billion, growing to $133 billion next year and hitting $383 billion 
by 2009. The White House projected a $79 billion surplus this year, 
$117 billion next year and $393 billion in 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget would leave the 2000 surplus at $113 billion  
without his Social Security plan and $80 billion with it, the CBO 
said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Cuts Wholesale Milk Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Californians pay more for milk than  
anybody else in the country, but relief may be on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a nationwide increase in the milk supply, the state  
Department of Food and Agriculture is trimming 50 cents per gallon 
off the minimum wholesale price of milk -- from $1.71 per gallon to 
$1.21 per gallon as of April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the largest drop we've ever had in the farm price of  
milk,'' spokeswoman Myrlys Williams said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	California, the nation's biggest milk producer, also has the  
most expensive milk in the country. The average retail price for a 
gallon of whole milk in the Sacramento area was $3.06 a gallon in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates blame a combination of state price  
regulations, quality standards and markups by the big grocery 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be up to retailers to pass the latest price cut along to  
consumers. Dave Heylen, a spokesman for the California Grocers 
Association, said retail prices will also depend on costs such as 
advertising.

<HEADLINE>  Dodgers' Sheffield Likes Left Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Gary Sheffield smiled, knowing the  
question was coming. 
</P>
<P>
	No, he said quietly, he didn't object to a move to left field  
because he'll do anything to help the Los Angeles Dodgers win. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 30, Sheffield thinks that because of a reputation that goes  
back to the late 1980s when he was playing for Milwaukee, and 
perhaps because of his high salary, people have preconceived 
notions about him. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Dodgers signed Devon White to play center field during  
the offseason, that meant for certain that Raul Mondesi would move 
back to right, as he preferred, and Sheffield would go from right 
to left. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately, it was speculated Sheffield would balk at the  
change. 
</P>
<P>
	Never happened, he said. And general manager Kevin Malone  
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a team player,'' Malone said. ``I don't know how Gary  
was in the past, I know how he is now. I had heard about his 
reputation. I don't know who this guy used to be. He just wants to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll play first, third, wherever. He's been working out hard,  
he's real focused. I've always respected him as a player, I've 
gotten to know and respect him as a person. He's much more cerebral 
than he's given credit for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield set a single-season salary record last year, earning  
more than $14.9 million. His earnings were boosted by a $5 million 
bonus he received for agreeing to a trade from the Florida Marlins 
in May, a trade he has no regrets about now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm comfortable here, I want to spend the rest of my career  
with the Dodgers,'' he said. ``This is a great organization that 
treats its players right. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go out as one, we've got to think as one. The No. 1 goal is  
to win ball games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield has had two terrific seasons -- 1992 with San Diego  
(.330, 33 homers) and 1996 with the Marlins (.314, 42 homers). But 
he's always been hampered by injuries, and last year was no 
exception -- he missed the final 25 games because of a severely 
sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, he hit .302 with 22 homers, 85 RBIs and 22 stolen  
bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ankle's fine,'' he said. ``They say I would have been  
better off breaking it. It took the whole season of working out, it 
took four months for the swelling to go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield was injured in a rundown between third base and home  
plate, and he believes he learned a lesson from it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being too aggressive gets you hurt,'' he said. ``I think  
that's what's happened to me. That's mainly how my injuries have 
occurred, on the basepaths, trying to make something happen that's 
not there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I come into camp, (staying healthy) is my No. 1  
goal. If I can play 150, 160 games, my numbers can be among the 
best in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone certainly agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``His bat speed compares to anybody,'' he said. ``I've seen him  
carry a team offensively by himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield admitted his ability in left was one of the few  
question marks on the Dodgers, but added, ``I didn't think twice 
about it, to be honest with you. There's no reason I can't play the 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Malone: ``I think he's going to be a natural in left  
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield, a key member of Florida's World Series-winning team  
in 1997, relishes the role of team leader. He also realizes the 
knock on his reputation won't disappear overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something I'll have to live with the rest of my life,''  
he said. ``I know I am (a good person). There's no doubt in my 
mind. I feel like I can make a lot of things happen, on and off the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look for what kind of numbers I can put up. Numbers  
aren't the most important thing. It's when you produce.''

<P>
	No, he said quietly, he didn't object to a move to left field  
because he'll do anything to help the Los Angeles Dodgers win. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 30, Sheffield thinks that because of a reputation that goes  
back to the late 1980s when he was playing for Milwaukee, and 
perhaps because of his high salary, people have preconceived 
notions about him. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Dodgers signed Devon White to play center field during  
the offseason, that meant for certain that Raul Mondesi would move 
back to right, as he preferred, and Sheffield would go from right 
to left. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately, it was speculated Sheffield would balk at the  
change. 
</P>
<P>
	Never happened, he said. And general manager Kevin Malone  
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a team player,'' Malone said. ``I don't know how Gary  
was in the past, I know how he is now. I had heard about his 
reputation. I don't know who this guy used to be. He just wants to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll play first, third, wherever. He's been working out hard,  
he's real focused. I've always respected him as a player, I've 
gotten to know and respect him as a person. He's much more cerebral 
than he's given credit for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield set a single-season salary record last year, earning  
more than $14.9 million. His earnings were boosted by a $5 million 
bonus he received for agreeing to a trade from the Florida Marlins 
in May, a trade he has no regrets about now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm comfortable here, I want to spend the rest of my career  
with the Dodgers,'' he said. ``This is a great organization that 
treats its players right. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go out as one, we've got to think as one. The No. 1 goal is  
to win ball games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield has had two terrific seasons -- 1992 with San Diego  
(.330, 33 homers) and 1996 with the Marlins (.314, 42 homers). But 
he's always been hampered by injuries, and last year was no 
exception -- he missed the final 25 games because of a severely 
sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, he hit .302 with 22 homers, 85 RBIs and 22 stolen  
bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ankle's fine,'' he said. ``They say I would have been  
better off breaking it. It took the whole season of working out, it 
took four months for the swelling to go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield was injured in a rundown between third base and home  
plate, and he believes he learned a lesson from it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being too aggressive gets you hurt,'' he said. ``I think  
that's what's happened to me. That's mainly how my injuries have 
occurred, on the basepaths, trying to make something happen that's 
not there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I come into camp, (staying healthy) is my No. 1  
goal. If I can play 150, 160 games, my numbers can be among the 
best in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone certainly agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``His bat speed compares to anybody,'' he said. ``I've seen him  
carry a team offensively by himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield admitted his ability in left was one of the few  
question marks on the Dodgers, but added, ``I didn't think twice 
about it, to be honest with you. There's no reason I can't play the 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Malone: ``I think he's going to be a natural in left  
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield, a key member of Florida's World Series-winning team  
in 1997, relishes the role of team leader. He also realizes the 
knock on his reputation won't disappear overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something I'll have to live with the rest of my life,''  
he said. ``I know I am (a good person). There's no doubt in my 
mind. I feel like I can make a lot of things happen, on and off the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look for what kind of numbers I can put up. Numbers  
aren't the most important thing. It's when you produce.''

<HEADLINE> Duke Is Favored in ACC Hoops Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Even Duke's challengers are doubtful that  
anyone can beat the top-ranked Blue Devils in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (29-1) swaggers into the Charlotte Coliseum for the  
four-day event after compiling a record-setting 16-0 league mark 
and 24.3-point average winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen of Duke's ACC wins were by double digits, and no team  
got closer than eight points against a starting five that all made 
one of the first three all-conference teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is going to beat Duke. Who is going to beat them?''  
said Virginia coach Pete Gillen. ``As Dave Odom has said, as Bill 
Guthridge has said, it's going to be boring. They're a wrecking 
machine. I hate to say that, but I'm just being frank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gillen, whose ninth-seeded club lost twice to Duke by 46 points  
in the regular season, even joked that his team might ``take a 
vacation or forfeit'' instead of playing its first-round game 
Thursday night against the Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	``We voted on whether to play the game or not,'' said Gillen.  
``Our seven walk-ons said, `Play the game,' and our six healthy 
scholarship said, `No.' So, we will play. 
</P>
<P>
	``The walk-ons like the meal money, staying at a hotel and  
missing school. Our scholarship guys want to be with their 
girlfriends. But we will be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Duke is riding a 24-game winning streak and has generally  
toyed with the rest of the ACC all season, history shows that going 
undefeated in league play doesn't necessarily guarantee an ACC 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the previous seven undefeated teams in ACC play went on  
to lose in the tournament, including the two most recent teams -- 
North Carolina in 1984 and '87. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you are the favored team, other teams look at that as a  
great opportunity to get a notch in their belt. And this would be 
something if somebody was to beat Duke. It would be a great 
accomplishment,'' said North Carolina coach Bill Guthridge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils have dominated the ACC regular season in the  
'90s with six championship, but has gone 4-6 in the league 
tournament since winning its only crown of the decade in '92. 
</P>
<P>
	So, coach Mike Krzyzewski is well aware of the pitfalls -- no  
matter how dominant his teams has looked. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of things that can happen,'' said Krzyzewski.  
``At this time of the year you get even more attention than you do 
during the regular season. You can start listening to the wrong 
things. This team has not done that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the other thing is if you change focus, you start  
playing it safe, you don't attack and you don't look to get better. 
Those are also dangerous things that can happen to a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many believe Duke's closest competition will come from No. 5  
Maryland, a team still with a chance at a No. 1 seed in the NCAA 
tournament if it can knock off the Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-seeded Terrapins (25-4) set a school-record with 13  
wins in the ACC, but still finished three games behind Duke in the 
standings and lost to them by 18 points twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've had a great deal of success against us but we've  
beaten them at times in the last five or six years,'' Maryland 
coach Gary Williams said of Duke. ``Nobody has beaten Duke this 
year. If we have a mental block against them then everybody else 
does too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Terrapins would love another shot at Duke, but Williams said  
playing in the Puerto Rico Shootout back in November helped his 
team learn a lesson about looking ahead to opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played three games in three days and we were supposed to  
play Kentucky in the championship game, but it didn't work out that 
way,'' Williams said of the Wildcats losing before the title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand it's a win or go home situation. You don't get  
any takeovers. To look past any game to get ready for a certain 
team is ridiculous at this time of year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland will play the winner of the Florida State-Clemson game,  
which opens the tourney on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two games Friday will pit No. 4 seed Wake Forest  
(16-12) against No. 5 seed N.C. State (17-12), while two-time 
defending champion North Carolina, the No. 3 seed, takes on No. 6 
seed Georgia Tech (15-14) in the nightcap. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15th-ranked Tar Heels (22-8) are gunning for their fifth ACC  
tournament title of the '90s, but are coming off a 20-point home 
loss against Duke and haven't been playing particularly well of 
late. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what has happened. We've gotten too relaxed, too  
comfortable out there,'' UNC point guard Ed Cota said of North 
Carolina's recent slump. ``We're not making the extra passes 
anymore. People are putting their heads down and looking to score 
on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you watched us play early in the season, the ball movement  
we had, how we played defense together, and you watch us know, it's 
totally different.''

<HEADLINE> Eugene Robinson Accepts Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The stigma of Eugene Robinson's Super Bowl weekend  
arrest for soliciting oral sex from an undercover police officer is 
likely to linger for years. The charge, though, should disappear by 
the time training camp arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Falcons safety, through his attorney, agreed to a  
diversion program Tuesday that would clear his record upon 
completion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that Mr. Robinson will do what he needs to do on  
pretrial diversion, and he and this office can move on,'' said Don 
Ungurait, spokesman for the Miami-Dade County Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretrial diversion programs are often offered to first-time  
misdemeanor offenders and require no plea. Robinson's attorney, 
Jeffery Allen, met with prosecutor Marc Weinstein to strike the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson did not appear before Judge Teretha Lundy Thomas in  
Miami-Dade County Court for his arraignment on a charge of 
soliciting prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pro Bowl safety would be ineligible for the program if  
Thomas discovers he has been convicted or charged with a crime in 
Florida or another state. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Robinson has to have an HIV test and  
complete a course on AIDS. He will be able to complete the program 
in his home state of Washington, where he lives outside Seattle 
with his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Robinson completes the program, charges will be dropped  
after another court hearing. If convicted of solicitation, he could 
have faced a maximum penalty of about 60 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say this is the standard resolution for solicitation  
cases,'' Ungurait said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen did not return phone calls Tuesday seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 35, was arrested Jan. 30 for allegedly offering an  
undercover officer $40 for oral sex. He was among about 25 people 
caught in a police sting on Biscayne Boulevard, a major street in 
downtown Miami frequented by prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons lost to the Denver Broncos 34-19 in the Super Bowl  
the next day, with Robinson beaten on the game's pivotal touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who also played in two Super Bowls with Green Bay and  
leads active NFL players with 53 interceptions, is known as ``The 
Prophet'' for his deep religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	His arrest came about 12 hours after a Christian athletes group  
presented him with an award for high moral character. He later 
returned the award.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Unveils African Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``You will walk through time in Africa ...  
from the beginnings of the human experience to the present,'' says 
Sulayman S. Nyang, lead developer of a new Smithsonian exhibit on 
the second largest continent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of African History and Culture is scheduled to open in  
Dec. 15, seven years after the National Museum of Natural History 
closed its antiquated exhibit on Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout the exhibition, visitors will find personal  
accounts from contemporary interviews and literary works, as well 
as cultural voices from proverbs, prayers, folk tales, songs and 
oral epics,'' said Natural History Museum Director Robert Fri. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people participated during the years the new  
exhibit was under development, Nyang said, providing answers to the 
question: ``What do Africans want to tell Americans about what it 
means to be African?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main focus of the $5.5 million project is a permanent 6,500  
square foot Hall of African History and Culture. It's in the same 
general area as the old African hall, which was criticized for 
generalities and inaccuracies. 
</P>
<P>
	``This exhibition is going to present Africa in a new light  
based on the most recent scholarship,'' said Nyang, a native of 
Gambia who is a professor at Howard University in Washington. ``We 
have avoided all the booby traps of generalization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the exhibit hall, there will be an Internet  
connection available where people can study the exhibit from afar 
and learn more detail than can be presented at the museum itself. 
And the exhibit will be kept up to date with continuing 
performances, seminars, lectures and program changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The continent's geography includes deserts, savanna, seaports,  
jungle and tropical forests as well as huge cities. The exhibit 
underscores the cultural and linguistic diversity of those living 
there, Nyang said. Africa has 54 nations, hundreds of languages and 
thousands cultures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit will begin, as did humankind, with the early  
hominids of Africa's Olduvai Gorge. 
</P>
<P>
	The hall will include looks at the Nile cultures of Egypt and  
Nubia, the great Mali empire, the Almoravids of North Africa who 
fused African and Islamic culture and invaded Spain and Portugal, 
the rise of the slave trade and history in the making in South 
Africa today. 
</P>
<P>
	The African Diaspora, the wide scattering of people through the  
world, is depicted, with a section quoting the words of Olaudah 
Equiano, who was enslaved in what is now Nigeria and sold to a 
British Royal Navy officer. In 1789, he wrote a book about his 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Other galleries include:  
</P>
<P>
	--Kongo Crossroads, which focuses on people in the continent's  
center who often go to crossroads -- places of possibility -- to 
invoke their ancestors' blessings for success. 
</P>
<P>
	--Market Crossroads, which recreates the bustle of shopping in  
Accra, Ghana, including the voices of Comfort Kwachi, a yam vendor, 
and Adjoa Mintah, seller of housewares. 
</P>
<P>
	--Work and the Environment Gallery, which looks at the daily life  
of the Bamana, the farming people of Mali; the techniques of 
African potters and Masai herders in Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Slide Further; Dow Off 67.64 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower this afternoon after a mixed  
morning, as technology stocks got hit again with a warning about 
softening computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 67.64 at 9,229.97. The blue-chip index had risen as high as 
9,337.00, up nearly 40 points, before retreating. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators turned lower as technology shares sank.  
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 7.30 at 1,218.20, and the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 11.88 at 2,247.15. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues led advancers by 13 to 9 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where volume came to 591 million shares, even with 
Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer stocks dropped after 3Com Corp., which sells Internet  
data, voice and video systems, said late Tuesday that third-quarter 
operating earnings will be about 23 cents a share, far below 
analysts' previously expected 36 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The company blamed an ``unexpected slowdown'' in sales to  
businesses in the United States and Latin America. 3Com stock was 
down 3 1/4 at 23 3/4 in leading volume in Nasdaq trading, after dropping 
Tuesday in after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also pushed lower by the bond market, where prices  
sank after the National Association of Purchasing Management said 
its index of non-manufacturing activity rose to 57.0 percent in 
February, from January's 54 percent. But, the group's index of 
non-manufacturing prices eased, to 46.5 percent from 47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury was down 23/32 point at 5.66 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	``The higher interest rates will exacerbate a slower economy, so  
that things are feeling kind of toppy in the stock market here,'' 
said Michael Farr, a partner at Farr, Miller &AMP; Washington in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan restated his  
reservations about President Clinton's proposal to invest a 
significant portion of the nation's Social Security Trust Fund in 
the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing a Congressional subcommittee this morning, Greenspan  
said such a plan could encourage investments for political reasons 
in companies that aren't well run, or discourage investments in 
companies that could earn the best return for future retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	Investing Social Security funds in the stock market could also  
lead to higher overall interest rates and curb economic growth, 
while doing ``little or nothing'' to make sure the retirement needs 
of the next century are met, Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's remarks ruffled a market that was already poised to  
continue a sell-off of technology shares while no other sector has 
stepped forward to lead the market higher, said Scott Bleier, chief 
investment strategist at Prime Charter in New York. ``This market 
is locked in a trading range,'' Bleier said. ``You are in the 
process of building some very serious negative sentiment, far more 
negative than we've see in several months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Farr: ``You're looking to what might be a stimulus for the  
markets, and it's certainly not coming from Mr. Greenspan this 
morning,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Hearings Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The lawyer who represented President Clinton  
in the Paula Jones case told a Senate committee today that the 
Independent Counsel Act has become ``a nuclear weapon in the 
arsenal of partisan politics'' and should be allowed to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beware of the lawyer with one case, with an endlessly deep  
pocket to finance it and no time limit in which to get the job 
done,'' Robert Bennett told the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	As the hearing opened, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the  
senior Democrat on the panel, said he remained reluctant to allow 
the statute to expire June 30 when its legal mandate runs out. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberman said he was disappointed by the administration  
position that the law is so seriously flawed that it must be 
allowed to die. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the criticisms cited by Deputy Attorney General Eric H.  
Holder Jr. ``can be remedied by surgery as opposed to 
termination.'' But Lieberman has few supporters for his position. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, battered by Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr's five-year probe, reversed course Tuesday and announced it 
was withdrawing support for the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans angered by independent counsel investigations  
of President Reagan already oppose the law's renewal without at 
least a major overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett pointed out in his testimony that he not only  
represented Clinton but also Reagan Cabinet official Caspar 
Weinburger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The act has become yet another weapon -- indeed a nuclear  
weapon -- in the arsenal of partisan politics,'' said Bennett. ``The 
mere appointment of an independent counsel puts the scandal machine 
in overdrive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The act was supposed to increase trust in our government;  
unfortunately, it has diminished it,'' Holder told the House 
Judiciary subcommittee on commercial and administrative law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The climate of politicization pervades the process, regardless  
of which way a specific decision, investigation or prosecution 
comes out,'' he said in prepared remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a marked reversal from five years ago, when Clinton and  
Attorney General Janet Reno successfully lobbied for the law's 
renewal. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder emphasized several times that the administration's  
reversal ``does not have to do with any particular inquiry or 
investigation. It has to do with the fact that the types of 
decisions we are talking about here can be controversial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Barry Toiv said Clinton ``concurs  
with the judgment of the Justice Department that the statute should 
not be renewed -- that its flaws outweigh its benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv said Clinton's judgment was ``a policy decision based on  
his observation of how the law's been implemented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning from subcommittee Chairman George Gekas,  
R-Pa., Holder told the panel that he first secured Reno's approval, 
then submitted his testimony to White House Counsel Charles Ruff 
late last week. ``He indicated to us that we proceed,'' Holder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law provides for an independent counsel selected by three  
judges to investigate allegations against specified administration 
officials. Reno has had seven independent counsels appointed in 
Clinton's six years in office, more than any other attorney 
general. 
</P>
<P>
	Without renewal, the law will expire June 30 and any future  
investigations of high-ranking government officials would be 
handled by the Justice Department. In rare cases, Holder said, the 
attorney general could appoint special prosecutors in cases where 
conflicts of interest clearly exist. 
</P>
<P>
	That was how the system worked until President Nixon fired  
special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal. 
Nixon's move convinced Congress that probes of presidents and other 
high-ranking officials should be conducted by outsiders not 
accountable to those they investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one years after its inception, Republicans and Democrats  
complain the law does not hold independent counsels accountable for 
their conduct of investigations or for the millions of public 
dollars they spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder also told the panel that Justice officials met recently  
with Starr and listened to his objections about the department 
investigating his conduct during the Clinton probe, but no 
negotiations took place and Reno will make any final decisions 
about who will conduct the investigation.

<HEADLINE>  Cable Car Case To Go to Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot was ``outright  
dangerous'' the day he flew his jet into an Italian ski lift cable, 
killing 20 people, a prosecutor told jurors today. The defense 
countered that it was an accident ``and nothing more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When he violated all these things and didn't know local rules  
and regulations, people died and a $60 million aircraft is in 
ruins,'' said the prosecutor, Maj. Daniel Daugherty, during closing 
arguments at Capt. Richard Ashby's court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason the accused is guilty ... is he was too low, he was  
too fast, he was too aggressive. He was outright dangerous,'' 
Daugherty said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his closing statement, defense attorney Frank Spinner posed  
the question of whether the tragedy was ``a training accident or 
was it something more?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a training accident and nothing more,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, said the case will go to the  
eight-man jury of Marine officers this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony in Ashby's manslaughter trial began Feb. 8 and ended  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was at the controls of an  
EA-6B Prowler jet on Feb. 3, 1998, when it struck the Mount Cermis 
gondola cable near Cavalese, Italy. He is charged with involuntary 
manslaughter and other counts and could get 206 years in prison if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 45-minute summation, Daugherty said the safe conduct of  
the flight depended on Ashby's decisions, but he made bad choices -- 
flying the jet above the 517 mph restriction for the low-level 
training mission, and far below the 2,000-foot altitude limit. 
Ashby's jet hit the cable 370 feet above the valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Daugherty argued that Ashby should have known he was flying too  
low and too fast by merely looking around. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have the roads, the cars, the houses, the humanity of it  
all. Captain Ashby ignores it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby testified he didn't know about the mission's speed limit  
and thought the altitude restriction was 1,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Ashby intentionally flew too low and too  
fast. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened on the final leg of a 42-minute training  
route through the Italian Alps. Europeans were outraged, and 
Italians demanded that U.S. landing rights be revoked at bases in 
their country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't recall in 20 years of investigating accidents any  
pilot being held criminally responsible for an accident,'' said 
Jeff Edwards, an investigator who worked for the defense team. ``I 
believe he's very worried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers have suggested the aviators were charged because  
of political pressure that went as high as the White House. They 
also said Ashby's jet had a malfunctioning radar altimeter, that he 
may have been victim of an optical illusion that made him think his 
jet was higher than it actually was, and that his superiors didn't 
provide up-to-date information on speed and altitude limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree the gondola cable wasn't marked on the map  
Ashby was issued by the Air Force. Ashby testified last week that 
he didn't know of the ski lift and that he didn't see the cable 
until the last second. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, faces similar  
charges and a separate court-martial. Charges against the other two 
crewmen were dismissed.

<HEADLINE> Court: Schools Must Pay Nurses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public schools must finance one-on-one nursing  
care for some disabled students throughout the school day, the 
Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in a decision that may strain 
educational budgets across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting 7-2 in the case of an Iowa teen-ager, the court said  
public financing is required under the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act because the federal law's exemption for 
``medical services'' applies only when a doctor's help is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision's immediate impact is certain: Iowa's Cedar Rapids  
Community School District must pay tens of thousands of dollars a 
year to provide nursing care for Garret Frey, a quadriplegic on a 
ventilator who is thriving as a high school sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling's broader impact is cloudier.  
</P>
<P>
	The court's two dissenters said the decision ``blindsides unwary  
states with fiscal obligations they could not have anticipated.'' 
But Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court that Congress 
wanted to ``help guarantee that students like Garret are integrated 
into the public schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contacted at his Cedar Rapids school and told about his victory,  
Garret said: ``It's going to help a lot of other kids, not just me 
and other kids in Iowa. It's going to help all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National School Boards Association was less enthusiastic.  
``At the current time, the public educational system in this 
country is not adequately funded to provide full medical services 
for approximately 17,000 students with severe disabilities,'' said 
Anne L. Bryant, the group's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want Garret in school -- he's an excellent student,'' she  
said. ``But schools can't do it alone. The federal government needs 
to pay its share of a less-than-adequately funded special education 
service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Richard Ott, executive director of the North Dakota School  
Boards Association: ``We're already strapped. We can't do the 
things we're wanting and trying to do now. The costs of special 
education are mounting continuously, and if you even indicate that 
you want to examine them, you're accused of being opposed to kids 
with handicaps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government now pays about 12 percent of the nation's  
special education costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In other cases decided Wednesday, the court ruled:  
</P>
<P>
	--State workers' compensation system insurers cannot be sued for  
withholding health-care benefits for work-related injuries while 
they decide whether the treatment is reasonable and necessary. The 
unanimous ruling, in a Pennsylvania case, said both public and 
private insurers can withhold payment while that deciding. The case 
is American manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co. vs. Sullivan, 
97-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federal agencies can be required to bargain with unions  
representing their employees over subjects the unions raise during 
the life of a contract agreement. The 5-4 ruling said the decision 
on whether to require such bargaining is up to the Federal Labor 
Relations Authority, which oversees labor disputes between federal 
agencies and their unionized workers. The ruling set aside a lower 
court decision that said the Interior Department's U.S. Geological 
Survey was not legally bound to bargain over a proposal raised by 
the union representing its employees in Reston, Va. The cases are 
National Federation of Federal Employees vs. Department of 
Interior, 97-1184, and FLRA vs. Department of Interior, 97-1243. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration had sided with Garret, 16. State and  
local school boards should look to Medicaid as well as Department 
of Education state grants to help ``work for the types of services 
at issue,'' said Judith Heumann, assistant secretary of education 
for special education and rehabilitative services. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal law, first approved in 1975, provides that all  
children with disabilities receive a ``free appropriate public 
education.'' Under it, public schools are required to provide 
various ``special education and related services,'' but an 
exception is made for medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stevens described Garret as a ``friendly, creative and  
intelligent young man'' who was paralyzed from the neck down in a 
motorcycle accident when he was 4. 
</P>
<P>
	His daily health care includes urinary catheterization,  
suctioning of his tracheotomy, providing food and drink, 
repositioning in his wheelchair, monitoring his blood pressure and 
responding to the alarms on his ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
	Cedar Rapids school officials said the special help Garret  
requires so he can attend high school is so involved and expensive 
that it should be considered medical treatment. The nation's 
highest court disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	The court acknowledged that the school district ``may have  
legitimate financial concerns'' in providing continuous, one-on-one 
nursing care, but said the court's only role is to interpret what 
the federal law requires. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress intended to open the door of public education to all  
qualified children and required participating states to educate 
handicapped children with non-handicapped children whenever 
possible,'' Stevens wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining him were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices  
Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas dissented.  
</P>
<P>
	Through most of his schooling, Garret has been assisted by a  
licensed practical nurse, paid through an insurance policy and 
money from the $1.3 million settlement with the motorcycle company 
involved in the accident that paralyzed him. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision could subject the school district to more than  
$285,000 in legal fees and nursing costs, although there's little 
agreement between the school district and Garret's mother, Charlene 
Frey, over the costs involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The school district has estimated annual costs at between  
$30,000 and $40,000 in addition to the $10,000 to $12,000 now spent 
to provide Garret with a teacher associate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Freys' lawyer has called those estimates inflated, saying a  
registered nurse could combine both the health and the teacher 
associate duties, costing the school district a total of about 
$18,000 a year.

<HEADLINE> Fraga OK'd As Brazil Central Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Arminio Fraga passed his final hurdle  
toward becoming Brazil's new central banker Wednesday as the Senate 
approved his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazilians have high hopes that the market-savvy economist and  
former disciple of financier George Soros can turn around the 
country's struggling economy. Brazil's currency, the real, has 
tumbled 45 percent since the government allowed it to float freely 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga has proposed high interest rates to protect the real, but  
many oppose those measures and say they are worsening the country's 
recession. Fraga was scheduled to lead a meeting Thursday to set 
interest rates, which currently stand at 39 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Brazilians are frustrated at the apparent lack of progress  
at fixing the country's battered economy. Talks with the 
International Monetary Fund on an agreement for a $41.5 billion 
loan package have dragged on longer than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Fraga's appointment, Brazil's currency rose late  
Wednesday. The real closed at 2.14 to the dollar, after slipping to 
2.20 earlier in the day. It had closed Tuesday at 2.17. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to stop the currency's recent slide, the government on  
Tuesday raised the amount of money banks are required to deposit 
with the Central Bank. The idea is to remove about 6 billion reals, 
or $2.7 billion, from circulation and reduce the demand for 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts say the measure is too timid. They estimate there  
is between $11.4 billion and $13.6 billion worth of reals in 
circulation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Democrats Proclaim Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton stood Wednesday with  
Democratic lawmakers who stood with him during impeachment and said 
``We are organized and we are united'' as the Republican-controlled 
Congress gets down to business. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Democratic leaders pledged  
support for a ``Families First'' agenda of protecting Social 
Security and Medicare, improving education and health care and 
raising the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	But as much as trumpeting their proposals -- most of which  
Clinton highlighted in his State of the Union address in January -- 
party officials sought to project an image of unity at a time when 
Republicans are still struggling to formulate detailed legislative 
plans of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was the first of its kind since Clinton's impeachment  
and trial, and coincidentally came on the day that Monica 
Lewinsky's televised interview was airing on ABC. Neither she nor 
the scandal was mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was greeted warmly by House Democratic leader Dick  
Gephardt of Missouri, Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South 
Dakota and others who recently had been sharply condemning his 
behavior with Ms. Lewinsky and seeking his formal censure rather 
than impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	And onetime rivals Gore and Gephardt embraced in a public  
display of unity -- the vice president running for president in 
2000, the other forsaking a White House campaign in hopes of 
leading Democrats back into the majority in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called for a ``new energy'' in Congress this year and  
urged Democrats to look beyond what seems at times ``to be 
excessive partisanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president welcomed Republican agreement to his proposal to  
set aside 62 percent of the budget surplus to help buttress Social 
Security and urged the GOP anew to set aside an additional 15 
percent for Medicare. ``They have not done that so far,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once those two steps are agreed on, he said, ``we can have an  
honest and principled disagreement about how much and what kind of 
tax cut we need with the rest, about how much should go to 
education, how much should go to defense, how much should go to 
medical research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Lewinsky interview was airing, Clinton was returning  
from a $2 million fund-raiser for Sen. Robert Torricelli, R-N.J., 
in Newark, where he urged supporters to push an activist agenda in 
the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``The easy thing to do when things are going well is to relax,  
maybe even go back to the old ways,'' Clinton said. ``I have to 
tell you I think that would be a terrible mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are in the enviable position of having a program  
crafted, at the same time Republicans are still working to put 
together a budget for the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, kicked off a campaign for  
tax relief during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I disagree with pollsters and pundits who say Americans don't  
care about tax relief,'' he said. ``If they spend a minute outside 
of Washington, their eyes will be opened to the enormous tax burden 
on real people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Republicans have yet to agree on what type of  
tax relief to push for. Earlier enthusiasm for a 10 percent across 
the board cut has waned, in favor of targeted reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from Medicare and Social Security, Democrats declared  
their support for several education proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	These include federal tax credits to modernize schools; money to  
reach the goal of hiring 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size 
and money for after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Democrats favor tax cuts for long-term care and  
child care and, in one of the more controversial proposals in his 
budget, the president recommended the government invest a portion 
of the surplus in the stock market to provide individuals with 
retirement accounts beyond Social Security.

<HEADLINE> Jury Gets Cable Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Jurors today began weighing the fate  
of a Marine pilot charged with involuntary manslaughter for flying 
his jet into an Italian ski lift cable, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight Marine officers closeted themselves shortly after 2  
p.m. following summations by prosecutors and defense lawyers that 
lasted nearly four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement, prosecutor Maj. Daniel Daugherty described  
Capt. Richard Ashby as ``outright dangerous,'' but Ashby's lawyer 
countered that it was an accident ``and nothing more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When he violated all these things and didn't know local rules  
and regulations, people died and a $60 million aircraft is in 
ruins,'' Daugherty said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason the accused is guilty ... is he was too low, he was  
too fast, he was too aggressive. He was outright dangerous,'' 
Daugherty said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his closing statement, defense attorney Frank Spinner posed  
the question of whether the tragedy was ``a training accident or 
was it something more?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a training accident and nothing more,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Testimony in Ashby's manslaughter trial began Feb. 8 and ended  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was at the controls of an  
EA-6B Prowler jet on Feb. 3, 1998, when it struck the Mount Cermis 
gondola cable near Cavalese, Italy. He is charged with involuntary 
manslaughter and other counts and could get 206 years in prison if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	In his summation, Daugherty said the safe conduct of the flight  
depended on Ashby's decisions, but he made bad choices -- flying the 
jet above the 517 mph restriction for the low-level training 
mission, and far below the 2,000-foot altitude limit. Ashby's jet 
hit the cable 370 feet above the valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Daugherty argued that Ashby should have known he was flying too  
low and too fast by merely looking around. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have the roads, the cars, the houses, the humanity of it  
all. Captain Ashby ignores it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner said a number of factors converged as Ashby flew the jet  
down the alpine valley -- the ground rose 150 feet, the altimeter 
malfunctioned and an optical illusion made Ashby believe he was 
flying higher than he really was. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't avoid what you can't see,'' he said. ``This was a  
trap. This was an accident waiting to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby testified earlier he didn't know about the mission's speed  
limit and thought the altitude restriction was 1,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Daugherty said that to hide evidence of their recklessness it  
appeared Ashby and his navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 
destroyed a videotape on which Schweitzer had filmed the early 
portions of the flight. The tape has never been located. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby testified earlier that he took the tape to his quarters,  
where Schweitzer picked it up. Ashby never saw it again, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The simple conclusion you can draw is that tape and video  
camera had nothing to do with the accident,'' Spinner told jurors 
today. ``It was a private tape; it wasn't a government tape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree the gondola cable wasn't marked on the map  
Ashby was issued by the Air Force. Ashby testified last week that 
he didn't know of the ski lift and that he didn't see the cable 
until the last second. 
</P>
<P>
	``Negligence is knowing the cable is there and flying as if it  
is not. ... Negligence is not the occurrence of normal deviations 
in flight,'' Spinner said. ``It would have been negligence if that 
aerial cableway was on their map and they ignored it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a brief recess after closing arguments, Vera Eyskens,  
whose daughter Rose Marie Eyskens of Kalmthout, Belgium, died in 
the accident, embraced Daugherty. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened on the final leg of a 42-minute training  
route through the Italian Alps. Europeans were outraged, and 
Italians demanded that U.S. landing rights be revoked at bases in 
their country. 
</P>
<P>

Jeff Edwards, an investigator who worked for the defense team.

of political pressure that went as high as the White House.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Postpones Vote on Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee abruptly postponed plans to  
vote on the year's first spending bill after Republican leaders 
ordered members Wednesday to find savings to pay for the emergency 
$1.2 billion measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee had planned to vote Thursday  
on the legislation, which has money to help hurricane-ravaged 
Central America, aid struggling U.S. farmers and bolster Jordan 
after King Hussein's death. The funding was requested by President 
Clinton, who wants to use this year's expected budget surplus to 
pay for most of it. 
</P>
<P>
	But House leaders, eager to show they are more fiscally  
responsible than Clinton, decided against spending part of the 
surplus in their very first spending measure of the year -- 
especially for a bill dominated by foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a general feeling we ought to find offsets'' to pay  
for the bill, said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, in a 
brief interview. ``It's been a thing we've done'' for emergency 
domestic spending in recent years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The leadership acted after GOP fiscal conservatives complained  
that the measure should be paid for -- especially because this 
year's expected $109 billion budget surplus comes entirely from 
Social Security trust fund surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we spend money, we won't steal it out of Social Security,  
and that's the first case out of the box,'' said conservative Rep. 
Tom Coburn, R-Okla., who had insisted on finding savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,  
plans to push a similar bill through his panel Thursday. He has 
said his measure will contain enough savings to pay for itself, 
putting added pressure on House leaders to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Appropriations panel aides said they already had planned to trim  
defense and foreign aid funds to pay for the $100 million in aid to 
Jordan. But now, they are also hunting for savings to offset $956 
million for Central America and $152 million for American farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Morra, spokeswoman for House Appropriations Committee  
Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., said the panel might vote on the 
measure next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the money is to help Honduras, Nicaragua, El  
Salvador and Costa Rica recover from Hurricane Mitch. The October 
storm, considered the worst natural disaster in the Western 
Hemisphere, killed more than 9,000 people, left more than 3 million 
homeless and destroyed more than $8.5 billion worth of property. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton travels to Central America to view recovery efforts on  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agriculture aid is to help U.S. farmers facing a weak export  
market caused largely by Asia's economic problems.

<HEADLINE> White House May Help in IOC Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee's top official  
sought White House help today in cleaning up the bribery scandal 
from Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC President Bill Hybl, in a letter to President Clinton,  
asked the administration to bring the International Olympic 
Committee, which picks the host cities, under coverage of the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The law prohibits bribing of foreign 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move would represent an important step in ridding the  
Olympics of the ``global crisis'' resulting from the disclosure 
that Salt Lake's bidders paid more than $1.2 million in trying to 
secure the winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``To do any less would mean facing a future that might include  
the loss of the games and noble ideals they profess,'' Hybl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl, who called USOC oversight of Salt Lake's bidders  
``abysmal,'' and Dick Schultz, USOC's executive director, pledged 
that such vote-buying would not recur. 
</P>
<P>
	They also outlined reforms for the organization, including a ban  
on bid-city assistance funds for IOC members and foreign athletes, 
and stricter USOC controls over U.S. cities bidding for the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC will increase participation by Olympic-level athletes  
in its decision-making and place a permanent staff member in Salt 
Lake to oversee organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendations were among a series of proposals Monday from  
an ethics panel, led by former Senate Majority Leader George 
Mitchell, that found the IOC had fostered ``this mess'' by 
accepting increasingly lavish gifts from communities trying to land 
the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The two USOC officials, in a telephone call early Wednesday,  
told IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch about the USOC's changes 
and the White House request. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pleased we would call and tell him what we were going  
to do,'' Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC leaders said they would wait for the IOC to carry out its  
own promised reforms at a special general assembly March 17-18 in 
Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled, and at least 19  
more remain under investigation. The IOC had 115 members before the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Two former Olympic stars from the United States said the IOC had  
to continue to move quickly and forcefully. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Marine Cable Car Case Nears End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The government's case against a Marine  
pilot whose jet severed an Italian gondola cable and killed 20 
people during a low-altitude training mission is heading to a 
military jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony that began Feb. 8 ended Tuesday in the manslaughter  
trial of Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif. After 
closing arguments from attorneys and instructions from the judge, 
the eight-man military jury was expected to begin deliberations 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was at the controls of an EA-6B Prowler jet on Feb. 3,  
1998, when it struck the Mount Cermis gondola cable near Cavalese, 
Italy. He is charged with involuntary manslaughter and other counts 
and could get 206 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't recall in 20 years of investigating accidents any  
pilot being held criminally responsible for an accident,'' said 
Jeff Edwards, an investigator who worked for the defense team. ``I 
believe he's very worried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mishap happened on the final leg of a 42-minute training  
route through the Italian Alps. Europeans were outraged over the 
accident, and Italians demanded that U.S. landing rights be revoked 
at bases in their country. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Ashby intentionally flew too low and too  
fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers have suggested the aviators were charged because  
of political pressure that went as high as the White House. They 
also said Ashby's jet had a malfunctioning radar altimeter, that he 
may have been victim of an optical illusion that exaggerated his 
altitude and that his superiors didn't provide up-to-date 
information on speed and altitude limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree the gondola cable wasn't marked on the map  
Ashby was issued by the Air Force. Ashby testified last week that 
he didn't know of the ski lift and that he didn't see the cable 
until the last second. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, faces similar  
charges and a separate court-martial. Charges against the other two 
crewmen were dismissed.

<HEADLINE> New York Is Heart Attack Captial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	If you can make it in New York, maybe you really can survive  
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	A researcher at the University of California at San Diego says  
people visiting New York City are 34 percent more likely to die of 
a heart attack than if they'd visited another town. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being in New York may be good for the rest of you, but leave  
your heart in San Francisco,'' said psychologist Nicholas 
Christenfeld, who is to present his findings Friday at a meeting of 
the Society for Behavioral Medicine in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven million New Yorkers aren't immune, either. Big Apple  
dwellers are 55 percent more likely to die of a heart attack than 
people living in other U.S. cities, Christenfeld said. When they 
leave the hustle and bustle of the city, the risk drops 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fran Reiter, president and chief executive of the New York  
Convention and Visitors Bureau, called the study silly and offered 
Christenfeld this characteristic New York advice: ``Get a life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christenfeld based his conclusions on 20 million U.S. death  
certificates from 1985 to 1994, focusing on heart attack 
fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
	He studied New Yorkers who died in the city; non-New Yorkers who  
died while visiting the city; and New Yorkers who died while 
traveling out of the city. About 44,000 tourists and the same 
number of New Yorkers died of heart attacks during the decade 
examined. 
</P>
<P>
	He compared the heart attack deaths against those in other  
states and ruled out other possible explanations, including age, 
sex and race. 
</P>
<P>
	Christenfeld made similar analyses for residents and visitors to  
the country's 10 other largest cities: Los Angeles, Chicago, 
Houston, Philadelphia, San Diego, Dallas, Phoenix, Detroit, San 
Antonio and San Jose. Typically, visitors to those cities had about 
a 1 percent higher rate of coronary deaths, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the findings do not identify what it is about New York  
that leads to the increased risk, Christenfeld says stress is the 
likely factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``New York gives you the full experience -- stress, excitement,  
pressure, density,'' he said. ``This won't cause a heart attack in 
a healthy young person, but if you're at high risk and teetering on 
the edge of a heart attack, it could push you over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Richard Stein, a spokesman for American Heart Association,  
questioned the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The researchers suggested that New Yorkers live in a more  
stressful environment, but there's nothing in the data that 
indicates that this is stress,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 400 or 500 possible explanations for this. And if it  
is stress, you certainly wouldn't want to move. Moving is one of 
the most stressful things you can do in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results came as no surprise to Sue Schonman, a broker who  
has been commuting to New York from Stirling, N.J., for the past 
nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to do this every day!'' she said, pressing through the  
crowds to catch a train. ``You have to endure a three hour commute 
here just to have a life. Years of this really take it out of 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ward Casscells of the University of Texas-Houston Medical  
School said the study was ingenious for examining a transient risk, 
not long-term factors like smoking or poor diets. 
</P>
<P>
	He said business and pleasure travelers to New York engage in  
activities which increase their risk temporarily -- lugging around 
heavy suitcases, eating fatty meals, rushing to appointments, 
active evenings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a heart-stopping city,'' he said. ``It's going to  
stimulate you, maybe to death.''

<HEADLINE> Amway Plans New Web site in Sept. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amway may be venturing into the faceless world  
of the Internet, but the direct-selling giant will still depend on 
real people to promote its business online. 
</P>
<P>
	Amway, known for its cheery salespeople who sell household goods  
to friends in their living rooms, announced today that it will 
launch a new Web site, Quixtar.com, in September. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest move by direct sellers to broaden the way they  
pitch their products. Avon has begun opening retail stores. Last 
month Tupperware announced it would offer its food storage products 
online by the end of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going door-to-door, to people's homes, is more difficult today  
than ever before. More people just don't have time,'' said David 
Rush, who works at the retail consulting firm Kurt Salmon 
Associates in Atlanta. ``The Internet is a way to knock on 
someone's door or have them knock on your door when they have 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amway's move online isn't a reach for the Ada, Mich.-based  
company. It has already solved one of the biggest challenges faced 
by Internet retailers -- it has an established distribution network 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also has a built-in promotional staff -- its army of  
3 million eager sales representatives, who have already started 
touting the new Web site to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Amway already operates an Amway.com site as a promotional  
vehicle. It decided against using its own name for the new site 
because it plans to sell thousands of goods and services from other 
companies. Quixtar.com will also be filled with familiar Amway 
names, such as Nutrilite vitamins and SA8 laundry detergent. 
</P>
<P>
	This new sales approach is a big change for Amway. Founded in  
1959, the company has long prided itself on its network of 
representatives using face-to-face meetings -- whether at a 
neighbor's house or at the local coffee shop -- to woo business. 
</P>
<P>
	Amway's salespeople are known for their almost evangelical  
spirit, but the company says they won't lose commissions to the Web 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Salespeople will sign up their customers to become ``members''  
of Quixtar.com, which will allow them to order goods online, some 
at discounted prices. The salespeople will get a commission from 
those orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Salespeople will continue to encourage their customers to become  
Amway representatives themselves and will continue to get a 
percentage of the commissions earned by their recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also hopes the Web site will broaden its reach.  
Anyone, regardless if they are a member or not, can purchase goods 
on Quixtar.com. The profits from such sales will be randomly 
assigned to Amway representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Amway's move online comes as the company looks for new avenues  
of growth. Its representatives' pep rallies and motivation meetings 
haven't helped boost business in the last year, especially in 
financially strapped Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Amway's sales for the year ended in August 1998 fell 18 percent  
to $5.7 billion. About 70 percent of Amway's operations take place 
outside North America. Amway, which is privately held, doesn't 
disclose profits.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky May Face McDougal Subpoena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whitewater figure Susan McDougal's lawyers are  
weighing whether to subpoena Monica Lewinsky and another figure 
from the impeachment drama to testify at her upcoming trial on 
charges of obstructing the Whitewater investigation, sources 
familiar with her case say. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move would likely draw public interest to Mrs. McDougal's  
trial, set to begin next week in Little Rock, Ark., but the sources 
said they expected the trial judge would have to rule on the 
controversial idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said Mrs.  
McDougal's defense team is discussing whether to subpoena Ms. 
Lewinsky and Julie Hiatt Steele to testify about their experiences 
with prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Both women have criticized the 
tactics of the independent counsel investigating President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, a former business partner of Clinton and his  
wife, Hillary, is to be tried in federal court on criminal contempt 
and obstruction of justice charges for refusing to cooperate with 
Starr in the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said subpoenas have not yet been requested from U.S.  
District Judge George Howard Jr., who is overseeing the trial, but 
that Starr's office was aware of the defense team's idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Independent Counsel Jackie Bennett said Tuesday he could  
not comment on the matter. Attorney Mark Geragos, who represents 
Mrs. McDougal, also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Summoning Ms. Lewinsky could transform Mrs. McDougal's trial  
from a sideshow in the long-running Whitewater investigation to a 
major event. Mrs. McDougal's lawyers probably would have to show 
that Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Steele have testimony directly relevant 
to the alleged offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, who along with her late ex-husband, James, formed  
the Whitewater land venture with the Clintons, is charged with 
defying a judge's order and refusing to answer Starr's questions 
before a federal grand jury investigating Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal has repeatedly said she refused to answer Starr's  
questions because she did not trust the prosecutor, a Republican, 
and believes Starr has waged a vendetta against the Clintons. She 
has said she believed Starr would prosecute her if she failed to 
deliver damaging evidence against the Clintons, adding that she 
knows of no illegal acts by the first family. 
</P>
<P>
	But her former husband, a longtime Clinton supporter who  
defended the first family for years, reversed course a year and a 
half before his death and testified that the president and first 
lady were involved in wrongdoing in their Arkansas business 
dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said Mrs. McDougal's legal team would like to use  
testimony from Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Steele to argue that their 
experiences bore out their client's fears about cooperating with 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky has alleged that Starr's prosecutors, during their  
initial encounter with her, threatened her with prosecution if she 
refused to cooperate against the president, kept her at a hotel for 
hours and urged her not to call her lawyer. Ms. Lewinsky also 
alleges they urged her to wear a body wire to try to implicate 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of tortuous negotiations, the former White House  
intern struck a deal to cooperate with Starr in exchange for 
immunity from prosecution, but she harbors bitterness toward him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele was charged earlier this year with three counts of  
obstruction of justice and one of making a false statement for 
providing testimony that cast doubt on her former friend Kathleen 
Willey's allegation that Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr alleged he has evidence showing Ms. Steele made up her  
account.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Sues 10 Firms for Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. expanded its national crackdown  
against software piracy by filing separate federal lawsuits against 
10 Chicago-area companies, accusing them of selling counterfeit 
Windows software to consumers and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The software giant, based in Redmond, Wash., has filed hundreds  
of similar lawsuits against companies in other states in recent 
years, but the latest actions were its first in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft seeks an injunction to stop the alleged practice, as  
well as damages. Microsoft attorney Nancy Anderson said Tuesday the 
10 companies continued to sell pirated copies of Microsoft products 
despite its repeated warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies named in the suits filed Monday are: Advanced  
Computer Systems, Computer Marketing Technology, Computer Plus, EOS 
Technologies, FosTec Computers, Lion Computer, Logical Choice 
Computers, Risk Free Disks, United Comtec and Worldwide PC Source. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the companies are accused of distributing counterfeit  
copies of software, including Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows 
NT. Two of the companies are accused of installing pirated software 
in computers and selling them to customers.

<HEADLINE> Cargo Ship Runs Aground Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YACHATS, Ore. (AP) -- The bow section of a burned and broken  
cargo ship ran aground again today after a storm ripped the 
oil-laden hulk free from the tug that was towing it out to sea for 
burial in deep water. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's back on the beach,'' said Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Mathew  
Brewer. ``We're going to go out and try to reconnect with her and 
take her back out before it hardens back in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The broken-off bow of the New Carissa ship was mired in the sand  
several hundred yards off a rocky stretch of coast between Waldport 
and Yachats. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of the grounding, sticky tar balls began showing up  
on the beach, apparently from the bow's tanks that are still 
holding up to 130,000 gallons of heavy bunker fuel. Booms were 
being set up at nearby Alsea Bay to protect the environmentally 
fragile estuary where the Alsea River flows into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Huge storm swells were delaying efforts to bring in another tug  
and there was no estimate when another salvage operation might take 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	The tug Sea Victory had laboriously dragged the bow section off  
the coast where it first ran aground, about 60 miles south of the 
spot where it ran aground again today. The tug had made it 50 miles 
to sea when its 10-inch-diameter tow line snapped in Tuesday 
evening's storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to keep up with the broken bow as wind and waves carried  
it back to shore, the tug lost sight of it during the night. 
</P>
<P>
	As the bow drifted toward the coast, cleanup crews as far north  
as Newport, about 100 miles southwest of Portland, got ready for 
the threat that a second grounding could spill the 130,000 gallons 
of thick, gooey oil still carried in the bow's fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	Stormy seas carried the 640-foot New Carissa aground Feb. 4  
while the ship waited to enter Coos Bay to pick up a load of wood 
chips. Stuck in the pounding surf, it eventually started leaking 
some of the 400,000 gallons of oil it carried as fuel for its 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Demolition crews were able to burn off some of the ship's oil,  
but the ship broke in two, spilling 70,000 gallons. At least 48 
birds have died from exposure to oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to tow the bow section out to sea started Friday. The  
tug slowly hauled the hulk through two coastal sandbars before 
pulling it out to open water Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Milwee, salvage consultant to the ship's Japanese owners,  
said $10 million has been spent to date on the operation, with much 
more to come. The cost is being born by the ship's insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oregon Division of State Lands will likely lead an  
environmental assessment of options for what to do with the 
220-foot stern section, still stuck on the beach near Coos Bay.

<HEADLINE> Fishermen Sue To Protect Steelhead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) -- Sport fishermen and environmentalists  
sued Wednesday to force the federal government to list southern 
Oregon and Northern California steelhead as a threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco  
against the National Marine Fisheries Service closely parallels one 
in Portland that forced the agency to list coho salmon in coastal 
Oregon as a threatened species last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund filed the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	Just as they had with coho salmon, the fisheries service  
initially recommended steelhead in the Klamath Mountains Province 
and the Northern California unit merited protection under the 
Endangered Species Act. As with coho, the agency decided to hold 
off the listing because of state efforts initiated by Oregon Gov. 
John Kitzhaber and followed to a lesser degree by California. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oregon Salmon Plan emphasized voluntary efforts by private  
landowners to restore and protect spawning habitat, a sharp 
departure from the Endangered Species Act, which imposes penalties 
for destroying habitat and protected species. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Endangered Species Act does not permit the federal  
government to make a decision not to list a species on the grounds 
that there are state conservation efforts in effect when those 
state conservation efforts are voluntary or unimplemented,'' said 
Mike Sherwood, an attorney for the Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisheries Service spokesman Brian Gorman said the coho reversal  
and the latest lawsuit did not change the agency's feeling that the 
Oregon Salmon Plan represents a better way to save species from 
extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're convinced this approach of getting grassroots support  
through conservation plans is the right way to go,'' Gorman said. 
``It appears to be working in some areas of Oregon.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Threatens To Veto Bank Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton threatened to veto financial  
overhaul legislation proposed by Senate Banking Committee Chairman 
Phil Gramm, saying it fails to fully protect consumers and would 
hurt community lending laws. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on Wednesday  
expressed the administration's ``strong support'' for a bipartisan 
compromise bill in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration supports in principle legislation to  
lift the Depression-era barriers between banks, securities firms 
and insurance companies. But the White House has threatened to veto 
several versions in recent years that took an approach it rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal drafted by Gramm, R-Texas, is more in line with the  
views of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan than those of the 
administration. The bill calls for most new financial activities to 
be conducted by affiliated companies within bank holding companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Gramm, Clinton said his proposal would  
``undermine the effectiveness of the Community Reinvestment Act 
..., a law that has helped to build homes, create jobs and restore 
hope in communities across America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton wrote, the bill would ``provide inadequate  
consumer protection.'' His letter, dated Tuesday and released 
Wednesday, did not elaborate on that point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will veto the bill if it is presented to me in its current  
form,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm, in response, insisted that his proposal would not weaken  
the community investment law that banks must follow, but would 
``restore its integrity.'' The 1977 law requires banks and thrifts 
to lend to the poor and minorities in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's opposition to the law led him to block financial  
overhaul legislation in the Senate's waning days last fall. The 
legislation had earlier squeaked through the House by one vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his new proposal, banks would not have to get a  
satisfactory community-lending rating from the government to set up 
holding companies to conduct new financial activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Financial services modernization is of such overriding  
importance to the national economy that President Clinton will be 
compelled to sign'' the bill, Gramm said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves came a day before Gramm's Senate banking panel and the  
House Banking Committee were to vote on amendments to two separate 
financial overhaul bills. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Banking Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa,  
and Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the panel's senior Democrat, on 
Monday unveiled a bipartisan compromise bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the lawmakers Wednesday, Rubin expressed the  
administration's ``strong support.'' The Treasury chief said the 
bill ``would benefit consumers, businesses and communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the House and Senate bills would create huge financial  
``supermarkets,'' offering consumers checking accounts, mutual 
funds, insurance policies and much more. Ralph Nader and other 
consumer advocates have expressed concern that the legislation, by 
allowing banks, brokerage firms and insurers to merge and get more 
deeply into each other's businesses, could bring a dangerous 
concentration of economic power in fewer hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills before Congress have been ``cobbled together from wish  
lists of the various industry groups,'' Nader told reporters 
Wednesday. ``In the process, the rights of consumers have been 
trampled or, more often, ignored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, Nader cited the previous deletion from the House  
bill of a provision that would have required banks to offer 
low-cost, ``no frills'' checking accounts for low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, led by the Treasury Department, and  
Greenspan's Federal Reserve have long been at odds over how an 
overhaul of the financial services laws should be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration wants to let banks diversify through  
subsidiaries of the bank itself, not just through affiliates within 
the same parent holding company. That arrangement would increase 
the power of the Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency, regulator of nationally chartered banks. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the battle, bills letting banks into other  
kinds of financial activities through a holding company structure 
would expand the independent Fed's role in regulating financial 
services industries.

<HEADLINE> Museum Is Treasure House of Dross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- What's all mixed-up and odd, weird and sad? Ask  
the people at ``The Museum of ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of what? The folks running London's newest museum, at The  
Bargehouse on South Bank, aren't yet sure. But they do know one 
thing: Throw anything away, even if it's only a candy wrapper, and 
someone will love it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Museum of ... is exploring its future in a series of  
temporary guises. Over 20 months, it will be The Museum of Me, The 
Museum of Emotions, The Museum of the Unknown or The Museum of the 
River Thames. 
</P>
<P>
	At the moment, this warehouse relic of wharves long gone is  
operating as The Museum of Collectors. 
</P>
<P>
	But whatever it's called, there are no masterpieces here.  
</P>
<P>
	Instead, visitors will find a wall of drink cans, plastic bags  
hanging on a stairway, and the entire floor of one room covered in 
Kinder Surprise toys -- those little playthings collected from 
hollow chocolate eggs by Jayne Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fascinated by not knowing what's inside,'' Ms. Jordan  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Rawley contributed a tree branch stuck through a wire  
fence, though the rest of the tree had been removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cut out that bit of fence -- you can call me a vandal or a  
liberator -- and collected the result,'' he says. It makes him think 
about the divide between nature and culture, and ``reminds me of 
the boundaries society places on the individual,'' he explains. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Weedon, a collector of plastic trolls, aspires to no such  
philosophical heights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I began rescuing trolls when I couldn't bear to see them  
rejected by children,'' she says. ``They are great company so long 
as they don't all talk at once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Michael Harrison's Dolly Parton memorabilia includes the  
item supreme, in a glass case with a note signed by the lady 
herself: ``This is a piece of carpet taken from my Music Room when 
I redecorated our home in Nashville, Tenn., in 1989.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Persephone Watkins, an assistant at the museum, says that when  
she first heard about the collection, she thought Harrison must be 
deranged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now,'' she says, ``I love it.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Bargehouse is an old warehouse that was turned into an arts  
center by Coin Street Community Builders, local people who won a 
fierce campaign a decade ago to save their historic district close 
to William Shakespeare's Globe theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors who sign the museum's guest book are asked, ``What  
museum do you wish existed?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among their answers: coat hangers, graffiti, ice, obsessions and  
compulsions, coal mines, industrial accidents, anything with 
gelatin in it, and ``things that never work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the entrance are scores of little paper bags, all signed  
and dated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to create our own collection, so when we opened in  
November, we asked everyone who came in to leave us something,'' 
says Louise King, the museum's communications manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Contributions include a shopping list, a lighter, a receipt from  
a Chinese restaurant, German postage stamps, bus and train tickets, 
``my name cut out of a newspaper,'' a disposable razor, a 
testosterone skin patch and ``my hair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's interesting to see what's private and personal,'' Ms.  
Watkins says. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-pound note someone left, worth about $33, ``didn't stay  
long, I'm sorry to say.''

<HEADLINE> Allstate, Money Manager Make Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Allstate Corp., the nation's largest publicly  
traded auto and home insurer, announced Wednesday it has formed a 
joint venture with a money management firm to sell stock-linked 
retirement saving plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northbrook, Ill.-based insurer, in partnership with  
Boston-based Putnam Investments, plans to begin selling in May 
variable annuities, a combination of mutual funds and insurance 
policies that has become increasingly popular with Americans as a 
retirement plan option. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in variable annuities has soared in the past five years  
because they let people make tax-deferred investments in the stock 
market, providing income to the buyer until death. U.S. variable 
annuity assets exceeded $700 billion at the end of last year and 
sales for the year totaled $100 billion, Allstate said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the U.S. population getting older and living longer,  
variable annuities are an increasingly attractive popular 
retirement savings tool,'' said Louis G. Lower, chairman and chief 
executive of Allstate's life insurance subsidiary, which accounted 
last year for 20 percent of the company's profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Putnam's portfolio managers will oversee the mutual fund  
investments, and Allstate will manage the insurance assets. The 
products will be distributed, via Putnam's wholesaling force, 
through its partnerships with banks, broker-dealers and financial 
advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership represents a shift for Allstate away from its  
current system of selling mainly life and property-casualty 
coverage through its 15,000 agents, a core business that in recent 
years has seen slowing growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate chairman Edward Liddy said the joint venture, which has  
few startup costs, is just one step among several that may be taken 
to boost the company's bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal really is to expand our company, to get into other  
channels of distribution ... and to acquire more customers,'' Liddy 
said. ``That doesn't preclude (acquisitions) on the 
property-casualty side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts applauded the deal, saying it represents opportunity  
for Allstate to see substantial improvement in its income. Still, 
Wall Street had been expecting Allstate to make a large acquisition 
in its home and auto insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock fell $1.81 1/4 a share, or 4.6 percent, to  
$37.06 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange amid a broad retreat tied in 
part to concern about the potential for higher interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Davidson Deal To Buy Team Finalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- William Davidson has taken on the monumental  
task of rebuilding the Tampa Bay Lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of the NBA's Detroit Pistons finalized his purchase of  
the Lightning and the lease for Tampa's Ice Palace on Wednesday, 
reportedly for around $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main attraction was the arena, probably even more than the  
hockey team,'' Davidson during a news conference at the Ice Palace 
on Wednesday. ``I've been a longtime hockey fan. The hockey we like 
... I won't say we love it yet, but that remains for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pending approval from the NHL Board of Governors, Davidson will  
take over a struggling Tampa Bay franchise that is headed for the 
NHL's worst record for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson is acquiring the team from Art Williams, who had bought  
the franchise last May for $117 million. Williams estimates he will 
loss $20 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is with mixed feelings we have decided to sell the Tampa  
Bay Lightning,'' Williams said in a statement. ``Certainly, we 
didn't do all that we set out to do. I believe we left the 
franchise in better shape than we found it a year ago and I'm proud 
of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lightning are also struggling at the gate, with an  
attendance average of 10,802, 55 percent of capacity at the 
19,758-seat Ice Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	``The building was a key in the equation, but at the end of the  
day it starts with your sports team,'' said Tom Wilson, the point 
man for Davidson in the transaction. ``We realize that hockey today 
is a dangerous investment. Energies, efforts and focus are going 
into the hockey team. We may have a great, very successful arena, 
but at the end of the day if the team is doing well, everybody 
looks favorable on us. If the team is struggling, then it seems 
like we're all struggling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams entered into a purchase agreement for the debt-ridden  
team from the Japanese-based Kokusai Green on May 18, 1998. The NHL 
Board of Governors approved the deal on June 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson appeared to be the frontrunner to obtain the Lightning  
last year before Williams' successful bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill (Davidson) has taken companies that were struggling and  
turned them around. That's our goal here,'' Wilson said. ``We think 
it's a tremendous opportunity for us. We hope its a tremendous 
opprtunity for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson is the principal owner of Palace Sports and  
Entertainment Inc. and the managing partner of the Pistons. The 
organization also owns the Palace of Auburn Hills, the WNBA's 
Detroit Shock and the International Hockey League's Detroit Vipers. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson plans on completing the current season before deciding  
if there will be any changes involving key Lightning management 
officials, including coach-general manager Jacques Demers, 
assistant general manager Jay Feaster and senior advisor to the 
general manager Cliff Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Mr. Davidson is saying is, this is a business and we're  
going to be run like a business,'' Demers said. ``There is no 
insurance. What I heard today is they're going to build. What I 
heard was positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal also includes control of six acres of land located near  
the Ice Palace.

<HEADLINE> Mich. QB Spends Break With Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Like a lot of college kids, Drew Henson is in  
Florida for spring break. Only he's not sunning on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan's backup quarterback is working out with other New York  
Yankees rookies. 
</P>
<P>
	No, this isn't a glorified fantasy camp. Henson just happens to  
excel at two sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like competition,'' Henson said Wednesday after a workout in  
the batting cages beneath Legends Field. ``To me, there is nothing 
quite like the competition between a pitcher and a batter. It's one 
on one. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I like hitting home runs. There's no other feeling in all  
of sports like the home run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henson signed a five-year deal worth $2 million with the Yankees  
in July after they made him a third-round draft pick. He hit .316 
in 10 games during a two-week span with the Yankees' rookie team in 
the Gulf Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
	Henson is 6-foot-5 and 225 pounds and plays third base. He's 19  
years old and almost nothing intimidates him. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even lunch with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. That was  
no more stressful than grabbing a pizza with the guys back in Ann 
Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an old football guy,'' Henson said. ``When I was down  
here one other time, my dad and I went to lunch with him. He talked 
about football. I asked him about his role on the `Seinfeld' show. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I like about George Steinbrenner is that he wants to  
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henson will almost certainly make his living playing baseball.  
But he loves football, too. After watching the Wolverines win a 
share of the national championship in 1997, he became fixed on 
leading the school to another title. 
</P>
<P>
	As a freshman, he backed up Tom Brady while the Wolverines went  
10-3, winning a share of the Big Ten championship and defeating 
Arkansas in the Citrus Bowl. For the season, Henson passed for 254 
yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Brady has a year of eligibility left, Henson must win the  
job when spring drills open next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been afraid to compete,'' Henson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Yankees appear content to wait. Scott Brosius  
recently signed a three-year contract. Brosius plays third base. 
Just about the time his contract runs out, Henson will be finished 
with college. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't pressure him,'' Yankees general manager Brian Cashman  
said. ``He'll end up doing what he wants to do. He'll make his 
decision at the end of his collegiate career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Newman, the Yankees' vice president of player development  
and scouting, said Henson could be in the major leagues in less 
than three years -- maybe even sooner -- if he devoted himself just 
to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he has no regrets about agreeing to let Henson pursue his  
football dream. 
</P>
<P>
	``He convinced us that while he loves football, he's passionate  
about baseball,'' Newman said. ``He's an exceptional talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, roving hitting instructor Gary Denbo called out  
situations and Henson was expected to react with his bat. Denbo 
told him to hit an off-speed pitch to right-center field. Henson 
did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has all the qualities we look for in a good young  
hitter,'' Denbo said. ``His eye-hand coordination is outstanding. 
He doesn't mis-hit balls. He also has good bat speed. He has the 
potential for a lot of power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once school is out, Henson will return to Tampa for a few days  
of extended spring training, then report to the Class A team at 
Greensboro, N.C., of the South Atlantic League. He will play 
baseball until two weeks before Michigan opens camp in August, then 
head back home. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, a lot is being expected of Henson, both by Michigan and  
by the Yankees. That kind of pressure might wilt some players. Not 
Henson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, I'm a student at the University of Michigan, and I'm a  
New York Yankee,'' Henson said. ``How much more can any kid want?''

<HEADLINE> New York Readies for First Lady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The would-be constituents in this seen-it-all  
city looked for a clue from the could-be candidate on her first 
visit since the word went out that Hillary Rodham Clinton was 
considering running for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	But press secretary Marsha Berry sought to cast today's visit by  
Mrs. Clinton as just another of many forays into the city by the 
first lady and said disappointment awaited those hoping for a 
blockbuster announcement on whether she would run in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Berry characterized today's rounds as first  
lady-business-as-usual -- a drop-in at a school, a luncheon and a 
private dinner, followed Thursday by a talk to a United Nations 
forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Mrs. Clinton's mere presence was turning the mood  
in indifferent New York giddy, at least in Democratic circles. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has held a commanding lead in the polls over Mayor  
Rudolph Giuliani, a potential but also unannounced Republican rival 
for the seat being vacated by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. A 
recent poll from Quinnipiac College Polling Institute showed her 
with an 18-point lead over Giuliani in a hypothetical race. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinnipiac pollster Maurice Carroll said Mrs. Clinton's visit  
isn't likely to boost her polling numbers because ``they're already 
off the charts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe if she could jump in the East River and rescue a  
drowning baby her numbers might get higher,'' Carroll said. ``I 
can't think how else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But pollster Lee Miringoff, of the Marist College Institute for  
Public Opinion, said a new survey he would unveil today would show 
that Mrs. Clinton's lead over Giuliani narrowing somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	``She needs to transition from celebrity to candidate Clinton,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to deliver an address on arts  
education at Intermediate School 25 in Queens. The Democratic 
National Committee Women's Leadership Forum luncheon was next, 
followed by a private dinner at the home of Roger Altman, a Wall 
Street financier. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, she is to talk at the United Nations about the  
forthcoming International Women's Day before returning to a 
classroom to view an HBO documentary on women and sports at a 
school in the Chelsea district of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's flirtation with the Senate race fueled a run on  
tickets for the fund raiser she is headlining this afternoon at the 
Plaza Hotel. Democratic Party organizers, originally expecting a 
crowd of 500, squeezed in 900 instead because of the intense 
interest. Another 300 people were on a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a confidant, said the  
first lady wanted some time to consider whether to run and hoped 
speculation would cool while she weighed her options. 
</P>
<P>
	But an architect of the drive to draft Mrs. Clinton, Rep.  
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., predicted on Tuesday that her arrival on 
the home turf of her most likely rival would touch off another 
heated round of ``will she, won't she.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever she comes into town it turns up the wattage,'' Rangel  
said. ``This adds even more electricity. ... Anything she attends 
now has political overtones.''

<HEADLINE> Eight Dead in Nigeria After Rioting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- Militants stoned five policemen to death  
and set their station ablaze Wednesday and security forces 
retaliated by firing into crowds as anger over the results of 
Nigeria's presidential election exploded into street battles. 
</P>
<P>
	At least eight people were killed Wednesday in election-related  
violence, witnesses said. Other reports cited up to 14 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence has plagued parts of Lagos since Olusegun Obasanjo won  
Saturday's presidential election. The latest bloodshed apparently 
began when members of a radical anti-government group called Odudua 
attacked a police station near Lagos' working-class neighborhood of 
Moshin. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents said five policemen were beaten and stoned to death  
after being dragged from the station. Later, police fired live 
ammunition and tear gas at crowds in Moshin. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers in riot gear singled out young men in the crowds and  
savagely beat them with whips, rifle butts and pieces of timber. 
Armored vehicles patrolled the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	A young man with a bandaged hand screamed for mercy as laughing  
plainclothes policemen struck him with whips. ``What have I done? 
What have I done?'' he cried. 
</P>
<P>
	A burly police officer nervously aimed an automatic rifle at  
pedestrians who dodged behind market stalls. ``We are keeping the 
peace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frightened young schoolgirls in pink uniforms were caught in the  
middle of the mayhem. They were ordered by the police to run past 
with their hands up to show they were unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagos police commissioner Sunday Aghedo called the post-election  
fighting ``embarrassing, nauseating and disturbing,'' and said 
security forces in the city had been increased to contain the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lagos radio station reported at least 14 people had been  
killed, including eight bystanders hit by stray police bullets. The 
report could not be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people are angry about the elections. But this violence is  
not the answer,'' said Mike Obi, an accountant who saw two 
bystanders killed by stray police bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	The gutted carcasses of six police cars smoldered next to the  
blackened, smoking ruins of the police station. 
</P>
<P>
	Another mob set fire to one floor of a police barracks at  
Oyagbo, 10 miles away. It was unclear whether there were 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Odudua, which wants a separate country for the Yoruba tribe that  
dominates southwestern Nigeria, is also blamed for gasoline-bombing 
two other police stations Monday evening. At least two people -- 
including one policeman -- were killed and four officers were 
seriously injured in those attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The post-election violence has erupted in Lagos strongholds of  
Olu Falae, who lost to Obasanjo, a retired general. The militant 
group Odudua, which supported Falae's unsuccessful presidential 
bid, had threatened violence if Obasanjo won. Falae has disowned 
the threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Frederick Fasheun, a leader of the militant group, distanced his  
followers from the attacks, saying they were committed by former 
members who had created splinter groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Both presidential candidates are Yorubas, but Obasanjo is widely  
disliked in the Yoruba heartland because he was a career military 
officer identified with northern power and served as military ruler 
of Nigeria from 1976 to 1979.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans, Retreat / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated Wednesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade as a two-day rally prompted increased 
farmer selling of ample stored supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers were taking advantage of sharply higher prices seen  
earlier in the week to get rid of crops that have seen little sign 
of increasing in value over the past few months, as weak demand 
walks hand-in-hand with large world supplies. There also was less 
concern about recent hot, dry weather in South America, as 
forecasters predicted beneficial weekend rains in corn and soybean 
growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat retreated on perceptions cool, wet weather in the winter  
wheat belt would benefit young crops by slowing the rapid pace of 
development and providing needed moisture, analysts said. The 
losses were contained, however, by continued underlying strength 
following a rebound in export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans fell under pressure from a worsening currency crunch in  
Brazil, which may lead to increased selling of competing crops 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn followed wheat and soybeans lower.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery fell 3 1/4 cents to $2.60 1/2 a bushel; May  
corn fell 1 cent to $2.14 3/4 a bushel May oats fell 3/4 cent to $1.04 1/2; 
May soybeans fell 3 3/4 to $4.67 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while feeder cattle retreated, lean hogs were lower and 
pork bellies were higher. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle rose .55 cent to 68.25 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle were down .30 cent to 73.10 cents a pound; April lean 
hogs were down .50 cent to 42.55 cents a pound; March pork bellies 
were up .73 cent to 48.50 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Critics Award Spielberg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan'' won  
best picture and Terrence Malick (``The Thin Red Line'') won best 
director honors at the Chicago Film Critics Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg paid homage to movie critic Gene Siskel, who died last  
month. Siskel and TV partner Roger Ebert used the power of 
television for the better ``and have done a remarkable thing for 
the motion pictures,'' Spielberg said in accepting his award 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebert toasted the Spielberg in return, noting that some  
filmmakers appeal to mass audiences while others strive for high 
art, but few achieve both in the same film. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our winner tonight has done that,'' said Ebert.  
</P>
<P>
	British stage veteran Ian McKellen won best actor for his role  
in ``Gods and Monsters,'' an account of the final days of British 
film director James Whale. 
</P>
<P>
	Cate Blanchett won best actress for her portrayal of Queen  
Elizabeth in the film ``Elizabeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Bates won best supporting actress for her role as the  
eccentric political fixer in ``Primary Colors,'' while Billy Bob 
Thornton won best supporting actor for his work in ``A Simple 
Plan.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Currency Plunges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's currency, the sucre, plunged  
Wednesday as traders were unnerved by rumors the government planned 
to seize dollar bank accounts to buy sucres and concern over a huge 
budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	The sucre's value dropped by 17 percent in a wild day of  
trading, closing at 12,000 per dollar. It started the day at 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the sucre has lost 43 percent of its value.  
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank intervened in the money market, buying $5  
million in sucres to bolster the sagging currency and promised to 
buy more sucres if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I make a call to ignore unsubstantiated rumors about a  
possible seizure of foreign currency and other rumors that only 
generate nervousness,'' Central Bank President Luis Jacome told a 
hastily arranged news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago, Ecuador allowed its currency to float to stave  
off speculators from the battered sucre. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were also unappeased by President Jamil Mahuad's  
announcement late Tuesday of economic measures to cut public 
spending and boost tax revenues to cut a giant budget deficit, 
Francisco Cano, a trader at Aserval Bank, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures would limit public servants' salaries to $5,000 a  
month or less, accelerate privatizations and boost revenues through 
tax reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador is embroiled in its worst economic crisis in the past 20  
years due to falling oil prices and $2.6 billion in damage caused 
by the freakish El Nino weather last year. It is running a fiscal 
deficit of $1.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> Test May Cut Colon Cancer Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The death rate from colon cancer, the second  
leading cancer killer in the United States, could be reduced by up 
to a third if more people over 50 started using a simple screening 
test that detects bleeding in the bowel, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published today, Minnesota researchers say that a  
study of the long-term health of 46,000 volunteers shows that 
people who take an annual fecal occult blood test have 33 percent 
fewer deaths from colon cancer than do people who do not take the 
test. Among those who are tested every other year, the death rate 
is reduced by 21 percent, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is published today in the Journal of the National  
Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a positive test for blood, the likelihood of  
finding a growth in the colon is about 35 percent,'' said Dr. John 
H. Bond, the study's co-author. ``About 9 percent will have cancer, 
and the rest will have significant precancerous polyps in the 
colon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An analysis of data from the study in 1993 suggested that annual  
tests could reduce deaths from colon cancer, and a new analysis 
shows that even biennial tests can have a dramatic effect, said 
Bond, a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota and a 
staff physician at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very valuable way to identify people who are healthy  
and have no symptoms, who nevertheless have a developing cancer in 
their colon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results confirm findings from two earlier studies in Europe,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prompted by the research results, federal health agencies on  
Tuesday announced a new campaign to encourage all Americans over 50 
to take the fecal occult blood test. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that we can prevent many deaths from  
colorectal cancer through screening,'' said Surgeon General David 
Satcher. ``If you've celebrated your 50th birthday and have never 
been screened for colorectal cancer, start now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a program that went into effect last year, Medicare now  
pays for the screening, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 129,000 Americans, most past the age of 50, are diagnosed  
each year with colorectal cancer, and about 56,000 die each year. 
It is the second most common cancer killer, just behind lung 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The fecal occult blood test used in the Minnesota research has  
long been a common part of physical examinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a card with small inserts, patients collect specimens for  
the tests at home. Fecal specimens from several bowel movements are 
placed into the insets, and the self-sealing card is then mailed or 
delivered to a doctor's office where a chemical is applied to each 
specimen. If the chemical turns blue, it is evidence of blood. 
</P>
<P>
	If the test is positive, patients then undergo a full colon  
examination with a flexible tube, Bond said. This exam, called a 
colonoscopy, will find any evidence of cancer or of precancerous 
growths called polyps. 
</P>
<P>
	Removing the polyps, performed during the full colon exam, stops  
the growth from becoming cancer in most cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This type of cancer is preceded in 95 percent of the cases by  
slowly growing polyps,'' Bond said. ``By taking out the polyps, one 
can reduce subsequent development of cancer by 90 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fecal blood tests give false positives 65 percent of the  
time, Bond noted. But he said ``that 35 percent (where a growth is 
found) is sufficiently high to warrant the examination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fecal blood test costs about $10, said Bond. The follow-up  
colonoscopy examination can cost several hundred, but he said it is 
``very cost effective'' from a public health viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost of the screening and the follow-up tests is much less  
than finding and treating the cancer later, not only in money, but 
in the pain and suffering of the patients,'' said Bond.

	WHEN A STAR EMPLOYEE FADES: Sometimes even the best employees go  
through a slump and their usually stellar performance slips. 
Management consultant Personnel Decisions International has 
suggestions to help bosses re-energize these workers. First, let 
the employee know in a non-accusing manner that there's been a 
change, and ask the employee how he or she sees the situation. 
Second, try to find out the reasons for the change -- is there a 
problem in the employee's personal life, or is something going on 
at work? Once the problems have been identified, involve the 
employee in finding a solution. And keep in mind that expressing 
appreciation will help motivate him or her. 

</P>
<P>
	THE LOWDOWN ON CHOCOLATE: Many people consider Consumer Reports  
the place to go for information about the best cars, dishwashers, 
table saws, child safety seats and other staples of life. But the 
March issue of the magazine goes off in a more decadent direction -- 
chocolate. High-priced brands like Teuscher and Godiva are compared 
with household names like Hershey and Nestle. And for the most 
part, the pricier treats had the highest ratings. Roberta 
Karpatkin, president of magazine publisher Consumers Union, says 
the testing staff probably enjoyed working on this project more 
than most others. 

</P>
<P>
	PRODUCT PLACEMENT: Did you like that car you saw in a movie, or  
the sofa you saw on that TV show? Chances are that the manufacturer 
paid thousands of dollars to get it there, hoping to elicit exactly 
that response from audiences. Richard Heslin, a Purdue University 
psychology professor, says this practice, known as product 
placement, is an effective form of advertising because, ``when we 
watch a movie or something on television, our defenses are down and 
we become more receptive to the messages that are coming at us.'' 
Manufacturers know that even if you don't see or notice labels or 
brand names when you're watching a movie or TV program, you might 
see the product in a store later and decide to buy it.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Mayor Quits Over Racial Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.C. (AP) -- The mayor of a small North Carolina town  
who said blacks had no capacity for leadership and preferred to 
work for whites has quit following calls for his removal. 
</P>
<P>
	Joffree Leggett, 81, resigned Tuesday as mayor of Trenton, about  
90 miles southeast of Raleigh, a week after a newspaper quoted him 
as saying he and the Town Council did not want blacks to take over 
town government. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just the beginning,'' said Daniel Johnson Willis,  
whose lawsuit challenging Trenton's annexation policy prompted 
Leggett's comments. ``The mayor has helped us trigger what will be 
a major, major change in Trenton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willis, 64, claims the City Council has refused to annex three  
predominantly black areas in order to maintain a white majority in 
its elections. Trenton's voter rolls include 131 whites and 49 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Leggett, who served as mayor for 16 years, told The Free Press  
of Kinston last week that blacks were not ``leaders,'' and that a 
``black man would rather work for a white person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state National Association for the Advancement of Colored  
People called for Leggett's resignation. On Friday, the town 
council did the same, adopting a resolution saying Leggett made 
``reprehensible and derogatory comments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leggett said he doesn't understand the attention his comments  
have drawn. He said he's had enough after getting two death threats 
and dozens of angry calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't do anything wrong,'' he said. ``But I think it's best  
if I get out of here and let somebody else deal with what's 
coming.''

<HEADLINE> Raiders, NFL Case Over LA Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge dismissed most of a lawsuit  
between the Oakland Raiders and the NFL that includes a battle over 
who owns rights to the Los Angeles football market. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling, which was issued Tuesday and released Wednesday,  
does not end the legal battle between the Raiders and NFL. The 
Raiders immediately refiled their lawsuit in state court. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George H. King said neither the NFL nor the  
Raiders provided ``sufficient reasons for this court to provide a 
forum'' and dismissed most of the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	King said the dismissed claims should be heard in state court.  
However, on the issue of antitrust, the judge ruled that the 
Raiders' allegation had no merit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders claimed the NFL violated antitrust laws by refusing  
to schedule the Raiders' home games in Oakland for the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	But to prove there was damage from the 1994 schedule, the  
Raiders would have had to shown that their ``relevant market'' was 
the San Francisco Bay area, King said. The team couldn't do this 
because, in 1994, they were still the Los Angeles Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling stems from a 1995 lawsuit in which the NFL sued the  
Raiders and owner Al Davis over territorial rights to the Los 
Angeles area, where the Raiders played for 13 years before 
returning to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides claimed victory in King's ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pure procedural motion that was made in federal court.  
Now what happened is we simply have to start over in the state 
court,'' Raiders lawyer Jack Quinn said. ``The claims of the 
Raiders are still the same -- they own control and have the rights 
to the Los Angeles market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders refiled their lawsuit in state court but dropped the  
antitrust allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL spokesman Greg Aiello declined comment. A league lawyer  
characterized the ruling as a boost for the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are delighted with the results. It establishes what we have  
always contended -- that there are no antitrust violations involved 
in our actions with the Raiders,'' Los Angeles-based lawyer Frank 
Rothman said. ``It's just another big win for the league and 
another loss for Davis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders moved from Oakland to Los Angeles in 1982. The NFL  
sued the Raiders over a failed plan to play in Oakland in 1994, 
when the Northridge earthquake damaged the Los Angeles Coliseum 
earlier that year. The league also sued over revenue-sharing 
discrepancies after the team moved to Oakland the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL claimed the team scheduled games in Oakland without  
league approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders countersued, claiming the league blocked the team's  
1994 move to Oakland, interfered with the move the following year 
and destroyed negotiations between the team and Hollywood Park in 
nearby Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations to build a new stadium in Hollywood Park fizzled  
and the team decided to return to Oakland in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn called the federal judge's ruling ``unfortunate'' because  
the team originally wanted to file in state court, but the NFL 
pushed for it to be filed in federal court. He said 2 1/2 years have 
been wasted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably could have built the same stadium and played  
there,'' Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the complaint, the team alleges that the NFL ``engaged in a  
concerted course of conduct'' to keep the Raiders out of the Los 
Angeles area. The team claims the league reneged on promises to 
fund part of the deal to bring the team to the park. The Raiders 
also want the NFL to pay the team the differential between the more 
profitable Los Angeles market and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Raiders spokesman Mike Taylor did not immediately return a phone  
call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles has been without a franchise since the Raiders went  
back to Oakland and the Rams moved to St. Louis before the 1995 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Two opposing groups in Los Angeles are bidding for the expansion  
franchise along with their own stadium proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The league is expected set up an expansion vote at an owner's  
meeting in Phoenix on March 14-18. A new team could begin play by 
2002. Houston is the other top contender for expansion.

<HEADLINE> Sergei Fedorov Suspended for 5 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sergei Fedorov of the Detroit Red Wings was  
suspended for five games without pay today for slashing Zdeno Chara 
of the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting out those games will cost the forward $386,178.  
</P>
<P>
	Federov's attack came with six minutes left in Saturday's game  
on the Islanders' home ice. Fedorov swung his stick with his right 
hand and struck Chara on the neck. Chara collapsed to the ice and 
remained there for several minutes. Fedorov was assessed a match 
penalty for deliberately injuring an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fedorov is classified as a repeat offender. He was suspended two  
games last March 26 for a hit from behind on Jason Marshall of 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``While Mr. Fedorov acknowledges and regrets the severity of his  
action, the league has made clear this season there is no 
acceptable explanation for administering blows to the head,'' said 
Colin Campbell, the league's senior vice-president and director of 
hockey operations, after conducting a hearing today. ``This 
suspension also reaffirms the league's position that every player 
is accountable for his stick and that reckless, dangerous use of 
the stick will be met with severe consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fedorov will miss Detroit's game at Phoenix on Friday night,  
plus contests at Anaheim on Sunday, at Los Angeles on Tuesday, at 
San Jose on March 12 and at Colorado on March 14. He will be 
eligible to return March 17 against Phoenix.

<HEADLINE> Browns Sign Pope, Brown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Veterans Marquez Pope and Lomas Brown signed as  
free agents with the expansion Cleveland Browns on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pope, a seven-year NFL veteran who played for San Francisco, the  
Rams and San Diego, is yet another former 49er to sign with 
Cleveland. The Browns' front office, led by president Carmen Policy 
and director of football operations Dwight Clark, has a distinct 
49ers flavor. 
</P>
<P>
	Pope, 28, got a two-year deal worth nearly $5 million. He was  
bothered by injuries for much of 1998. He also played with the 
Chargers in 1992-93 and with the Los Angeles Rams in 1994 before 
signing with the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marquez bolsters our defensive unit with his speed and  
tenacious approach to the game,'' Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown signed a three-year deal worth $10.75 million deal, with a  
$3 million signing bonus -- plus a provision that Brown will be the 
first player introduced at Cleveland's home opener next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time that you are able to add a Pro Bowl player to your  
roster, you have made a significant addition to your football 
team,'' Clark said. ``Lomas will solidify our offensive line, which 
we are extremely pleased with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown admitted it was difficult to leave Arizona.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know what I'm doing is a hard step. It wasn't just about  
money,'' said Brown, 36, a 14-year pro who wanted to move closer to 
his business interests in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	A fixture at left tackle with the Cardinals the last three  
seasons after 11 with the Lions, Brown reconsidered his decision to 
join Cleveland on Tuesday. Arizona offered a $2 million signing 
bonus and a two-year deal said to be about the equal of Cleveland's 
first two years, but with more money for the coming season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that's disappointing is that is we could have had  
this done a long time ago,'' Brown said of his negotiations with 
the Cardinals. ``The deal they finally took to the table is the 
exact same offer we made to them at the scouting combine (last 
month). They pretty much sat on the deal. By the time they got back 
to us, Cleveland was in the ballgame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns also announced the hiring of Joe Collins, coordinator  
of pro personnel for the 49ers, as player personnel director, and 
Douglas C. Jacobs, as vice president-finance and treasurer.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Africa Show Is Revamped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seven years after closing its antiquated  
exhibit on Africa, the Smithsonian Institution is preparing a new 
look at the continent's geography, history, culture and people. 
</P>
<P>
	``This exhibition is going to present Africa in a new light  
based on the most recent scholarship,'' said Sulayman Nyang, a 
Howard University professor and the lead developer of the new 
exhibit, which is scheduled to open in December at the National 
Museum of Natural History. ``We have avoided all the booby traps of 
generalization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people participated during the years, since 1992,  
that the new exhibit has been under development, Nyang said, 
providing answers to the question: ``What do Africans want to tell 
Americans about what it means to be African.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, decisions on what to include and leave out came only  
after countless hours of listening to the ideas and suggestions of 
individuals, said Natural History Museum Director Robert Fri. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit will include personal accounts from contemporary  
interviews, as well as proverbs, prayers, folk tales and oral 
epics, Fri said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new exhibit occupies the same general area as the old  
African hall, which had come under criticism for generalities and 
inaccuracies. 
</P>
<P>
	The main focus of the $5.5 million project is a permanent new  
Hall of African History and Culture. It will open Dec. 15, 
occupying 6,500 square feet on the museum's second floor. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the exhibit hall, an Internet connection will be  
in place through which people can study the exhibit from afar and 
even learn more detail than can be presented at the museum itself. 
The exhibit will be kept up to date with continuing performances, 
seminars, lectures and program changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit will begin, as did humankind, with the early  
hominids of Africa's Olduvai Gorge. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the history exhibits will be looks at the Nile cultures of  
Egypt and Nubia, the great Mali empire, the Almoravids of North 
Africa who fused African and Islamic culture and invaded Spain and 
Portugal, the rise of the slave trade and history in the making in 
South Africa today. 
</P>
<P>
	A living spaces gallery provides a glimpse at the diverse  
cultures of Africa from a busy Benin city to a rural Somali home. 
Visitors hear the voices of Somali women as they construct a 
portable house. 
</P>
<P>
	The African diaspora, the wide scattering of people throughout  
the world, especially through the slave trade, is presented. 
Included is a section in the words of Olaudah Equiano, who was 
enslaved in what is now Nigeria, sold to a Royal Navy officer and 
in 1789 wrote a book about his experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	The small Freedom Theater, which seats about 20, will provide  
film and the words of such leaders as the Americans W.E.B. DuBois, 
Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, the Africans Kwame Nkrumah 
and Bishop Desmond Tutu and others.

tourists who visit New York are 34 percent more likely to die of a 
heart attack than visitors to other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The people who live there aren't safe, either. New Yorkers are  
55 percent more likely to die of a heart attack in their hometown 
than people living in other U.S. cities, said psychologist Nicholas 
Christenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	New Yorkers' risk of dying of a heart attack drops by 20 percent  
when they are outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being in New York may be good for the rest of you, but leave  
your heart in San Francisco,'' said Christenfeld, who will present 
his findings Friday at a meeting of the Society for Behavioral 
Medicine in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Christenfeld based his data on U.S. death certificates from 1985  
to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	While the findings do not identify what it is about New York  
that leads to such a high risk, Christenfeld said the stress is 
likely the factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``New York gives you the full experience -- stress, excitement,  
pressure, density,'' he said. ``This won't cause a heart attack in 
a healthy young person, but if you're at high risk and teetering on 
the edge of a heart attack, it could push you over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christenfeld studied New Yorkers who died in the city; non-New  
Yorkers who died while visiting the city; and New Yorkers who died 
while traveling out of the city. About 44,000 tourists and the same 
number of New Yorkers died of heart attacks during the decade 
examined. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar analyses were conducted for residents and visitors to  
the 10 largest U.S. cities besides New York: Los Angeles, Chicago, 
Houston, Philadelphia, San Diego, Dallas, Phoenix, Detroit, San 
Antonio and San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, visitors to other cities have about a 1 percent  
higher rate of coronary deaths, according to Christenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Stein, a spokesman for the American Heart Association  
and Chief of Cardiac Prevention and Rehabilitation at Lenox Hill 
Hospital in New York, said he wasn't sure what the results meant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The researchers suggested that New Yorkers live in a more  
stressful environment, but there's nothing in the data that 
indicates that this is stress,'' Stein said. ``At the end of the 
day, it's clear that the take home message is you get your heart 
disease by how you live not where you live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fran Reiter, president and chief executive of the New York  
Convention and Visitors Bureau, said Christenfeld ``has really got 
to get a life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``New York is the most exciting place in the world,'' she said.  
``People flock here for the experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However the results came as no surprise to Sue Schonman, a  
broker who has been commuting to New York from Stirling, N.J., for 
the past nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to do this every day!'' she said, pressing through the  
crowds to catch a train. ``You have to endure a three hour commute 
here just to have a life. Years of this really take it out of 
you.''

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Witholding Worker Comp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State workers' compensation system insurers  
cannot be sued for withholding health-care benefits for 
work-related injuries while they decide whether the treatment is 
reasonable and necessary, the Supreme Court said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous ruling, in a Pennsylvania case, said both public  
and private insurers can withhold payment while that deciding. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law expressly limits an employee's entitlement to  
'reasonable' and 'necessary' medical treatment,'' Chief Justice 
William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court. Injured workers ``do not 
have a property interest ... in having their providers paid for 
treatment that has yet to be found reasonable and necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court added that private companies that serve as workers'  
compensation insurers cannot be sued because they did not act in 
the role of the state. Only government action, not a private 
citizen's acts, can violate someone's constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Insurance Association praised the ruling. General  
counsel Craig Berrington said it ``reaffirmed the common-sense 
notion that since workers' compensation insurers pay the full 
medical tab for employee injuries, they have the right to review 
the appropriateness of medical treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The justices reversed a lower court decision that let a group of  
injured workers sue insurers for withholding their benefits pending 
a review of their treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other states, Pennsylvania requires employers to pay for  
medical care for workers who suffer job-related injuries and 
diseases, and to partially replace lost wages. The state law 
requires payment for ``reasonable and necessary'' medical services. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the state legislature responded to the rising cost of  
workplace injuries by allowing insurers to withhold payments for 
disputed medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of injured workers sued state officials and private  
insurers, saying the withholding of benefits violated their 
due-process rights. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge threw out the claims against the private  
insurers on grounds they were not state agencies, and said the 
state officials' actions did not violate the workers' due-process 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the lawsuits,  
saying the private insurers were acting for the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 3rd Circuit court's decision last year, Pennsylvania  
has changed its procedures. No benefits are withheld until an 
employee receives notice that a review has been requested and has a 
chance to submit written testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court reversed the appeals court's ruling. Rehnquist  
wrote that injured workers have a right only to reasonable and 
necessary medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``What (the workers) ask in this case is that insurers be  
required to pay for patently unreasonable, unnecessary and even 
fraudulent medical care without any right, under state law, to seek 
reimbursement from providers,'' he added. Further, he said, a 
decision by private insurers to withhold payment pending review 
cannot be considered a state action. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is American manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co. vs.  
Sullivan, 97-2000.

<HEADLINE> Web Cartoons Animate TV's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Can a little pink donkey find success and  
happiness on television? That depends on how she fares on the World 
Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Cartoon Network, which unspools toons nonstop for cable TV  
viewers, is now using its Web site as a proving ground for animated 
shorts. New online cartoons that click with the point-and-click 
crowd could soon find themselves uploaded to the television big 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Visit Cartoon Network Online (www.cartoonnetwork.com) and this  
week you'll find two episodes of ``Pink Donkey and the Fly,'' as 
well as the first installment of ``B. Happy.'' Each is cheeky, 
riotously colorful and sufficiently, well, animated to be a 
reasonable facsimile of cartoons as you'd view them on your TV set. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, these ``Web Premiere Toons'' come with a  
computer-centric twist: interactivity. Mouse ready? You can choose 
how Pink Donkey might reach the apple dangling from a distant 
branch. You can decide if B. Happy, a ``bluebird of happiness'' 
with a nasty streak, should succeed in his mission to keep the 
bully cat from gobbling Pity Kitty's fish. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just scratching the surface of interactivity in these  
first ones, but our goal is to make good interactive 
entertainment,'' said Sam Register, creative director of Cartoon 
Network Online. ``If you want to just watch a cartoon, shut your 
computer off and turn on the TV and have a cartoon pushed at you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Point taken. Still, when push comes to shove for the toon  
impresarios, it all comes down to pretty much the same thing: 
Create program content that adapts to every media platform, 
broadcast and Internet alike. 
</P>
<P>
	Can WhirlGirl rise to this challenge? A bodacious super-heroine  
who should dress more warmly, she arrived last Friday on Showtime 
in its first original Web series -- with the prospect, of course, of 
a ``WhirlGirl'' spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some months down the road we'll take a look at whether we want  
to develop it as a television project on our (cable) network -- 
either animated or live action,'' said Jeff Morris, Showtime's 
senior vice president for new media. 
</P>
<P>
	The campy ``WhirlGirl,'' a hybrid of ``Wonder Woman'' and ``Max  
Headroom,'' pits its raven-haired, spandex-clad champion against 
the world's vilest media megalomaniac. Morris said the network, 
which acquired the two-year-old online comic strip, has ordered 28 
animated episodes. A five-minute chapter will be posted each Friday 
(www.showtimeonline.com) to accompany that evening's sci-fi block 
of Showtime cable fare. 
</P>
<P>
	But even before Cartoon Network and Showtime took the plunge,  
dozens of Web sites were embracing animation, and no wonder. 
Animation can look good, even great, on the Web. Simple shapes, fat 
lines, bold colors and limited motion can comfortably conform to 
the Web's current technical limitations. By contrast, live-action 
``streaming video'' available on many Web sites looks as fuzzy and 
jumpy as your Aunt Harriet's 8mm home movies. 
</P>
<P>
	What kind of toons wait out there in cyberspace? One site, the  
ambitious Hotwired Animation Express (www.hotwired.com/animation), 
boasts a ``most innovative, surprising and witty'' collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, promising ``a new production every Tuesday,'' the  
Surrey Stick Figure Theatre of Death 
(www.c-cat.demon.co.uk/theatre) ``stages'' drama at its most daftly 
concise. For instance, catch a performance of ``Julius Caesar'' or 
``Don Giovanni'' boiled down to 10 silent seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	As it has for other mavericks, the Web has enabled inventive  
animators to bypass Big Media and take their work straight to the 
Internet's global audience. 
</P>
<P>
	But no less resourcefully, a media juggernaut like Cartoon  
Network is employing the Internet to hold TV tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides ``Pink Donkey and the Fly'' (which proposes that a fly  
can fall in unrequited love with a donkey) and ``B. Happy'' (think: 
a demented ``Touched by an Angel''), Cartoon Network plans to 
introduce three more toon titles, each with two to six episodes. 
New installments will be added each Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, every day, we're thinking about how cartoons will  
be pre-purposed for a converged environment,'' Register said. 
</P>
<P>
	Translated: Hoof-loose and fancy-free, Pink Donkey is a pioneer  
in bringing together TV and the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	YESTERDAY ON `TODAY': NBC rolls out two former ``Today'' show  
hosts later this week and next to fill in for Matt Lauer on 
vacation. On Thursday and Friday, Jane Pauley will be paired for 
the first time with Katie Couric, and Tom Brokaw will join Couric 
on Monday and Tuesday, March 8 and 9. Pauley was co-host of 
``Today'' from 1976 to 1989, and is now co-anchor of ``Dateline

from 1976 to 1981.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps Torricelli Raise $2M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- President Clinton paid back the loyalty of  
one of his staunch impeachment defenders Wednesday, helping 
Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli raise $2 million for a 
re-election campaign three years away. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing at a $1,000-per-ticket reception for Torricelli's 2002  
re-election bid, Clinton praised him as a ``ferocious advocate'' 
for New Jersey and human rights and thanked him for his support. 
``He has been my friend in good times and bad, and I will never 
forget it,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The event at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center drew 1,500  
guests who gave the maximum amount. Some supporters gave donations 
but did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
	While the White House did not cast Clinton's appearance as an  
expression of gratitude for Torricelli's unwavering loyalty during 
Clinton's impeachment, it acknowledged that the president wanted to 
show his support for the junior senator from New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The senator asked the president to come,'' said White House  
spokeswoman Amy Weiss, and Clinton agreed because Torricelli had 
been ``an avid defender of the president's policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also was the keynote speaker for a 1996 Torricelli  
fund-raiser for a campaign that ultimately raised more than $9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli spoke before the president Wednesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``In all the times of all the nations of the world, no nation  
has ever enjoyed the economic circumstances we enjoy,'' Torricelli 
said, embracing Clinton's plans to strengthen the nation's 
education and retirement systems for the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope every member of Congress ... will join hands with us,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli, who heads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign  
Committee and has urged first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to run 
for Senate in New York, joked that he deserved a title befitting 
the speculation that has surrounded her future plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the man who created and am managing the Hillary Rodham  
Clinton campaign for the United States Senate,'' he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those attending were actors Kevin Spacey and Joe Pesci,  
and singers Cissy Houston and Gloria Gaynor. Ms. Houston -- mother 
of pop diva Whitney Houston -- performed the national anthem, while 
Ms. Gaynor serenaded Clinton with her signature song. ``I Will 
Survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who thinks they've survived can stand up,'' Gaynor  
said, and sooon the entire crowd was on its feet, swaying and 
singing along with the refrain. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who was listening backstage, said he had wondered  
whether it was more appropriate for him to sing along with ``I Will 
Survive'' -- drawing a hearty laugh from the audience -- or ``Never 
Can Say Goodbye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the same donors planned to attend a second, $1,000  
fund-raiser Thursday at the East Brunswick Hilton for former U.S. 
Sen. Bill Bradley's presidential campaign. Though supporters of 
Bradley and Torricelli acknowledge the timing was unfortunate, 
neither camp expected to suffer financially.

	``Trail'' (Bohemia Beat) -- Jimmy LaFave  

</P>
<P>
	Jimmy LaFave's voice is honey-smooth and whiskey-rough, weepy  
but manly, armor-piercing and heat-seeking, and, though he can make 
it swoop, soar and turn somersaults, he always uses it for the sake 
of the song. ``Trail,'' a two-CD collection culled from outtakes, 
concerts, radio appearances and living room jams showcases that 
great voice in a variety of settings, from supercharged roadhouse 
rockers to sweet acoustic ballads. It also answers the calls for an 
album of Bob Dylan covers by including a dozen of them among its 
two-plus hours of music. 
</P>
<P>
	From the kicking version of ``Positively 4th Street'' that opens  
the album through the intimate and beautiful ``One Too Many 
Mornings'' near the end, LaFave shows that he is the preeminent 
Dylan interpreter because he makes the songs his own. He does the 
same with songs by other great writers on ``Trail,'' including Joe 
Ely, Woody Guthrie and Bruce Springsteen, as well as offering up 
interesting versions of some mighty fine Jimmy LaFave tunes. 
</P>
<P>
	All in all, ``Trail'' is the most satisfying work yet from a  
rock 'n' roll road warrior with the best voice in the business.

	``What I Deserve'' (Rykodisc) -- Kelly Willis  

</P>
<P>
	Kelly Willis' first full-length album in seven years is a  
dazzler. Willis just went on making terrific, twangy, rootsy music 
while she was in record company limbo. And what music she makes on 
``What I Deserve,'' which is clearly her best album. Willis has a 
classic country voice, packing more heartache into one phrase than 
a whole jar full of those big-haired Nashville country singers. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis' quaver sounds best on two songs written by her husband,  
Bruce Robison -- ``Wrapped'' (the title track on his own fine album) 
and the most addictive song on the album, ``Not Forgotten You,'' 
which ought to be a crossover hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I Deserve'' sounds like the sort of album that's country  
enough to appeal to country fans (at least those whose idea of 
country is broad enough to take in some Texas twang) and edgy 
enough to grab alt-country diehards, too. What this album deserves 
is a lot of time in your CD player.

	``Through a Glass Darkly'' (Philo) -- David Olney  

</P>
<P>
	Many of the songs on David Olney's deep, dark and delicious new  
album play out like miniature black-and-white movies about rural 
life between the World Wars. Olney is a writer of tremendous power 
and clarity, and his tales of hard times and hard choices gain 
further authenticity from their spare, mostly acoustic settings. 
Fans of Townes Van Zandt (whose ``Snowin' on Raton'' Olney covers 
beautifully) or Bill Morrissey ought to enjoy this one for its 
unflinching character studies and country-folk music.

	``The Secret Handshake'' (HighTone) -- Geoff Muldaur  

</P>
<P>
	``The Secret Handshake'' is an almost perfect distillation of  
country-blues and folk with a dollop of New Orleans second-line and 
fife-and-drum music thrown in. Geoff Muldaur tops that potent mix 
with a sweet voice that has aged into a beautifully expressive 
instrument. The most heavenly offering on this album, subtitled 
``American Blues and Gospel'' is ``I Don't Feel at Home in This 
World Anymore,'' but, start to finish, this a great roots album.

	``Half Mad Moon'' (Sire/Watermelon) -- The Damnations TX  

</P>
<P>
	``Half Mad Moon'' is a seemingly casual blend of garage rock,  
acoustic strumming, Americana and the occasional great pop song. 
Sisters Amy Boone and Deborah Kelly lead the band and share both 
songwriting and singing. Occasionally, the casual feel gets to be 
too much -- the title track, for example, drags -- but at their best, 
The Damnations TX sound like an inspired band having a blast in 
someone's basement, and making some mighty fine rock 'n' roll.

	``Tryin' to Make a Little Love'' (Bullseye) -- Michelle Willson

	Oh my, yes. So many of today's blues singers have all the  
passion of a bored Chicago band in the sanitized North Side tourist 
clubs sleepwalking through ``Sweet Home Chicago'' for the 769th set 
in a row. But Michelle Willson swings with fire, passion and, best 
of all, soul. Most listeners should find it pretty much impossible 
to be still while ``Tryin' to Make a Little Love'' is playing. 
Those uninspired by this meeting of New Orleans funk (LOVE that 
rhythm section) with northern blues ought to consult a physician.

	``Simply Baroque'' (Sony Classical) -- Yo Yo Ma, Ton Koopman and  
the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra 

</P>
<P>
	Always known as a musician willing to experiment -- he's done  
collaborations with jazz/improvisational vocalist Bobby McFerrin 
and with Appalachian bluegrass players -- cellist Yo Yo Ma has gone 
back to the roots of his instrument to find a new sound. On 
``Simply Baroque,'' Ma uses a Baroque-style cello, which has no 
stand and must be supported by the player's legs, to create a more 
delicate, more moving sound than his previous work. The album is a 
collection of compositions by Bach and Luigi Boccherini, an 
18th-century Italian cellist who wrote concertos to show off his 
own talent. And using a scaled down Baroque-style orchestra, which 
features only strings and a harpsichord and no horns, allows the 
lighter tone to shine through, although Ma sometimes defers too 
much to his fellow musicians. Still, this step back is a definite 
step forward for a giant of classical music.

	``My Secret Life'' (Capricorn) -- Sonia Dada  

</P>
<P>
	The name of this Chicago eight-piece band basically means  
irreverent music, but ``My Secret Life'' is far from that. A jumble 
of styles, including blues, salsa, gospel and freeform rock -- think 
recent Paul Simon crossed with the Grateful Dead with a splash of 
the Neville Brothers -- Sonia Dada's third release works on several 
levels. Sadly, one of the most important is lacking, as the band 
doesn't have a true lead vocalist to go with the fine playing. 
Still, the precise musicianship -- all the songs are recorded live 
in the studio -- and the level of expert experimentation evident on 
``My Secret Life'' ensure that Sonia Dada won't be secret for long.

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs To Vote on IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Goldman Sachs Group LP, the last of Wall  
Street's large private investment banks, will ask its partners to 
vote next week on a plan to sell a 10 to 15 percent stake in the 
firm to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm's 220 partners are expected to approve the deal on  
Monday, clearing the way for a stock sale in May or June. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs originally planned to go public last year but  
aborted its attempt in September because turmoil in financial 
markets scared off many investors and ate into Goldman's profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Jon S. Corzine stepped down as co-chief executive in  
order to focus on the firm's initial public stock offering, and 
many insiders expect him to leave after the sale is complete. For 
now, Corzine shares the chairman's title with Henry M. Paulson Jr., 
who took over as the sole chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The two officials issued a joint statement, saying: ``We have  
recommended that the firm become a public company to secure 
permanent capital to grow; to share ownership broadly among our 
employees; and to permit us to use publicly traded securities to 
finance strategic acquisitions that we may elect to make in the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts and investors said Goldman Sachs' IPO last year would  
have valued the firm at about $30 billion. They estimated, however, 
that the IPO would be discounted by as much as 25 percent in 
today's market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market would not place as high a valuation on Goldman now,  
but it would still provide it with a very handsome valuation 
because of Goldman's pedigree,'' said Michael Flanagan, an 
independent brokerage industry analyst with Financial Service 
Analytics. 
</P>
<P>
	While the stock market has gained 11 percent since Goldman Sachs  
abandoned its plans, the firm's public competitors, such as Merrill 
Lynch &AMP; Co. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. are still trading 
off their highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry watchers, including Goldman Sach's former  
co-chairman John Whitehead, have expressed concern that the 
130-year-old firm would lose some of its prestige and control by 
becoming a public company. 
</P>
<P>
	But Flanagan bets Goldman will do all that it can to preserve  
its reputation as one of the most desirable places to work on Wall

	``It's been known as an elite, private culture,'' he said, ``and  
I suspect the firm would like to retain elements of that mystique 
to the extent that a public firm can.''

<HEADLINE> Jones Apparel Buys Nine West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jones Apparel Group Inc. fell more than 16  
percent in early trading today on news that it will buy Nine West 
Group, a leading footwear and accessories maker that has been 
struggling with its profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones announced late Tuesday that it would purchase Nine West  
for $885 million in stock and cash and assume more than $500 
million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been rumors on Wall Street over the last month that a  
Nine West-Jones deal was likely. Both cater to the middle-market 
consumer, especially professional women looking for classy, yet 
affordable merchandise for both work and play. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was down $4.18 3/4 at $21.75 this morning on the New York  
Stock Exchange. Nine West was also lower, falling $1.81 1/4 to $21 on 
the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, which is best known for its Jones New York, Saville and  
Evan-Picone labels, has been on a buying spree in the past year to 
build itself into a multibrand conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Its recent purchases include Sun Apparel, which makes Ralph  
Lauren's Polo jeans. It also owns the license for Lauren by Ralph 
Lauren, a top-selling mid-priced women's label at department 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last month, it acquired the trademark for designer Todd  
Oldham, which it plans to develop into a fashion brand for the teen 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nine West meets all of our acquisition criteria,'' said Sidney  
Kimmel, chairman of Jones in a statement Tuesday night. ``The 
company has many strong brands, such as Nine West, Easy Spirit and 
Enzo Angiolini; excellent product quality and consistency; and 
leading market positioning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time that Jones is expanding, Nine West has been  
trying to get its business back in order. While Nine West estimates 
it sells 20 percent of all women's shoes sold in the United States, 
the company still has struggled to reduce costs and improve its 
profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine West sells its shoes and accessories, like purses, socks  
and sunglasses, through department stores, independent shoes stores 
and more than 1,500 retail stores which it operates. 
</P>
<P>
	Since November, the White Plains, N.Y.-based company has  
eliminated about 6 percent of its total work force of 13,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Nine West was named earlier this year in a  
price-fixing lawsuit, which claimed the company and several large 
department store chains kept shoe prices artificially high for 
years on 12 brands of women's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to be completed by the end of June. Under  
the buyout agreement, Jones will exchange .5011 of a share of its 
stock and $13 in cash for each Nine West Group share. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deal is complete, Nine West chairman Jerome Fisher and  
chief executive Vincent Camuto will be replaced at the helm of the 
company by Mark Schwartz, a former Merrill Lynch investment banker 
who was responsible for the initial public offerings of both Jones 
and Nine West. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz will leave his current position as president of the  
leverage buyout firm Palladin Capital Group, which acted as the 
financial advisor on this deal for Jones. Fisher will remain a 
consultant with Nine West, while Camuto will be involved with 
design and merchandising.

<HEADLINE>  Aid Agencies Help Kosovo Albanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Humanitarian workers took advantage  
of a lull in fighting to rush aid Wednesday to thousands of 
displaced ethnic Albanians massed along Kosovo's border with 
Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Defying NATO warnings, Yugoslav army and Serbian police forces  
have pounded suspected Kosovo Liberation Army rebel positions along 
the border for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting has cast increasing doubt on the chances for  
success when suspended peace talks resume March 15 in France, 
although there was evidence Wednesday that the Kosovo Albanian 
delegation is ready to sign a peace deal calling for broad 
autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav forces refrained from attacks on rebel positions  
Wednesday but sent a convoy of armored vehicles through the 
strategically important area in a show of strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Infantry fighting vehicles and trucks loaded with army troops  
and carrying heavy weapons rumbled through the border zone before 
returning to a base at Urosevac, halfway between the capital of 
Pristina and the main Macedonia-Kosovo border crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,000 people have been displaced by the recent clashes,  
U.N. refugee agency spokesman Fernando del Mundo said. Some have 
crossed into Macedonia or found shelter within Kosovo, while 
several hundred remain stuck on mountain slopes in cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid agencies sent food, blankets, mattresses, medicine and other  
items to the flashpoint area in southern Kosovo, a province in 
Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's information minister accused Kosovo Albanians of  
trying to ``stage a simulated humanitarian catastrophe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The (Yugoslav) army has no reason to fire on villages,'' said  
Milan Komnenic, adding that the government troops were only 
fighting with KLA guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav forces are trying to assert control over the Macedonian  
frontier amid a heightened threat of action by NATO forces 
assembling just across the border in preparation for enforcing a 
peace deal in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Army troops have mined part of the border and rigged a key  
bridge with explosives. Clearing the border of civilians would help 
secure the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has threatened airstrikes against Serb forces if the  
Yugoslav government does not accept the peace plan when talks 
resume. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, chief negotiator Christopher Hill said the  
KLA is prepared to sign the Rambouillet peace plan. Although Serb 
authorities continue to oppose a NATO-led implementation force, he 
was positive about the plan's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sense is that many Serbs understand that this (NATO force)  
is indeed an inseparable part of the agreement,'' Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Albania, a Kosovo Albanian delegate to the talks in France  
said its negotiators will keep their pledge to sign the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Albanian delegation will sign the Rambouillet  
agreement because it represents the historical and actual interests 
of the Albanian people,'' Rexhep Qosja, leader of the Democratic 
United League, said in Tirana. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,000 people have been killed and 300,000 displaced in a  
year of war for control of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up 
90 percent of the province and mostly favor independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, about 2,000 mourners attended the funeral of a  
Serb civilian kidnapped and beaten to death last week by ethnic 
Albanian rebels. Dobrivoje Savelic, 43, was abducted Saturday near 
his home, 40 miles southwest of Pristina, in an area heavily 
contested between Serb government troops and the KLA.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Gets Her Say in Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky says she regrets her role in  
causing pain and suffering not only for her own friends and family, 
but for President Clinton's family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've apologized in private to my family and to my friends ...  
I would like to publicly acknowledge that I recognize the pain and 
the suffering that they've gone through because of this,'' Ms. 
Lewinsky says in an interview with ABC News to be aired tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't dream of asking Chelsea and Mrs. Clinton to forgive  
me,'' she says. ``But I would ask them to know that I am very sorry 
for what happened and for what they've been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Walters of ABC won the first interview with Ms. Lewinsky  
since the former White House intern's affair with Clinton burst 
into the headlines on Jan. 21, 1998. Ms. Lewinsky, who received 
immunity from prosecution for cooperating with investigators, was 
prohibited from speaking publicly until Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr's office gave the go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview was timed to help promote her book -- ``Monica's  
Story,'' written with Princess Diana biographer Andrew Morton -- 
which goes on sale Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported in today's editions that Ms.  
Lewinsky is so critical of Starr in the book that several of her 
friends and associates fear Starr will try to revoke her immunity 
agreement and prosecute her. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times says she told Morton she was so despondent at her  
treatment by prosecutors who initially confronted her at a hotel in 
suburban Virginia that she briefly considered jumping out of a 10th 
floor window in their presence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times report said prosecutors had confronted her with a copy  
of her false affidavit in which she swore that she had not had an 
affair with Clinton, even though it had not been filed yet with a 
federal court in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said Starr has said his office was sent the affidavit  
anonymously by James A. Moody, a lawyer for Linda Tripp, who had 
obtained it from lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones, who had a sexual 
harassment suit pending against the president at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office learned of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair from Mrs.  
Tripp. The extent, timing and nature of any contacts between 
Starr's office and the Jones lawyers are under review by the 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv refused to comment on the  
Lewinsky interview and book. But asked on Tuesday whether Ms. 
Lewinsky's words would finally bring an end to the story, Toiv 
said, ``I think I can safely say 'No' to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC released brief excerpts from the interview on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Is Bill Clinton a sensuous, passionate man?'' Walters asked  
the 25-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gosh, I'll probably get in trouble for saying this,'' Ms.  
Lewinsky began, before describing the president as ``a very sensual 
man'' who feels conflicted because of his ``strong religious 
upbringing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he struggles with his sensuality because I don't think  
he thinks it's OK,'' she said. ``I think he tries to hold himself 
back. And then can't any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky had stinging words for her former friend, Mrs.  
Tripp, who secretly tape-recorded their telephone conversations 
about the president and turned them over to Starr's investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pity her,'' Ms. Lewinsky said. ``I would hate to be her.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky said she was drawn to Mrs. Tripp at the Pentagon  
because both of them had worked at the White House, where Ms. 
Lewinsky longed to return. She said she confided the affair to Mrs. 
Tripp after her co-worker kept saying such things as ``You're just 
the type of girl the president would like'' and ``I bet you could 
have an affair with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News in New York reported in today's editions that Ms.  
Lewinsky was questioned Walters about a brief affair she had with a 
42-year-old Pentagon official after she was assigned there in the 
spring of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd tease him (Clinton) about it and tell him he had  
competition,'' the paper quoted her as saying on an audio tape of 
part of the Walters interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News obtained the tape Monday and reported in  
Tuesday's editions on other details contained on it. It was not 
clear how much, if any, of the matters covered on the audio tape 
will be broadcast by ABC, which is trying to determine who leaked 
the audio tape to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with the Pentagon official, who was  
unmarried at the time, has been reported previously.

<HEADLINE> Blues Hope Carey Can Regain Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Three years removed from the Vezina Trophy,  
24-year-old Jim Carey is anxious to show the St. Louis Blues that 
he can be a star goaltender again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get back in there and prove to myself that I'm back,  
that I can play at this level, that I've accomplished things at 
this level,'' Carey said Wednesday. ``The opportunity is going to 
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carey signed a two-year deal with the Blues on Monday, the same  
day he agreed to a contract buyout with the Boston Bruins. He joins 
a team that has already started four goalies this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a young goaltender who has had some success in the past  
and drifted off in the wrong direction,'' general manager Larry 
Pleau said. ``We're hoping he can find his way back. We're looking 
for somebody to be the No. 1 goaltender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues don't think Grant Fuhr, 36, is the answer anymore.  
Fuhr underwent his third knee operation in three years in December, 
and was ineffective before that. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup Jamie McLennan also has struggled. The Blues are the  
stingiest team in the NHL in shots allowed but they're only two 
games above .500 because their goalies also have the worst save 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookies Rich Parent and Brent Johnson have had the most success  
lately. Parent won four of five before being sidelined by a freak 
injury in the middle of February -- a ruptured testicle when a 
pre-game warmup shot broke his cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 21, is the No. 1 of the moment, having been in the nets  
during the team's current three-game winning streak. He has a very 
impressive .954 save percentage and will get the call again 
Thursday night against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	But sooner or later, Carey will get his chance.  
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity is going to come,'' he said. ``Johnson is hot  
right now and they're going to ride him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides winning the Vezina in 1996, Carey won the Calder Trophy  
as the NHL's top rookie the previous year. He's fallen off the 
hockey map recently with only 10 games in the NHL the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey's career has been in decline since the Bruins acquired him  
in a six-player deal on March 1, 1997. He struggled down the 
stretch that season with a 5-13 record and 3.82 goals-against 
average, then after seven games the following season he lost his 
job to Byron Dafoe and was sent to Providence of the AHL. 
</P>
<P>
	He reportedly agreed to a $1.2 million buyout of a contract that  
was to have paid him $2.3 million this year and $2.7 million next 
season, just for a chance to play again. The Blues got him cheap, 
paying him $200,000 for the rest of this season and $600,000 next 
season with incentives that could boost his salary to $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``You take one step back to go two steps forward,'' Carey said.  
``It wasn't a money issue, it was more about playing. Most guys 
would do that, I think. There's nothing like playing in the NHL, 
and if you feel you belong there, money is not an issue.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Turn Lower; Dow Down 52.16 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes turned lower in late morning, as  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan reiterated reservations 
about President Clinton's proposal to invest a significant portion 
of the Social Security funds in equities. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 52.16 at 9,245.45. The blue-chip index had risen as high as 
9,337.00, up nearly 40 points, before retreating. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators turned lower as well. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 3.06 at 1,222.44, and the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index down 5.33 at 2,253.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues overtook advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 231.87 million 
shares, up from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing a Congressional subcommittee this morning, Greenspan  
warned that large-scale investments in equities by the Social 
Security Trust Fund could render the stock market less efficient. 
It could also harm the economy, he said, by potentially channeling 
investment dollars into poorer performing companies. 
</P>
<P>
	As the fourth-quarter earnings reporting season winds down, the  
market is stalled and looking for new direction, said Michael Farr, 
a partner in the investment firm of Farr, Miller &AMP; Washington, in 
Washington D.C. ``You're looking to what might be a stimulus for 
the markets, and it's certainly not coming from Mr. Greenspan this 
morning,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials were led lower by Union Carbide, which was  
down 2 1/8 at 42 11/16 after rising 9 percent Tuesday on takeover 
speculation. Consumer stocks were also lower, with Eastman Kodak 
down 1 3/4 at 63 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were mixed after another warning about  
declining computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest one, from 3Com Corp., which sells data, voice and  
video systems for the Internet and intranets. The company said late 
Tuesday that third-quarter earnings from ongoing operations will be 
about 23 cents a share, far below analysts' previously expected 36 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The company blamed an ``unexpected slowdown'' in sales to  
businesses in the United States and Latin America. 3Com stock was 
down 2 3/4 at 24 1/4 in leading volume in Nasdaq trading, after dropping 
Tuesday in after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rest of the technology sector was mixed. Intel was up 3/8  
at 110 3/16 in Nasdaq trading, and Dow component Hewlett-Packard, 
which gained Tuesday on a restructuring announcement, was down 5/16 
at 68 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices were lower after the National Association of  
Purchasing Management said its index of non-manufacturing activity 
rose to 57.0 percent in February, from January's 54 percent. But, 
the group's index of non-manufacturing prices eased, to 46.5 
percent from 47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullish economic data erased a slight gain in bonds. The  
30-year Treasury was down 23/32 point at 5.66 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The higher interest rates will exacerbate a slower economy, so  
that things are feeling kind of toppy in the stock market here,'' 
Farr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average soared 1.79 percent,  
after falling 2.11 percent on Tuesday, as investors were cheered by 
a decline in interest rates and a falling yen. In afternoon trading 
in Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 1.09 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 was up 0.39 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.28 
percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Mark Whiten, the Cleveland Indians outfielder, will miss at  
least two weeks of spring training with a stress fracture of his 
right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Whiten, expected to open the season as a reserve, complained  
about pain in the foot and underwent tests Monday, the club 
announced on Wednesday at Winter Haven, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Chris Carpenter, scheduled to start against the New York  
Yankees on Thursday, signed a three-year contract with the Toronto 
Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives me confidence that Toronto has confidence in me and  
the ability I have,'' Carpenter said at Dunedin, Fla. The Yankees 
announced that Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez will start in the 
game at Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Relief pitcher Jeff Shaw couldn't wait any longer the birth of  
his third child and arrived Wednesday at the Los Angeles Dodgers' 
camp at Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw had been given permission to report late -- after wife Julie  
delivered, which was supposed to Feb. 15, then Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Julie's still healthy, the baby's not in danger, that's the

<HEADLINE> Man, 96, Sentenced in Hit-and-Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- A 96-year-old man who struck and  
killed a 15-year-old girl with his car and then fled the scene was 
sentenced to five years' probation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Cox was also ordered to pay restitution into a fund to  
promote state legislation that would make it more difficult for 
elderly drivers to renew their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox had pleaded no contest to felony hit-and-run charges in  
December and has since surrendered his license. He struck Brandi 
Mitock on Nov. 5 and then apparently became disoriented. He fled 
the scene and turned himself in to police later that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Bernard Kamins said he was shocked by medical reports that  
showed Cox had been having strokes since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``The driver laws need to be revamped,'' Kamins said.  
</P>
<P>
	Brandi's death has sparked a legislative push for tougher  
testing of elderly drivers. Cox's restitution will go into a fund 
to promote a bill that would take legally blind motorists off the 
road and require drivers over 75 years of age to undergo vision and 
road tests to get their licenses renewed.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Suspect Refuses To Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The man accused of killing two U.S. Capitol  
Police officers refused to talk to psychiatrists on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the advice of my attorneys I have no comment,'' Russell  
Eugene Weston Jr. said in response to repeated questions from U.S. 
District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who plans to proceed with a 
competency hearing April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will consider his cooperation or lack thereof,'' said  
Sullivan, who stepped down from the bench Wednesday to explain to 
Weston that the competency proceedings had nothing to do with his 
guilt or innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston, 42, is accused of gunning down officers John Gibson and  
Jacob J. Chestnut in a corridor of the Capitol on July 24. He was 
returned to the District of Columbia Tuesday after spending 30 days 
at the U.S. Medical Facility for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, 
Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendant has steadfastly refused to talk with and be  
examined by either the court-appointed experts or the government's 
expert,'' federal prosecutors wrote in a motion filed with the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Wolfson, a government psychiatrist, told the court  
that ``Mr. Weston's unwillingness to cooperate does not mean that a 
psychiatric examination has not been going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfson noted that observances of Weston's body language, eye  
movements and expressions would also play a role in his assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston was examined by a court-appointed government psychiatrist  
last October. Dr. Sally Johnson, associate warden at the Federal 
Corrections Institute at Butner, N.C., determined that he was 
incompetent to stand trial and recommended indefinite 
hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	In ordering a second evaluation, Sullivan cited the possibility  
that Weston could face the death penalty if convicted. A 
government-appointed psychiatrist who has attempted to examine 
Weston since Jan. 28 was refused again on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Debra DePrato, director of the Law and Psychiatry Center at  
Louisiana State University, has sought three more weeks to examine 
Weston, who is now at the District of Columbia Corrections 
Treatment Facility.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen early Thursday on  
declining interest rates in Japan. Tokyo share prices edged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.94 yen in early trading, up 0.76 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its level of 121.77 yen in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average was up 6.47 points, or 0.05 percent,  
moving to 14,176.83 in early trading. On Wednesday, the average 
closed up 249.30 points, or 1.79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar continued to gain ground  
against the yen after Japan's central bank had pumped liquidity 
into the Japanese banking system. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Bank of Japan flooded the interbank loan  
market with cash by purchasing short-term government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The action drove the call rate, used by major banks making  
overnight loans to each other, down to a minuscule 0.02 percent 
from 0.07 percent the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is now struggling to bail out of its worst recession in  
decades. Lowering interest rates make cheap cash available and spur 
more spending, while helping cash-stripped companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 132.96 yen, up from  
132.25 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the lower interest rates and stronger  
dollar helped keep share prices in a narrow range. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 2.55 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,102.36 
points. The TOPIX closed up 7.73 points, or 0.71 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bonds  
rose to 1.675 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.670 percent, 
driving its price down to 101.00 yen from 101.04 yen.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks soared today as investors were cheered  
by a decline in interest rates and a falling yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 249.30 points,  
or 1.79 percent, to close at 14,170.36. On Tuesday, the average 
closed down 300.69 points, or 2.11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar jumped to 121.18 yen in late afternoon trading, up  
1.10 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and higher than its late New 
York level of 120.23 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rose after the central bank drove Japan's already super  
low short term interest rates to nearly zero by flooding the 
interbank loan market with cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The call rate, which big banks use when they make overnight  
loans to each other, fell to as low as 0.02 percent, from 0.07 
percent the day before. Other interest rates, including those for 
long term bonds, fell in line. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower rates were welcomed by the stock market, where  
investors had worried that a recent rise in interest rates would 
erode corporate profits by raising borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the weakening yen boosted exporter stocks  
because Japanese products are more competitive abroad when the yen 
falls. 
</P>
<P>
	By the close of trading the Nikkei had nearly recovered from its  
big decline Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday's drop was overdone,'' said Kazuhiro Nomura, head of  
trading at Paribas Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 7.73 points, or 0.71 percent, to 1,099.81 
points. The TOPIX closed down 15.73 points, or 1.42 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the main section fell to 395.30 million shares, from  
457.38 million shares Tuesday. Rising shares outnumbered declines 
691 to 411, while 195 issues finished the day unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the falling Japanese interest rates pulled  
the yen lower against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining interest rates could lower the return to investors on  
everything from bank deposits to government bonds. A country's 
currency often falls when interest rates do on the theory that some 
investors will pull their money out of the county to seek higher 
returns elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	After trading as low as 119.88 yen in the morning, the dollar  
surged to as high as 121.30 yen in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at 132.25 yen, up from 131.08 yen late  
Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.690 percent from Tuesday's finish of 
1.805 percent, driving its price up to 100.88 yen from 99.96 yen.

<HEADLINE> Parent Accused in Teacher Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When his daughter brought home near-failing grades  
on her report card, Dale Robinson allegedly got angry -- but not 
with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 35, was charged Wednesday with walking into the girl's  
school and beating up her math teacher, breaking some of his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We anticipate some parents will always be concerned or  
unsatisfied around report card time,'' said the school headmaster, 
Steven Leonard. ``But in this case, the value system seems to be a 
little warped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teacher Antonio Centeio had given Robinson's daughter -- a  
high-school senior -- a D-minus in math and a D in effort. On 
Tuesday morning, Robinson arrived at the Jeremiah Burke High School 
and confronted Centeio in a hallway. 
</P>
<P>
	``He chased the teacher down and punched him in the head  
twice,'' Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking off in his car, the 6-foot-8 Robinson said, ``I  
never lose,'' according to Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, a self-described minister and youth counselor, pleaded  
innocent to assault and battery charges. School officials said it 
wasn't the first time Robinson had come around.

<HEADLINE> Zoo Puts Chimps on Birth Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The monkey business among chimps is  
perplexing zookeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	After the surprise birth of Toshi a month ago and tests  
confirming two more pregnancies, four of the adult female 
chimpanzees at the Los Angeles Zoo are being given birth control 
pills. 
</P>
<P>
	The mystery is that the three breeding-age males have had  
vasectomies. The oldest male, 45-year-old Toto, didn't have a 
vasectomy because he's never produced offspring or showed an 
interest in breeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other males -- 2-year-old Ripley and 4-year-old Glenn -- are  
believed to be too young to breed. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood samples from Jedeo, 20, Shaun, 10, Herrard, 9, and Glenn  
will be taken to determine paternity. They will also take a blood 
or semen sample from Toto. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't been ruled out, but it's unlikely,'' said Vicki  
Bingaman, the zookeeper who crushes the birth control pills and 
mixes it with the chimps' morning strawberry yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests show 12-year-old Gracie will likely give birth at the end  
of the month and 15-year-old Regina should deliver sometime this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we had a fail-proof method with the vasectomies.  
But the urologist who helped with these vasectomies told me that 
there is a 1 percent failure rate in humans. The rate for chimps is 
unknown,'' Dr. Cynthia Stringfield said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The zoo now has 14 chimps, 11 of them zoo-born.

<HEADLINE> Man Ordered Killings for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An immigrant who got his start pumping gas and  
became a millionaire with service stations in four states has been 
convicted of ordering two killings to protect his operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gurmeet Singh Dhinsa, 36, was found guilty Tuesday in federal  
court of murder in the aid of racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also convicted of rigging gas pumps to rip off motorists,  
evading taxes and terrorizing fellow immigrants who threatened to 
expose him. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury will return on Monday to hear evidence on whether he  
should get the death penalty or life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Dhinsa arrived in the United States in 1982 from India's Punjab  
region and took a job pumping gas. He saved enough money to lease 
that gas station, then began opening others. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, his City Gas chain had 51 stations in New York, New  
Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware, and employed 300 people. Annual 
revenue topped $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But the city repeatedly cited Dhinsa for overcharging customers.  
And in 1990, he was arrested in the kidnap-torture of one of his 
attendants. He served 90 days in jail on lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, another City Gas employee vanished. When the employee's  
brother confronted Dhinsa, the businessman allegedly paid a 
criminal to kill the brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Dhinsa struck again in 1997, ordering the  
killing of a cab driver who was cooperating in an FBI investigation 
of City Gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Benton Campbell described Dhinsa as a ``man who uses  
murder as a way of doing business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Gerald Shargel said Dhinsa was a victim of  
false testimony from the hit men and rumors spread by rival Sikhs 
in New York.

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Witholding Worker Comp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State workers' compensation system insurers  
cannot be sued for withholding health-care benefits for 
work-related injuries while they decide whether the treatment is 
reasonable and necessary, the Supreme Court said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous ruling, in a Pennsylvania case, said both public  
and private insurers can withhold payment while that deciding. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law expressly limits an employee's entitlement to  
'reasonable' and 'necessary' medical treatment,'' Chief Justice 
William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court. Injured workers ``do not 
have a property interest ... in having their providers paid for 
treatment that has yet to be found reasonable and necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court added that private companies that serve as workers'  
compensation insurers cannot be sued because they did not act in 
the role of the state. Only government action, not a private 
citizen's acts, can violate someone's constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices reversed a lower court decision that let a group of  
injured workers sue insurers for withholding their benefits pending 
a review of their treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other states, Pennsylvania requires employers to pay for  
medical care for workers who suffer job-related injuries and 
diseases, and to partially replace lost wages. The state law 
requires payment for ``reasonable and necessary'' medical services. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the state legislature responded to the rising cost of  
workplace injuries by allowing insurers to withhold payments for 
disputed medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of injured workers sued state officials and private  
insurers, saying the withholding of benefits violated their 
due-process rights. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge threw out the claims against the private  
insurers on grounds they were not state agencies, and said the 
state officials' actions did not violate the workers' due-process 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the lawsuits,  
saying the private insurers were acting for the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 3rd Circuit court's decision last year, Pennsylvania  
has changed its procedures. No benefits are withheld until an 
employee receives notice that a review has been requested and has a 
chance to submit written testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court reversed the appeals court's ruling. Rehnquist  
wrote that injured workers have a right only to reasonable and 
necessary medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``What (the workers) ask in this case is that insurers be  
required to pay for patently unreasonable, unnecessary and even 
fraudulent medical care without any right, under state law, to seek 
reimbursement from providers,'' he added. Further, he said, a 
decision by private insurers to withhold payment pending review 
cannot be considered a state action. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is American manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co. vs.  
Sullivan, 97-2000.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Caution on Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If budget surpluses now are going to help pay  
for Social Security in the future, the key issue confronting 
Congress is how to make sure the extra money is somehow saved, 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whichever direction the Congress chooses to go, whether toward  
privatization or fuller funding of Social Security, augmenting our 
national savings has to be the main objective,'' Greenspan told a 
House Commerce subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Surpluses could be saved through a plan like President Clinton's  
that would pay down the national debt, making it more likely the 
government will continue to run large surpluses that could be used 
for Social Security in the future, Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, the surpluses could be used to help start private investment  
accounts that many Republicans would like to see replace some 
future benefits. In that case, individual Americans would do the 
saving themselves, Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the central bank chairman said he likes Clinton's plan, he  
also said he fears that politicians inevitably would be tempted to 
spend future budget surpluses on other things -- such as tax cuts or 
other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the capacity to have a fully funded private system is  
far higher ... than in a public system where you have the 
possibilities of having to deal with very large surpluses, which 
can be employed for other means,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed chairman, however, said moving Social Security money  
into stock market investments -- whether done by individuals or in 
bulk by the federal government -- cannot in and of itself improve 
the nation's overall preparedness for the coming retirement of the 
huge baby boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any increase in returns realized by Social Security must be  
offset by a reduction in returns earned on private portfolios, 
which represent, to a large extent, funds also held for 
retirement,'' Greenspan said. ``It's a shuffling of claims and 
doesn't increase the real resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Republican leaders in Congress have agreed to use  
about 60 percent of the budget surpluses expected over the next 15 
years to bolster Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, the Social Security payroll taxes collected from  
workers each year is more than enough to cover the needed 
retirement benefits paid out each year. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 2013, after baby boomers begin to retire, the program  
will not collect enough taxes from workers to cover the baby 
boomers' benefits. Lawmakers now are trying to decide how best to 
prepare for that shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed paying down the national debt to help grow  
the economy and therefore increase future tax revenues. He also 
wants the government to invest some money in the stock market to 
try to increase its value. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many Republicans -- and some Democrats -- would prefer to  
use the surpluses to develop a new system of personal accounts, 
which workers could invest in the stock market themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Younger workers would be allowed to divert into such accounts  
some of the payroll taxes they would otherwise pay. The surpluses 
would be used to help maintain current Social Security benefits for 
those already retired or near retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The hope is that, for the younger workers, stock market accounts  
would grow big enough to replace some Social Security benefits.

<HEADLINE> Most Uninterested in Monica's Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some results from the Gallup Poll about Monica Lewinsky,  
President Clinton and the release of her televised interview and 
book. When results do not total 100 percent, the remainder did not 
know or offered no answer. 

</P>
<P>
	--Would you personally be interested in reading the book about  
Monica Lewinsky when it comes out? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, would be interested, 8 percent; no, would not be  
interested, 92 percent. 

</P>
<P>
	--Based on what you have seen in the news, how do you feel toward  
the following people -- very sympathetic, somewhat sympathetic, 
somewhat unsympathetic, very unsympathetic: 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: Very sympathetic, 11 percent; somewhat sympathetic, 20  
percent; somewhat unsympathetic, 18 percent; very unsympathetic, 47 
percent. The number of people who are very unsympathetic toward 
Clinton has risen from a third to almost half in just over a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Clinton: Very sympathetic, 37 percent; somewhat  
sympathetic, 32 percent; somewhat unsympathetic, 10 percent; very 
unsympathetic, 17 percent. These numbers are fairly consistent with 
results a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky: Very sympathetic, 3 percent; somewhat sympathetic,  
23 percent; somewhat unsympathetic, 24 percent; very unsympathetic, 
46 percent. The number of people who are very unsympathetic toward 
Ms. Lewinsky has increased by 20 percentage points since that 
question was asked during the impeachment trial. 

</P>
<P>
	--Thinking about Bill Clinton as a person, do you have a positive  
or negative opinion of him? 
</P>
<P>
	Positive, 32 percent; negative, 60 percent. In December, people  
in a Gallup poll were about equally divided on how they view 
Clinton. 

</P>
<P>
	The Gallup Poll of 1,013 people was taken Friday through Sunday  
and has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> FBI Takes Anthrax Hoaxes Seriously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With phony anthrax threats popping up daily  
around the nation, the FBI is investigating every one in the hope 
that federal prosecution of the culprits will halt the disruptive 
hoaxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The fake threats ``have gotten publicity and scare the normal  
citizen. They create a fear factor,'' Neil J. Gallagher, FBI 
Assistant Director in charge of the national security division, 
said Tuesday. ``They disrupt American life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, all the anthrax threats have been hoaxes, but the bureau  
must respond seriously to every one. 
</P>
<P>
	``My personal fear is that someday there will be a real anthrax  
threat, and American society will react by saying, `There's another 
hoax','' Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporadic threats of contamination with the potentially lethal  
anthrax bacterium date back several years. But beginning last fall 
and accelerating in the past few weeks, the FBI has seen a spate of 
letters, containing a sticky substance or a dark powder and the 
ominous warning: You've been contaminated by anthrax. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters have arrived in almost every region -- often at 10 or  
15 similar targets in a city. The targets have varied widely: 
Abortion clinics, Catholic schools, nightclubs, department stores, 
hospitals, post offices, courthouses, news media offices, FBI 
offices and even the Old Executive Office Building beside the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not a day goes by without us hearing from somewhere in the  
United States about an anthrax threat,'' Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anthrax threats have become what bomb threats once were or  
product tampering threats in the 1980s'' after the Tylenol 
poisoning in Illinois, said FBI spokesman Bill Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to slow this down is for us to prosecute  
someone,'' said Gallagher's deputy Dale L. Watson. ``So we are 
diligently investigating'' the hoaxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the hoaxes are federal felonies.  
</P>
<P>
	Mailing a threat to injure someone is punishable by up to six  
years in prison. Threatening to use a weapon of mass destruction, 
including a biological agent like anthrax, can bring life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles accountant Harvey Craig Spelkin, 53, was charged at  
the end of the year with such a biological threat. Federal 
prosecutors accuse him of trying to avoid a Dec. 18 appearance in 
U.S. Bankruptcy Court by telephoning the courthouse with a warning 
that anthrax might be in the air conditioning system. 
</P>
<P>
	Another man, charged in January with telephoning anthrax threats  
to a Los Angeles area hospital, is undergoing psychiatric tests. 
</P>
<P>
	They are among very few people charged so far, none of them with  
the letter-threat hoaxes. The FBI has investigated 42 incidents 
since the beginning of this year; the Justice Department could not 
say exactly how many have been charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Letter threats are difficult to investigate, Gallagher said.  
</P>
<P>
	``They don't walk into a post office where they can be spotted.  
They use a remote mailbox. You can't trace a letter to a particular 
mailbox, only to a time of day and a part of town,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not being done by one person or one group,'' Gallagher  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Some senders obviously want to publicize a cause, as in the  
letters to abortion clinics. Others are just copy cats. Sometimes 
the motive isn't apparent. Sometimes, agents believe, the sender 
wants to get a look at the response of law enforcement and rescue 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That large response ... encourages others who want the same  
response,'' Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lexington, Ky., is one of several cities where a batch of  
letters have been postmarked. Nearly 30 letters and cards 
postmarked from Lexington have been sent to women's clinics 
nationwide in the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI Laboratory's Hazardous Materials Response Unit responds  
when local authorities don't have proper equipment. They can do 
tests at the scene for anthrax, said Tom Kubic, deputy assistant 
director of the lab. Further testing in the lab can show the purity 
of any anthrax that might be found. 
</P>
<P>
	``The availability of anthrax harmful to individuals is fairly  
small,'' Kubic said. ``The steps to purify anthrax to a hazardous 
or deadly level are not generally available to the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exposure isn't always fatal. Bleach destroys anthrax, Kubic  
said, so people at some threat sites have been rinsed with a bleach 
solution as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	After one to six days, anthrax produces flu-like symptoms in  
people who inhale its spores. Once fully established, it can kill 
within 24 hours if not treated with antibiotics.

<HEADLINE> WHO Seeks Help From Tobacco Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The World Health Organization asked  
tobacco farmers Wednesday to support its efforts to reduce the 
cultivation and consumption of the crop. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency blamed 4 million deaths worldwide each year on  
diseases allegedly caused by tobacco and said that number could 
rise to 10 million within two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``WHO is not against tobacco farmers, but ... WHO is committed  
to addressing the tobacco epidemic,'' said Dr. Derek Yach, head of 
the organization's tobacco free initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Yach and other representatives of the U.N. agency met with the  
International Tobacco Growers Association to gain support for a 
public health treaty, called the Framework Convention on Tobacco 
Control. 
</P>
<P>
	WHO has invited tobacco growers, international agricultural  
agencies and the World Bank to develop long-term strategies to 
substitute other crops for tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	The organizations are also trying to reduce the number of the  
world's smokers from 1.2 billion to 800 million.

<HEADLINE> House OKs $500M for Farm Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House is trying to ease a farm credit  
crunch by making as much as $500 million available to guarantee 
loans to farmers and ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a bill passed Tuesday by voice vote, the money is not to  
be lent directly to farmers but is to be used to back up loans and 
ward off default. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department is running out of money to make loans  
at a time when demand for them is high because of natural disasters 
and low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The money also is intended to help farmers until Congress has a  
chance to vote on whether to grant President Clinton's request for 
$153 million in extra money this year for emergency loans and for 
hiring temporary government workers to handle a heavy demand for 
disaster help. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of the money targeted in Tuesday's House bill is limited  
until April 1 to a program for beginning farmers and ranchers. 
After that, the government may make it available to anybody 
eligible for USDA-guaranteed loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would make the money available for loan  
guarantees immediately because the funds are not being used and are 
not expected to be used, according to a statement released by the 
Republican House Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Freeing up the Beginning Farmer guaranteed loan money, which  
is not being used, will be of great benefit to agricultural 
producers,'' Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to take action to make sure they survive and give them  
an opportunity to prosper,'' said Rep. Bob Etheridge, D-N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also requires the agriculture secretary to give  
priority to guaranteed loan applications from beginning farmers and 
ranchers under any additional money Congress allocates for this 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	No corresponding bill has yet been introduced in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	The House measure's sponsor, Agriculture Committee chairman Rep.  
Larry Combest, R-Texas, said he's holding Washington bureaucrats 
accountable for ``failing to deliver farms disaster aid to 
producers authorized by Congress nearly 4 1/2 months ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department's plans for distribution of disaster relief  
payments means farmers probably won't see the money until May. 
``Help is many months past producers' expectations and the 
department's own promises,'' Combest said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Clinton said economic turmoil in Asia and elsewhere  
continues ``to make it difficult for American farmers and ranchers 
to export their goods overseas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposal would provide $1.1 billion in direct  
loans or loan guarantees for an estimated 10,000 producers who 
can't get credit from private sources. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 882.

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Sante Fe Bus Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A bus carrying elementary school students  
home from a ski outing crashed and overturned on a narrow canyon 
road, killing two people and injuring more than 30. 
</P>
<P>
	One child and one adult died yesterday after being thrown  
through the windshield just outside Santa Fe, Sheriff Ray Sisneros 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of students walking along the roadway. They  
were bleeding and crying and frantic,'' said Whitney Russell, who 
came upon the scene moments after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were scared,'' said Kevin Henson of the Santa Fe County  
Fire Department. ``They were saying, `Call my Mom.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Katherine Eagleson, whose 11-year-old son was hurt in the crash,  
said the boy described children being tossed around inside the 
vehicle ``like a box of marbles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dead were identified as Eric Garcia, 11, and Gary Apodaca,  
44, a chaperone. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus that crashed was one of three that was carrying students  
from six local elementary schools back from the Santa Fe Ski Area. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-two people were treated at St. Vincent Hospital. Eight  
people remained hospitalized today, including one child in critical 
condition and another in serious, said hospital spokeswoman Bernie 
Padilla. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus driver, Robert Heusner, told investigators the brakes  
had failed, Sisneros said. But the owner of the bus company, Ray 
Sena, said his fleet had new brakes installed only two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus went up onto an embankment and struck a large rock  
before overturning, sheriff's Capt. Terry Delgado said.

<HEADLINE>  Mrs. Clinton Teases with Comment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton left her supporters more  
excited than ever about her potential Senate candidacy with a 
comment that was tantalizingly vague. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot drop out of the political process and leave it to  
others,'' she told 900 people at a Democratic National Women's 
Leadership Forum luncheon at the Plaza Hotel today. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether she was referring to herself or merely  
encouraging women to get involved in electing candidates who will 
represent their interests. But many in the audience interpreted the 
statement as a sign of her own interest in running. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like she might be leaning toward running. It  
sounded very positive to me,'' said Manhattan Borough President 
Virginia Fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also teased her audience by asking why attendance  
at the luncheon was so high -- 400 people were added to the guest 
list after the original 500 tickets sold out, and many of the 
latecomers were seated in an adjacent room where they actually 
could not see Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was talk I might have an announcement to make,'' Mrs.  
Clinton said. She then paused and added: ``I do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the audience groaned.  
</P>
<P>
	Her comment about not dropping out of the political process was  
made while stressing the positive effect politics can have on 
people's lives. When the speech ended, her supporters began 
chanting ``Go, go, go! Run, Hillary, run!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, she was greeted at a Queens middle school with raucous  
applause from students, education officials and local politicians. 
She spoke about the importance of arts education and unveiled a new 
report that cites the school, I.S. 25 in Flushing, for its 
attention to the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	Students in the chorus, fidgeting nervously in a hallway before  
performing for the first lady, said they hoped she would run. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's cool, she's not snotty, she's like a real, regular  
person,'' said 14-year-old Tiffany Mance. 
</P>
<P>
	This is her first trip to New York since announcing she was  
considering a run for office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who would be Mrs. Clinton's most likely  
rival should she run, did not attend the event -- he was in 
Washington. But earlier this week, his staff noted that the arts 
program Mrs. Clinton was championing did not receive any federal 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some students don't learn well just sitting and listening,''  
Mrs. Clinton said in the school auditorium. ``They need to move, 
they need to use their hands, and then ... the arts are a part of 
who we are,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``As a tone-deaf person in elementary school, I was  
told I could sit with my friends in the soprano section if I 
lip-synched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also met with nine students in one of the classrooms. Some  
were sketching with pastels; others performed a short interpretive 
dance for her. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls taken a few weeks ago gave her a commanding lead in a  
hypothetical match-up with Giuliani for the Senate seat being 
vacated by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But another statewide poll released today showed a narrowing of  
the potential race. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 702 registered voters conducted Sunday and  
Monday by Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion found Mrs. 
Clinton favored by 50 percent of voters with Giuliani the choice of 
46 percent. The gap was the same as the poll's margin of error of 
plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight she is to dine at the home of Roger Altman, a Wall  
Street financier. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, she is to talk at the United Nations about the  
forthcoming International Women's Day before returning to a 
classroom to view an HBO documentary on women and sports at a 
school in the Chelsea district of Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel OKs Y2k Lawsuit Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee on Wednesday approved a  
bill aimed at curbing what many fear could be up to $1 trillion in 
lawsuits arising from Year 2000 computer failures. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry-backed measure, endorsed by the Commerce Committee  
on a party-line 11-9 vote, would limit damages from economic 
losses, allow a ``good faith'' defense for companies trying to make 
the needed repairs and establish a 90-day waiting period for filing 
suits so companies can make those repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief sponsors, committee chairman Sen. John McCain,  
R-Ariz., and Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., would ensure that 
companies can concentrate on fixing computers rather than fending 
off lawsuits. Being ``distracted by the potential for litigation in 
an almost unlimited sense,'' Gorton said, ``is not socially 
desirable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat  
on the panel, said the market is already adjusting to the problem, 
with companies cutting suppliers that aren't addressing the Y2K 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving laggards a three-month grace period, Hollings said, was  
``monkeyshines replacing fundamental contract law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, in hearings earlier this week on a similar  
bill introduced by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, 
R-Utah, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., also expressed concern 
that limiting lawsuits could be a disincentive for companies to 
prepare for Y2K problems and a restriction on the rights of victims 
to sue for redress. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he was willing to amend his bill to meet some  
Democratic objections. ``I don't think our goal is to just have 
this go to the floor and have it killed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., one of the Senate's leading  
experts on the Y2K problem, said Tuesday that keeping lawsuits from 
getting out of control was a critical issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a chance of passing some limited liability  
legislation if it's focused on this issue and is not used as an 
opportunity to drive a fleet of Mack trucks through the tort system 
of this country,'' Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd and Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, on Tuesday issued a  
comprehensive report concluding that most Americans will not 
experience major disruptions on Jan. 1, 2000, when computers that 
use only two digits to delineate the year might mistake 2000 for 
1900. But the report also pointed to serious concerns in such 
fields as health care, foreign oil supplies and some government 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Manufacturers on Wednesday released  
a survey of its members showing that nearly 90 percent of large 
companies were confident that their vendors and suppliers will have 
tested and fixed Y2K systems by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller companies were less sure, with 72 percent optimistic  
about their business partners, while 2 percent said those partners 
would not be ready and one-quarter saying they didn't know.

<HEADLINE> Study Refutes Dopamine Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dopamine may not be the brain's ``feel-good'' chemical after  
all, a study found, suggesting that scientists trying to unlock the 
secrets of drug addiction may have been off-target for the past two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The naturally produced brain chemical, rather than being the key  
player in the pleasure process, is only a messenger and one of 
several factors, according to the study, published Thursday in the 
journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly says the picture is much more complicated than  
being just dopamine alone, and it will lead to the search for other 
chemical substances in the brain,'' said the study's author, 
chemist R. Mark Wightman of the University of North Carolina-Chapel 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Dopamine, first discovered in 1957, came into prominence in the  
early 1960s when scientists discovered that several antipsychotic 
drugs targeted it. In the late 1970s, researchers began looking 
into its role in drug addiction and found that cocaine, heroin and 
other addictive drugs increase levels of dopamine in the body. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, some scientists have tried to develop a medication  
that would cure cocaine addiction by blocking dopamine. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest study is another in a series that have cast doubt on  
that approach. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers attached electrodes to the brains of rats, which  
produced dopamine when they were shocked. The rats were then 
trained to shock themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	As the rats continued to shock themselves, however, the  
researchers discovered that the amount of dopamine produced by 
their brains decreased -- even though they continued to seek 
pleasure by pressing the lever that electrically stimulated their 
brains. 
</P>
<P>
	Dopamine appears to be related to ``novelty, predictability or  
some other aspect of the reward process, rather than to hedonism 
itself,'' the researchers reported. 
</P>
<P>
	What chemical or process is ultimately responsible for the  
pleasure is ``not really clear right now. That's something that's a 
real topic of investigation,'' said Anthony Grace, a professor of 
neuroscience and psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh who was 
not involved in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Grace said that even if dopamine is not the ultimate reward for  
the brain, it might still be the key to curing addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis White, chairman of cellular and molecular pharmacology  
at the Chicago Medical School, said the study adds to the growing 
belief that the pleasure process has been oversimplified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are beginning to understand the complexity of  
the situation and no longer think about things as simply as they 
once did,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some researchers now complain that dopamine's activity in the  
brain has been overstated. Alan I. Leshner, director of the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse, has criticized what he called 
``the dopamine religion'' among some scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Caron, a professor of cell biology at the Duke University  
Medical Center, found evidence last year that the effects of 
cocaine are not solely controlled by dopamine. Caron created 
specially bred mice without dopamine transporters, and found they 
still wanted cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Medications that block the transporters in humans, however,  
might be effective if they could block the desire for cocaine long 
enough to break the addiction, Grace said. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina researchers were able to obtain real-time  
results of the effect of the electrical stimulation using 
specially-treated carbon fibers. Caron said the carbon fiber method 
will allow for more sophisticated neurological work.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Olympic Openness Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake Olympic organizers would have to  
open most of their meetings and documents under a bill that passed 
the Utah Legislature on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	House Bill 285, sponsored by House Minority Leader Dave Jones,  
requires the Salt Lake Organizing Committee to develop operating 
rules to open its meetings and documents to the public as a 
condition of $59 million the state invested to build Olympic 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that this will ensure that we have an open and  
accountable Olympics,'' said Sen. Karen Hale, who carried the bill 
in the Senate. ``I think it will ensure that the public will be 
open to SLOC and they'll be very supportive, and I think we'll have 
one of the best Olympics ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said SLOC would be required to submit its open meetings  
policies to the organization's management committee and to a newly 
formed legislative Olympic Oversight Committee for review no later 
than Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitt Romney, SLOC's new president, has expressed commitment to a  
spirit of openness in the games, and Shelley Thomas, SLOC's vice 
president for communications, said an ad hoc committee has been 
meeting to draft proposed policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``They met yesterday literally for about 2 1/2 hours. They're  
starting to formulate policies, but basically Rep. Jones' desires 
mirror our own,'' said Thomas on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he appreciates those efforts but wants more.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've asked for SLOC to do this voluntarily and they're moving  
in that direction, but we're not going to know (their policies) 
until after the session,'' he said. ``In light of all that has gone 
on, we need more than assurances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake bid officials were found to have given lavish gifts,  
free medical care, college scholarships, junkets and cash payments 
to members of the International Olympic Committee who voted to 
award the 2002 Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate amended the bill to exempt meetings of SLOC's ethics  
panel, compensation committee and auditing committee from those 
required to be open. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Millie Peterson believes exempting compensation committee  
hearings went too far. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale argued that SLOC employees actually work for a private  
entity. Sen. Beverly Evans, who sponsored the amendments, also 
argued the compensation meetings demanded special consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have crafted this very carefully with the bill sponsor,''  
Evans said. ``This is one we felt that had such sensitivity that we 
wanted to leave it in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson argued that public outrage over compensation packages  
awarded to some SLOC officials warrant opening those meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been embarrassing for the entire state to have this  
whole scandal,'' Peterson said. ``They (compensation hearings) 
should be open because it's not just a private entity. It 
represents us to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said SLOC's ethics panel is technically independent of  
the organizing committee and the panel sometimes needs 
confidentiality in order to gather complete information. She 
pointed to the 300-page report the panel released on the bribery 
scandal and said the ethics board will always issue a comprehensive 
report of their findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The House agreed to the Senate's amendments, and the bill will  
go to Gov. Mike Leavitt for approval.

<HEADLINE> IRA-Type Accounts for Farmers Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With farmers facing another year of declining  
exports and depressed prices, lawmakers on Wednesday proposed new 
IRA-type savings accounts to encourage them to save money in boom 
years to help weather the busts. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second try for Rep. Kenny Hulshof, R-Mo., who as a  
primary sponsor of the measure saw the idea scrapped late last 
year. This year, it has enthusiastic support from both parties and 
from more than three dozen farm groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Farm Bureau President Bob Stallman said legislation to  
help producers save for tough times by deferring taxes on part of 
their incomes is one of the best ways for government to make the 
market less volatile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too much rain, too little rain, disease problems and low  
prices are threatening family farms that have been in business for 
generations,'' said Stallman, a rice producer from Columbus, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored by Hulshof, Democratic Rep. Karen Thurman of Florida  
and more than 80 other lawmakers, the Farm and Ranch Risk 
Management act, or FARRM, would allow farmers -- individuals, not 
corporate operations -- to make tax-free contributions to the 
accounts of up to 20 percent of their annual taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
	``The really bad news is that some of the resulting farm sales  
and foreclosures could have been prevented if farmers and ranchers 
had FARRM accounts,'' Stallman said at a Capitol news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The money could be held in the accounts for up to five years  
without penalty and would be taxable on withdrawal. Money held more 
than five years would be subject to a 10 percent penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that's doable,'' said Hulshof, who along  
with Thurman is a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means 
Committee. He said its estimated cost is $500 million over five 
years; $900 million over ten.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Democrats Proclaim Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton stood today with Democratic  
lawmakers who stood with him during impeachment and said ``We are 
organized and we are united'' as the Republican-controlled Congress 
gets down to business. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Democratic leaders pledged  
support for a ``Families First'' agenda of protecting Social 
Security and Medicare, improving education and health care and 
raising the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	But as much as trumpeting their proposals -- most of which  
Clinton highlighted in his State of the Union address in January -- 
party officials sought to project an image of unity at a time when 
Republicans are still struggling to formulate detailed legislative 
plans of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was the first of its kind since Clinton's impeachment  
and trial, and coincidentally came on the day that Monica 
Lewinsky's televised interview was airing on ABC. Neither she nor 
the scandal was mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was greeted warmly by House Democratic leader Dick  
Gephardt of Missouri, Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South 
Dakota and others who recently had been sharply condemning his 
behavior with Ms. Lewinsky and seeking his formal censure rather 
than impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	And onetime rivals Gore and Gephardt embraced in a public  
display of unity -- the vice president running for president in 
2000, the other forsaking a White House campaign in hopes of 
leading Democrats back into the majority in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called for a ``new energy'' in Congress this year and  
urged Democrats to look beyond what seems at times ``to be 
excessive partisanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president welcomed Republican agreement to his proposal to  
set aside 62 percent of the budget surplus to help buttress Social 
Security and urged the GOP anew to set aside an additional 15 
percent for Medicare. ``They have not done that so far,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once those two steps are agreed on, he said, ``we can have an  
honest and principled disagreement about how much and what kind of 
tax cut we need with the rest, about how much should go to 
education, how much should go to defense, how much should go to 
medical research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are in the enviable position of having a program  
crafted, at the same time Republicans are still working to put 
together a budget for the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, kicked off a campaign for  
tax relief during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I disagree with pollsters and pundits who say Americans don't  
care about tax relief,'' he said. ``If they spend a minute outside 
of Washington, their eyes will be opened to the enormous tax burden 
on real people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Republicans have yet to agree on what type of  
tax relief to push for. Earlier enthusiasm for a 10 percent across 
the board cut has waned, in favor of targeted reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from Medicare and Social Security, Democrats declared  
their support for several education proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	These include federal tax credits to modernize schools; money to  
reach the goal of hiring 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size 
and money for after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Democrats favor tax cuts for long-term care and  
child care and, in one of the more controversial proposals in his 
budget, the president recommended the government invest a portion 
of the surplus in the stock market to provide individuals with 
retirement accounts beyond Social Security.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Treasury Scandal Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two state employees were arrested Wednesday on  
charges of stealing $2.4 million, the latest development in a 
scandal that has rocked the state treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were charged with stealing from the state treasury's  
Unclaimed Check Fund, an account containing money from uncashed 
state checks. Officials believe several million dollars may have 
been siphoned off over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is almost beyond belief,'' Attorney General Thomas Reilly  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Foley, 39, who left his job as deputy treasurer in charge  
of cash management last week, was charged with larceny and bribery. 
Thomas Ciliberto, 51, of Woonsocket, R.I., faces the same charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly said the thefts involved an heir-finder scam and that  
Ciliberto had an heir-finder business, reuniting unclaimed money 
and property with owners for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no answer at Ciliberto's home Wednesday and Foley's  
number was unlisted. Their lawyers' names were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley is accused of stealing $1.6 million between 1992 and 1993  
and $812,000 in 1994 and 1995. Ciliberto is charged in the latter 
theft, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate case, a longtime treasury employee who was Foley's  
subordinate in charge of the Unclaimed Check Fund was arrested in 
mid-February and charged with helping a friend fraudulently claim 
$6.5 million from the fund.

<HEADLINE> Changes Could Disrupt 2000 Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Any changes in plans for next year's census  
would be disruptive and waste valuable time, Census Bureau Director 
Kenneth Prewitt says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are at a point in this census which, if we don't get about  
it, we're not going to get it done,'' he told the House Government 
Reform census subcommittee Tuesday. ``We would reduce accuracy at 
this point if we start trying to introduce new procedures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., the subcommittee chairman, has outlined  
a series of proposals that he says would produce a more accurate 
head count than the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
	They include printing the forms in 33 languages, spending more  
to advertise and promote the census, enlisting Americorp volunteers 
and reviving a program that lets local officials review the 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Prewitt said most of Miller's proposals would be  
acceptable, he predicted that legislative changes at this late 
stage would cause problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``These proposals would disrupt Census 2000 and even put it at  
risk'' by reducing its accuracy, he said. Major contracts would 
have to be renegotiated, making it ``extremely difficult'' to meet 
the deadline, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The census begins in less than 13 months -- on April 1, 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Prewitt announced that the bureau would use  
traditional census methods to make the population estimates needed 
to redistribute the 435 House seats among the states. The Supreme 
Court last month said the Clinton administration's plan to use a 
scientific method known as statistical sampling for that process 
was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	But Prewitt said the bureau would use sampling to determine how  
many people were missed and develop more accurate numbers for 
states to redraw congressional and state legislative boundaries. 
The high court did not prohibit sampling for this purpose or for 
the distribution of billions of dollars in federal financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a harsh critic of sampling, said ``this two-number  
census is a recipe for disaster'' and predicted it would prompt 
lawsuits from ``every state and local government in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 census, which was the first to be less accurate than  
the one before, missed 8.4 million people and counted 4.4 million 
people twice. 
</P>
<P>
	The sampling plan was designed to avoid another miscount, but  
met strong resistance from congressional Republicans which, coupled 
with lengthy debates over the procedure, ended up delaying the 
Census Bureau's preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have accused Republicans of opposing sampling for fear  
of losing control of the House. Republicans, insisting on the 
constitutionally required head count, argue that Democrats could 
manipulate a number produced by sampling. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., cited findings of a General  
Accounting Office analysis of the 1990 census to illustrate the 
effects of an inaccurate count. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, by the investigative arm of Congress, found that 27  
states and the District of Columbia lost a combined $4.5 billion in 
federal funds during the decade because of failure to make 
recommended adjustments, Waxman said.

<HEADLINE>  Mrs. Clinton Doesn't Tip Her Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton greeted clamor for her  
Senate candidacy with an impossible-to-read smile. But the first 
lady's talk of civic duty and debts to feminist forebears made her 
sound like a woman ready to be drafted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I begin to think about the future in political terms because  
I've always believed that we are at our best as a nation when 
everybody understands their obligation as a citizen,'' Mrs. Clinton 
said Wednesday, the first day of a two-day New York visit. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour bore the hallmarks of a campaign swing: cheering  
crowds, sweeping speeches to would-be constituents, a private 
dinner with could-be campaign financiers. 
</P>
<P>
	But, to the disappointment of an oversold Democratic National  
Committee fund-raising luncheon -- and dozens of reporters from as 
far away as Denmark -- Mrs. Clinton made no announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Associates said her decision on whether to seek New York's open  
Senate seat in 2000 is still months away. 
</P>
<P>
	As long as the mystique lingers, Mrs. Clinton could be a  
powerful money magnet for Democratic fund-raisers, as evidenced by 
Wednesday's unprecedented waiting list of 300 for the $500,000 DNC 
luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	One donor, Didi Barrett, wants the first lady to become her  
state's new senator, but said New Yorkers will get impatient if 
summer comes and Mrs. Clinton is still playing guessing games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair to whoever else ends up running,'' said Barrett,  
48, head of a girls' club organization. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Chuck Schumer, who took a Republican Senate seat for  
the Democrats last year after beating incumbent Alfonse D'Amato 
with Mrs. Clinton's help, advised: ``Take a little time, think this 
one through and then, if you decide you will be a candidate, we 
will support you and we will be resolute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the luncheon crowd erupted in applause, Mrs. Clinton stood  
behind Schumer with her hands clasped, her gaze downcast, her mouth 
closed in a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	A new statewide poll suggested she could face a real battle for  
the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Where weeks ago she enjoyed an 11-point lead over New York GOP  
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the Marist Institute Poll's hypothetical 
matchup, her lead shrank to a statistically insignificant 4 points 
in the latest survey, released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boo! Go back to Arkansas!'' Gary Percivalle shouted as Mrs.  
Clinton emerged from a morning education speech at Intermediate 
School 25 in the borough of Queens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being that she's married to such a degenerate, by putting up  
with him it only proves her ignorance,'' he said. The 46-year-old 
sales distributor from Whitestone called her flirtation with 
candidacy an ego-driven ``scam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, she was sitting down to a private dinner  
with Roger Altman, a former Treasury Department official considered 
key to financing any Clinton campaign, and his Wall Street friends. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since prominent Democrats began to woo Mrs.  
Clinton for the race, she stepped from behind her spokeswoman's 
``no comments,'' publicly engaged the courtship and appeared to 
enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is just an amazing sight to behold,'' Mrs. Clinton marveled  
as she faced 900 adoring Democrats, 24 television cameras and the 
clattering shutters behind at least as many zoom lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told that there were some who thought that, ah, I might  
have an announcement to make,'' she said, with a playfully dramatic 
pause. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd went ``Ooooh.''  
</P>
<P>
	``... But I don't,'' she finished.  
</P>
<P>
	The crowd went ``Aaaah.''  
</P>
<P>
	New York Democratic Rep. Gary Ackerman, one of many whom Mrs.  
Clinton has consulted about a race, said she is serious but also 
``kind of astounded and gratified by the kind of encouragement 
she's getting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After 13 months consumed by Monica Lewinsky, Marc Rosenberg did  
not begrudge the first lady a little basking in flattery. ``Why not 
feel wanted for a change?'' said the middle-school principal from 
Queens. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton did not talk like a political spouse who would slip  
quietly out of Washington at the end of her husband's term. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot drop out of the political process,'' she said,  
recalling the suffragists' conference 150 years ago at Seneca 
Falls, N.Y. Her challenge, she added, was to decide ``whether all 
the sacrifices that were made in the past should just be honored by 
rhetoric or honored by action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Action, decided the girl-power cluster outside Intermediate  
School 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need, like, a new person in the Senate, especially a woman.  
There's too many guys,'' said Jin Kim, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow ninth-grader Alexis Rubenstein also approved of Mrs.  
Clinton as a candidate: ``She'll make her mark as first woman 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it's the Senate that Mrs. Clinton is eyeing, another girl  
reminded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I mean, this will be the first step,'' Rubenstein said.

</P>
<P>
	``Being that she's married to such a degenerate, by putting up  
with him it only proves her ignorance,'' he said. The 46-year-old 
sales distributor from Whitestone called her flirtation with 
candidacy an ego-driven ``scam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, she was sitting down to a private dinner  
with Roger Altman, a former Treasury Department official considered 
key to financing any Clinton campaign, and his Wall Street friends. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since prominent Democrats began to woo Mrs.  
Clinton for the race, she stepped from behind her spokeswoman's 
``no comments,'' publicly engaged the courtship and appeared to 
enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is just an amazing sight to behold,'' Mrs. Clinton marveled  
as she faced 900 adoring Democrats, 24 television cameras and the 
clattering shutters behind at least as many zoom lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told that there were some who thought that, ah, I might  
have an announcement to make,'' she said, with a playfully dramatic 
pause. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd went ``Ooooh.''  
</P>
<P>
	``... But I don't,'' she finished.  
</P>
<P>
	The crowd went ``Aaaah.''  
</P>
<P>
	New York Democratic Rep. Gary Ackerman, one of many whom Mrs.  
Clinton has consulted about a race, said she is serious but also 
``kind of astounded and gratified by the kind of encouragement 
she's getting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After 13 months consumed by Monica Lewinsky, Marc Rosenberg did  
not begrudge the first lady a little basking in flattery. ``Why not 
feel wanted for a change?'' said the middle-school principal from 
Queens. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton did not talk like a political spouse who would slip  
quietly out of Washington at the end of her husband's term. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot drop out of the political process,'' she said,  
recalling the suffragists' conference 150 years ago at Seneca 
Falls, N.Y. Her challenge, she added, was to decide ``whether all 
the sacrifices that were made in the past should just be honored by 
rhetoric or honored by action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Action, decided the girl-power cluster outside Intermediate  
School 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need, like, a new person in the Senate, especially a woman.  
There's too many guys,'' said Jin Kim, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow ninth-grader Alexis Rubenstein also approved of Mrs.  
Clinton as a candidate: ``She'll make her mark as first woman 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it's the Senate that Mrs. Clinton is eyeing, another girl  
reminded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I mean, this will be the first step,'' Rubenstein said.

<HEADLINE> Ramon Says He's Headed to Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Ramon Martinez said Wednesday he has  
agreed to a two-year contract to join his brother, Pedro, with the 
Boston Red Sox. The team, however, said the deal was not complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramon, recovering in the Dominican Republic from shoulder  
surgery, became available after compiling a .615 winning percentage 
in 11 seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers, who bought out his 
option. Pedro was 19-7 last season, his first with Boston after 
winning the Cy Young award with Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agreed on the deal'' for two years, Ramon said in an  
interview with WEEI radio in Boston. ``I made a decision that I'm 
now going to play for the Red Sox.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not done yet, but it sounds like they made pretty good  
progress,'' said Kevin Shea, Boston's director of communications. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Dan Duquette said Monday that the Red Sox had  
been pursuing Ramon for several months and that he had visited the 
Dominican Republic two weeks ago to watch Ramon throw. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramon, 30, was 7-3 with a 2.83 ERA last season but made only 15  
starts before a season-ending rotator cuff injury that required 
surgery June 30. In 11 seasons in Los Angeles, he had a 3.45 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers ``made some decision and ... I wasn't too happy  
about the situation and the way they handled it,'' Ramon said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told WEEI that he may be ready to pitch before the All-Star  
game, scheduled for Boston's Fenway Park on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that it's going to be pretty soon, the way that I  
feel,'' Ramon told WEEI. ``I had a different choice (of teams) but 
I decided to join my brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were teammates with Los Angeles in 1993, when Pedro pitched  
65 games as a rookie, only two of them starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be probably the first time we're going to be in the  
same rotation,'' said Pedro, 27. ``I feel happy to have my brother 
here, my best friend here. To me it would be feeling even more 
secure than I've been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Ramon is healthy, it also would give manager Jimy Williams  
more security. He already has a rotation of reliable veterans with 
Pedro Martinez, Bret Saberhagen, Tim Wakefield, Mark Portugal and 
Pat Rapp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy,'' Ramon said, ``because now we're going to be  
together again and we can help the team.''

<HEADLINE> Cepeda Leads Four Into Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- It was the spring of 1953, and a young  
teen-ager named Orlando Cepeda made quite an impression among elite 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill White and Willie McCovey, future Hall of Famers, took note.  
So did Leon Wagner and Willie Kirkland, two more prospects who 
would go on to have productive major league careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all with the Giants,'' recalled White, former NL  
president and a member of the Veterans Committee that elected 
Cepeda to the Hall of Fame on Tuesday. ``We knew then that Orlando 
was something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Cepeda would take over as the Giants' first baseman  
-- in a lineup with Willie Mays, Juan Marichal and McCovey -- after 
White was traded to St. Louis. Later, he'd wind up with the 
Cardinals, replacing White in the lineup again. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I see Orlando, he always kids me and says, `I've run you  
out of a lot of positions,'' White said. ``And, he's right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, who hit 379 home runs in a 17-year career, joined Negro  
Leagues pitcher Smokey Joe Williams, turn-of-the-century manager 
Frank Selee and former umpire Nestor Chylak as selections by the 
12-man Veterans panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the former players, managers and executives receiving  
support, but not the necessary nine votes for election, were Bill 
Mazeroski, Dom DiMaggio, Joe Gordon, Bowie Kuhn, Dick Williams and 
Whitey Herzog. 
</P>
<P>
	Marichal, a member of the Veterans panel, called Cepeda with the  
good news that they would be teammates in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a rookie on the Veterans Committee, I'm glad he got in on  
my first year,'' Marichal said. ``He was the type of player who had 
no fear, the type of player you wanted playing behind you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda batted .297 with 1,365 RBIs, and played in nine All-Star  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cried ... along with my wife (Miriam),'' said Cepeda, whose  
chances for induction widely were believed to have been hindered 
until now because of a 1975 marijuana smuggling conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to explain the feeling ... I've been ready for this  
for 17 years,'' Cepeda said at San Francisco's 3Com Park, called 
Candlestick when he played there. ``When they told me I was 
selected, I lost my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies will be held July 25 at Cooperstown, N.Y.  
Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount were elected in January by 
the Baseball Writers' Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, now works as a community relations representative  
with the Giants. The team also had a present for him -- it announced 
the retirement of his No. 30 jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda missed by just seven votes in the BBWAA election five  
years ago, his final try with the writers. He came close last year 
in voting by the Veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	A breakdown of voting was not released. However, 75 percent -- or  
nine votes -- were required for election. 
</P>
<P>
	While his brush with the law once cast suspicion about his  
character, White and other supporters said Cepeda has led an 
exemplary life since serving 10 months in prison for the drug 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good man. He's worked extremely hard for the Giants in  
the community. He lectures kids on what to do and what not to do. 
I'm glad for him,'' White said. ``When we called him, he said it 
was the happiest day of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to playing for the Giants and Cardinals, Cepeda had  
stints with the Atlanta Braves, Boston Red Sox and Kansas City 
Royals. Called the Baby Bull, he was the NL's rookie of the year in 
1958 with San Francisco and the league's first unanimous MVP in 
1967 with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Chylak, long-time AL umpire crew chief, had a 25-year major  
league career that included working six All-Star games, three 
league championship series and five World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the 16th player elected for his accomplishments in the  
Negro Leagues, pitched from 1910-32 with several teams, including 
the Homestead Grays and New York Lincoln Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander was credited with a winning percentage of .624  
and also made his mark as a tourist attraction of sorts, facing top 
major league pitchers in exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a 20-year period, Williams compiled a record of 22-7 with  
12 shutouts against white teams featuring such big league pitchers 
as Chief Bender, Rube Marquard, Pete Alexander, Walter Johnson and 
Grover Cleveland Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Selee, who had a winning percentage of .598, managed in the NL  
with Boston and Chicago from 1890 to 1905 in the National League 
with Boston and Chicago. He died in 1909.

<HEADLINE> Research Urged on Gulf War Ailments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Army veteran Victor Silvester had waited nearly a  
decade to talk with experts about his 27-year-old son, who has had 
severe headaches, memory loss and joint pain since returning from 
the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	Silvester finally got his chance this week, at a conference  
aimed at advancing research into the mysterious maladies that 
thousands of soldiers -- including his son -- say they have suffered 
since serving in the Gulf War of 1991. Silvester said he is 
hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	``The important part is there was a major channel of  
communication open today between the veterans and health 
researchers,'' said Silvester, of Odessa, Texas. ``I'm guardedly 
optimistic that something will come out of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three-day conference, which brought together government  
researchers, doctors and military veterans, sought ways for 
investigating the possible relationship between chemical exposures 
during the war and chronic symptoms being reported, including 
fatigue, joint pain and memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The answers aren't any clearer, but the participants agreed more  
research is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to get ideas out on the table. We didn't intend and  
it really wasn't our charge to select a single magic bullet,'' said 
Dr. Henry Falk, director of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention's Division of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal formulating a research agenda, and ``we have a lot of  
material to work with,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the recommendations issued Tuesday were establishing  
another committee to investigate veterans' complaints to taking a 
closer look into the effects of exposure to depleted uranium, which 
is spread into the air when armor-piercing shells and bombs 
explode. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal health officials plan to compile the suggestions into a  
report in the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
	One recommendation that got strong support was the call for a  
central database of all research involving Gulf War illness. No 
such coordination exists, and the Defense Department knows of at 
least 161 separate ongoing studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Although thousands of Gulf War veterans have complained of  
chronic illnesses, researchers have not been able to link the 
symptoms to any particular disease or biological agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 700,000 soldiers who served in the Gulf, 70,000 have been  
diagnosed with some sort of health problem -- including illnesses as 
extreme as Lou Gehrig's disease, said Diane Lawhon, a Defense 
Department spokeswoman. Another 20,000 have not received a 
diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a 1997 congressional investigation, likely causes  
of the veterans' ailments included exposure to pesticides, smoke 
from oil well fires and other toxins. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the government contends that lack of solid diagnoses or  
evidence of clear causes has hampered the path toward remedies.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Make Air Crashes Equal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Families of victims of airline crashes over  
the ocean would be able to sue for more than just economic damages 
under a bill the House passed today. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 412-2 for a bill that would exempt those  
aviation accidents from the 1920 Death on the High Seas Act, which 
bars families from collecting non-economic damages as a result of 
disasters at sea, such as the 1996 TWA 800 crash, in which 230 
people died. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said it made no sense to treat aviation accidents  
differently depending on whether they occur over water or land. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., called current law a ``bizarre  
inequity'' that arose as a result of a Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The effect of this decision is to treat families differently  
depending on whether their relative died in an aircraft that 
crashes into the ocean or one that crashes into the land,'' Shuster 
said during debate on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This act prevents a family from collecting damage for their  
relative's pain and suffering or for the loss of the companionship 
of their loved one,'' he said. ``There really is no reason why the 
monetary recovery from a lawsuit should depend upon whether the 
plane happens to comedown, whether its into the water or into the 
land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If passed by the Senate, the bill would apply to civil actions  
filed after the date of passage and to all pending cases where a 
court has not yet rendered a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed similar legislation last year, but it died in  
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 603.

<HEADLINE> Solo Yachtsman Arrives As a Winner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay (AP) -- An Italian yachtsman sailed into  
port a hero and a winner Wednesday, ready for some rest and a 
celebratory glass of wine or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is fine, everything is marvelous,'' Giovanni  
Soldini said after capturing the third leg of the Around Alone 
regatta with a rescued French competitor aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini docked his 60-foot boat FILA after a harrowing crossing  
from Auckland, New Zealand. His yacht bobbed in the harbor with a 
slogan painted on the side: ``No more problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there have been plenty of problems in this solo sailing  
competition, highlighted by the daring rescue of a French sailor 
that has overshadowed the race itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The global odyssey of more than 31,000 miles began last  
September in Charleston, S.C., and will end there in May, capping a 
grueling nine-month adventure. Earlier legs took sailors from South 
Carolina to South Africa and then to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people were on the dock when Soldini arrived at dawn.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is overwhelming,'' he said upon learning of his victory  
in the next-to-last leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government is expected to decorate Soldini. He plans  
to fly to Italy next week to join his family before the last leg 
resumes in a month. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Wednesday, he said he simply wanted to celebrate with a  
glass of wine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to lift a glass,'' he said. ``Come to think of it, a  
couple of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isabelle Autissier, who was plucked from the Southern Ocean off  
Antarctica on Feb. 16, was jubilant upon docking. She called 
Soldini a ``gentleman of the seas'' for going into harm's way to 
save her. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini braved 30-foot waves, scouring the seas until he  
happened upon her yacht. He had to throw a hammer at the overturned 
hull to awaken Autissier, who had waited inside for more than 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini won the leg ahead of Frenchman Marc Thiercelin despite  
having to go hundreds of miles out of his way. Thiercelin led 
Soldini by 18 hours upon their departure from New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Frenchman hit stormy waters in the South Atlantic last  
Thursday, lost a mast and limped last weekend to the Falkland 
Islands for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiercelin's sister, Emanuelle, told The Associated Press her  
brother might be able to leave the Falklands as early as Monday 
before heading to Punta del Este. 
</P>
<P>
	The last leg of 5,750 miles begins April 10 when the yachts are  
to sail from this port on South America's Atlantic coast to South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing authorities said Soldini's unofficial time for the third  
leg was 25 days, 9 hours, 55 minutes, 53 seconds. But they might 
adjust his time because of the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiercelin was harshly criticized for his failure to aid  
Autissier despite being about 80 miles closer than Soldini. 
Thiercelin led by hundreds of miles at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini said Wednesday a meteorologist with whom he was in  
contact helped him calculate Autissier's location. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Italian arrived at Punta Del Este just before 6  
a.m., hours earlier than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``He picked up some really nice winds just after midnight,''  
race director Mark Schrader said. ``He was doing really well.''

<HEADLINE> Big East Tourney Said Unfair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Big East coaches all agree that since the league  
expanded to 13 teams in 1995, the postseason tournament just hasn't 
been fair. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Rutgers, West Virginia and Notre Dame forced the  
change in the tournament format to include a fourth day of 
competition for all but the top three seeds. To a man, the coaches 
agree the champion will always be one of the teams that only plays 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win four games on four straight days, even for a terrific  
basketball team, is one heck of an accomplishment. I just don't 
know if many teams have ever done that,'' said Connecticut coach 
Jim Calhoun, whose Huskies (25-2) are the top seed in the 
tournament for the fifth time in the last six years. ``The extra 
day of rest for us will be good. From trying to win the Big East 
and then playing the following week, it's a huge advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other teams with a bye into Thursday's quarterfinals are  
Miami (21-5) and St. John's (23-7). 
</P>
<P>
	It's a new area for Miami coach Leonard Hamilton.  
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't gotten to that day, but I'm sure it's going to be  
nice,'' he said. ``Each year there are different goals and this 
year we're going in thinking we have a legitimate chance of winning 
the title because of the extra day. Maybe not a day of rest, but 
one of preparation will benefit the team. You won't expend as much 
energy in a practice as in a game, but that extra day of 
preparation will make you look better going into that first game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In today's games, fourth-seeded Syracuse (19-10) faced No. 13  
Boston College (6-20); while No. 5 Villanova (20-9) played No. 12 
West Virginia (10-18); No. 6 Rutgers (17-11) met No. 11 Pittsburgh 
(14-15); No. 7 Providence (16-12) faced No. 10 Georgetown (14-14); 
and No. 8 Notre Dame (14-15) met No. 9 Seton Hall (14-13). 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's tournament saw the 11th, 12th and 13th seeds win  
opening-round games and that would be devastating this year for the 
likes of Syracuse, Providence and Rutgers as they try to secure 
spots in the NCAA's field of 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutgers, which came into the tournament on a four-game losing  
streak, may even need a second win like it got last year when it 
reached the semifinals as a No. 12 seed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing we're concerned with now is getting back to  
playing good basketball and getting a much-needed win over Pitt,'' 
coach Kevin Bannon said. ``The upperclassmen will remind the others 
of last year and we may watch a little tape of it, but I want them 
to have a different attitude. Go in with a little chip on our 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them they have to win a game to get in the tournament  
and they're fine with that. We want to go there and win a couple of 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim could feel confident his Orangemen  
would get an at-large bid, barring a shocking loss to Boston 
College. Still, there was so campaigning to do for the rest of the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``With so many back and forths in the league it comes down to  
where did you finish,'' he said. ``Our conference has three top 10 
teams (No. 3 Connecticut, No. 9 Miami and No. 10 St. John's) and a 
lot of other good teams. The conference deserves as many bids as 
possible. Providence and Rutgers can play their way in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown, which won its opener over Miami last year as a 13th  
seed, needed a first-round win to keep its 25-year postseason 
streak alive because a team cannot be invited to the NIT with a 
sub-.500 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NIT would mean a lot to me personally and a lot to team,''  
said Hoyas coach Craig Esherick, who replaced John Thompson 
following his sudden resignation during his 27th season at 
Georgetown. ``Back in January, we were fighting for our lives to 
play consistently. We had a good month of February, winning some 
games. Give an awful lot of credit, if we do end up in a 
tournament, to the players for what they went through with the 
change.''

<HEADLINE> Another New Charge on Phone Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's largest local phone company, Bell  
Atlantic, will charge customers a new 24-cents-a-line monthly fee 
to pay for the costs of letting customers keep their local 
telephone numbers after they switch carriers -- even though many 
don't have that choice now. 
</P>
<P>
	Many other local phone companies have either already announced  
or have started billing customers for the new charge, ranging from 
38 to 53 cents a month for each phone line. The fee pays for local 
phone companies' costs of complying with a provision in a 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic's customers -- from Maine to Virginia -- will begin  
seeing the fee in their May bills, spokeswoman Susan Butta said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses also will pay a fee, which can vary by the services  
they get. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE, which provides local service in 28 states, meanwhile, has  
said it now will charge customers 38 cents a line rather than 43 
cents as originally planned. The fee will appear in most customers' 
bills after March 10. 
</P>
<P>
	New monthly fees last year began popping up on consumers' phone  
bills. Those charges came from a 1997 government overhaul of phone 
fees and from itemized charges for government-ordered subsidies 
once included in rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Like those fees, the newest charges are broken out in phone  
bills, under different names. They come in addition to the 
multitude of existing charges for federal, state or local taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The concept of portable phone numbers is not new. For years,  
long-distance customers have been able to change their 
long-distance carriers without getting a new phone number. 
</P>
<P>
	The rationale: Consumers would be less inclined to switch to a  
new carrier -- local or long-distance -- if they had to get a new 
phone number each time. That would thwart the goal of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law requires local phone companies to make technical  
changes that would allow customers to keep their phone numbers 
after they switch to a new local provider. 
</P>
<P>
	However, most of the local competition that has evolved since  
the 1996 law focuses mostly on lucrative, high-volume business 
customers, not on residential customers.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Gives First Major Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura sounded familiar themes in  
his first State of the State address, a staid 45-minute speech in 
which he rarely strayed from his notes and didn't tell any jokes. 
His opening observation was elegantly simple. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state of the state is great,'' the governor said in an  
address that stressed broad principles. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said before Tuesday's speech that the former pro wrestler  
once known as ``the Body'' wants to be taken seriously. So Ventura, 
who often shoots from the lip, stayed low-key as he delivered a 
message heavy on themes of limited government, an involved 
citizenry and increased responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't legislate against every stupid thing people will do,  
and yet the temptation is there to try time and time again,'' said 
Ventura, who won election last November as a third-party candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The state is jeopardized by the notion that ``taxpayers must  
step forward to provide nearly unlimited resources to anyone who 
faces adversity, who lives with circumstances they brought about 
through their own decision or who lives with consequences of 
choices to act illegally,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The free ride is over,'' said Ventura.  
</P>
<P>
	He said his administration's legacy ``will be provoking people  
out of their apathy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One ``bread and butter'' example from Ventura's speech turned  
out to be wrong, and the state Health Department has set the record 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	The disputed reference came as Ventura was urging lawmakers not  
to become overzealous regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time government burdens the people with nonsense like  
rules that dictate how to butter bread in nursing homes -- and 
believe it or not, that is a real government regulation -- we remove 
any incentive for doing good work,'' Ventura said in his speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has no rule on how nursing home workers must butter  
bread, said Health Department spokesman John Stieger. 
</P>
<P>
	The lone specific new proposal in Ventura's address was a pledge  
to increase the $10 million in his initial budget to help 
struggling farmers to $60 million over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	He alluded to one of the biggest issues of the legislative  
session -- whether surplus revenue should be returned via an income 
tax rebate or a sales tax rebate. ``As soon as you're ready to send 
me a sales tax rebate bill, I'm ready to sign it,'' said Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the bread-buttering miscue, Ventura spokesman John Wodele  
wouldn't say how the example made it into the speech. Stieger said 
it's possible the department had a bread-buttering rule several 
years ago during a period of stricter regulation, but ``if there 
was anything like it, there isn't anything like it now.''

<HEADLINE> Mass. Treasury Scandal Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In a widening scandal at the Massachusetts  
treasury, two state employees have been arrested on charges of 
stealing $2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are charged with stealing from the state treasury's  
Unclaimed Check Fund, an account containing money from uncashed 
state checks. Officials believe several million dollars may have 
been siphoned off over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is almost beyond belief,'' Attorney General Thomas Reilly  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Foley, 39, who left his job as deputy treasurer in charge  
of cash management last week, was charged Wednesday with larceny 
and bribery. Thomas Ciliberto, 51, of Woonsocket, R.I., faces the 
same charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly said the thefts involved an heir-finder scam and that  
Ciliberto had an heir-finder business, reuniting unclaimed money 
and property with owners for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley is accused of stealing $1.6 million between 1992 and 1993  
and $812,000 in 1994 and 1995. Ciliberto is charged in the latter 
theft, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no answer at Ciliberto's home Wednesday and Foley's  
number was unlisted. Their lawyers' names were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate case, a longtime treasury employee who was Foley's  
subordinate in charge of the Unclaimed Check Fund was arrested in 
mid-February and charged with helping a friend fraudulently claim 
$6.5 million from the fund.

<HEADLINE> House Takes Action Against Concorde </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- European authorities thought they were going  
to clean up the environment by cracking down on U.S. airliners 
equipped with engine mufflers known as hush kits. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they face the prospect of having their beloved but  
ear-shattering supersonic Concorde banned from U.S. skies in 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed a bill today that would bar the Concorde if the  
European Union proceeds with plans to prohibit hush-kitted American 
aircraft from flying over Europe. The bill was passed by voice 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	'' None of us relishes taking this type of retaliatory measure,  
but fair is fair,'' Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., said. ``This 
sends a simple message to our friends across the pond that we will 
respond in kind when they take this type of action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the House Rules Committee approved the bill Tuesday, members  
didn't try to hide their eye-for-an-eye approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a straight sort of rattling of swords back and forth, but  
I think that the timing of this is very important, to let them know 
that just because they've rattled their sword, we're not going away 
on the hush kits,'' said Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., a member of the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Urged on by environmentalists, the European Parliament voted  
last month to adopt a new set of aircraft engine rules. 
</P>
<P>
	One would prohibit registration of hush-kitted aircraft in  
Europe after April 1. Another would ban hush-kitted aircraft 
registered elsewhere from flying in European skies as of April 1, 
2002, unless they were operating there before the start of next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	EU officials concede that hush kits reduce noise pollution, but  
they contend they are ineffective at controlling air pollution 
since they are slapped on old engines. The Europeans prefer planes 
with new engines altogether. Final action on the rules is scheduled 
March 29. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials say the rules are arbitrary, because hush-kitted  
airplanes meet new noise limits, known as Stage 3, established by 
the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	A Commerce Department official said last month the rules could  
have a $1 billion effect on the United States by devaluing 
airplanes in the U.S. fleet, which are often resold in Europe, and 
harming hush-kit makers, all U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Concorde legislation is the brainchild of Rep. James  
Oberstar, D-Minn., top Democrat on the House Transportation 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The needle-nosed plane, famous for rocketing through the sky at  
more than twice the speed of sound, made its first flight March 2, 
1969. It is also known as a fuel hog and a noise polluter. 
</P>
<P>
	Oberstar's bill says that if the EU adopts the hush-kit rules,  
any supersonic jet that does not meet Stage 3 engine noise 
requirements will be banned from U.S. skies. The Concorde doesn't 
even meet the current standard, Stage 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Air France and British Airways are the only scheduled airlines  
flying the Concorde in the United States. Air France operates a 
daily round trip between Paris and New York, while British Airways 
flies two daily round trips between London and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	A flight takes 3 1/2 hours, about half the time of a conventional  
jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Breest, an Air France spokesman, said, ``If it's banned,  
it's going to inconvenience a lot of business travelers traveling 
to Europe who need the timesaving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Lampl, a British Airways spokesman, added: ``We feel that  
British Airways and ultimately the Concorde is not an appropriate 
target for sanctions in a purely trade dispute.''

<HEADLINE> Disability Ruling Impacts Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) -- Garret Frey maneuvers through his high  
school hallways by blowing into a straw to steer his oversized 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	A nurse and teacher's aide are always at his side, looking after  
a daily care regimen that includes urinary catheterization, 
clearing his tracheotomy, monitoring blood pressure and responding 
to alarms on his ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court held Wednesday that the boy's school  
district must pay for his nursing care, a decision he called a 
victory for disabled students far beyond the halls of Cedar Rapids 
Jefferson High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has a chance to have a free education,'' Frey said.  
``It's going to help a lot of other kids. Not just me and other 
kids in Iowa. It's going to help all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But school administrators, while sympathetic to the  
16-year-old's case, fear their new financial burdens could be 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 15,000-plus school districts in the country that are  
watching this case,'' said Lew Finch, superintendent of the Cedar 
Rapids School District. ``Where do you draw the line with how you 
handle medically fragile kids?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Richard Ott, executive director of the North Dakota School  
Boards Association: ``We're already strapped. We can't do the 
things we're wanting and trying to do now. The costs of special 
education are mounting continuously, and if you even indicate that 
you want to examine them, you're accused of being opposed to kids 
with handicaps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act provides  
that all children with disabilities receive a ``free appropriate 
public education.'' The 1975 law requires public schools to provide 
special education services, but an exception is made for medical 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	In Frey's case, the court ruled 7-2 that his continuous care  
during the school day is not medical treatment and must be publicly 
funded under the act. 
</P>
<P>
	The district has estimated the ruling will cost $30,000 to  
$40,000 per year in addition to the $10,000 to $12,000 now spent to 
provide Frey with a teacher associate. 
</P>
<P>
	The National School Boards Association estimates there are  
17,000 students nationwide with severe disabilities. The financial 
arithmetic -- conceivably running into the hundreds of millions -- 
frightens the districts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is going to provide that money?'' asked Sue Seitz,  
attorney for the Cedar Rapids district. ``So far the federal 
government certainly hasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government now pays about 12 percent of the nation's  
special education costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Seid Margolis of the National Association of Protection  
and Advocacy Services, downplayed the fiscal alarms sounded by the 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are kids with health needs who have had access to the  
services publicly without a need to battle for them,'' she said. 
``Secondly, there aren't that many kids in this division so, in 
terms of numbers, it's not like the flood gates are going to open 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frey was paralyzed in a motorcycle accident when he was 4 years  
old. Until now, his family has paid for his care with money from a 
$1.3 million settlement with the motorcycle manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are just overwhelmed,'' said Frey's mother, Charlene Frey.  
``I'm very happy. It's been a long road and it's finally over. 
We've been anticipating this day for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frey described waiting for the ruling as ``nerve-racking,'' but  
ultimately satisfying. It did, however, come down on a day the 
sophomore had to take a test and give a speech at school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was stunned,'' he said. ``I didn't believe what they had  
said. Was it hard to finish that final exam after the news? Yes.''

<HEADLINE> Housing Figures Yet To Slow Market / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If housing is a leading indicator of economic  
activity and, by extension, of stock market behavior, what will 
investors make of the recent decline in new housing starts? 
</P>
<P>
	Not much, judging at least by the casual manner in which they've  
dispensed with all other threats, real and imagined. A quality of 
self-fulfillment guides this market -- anything is possible if you 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
	That belief has seldom been higher, and never before in history  
has it involved so many people and so much money. In the mind of 
investors, the world is being recreated, and the new world is 
abounding with riches. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the reality, of course, any more than the amount of  
cash in a person's pocket is a true reflection of the world 
economy. But as long as enough pockets are bulging, the market 
apparently will rise. 
</P>
<P>
	In such an atmosphere memories grow dim, and many of today's  
investors fail to recall that just nine years ago this summer the 
stock market lost 20 percent of its value in just three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Or for that matter, that just three years before that it  
subtracted 33.5 percent of its value in a similarly brief period. 
And that until last summer, there had been 15 bear markets since 
1948. 
</P>
<P>
	Why go back so far? Some investors barely remember that last  
summer the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 14.6 percent and the 
Nasdaq composite index plunged nearly 20 percent. This market looks 
forward, not back. 
</P>
<P>
	There are compelling reasons for it to rise: The affluence of  
ordinary people benefiting from pay raises, the daring that comes 
with a sense of new wealth, the automatic investments through 
pension funds and 401(k)s. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadly speaking, and at the risk of oversimplifying, you might  
divide today's investors into (1) those who contend they are in for 
the long term and (2) those who think they can time the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The question about the first is whether they really understand  
what ``long-term'' means. All investors live within a time frame 
imposed by age; unless they wish to endow their heirs, ``long 
term'' could be briefer than they want to admit. 
</P>
<P>
	The second group is populated by those who believe that  
foresight or dumb luck will guide their escape from a major 
downturn. The attitude is common among those who recently rode a 
stock to a 200 percent profit. 
</P>
<P>
	For the latter, market historian and adviser Gerald Perritt has  
some words, to wit: 
</P>
<P>
	``More than 50 years of rigorous academic research has failed to  
uncover one indicator that could consistently predict the onset of 
a bear market far enough in advance to improve long-run investment 
returns over a buy-and-hold strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perritt, a former mathematics professor and now publisher of the  
Mutual Fund Letter, adheres to the buy-and-hold strategy, declaring 
``successful investors are those who stay in the market over the 
long run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time he must make a concession to human nature.  
``The best way to weather a stock market downdraft is to know who 
you are and to determine how much downside volatility you can 
tolerate,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Applying that philosophy to our times, a smart investor would  
ask himself (1) am I really in this for the long haul or am I 
kidding myself, and (2) do I really, truly believe I can foretell 
what might happen? 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, they must ask themselves also whether their  
confidence is based on substance or is just a nice feeling they 
have from all the money in their pocket.

<HEADLINE> After 100 Years, Coward Celebration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Noel Coward had ``a talent to amuse,'' as the  
lyric in his own song, ``If Love Were All,'' so elegantly put it. 
He also possessed a famously incisive, epigrammatic wit. 
</P>
<P>
	And in this centennial year of his birth, the late English  
dramatist and songwriter is proving ripe for reappraisal, with a 
cavalcade of play revivals, galas and tributes planned at home and 
abroad of virtually every extant piece of Coward -- maybe even his 
``Calvacade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1950s and '60s embraced gritty, working-class dramas from  
such Angry Young Men as John Osborne. But earlier writers like 
Coward and his contemporaries Somerset Maugham and Terence Rattigan 
look set to endure, as theatergoers realize that plays about 
society swells can be provocative as well as entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``Noel deserves our celebration,'' said actress Lynn Redgrave,  
who was directed by Coward in a now-legendary 1964 National Theater 
revival of his ``Hay Fever.'' Redgrave might play the eccentric 
Madame Arcati in a Los Angeles production of Coward's ``Blithe 
Spirit'' at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's our man,'' said Michael Imison, a former agent for the  
Coward estate and coordinator of the current spate of centenary 
goings-on. ``He's one of the great world figures we can claim as 
being English.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-seven years after his death, Coward's soigne  
sophistication still embodies a certain English classiness -- 
cigarette and bon mot always at the ready. 
</P>
<P>
	A stand-up comedian, he wasn't. Ever droll, he remains.  
</P>
<P>
	Consider the following, for example, from ``Blithe Spirit'':  
</P>
<P>
	Ruth: ``If I died, I wonder how long it would be before you  
married again?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles: ``You won't die. You're not the dying sort.''  
</P>
<P>
	Or lyrics that have become part of the language, such as ``Don't  
put your daughter on the stage, Mrs. Worthington,'' and ``Don't 
let's be beastly to the Germans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Coward who wrote:  
</P>
<P>
	``The Stately Homes of England,  
</P>
<P>
	``How beautiful they stand,  
</P>
<P>
	``To prove the upper classes  
</P>
<P>
	``Have still the upper hand.''  
</P>
<P>
	And it was ``Mad Dogs and Englishmen'' of 1931 that assured his  
immortality: 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Philippines, there are lovely screens  
</P>
<P>
	``To protect you from the glare;  
</P>
<P>
	``In the Malay states, they have hats like plates  
</P>
<P>
	``Which the Britishers won't wear.  
</P>
<P>
	``At twelve noon, the natives swoon,  
</P>
<P>
	``And no further work is done;  
</P>
<P>
	``But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun.''  
</P>
<P>
	For Coward, seriousness -- or, to be more accurate, earnestness --  
was as repellent as the suburban background into which he was born 
and as quickly as possible left behind, first as a child actor and 
then as the author of 50 or so plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning with ``The Vortex'' in 1924, a portrait of drug  
addiction and love between an older woman and a younger man 
(nowadays, he would be called a ``boy toy''), Coward depicted 
sexual mores and social finesse -- or sometimes lack thereof -- in 
ways that remain trenchant, funny, and often wounding. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Coward's writings are almost always on view, even  
without the milestone birthday celebration -- the dramatist was born 
Dec. 16, 1899, in Middlesex, west London. 
</P>
<P>
	``Present Laughter,'' his endearingly narcissistic play about  
vainglorious Garry Essendine, an actor clearly patterned on 
himself, has had four major London and New York revivals in the 
last two decades, with George C. Scott and Frank Langella among the 
actors donning smart dressing gowns to play Gary. The 1942 comedy 
may emerge in the West End once again if Ian McKellen decides to 
take a recent sell-out production in the Yorkshire city of Leeds to 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	Coward's 1930 play, ``Private Lives,'' contains perhaps the most  
famous balcony scene besides ``Romeo and Juliet.'' Elizabeth Taylor 
and Joan Collins are just two legends who have tackled the barbed 
comedy, with mixed results, on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	London revisits the play May 13 at the National, where Juliet  
Stevenson is expected to play Amanda Prynne, the divorcee reunited 
on the Riviera with her former husband and favorite sparring 
partner, Elyot Chase (to be played by Anton Lesser). 
</P>
<P>
	Time-honored audience pleasers, these plays are part of a Coward  
canon of favorites that includes ``Design for Living,'' a play 
whose central (and bisexual) menage-a-trois can seem decidedly 
steamy in some directors' hands. 
</P>
<P>
	That play is on course for a late-summer London revival -- the  
first-ever Coward production of veteran director Peter Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a play I've wanted to do for 20 years,'' said Hall,  
adding that he found the 1933 comedy ``very strange and haunting -- 
the last 20 minutes are absolutely amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No less amazing is the way the play manages to be deeply serious  
about the characters' frivolity and passion. 
</P>
<P>
	As one exchange puts it:  
</P>
<P>
	Ernest: ``You're -- you're insane! You can't be serious.''  
</P>
<P>
	Gilda: ``I'm not serious! That's what's so dreadful. I feel I  
ought to be but I'm not. ... It's shameful, I know, but I can't 
help it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time that revival arrives in London, ``Hay Fever'' should  
be back on the London stage, as well, with 1998 Tony nominee 
Geraldine McEwan (``The Chairs'') playing the daffy Judith Bliss, a 
hostess who takes self-absorption to comical extremes. The role was 
a Broadway success for Rosemary Harris in 1985.

	Ever the fantasist, Judith regards her grown children, Simon and  
Sorel, as a rebuke to her advancing age: 
</P>
<P>
	Simon: ``I don't see any point in trying to be younger than you  
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judith: ``At your age, dear, it would be indecent if you did.''  
</P>
<P>
	And what about the rest of Coward -- the remaining plays, 300  
songs, collections of short stories and verse, and at least five 
screenplays? 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many talents Noel had, it's difficult to pin one  
down,'' 80-year-old Graham Payn, Coward's longtime lover, said in 
an interview from the French Riviera resort of Cannes. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you realize, partly because of his sexuality, was that he  
dealt with themes and ideas which are very, very modern,'' said 
Philip Hoare, a Coward biographer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was never just about blue-rinse matrons going to Saturday  
matinees,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coward is a man who wrote about drug abuse, women taking  
younger lovers, who wrote about sexuality,'' he said. ``His plays 
were openly challenging the status quo of the '20s and '30s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKellen, an Academy Award nominee for his performance in ``Gods  
and Monsters,'' had never acted in a Coward play on stage until his 
recent run in ``Present Laughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Noel's plays are about topics still thought to be pretty  
dangerous in the theater,'' McKellen said, ``and to make comedies 
of them was very clever indeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On occasion, Coward took self-analysis still further. A frequent  
actor in his own work, he starred in the 1965 West End premiere of 
his ``A Song at Twilight,'' about a successful writer forced one 
baleful evening to own up to his bisexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	Revived in January in London, where actor Corin Redgrave  
(brother of Lynn) made an impressive Coward surrogate, the play 
seemed to pertain less to its nominal inspiration, Somerset 
Maugham, and more to Coward's fascination with masks and facades 
and what is revealed when they fall away. 
</P>
<P>
	Half a dozen other Coward plays, revues and compilations are in  
production. London will have a gala tribute on Oct. 24 at the 
Theater Royal, Drury Lane, while a similar New York event is set 
for Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Too much of a good thing?  
</P>
<P>
	``It is dangerous, I think,'' said Hoare, the biographer. ``If  
you're exposing the work to a new generation that doesn't know his 
entire history, they go and see `A Song at Twilight' and think, 
`Why is this man a genius?' You need also to show them `Private 
Lives.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``My own view of Coward is he's very uneven,'' said Joel Kaplan,  
chairman of the department of drama and theater arts at England's 
Birmingham. ``(But) the best of his work can stand its ground with 
virtually anything the English theater has produced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fantastic. It really is,'' Payn, the writer's former  
lover, said of all the hoopla. ``Noel would be very thrilled. He 
really would.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Threatens To Veto Bank Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton threatened to veto financial  
overhaul legislation proposed by Senate Banking Committee Chairman 
Phil Gramm, saying it fails to fully protect consumers and would 
hurt community lending laws. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on Wednesday  
expressed the administration's ``strong support'' for a bipartisan 
compromise bill in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration supports in principle legislation to  
lift the Depression-era barriers between banks, securities firms 
and insurance companies. But the White House has threatened to veto 
several versions in recent years that took an approach it rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal drafted by Gramm, R-Texas, is more in line with the  
views of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan than those of the 
administration. The bill calls for most new financial activities to 
be conducted by affiliated companies within bank holding companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Gramm, Clinton said his proposal would  
``undermine the effectiveness of the Community Reinvestment Act 
..., a law that has helped to build homes, create jobs and restore 
hope in communities across America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton wrote, the bill would ``provide inadequate  
consumer protection.'' His letter, dated Tuesday and released 
Wednesday, did not elaborate on that point. 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official cited as an example a provision in  
the compromise House bill, but absent from Gramm's, that would 
require banks selling securities to make sure they are appropriate 
for a consumer's income and circumstances. The official spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will veto the bill if it is presented to me in its current  
form,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm, in response, insisted that his proposal would not weaken  
the community investment law that banks must follow, but would 
``restore its integrity.'' The 1977 law requires banks and thrifts 
to lend to the poor and minorities in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's opposition to the law led him to block financial  
overhaul legislation in the Senate's waning days last fall. The 
legislation had earlier squeaked through the House by one vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his new proposal, banks would not have to get a  
satisfactory community-lending rating from the government to set up 
holding companies to conduct new financial activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Financial services modernization is of such overriding  
importance to the national economy that President Clinton will be 
compelled to sign'' the bill, Gramm said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves came a day before Gramm's Senate banking panel and the  
House Banking Committee were to vote on amendments to two separate 
financial overhaul bills. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Banking Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa,  
and Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the panel's senior Democrat, on 
Monday unveiled a bipartisan compromise bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the lawmakers Wednesday, Rubin expressed the  
administration's ``strong support.'' The Treasury chief said the 
bill ``would benefit consumers, businesses and communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the House and Senate bills would create huge financial  
``supermarkets,'' offering consumers checking accounts, mutual 
funds, insurance policies and much more. Ralph Nader and other 
consumer advocates have expressed concern that the legislation, by 
allowing banks, brokerage firms and insurers to merge and get more 
deeply into each other's businesses, could bring a dangerous 
concentration of economic power in fewer hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills before Congress have been ``cobbled together from wish  
lists of the various industry groups,'' Nader told reporters 
Wednesday. ``In the process, the rights of consumers have been 
trampled or, more often, ignored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, Nader cited the previous deletion from the House  
bill of a provision that would have required banks to offer 
low-cost, ``no frills'' checking accounts for low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, led by the Treasury Department, and  
Greenspan's Federal Reserve have long been at odds over how an 
overhaul of the financial services laws should be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration wants to let banks diversify through  
subsidiaries of the bank itself, not just through affiliates within 
the same parent holding company. That arrangement would increase 
the power of the Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency, regulator of nationally chartered banks. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the battle, bills letting banks into other  
kinds of financial activities through a holding company structure 
would expand the independent Fed's role in regulating financial 
services industries.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Women Claim Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHANTILLY, Va. (AP) -- Five Muslim women filed a religious  
discrimination complaint after being fired as airport security 
guards for allegedly refusing to take off their head scarves. 
</P>
<P>
	The women, immigrants from Egypt and Sudan, said they could not  
comply when a supervisor at Argenbright Security Inc. asked them to 
remove their scarves. Covering their heads is a requirement of 
their faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm angry. This is my religion,'' one of the women, Iklas  
Musa, 29, of Alexandria, said today after the complaint was filed 
with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The five women worked at Dulles International Airport in the  
Virginia suburbs outside Washington, where they screened passengers 
and luggage. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Musa said she was told by a supervisor that United Airlines  
had asked that the head scarves be removed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Joe Hopkins, a United spokesman, denied that the airline  
wanted the scarves removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Argenbright did not immediately return telephone  
calls today seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's complaint was filed Friday. It alleges a violation  
of federal civil rights law requiring employers to accommodate 
religious practices on the job as much as possible. It names 
Argenbright and United as respondents. 
</P>
<P>
	Argenbright settled a similar complaint last year at Denver  
International Airport out of court, according to the 
Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim 
advocacy group.

	2nd German Brother To Be Executed  
</P>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- The World Court in The Hague,  
Netherlands, is urging the federal government to do all it can to 
prevent a German citizen from execution this evening. Walter 
LaGrand, 37, is scheduled to die for stabbing a bank manager to 
death during a botched robbery in 1982. His brother was executed 
last week for the same crime, despite pleas for mercy from the 
German government.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky asserts that Kenneth Starr  
obtained a copy of her false affidavit denying an affair with 
President Clinton before it had been filed with a court. The 
episode ``exposed the dubious methods employed by Starr's 
investigators,'' the former White House intern says in her new 
book, ``Monica's Story,'' written by British author Andrew Morton. 
The Justice Department is investigating whether Starr improperly 
detained Ms. Lewinsky last year when questioning her about her 
affair with Clinton. Her interview with Barbara Walters airs 
tonight on ABC at 9 p.m. EST.

Intermediate School 25 in the borough of Queens, the first lady

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Says Clinton Is a 'Liar' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disclosing an abortion and thoughts of  
suicide, Monica Lewinsky gave the world an unabashed account of her 
life Wednesday and unleashed her long-pent-up loathing for Kenneth 
Starr's investigation. And she said she now regards President 
Clinton ``to be a much bigger liar than I ever thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a television interview and a separate book, the 25-year-old  
former White House intern spoke openly of sexual encounters with 
the president and several other men. 
</P>
<P>
	But she saved some of her sharpest words for the prosecutor who  
transformed her affair with Clinton into an impeachment crisis 
while providing her immunity from criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky said in her book, ``Monica's Story,'' that Starr's  
office ``was sick'' for asking so many detailed questions about her 
sexual encounters with the president and also engaged in ``dubious 
tactics'' by trying to coerce her cooperation during a first 
confrontation in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	She said in her book that first meeting made her so distraught  
that she considered hurling herself from the 10th floor window of 
the hotel room where prosecutors interviewed her, and later weighed 
fleeing the country with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Even now with a promise from prosecutors that she won't be  
charged, she is ``afraid of doing something to lose my immunity,'' 
she told Barbara Walters on ABC in a long-anticipated show aired 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Showing Americans a far different personality than the stern  
witness forced to testify before a grand jury and by videotape at 
the impeachment trial, Ms. Lewinsky was animated and smiled 
frequently during the TV interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, while recounting the pain the crisis has caused her  
family, she broke down crying. ``People have no idea about what 
this has done. ... It was so destructive,'' she said, tears 
streaming. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Clintons left Washington for a day their friends and  
aides admitted would be painful -- the president went to a 
fund-raiser in New Jersey; the first lady tested the political 
waters in New York where she's considering a bid for U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's book, written by Princess Diana biographer Andrew  
Morton with the former intern's cooperation, criticized Starr for 
obtaining a copy of her false affidavit denying an affair with 
Clinton before it was filed in court. 
</P>
<P>
	The book accuses the prosecutor of colluding with Paula Jones in  
obtaining the affidavit. Documents obtained by The Associated Press 
show Starr recently told Congress that he had gotten an early copy 
from a lawyer for Linda Tripp and not from Mrs. Jones' camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawyers had been given a copy of the affidavit four  
days before the Starr episode. Asked Wednesday about the affidavit, 
Mrs. Tripp's spokesman, Philip Coughter, said his client ``has no 
comment on the matter at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is investigating whether Starr's  
prosecutors improperly discussed a possible immunity agreement with 
Ms. Lewinsky without her attorney present and failed to disclose 
contacts with Mrs. Jones' lawyers to the department before it gave 
Starr permission to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Understandably, Starr's tactics have been a matter for grave  
public concern,'' Ms. Lewinsky's book said. ``The whole exchange 
about immunity was a waste of time except insofar as it exposed the 
dubious methods employed by Starr's investigators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her book spared no words for Starr's prosecutors, deriding one  
as a ``revolting specimen of humanity'' and another as ``pit-bull 
terrier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Independent Counsel Jackie Bennett said Wednesday he  
could not comment on the book because his office hadn't seen it. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the document sent to Congress two months ago, Starr  
disputed claims his office had mistreated Ms. Lewinsky, saying that 
while she was ``understandably upset and distraught'' by her first 
encounter with prosecutors, it was due to the ``gravity of the 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky also discloses in the book that she and her mother  
briefly considered ``fleeing across the border to Canada'' to 
escape Starr's investigation ``but that idea was discarded as soon 
as it was mentioned, because they believed that the FBI would have 
every airport and border post staked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, the friend who betrayed Ms. Lewinsky by secretly  
taping her talking about the Clinton affair and then taking the 
tapes to Starr, came in for her own sharp criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``When she poured out her story to Tripp, Monica thought she was  
confiding in a friend. Instead, she was gently being lured into a 
trap, the unwitting bait with which to catch a president,'' the 
book said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor does the president, whom Ms. Lewinsky said she instantly  
fell in love with when meeting him along a rope line at a 1995 
event, escape tough words. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I see him as a selfish man who lies all the time. That  
makes me very angry and resentful,'' she said in the book. 
</P>
<P>
	In a two-hour interview with Walters, Ms. Lewinsky questioned  
the sincerity of the president's apology for the entire episode, 
saying ``I think he's sorry he got caught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky said in the interview -- an event that ABC hoped  
would draw such a huge audience that it raised its ad rates -- that 
she felt like ``a piece of trash'' the day Clinton was forced to 
admit their affair on national television and apologized to the 
nation -- but not to her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt dirty and I felt used and I was disappointed,'' Ms.  
Lewinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also ackowledged the falsity of her fiorst affidavit. ``I  
think I knew I was lying but ... I had no idea what all the 
different elements of perjury were at the time,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In her book, Ms. Lewinsky recounted in the book her feelings the  
day Starr's impeachment report came out on Capitol Hill. ``I really 
felt raped and physically ill with myself. ... I just felt that the 
world looked at me as a whore,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just a pawn used to get the president,'' she added.  
</P>
<P>
	As for the stained dress that became key evidence in the case  
against Clinton, Ms. Lewinsky insisted she kept it, not as a trophy 
or incriminating evidence, but rather to save money on dry 
cleaning. She said the dress was a joke among her friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``We even laughed about it,'' Lewinsky told Walters. ``With one  
I even joked, gee, maybe he'll pay for the dry cleaning.'' She said 
now, however, she would burn the dress if she ever gets it back. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of getting Ms. Lewinsky's story from cold grand  
jury transcripts, Americans got to hear her version in two venues: 
ABC aired the interview it recorded 11 days ago while her publisher 
provided the news media its first copies of the book set to go on 
sale Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In both, Ms. Lewinsky volunteered detail about intensely  
personal matters in her life. 
</P>
<P>
	She acknowledged she had an abortion after becoming pregnant  
during a three-month affair with a fellow Pentagon worker. The 
abortion occurred in the latter part of 1996, while she was still 
seeing Clinton in secret meetings at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	She also detailed another affair she had with a married man in  
Oregon while still in college, disclosing that when the romance was 
ending she had a ``fling'' with his younger brother to spite him. 
</P>
<P>
	The details may be too much for a public already weary of the  
story. Nine out of 10 people said in a Gallup Poll taken Friday 
through Sunday that they would not be interested in reading her 
book. And almost two-thirds said they were not interested in 
watching her TV interview.

<HEADLINE> Maine Lobster Catch Nears Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- If Maine's lobster population is on the  
verge of collapse, why did the state's total lobster catch for 1998 
come in just shy of 1997's record year? 
</P>
<P>
	Some lobstermen say it's hard to argue that there's an impending  
crisis when they keep pulling up bountiful traps. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary figures from the National Marine Fisheries Service  
show Maine lobstermen caught 45.5 million pounds of lobster worth 
about $132 million in 1998. That compares to the 1997 record catch 
of 47 million pounds worth $138 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers don't surprise me,'' said Pete Daley, president of  
the Maine Lobster Pound Association in Hancock. ``I think it lends 
to the theory that there's too many damn lobsters out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Marckoon, who compiles the data for the fisheries service  
in Rockland, said he expected a dip in lobster landings and was 
pleasantly surprised by the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite several bumper years for lobstermen, scientists have  
been predicting a collapse of Maine's lobster fishery, similar to 
the collapse of New England's groundfish industry. The scientists 
say lobsters are being caught before they can reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, many lobsters died last year, apparently from a  
bacteria that is not harmful to humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisheries service spokeswoman Teri Frady said no one disputes  
that there are many lobsters crawling on the ocean floor right now. 
But she contends that the fishery is on the verge of immediate 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overfishing is occurring and it won't last forever,'' Frady  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern over the lobster fishery has prompted regulations in  
recent years, including reductions in the number of traps in the 
water and adjustments to let small lobsters escape the traps. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Blackmore, a retired lobsterman from Stonington, said  
conservation efforts must save the fishery in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the American way: When something gets its head up good,  
kill it -- and I think that's what is going to happen,'' said 
Blackmore, who has hauled traps for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat White, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen's  
Association, said lobstermen in eastern Maine may be doing well, 
but southern Maine lobstermen are seeing a decline in landings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The warning light has come on for us,'' said White. ``We can't  
continue at this rate of harvest. I think we are definitely 
overfishing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the continuing success of lobster fishermen is good  
news for consumers, who enjoy stable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Andersen, visiting Maine from St. Louis and dining on  
lobster at DiMillo's restaurant, rejoiced in the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love lobster. I absolutely love it and I don't want to see  
the stocks depleted. I want them to keep up,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Leading Economic Indicators Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rising stock prices and an increase in orders at  
the nation's factories carried a key gauge of future economic 
activity higher in January, signaling that the U.S. economy will 
continue to thrive through at least the middle of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the gain in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators  
and a separate government report of robust home sales showed that 
the economy remains very healthy, some analysts warned that its 
rate of growth may slow in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private research group, reported Tuesday  
that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.5 percent to 
106.9 in January from a revised level of 106.4 in December and 
106.2 in November. The results were slightly better than the 0.4 
percent increase economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the leading index posting three consecutive sharp  
increases, the U.S. economy does not seem to be ready to settle 
down much from the fast pace of growth it experienced in 1998,'' 
said Michael Boldin, senior economist with the Conference Board. 
``Over the past six months, the index has increased 1.2 percent, 
which is far above its historical average, and the prospects for 
growth in income and employment are very bright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that although new  
home sales slipped for the second straight month in January, they 
nonetheless were very strong. Americans bought new homes at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 918,000, down 5 percent from 
966,000 in December and more than 1 million in November. 
</P>
<P>
	With mortgage rates remaining under 7 percent and jobs  
plentiful, at least so far this year, most economists expect robust 
new home sales in 1999, but not quite as strong as the record 
887,000 for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists found signs in both reports that the economy's recent  
fast rate of growth would decline in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Maury N. Harris, chief economist with PaineWebber Inc. said the  
jump in leading indicators and the continued strength in housing 
sales were the predicted results of last fall's slumping dollar and 
declines in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect that in February, March and April they're going to  
cool off because the dollar is back up and so are interest rates,'' 
he said, referring to a recent increase in mortgage rates. The 
average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose last 
week for the fourth straight week to 6.89 percent, the highest 
level since mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 10 leading indicators that make up the Conference  
Board's index rose in January. Leading the way were increases in 
prices of 500 common stocks and manufacturers' orders of 
non-defense capital goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The sole area of decline was in the average factory work week.  
However, the National Association of Purchasing Management, which 
tracks the health of the nation's factories, reported Monday that 
manufacturing strengthened in February, so the one laggard in the 
January indicators might see an improvement in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading indicators index is designed to forecast economic  
activity six to nine months in advance. It operates from a base of 
100, set in 1992. First calculated in the late 1960s, it is 
periodically fine-tuned and figures from past years are revised.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	March 2  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Times, Farmington, N.M., on independent counsel law:  
</P>
<P>
	What a difference a couple of decades make. Just 20 years ago,  
one could find very few politicians opposed to the formation of the 
Office of Independent Counsel. ... 
</P>
<P>
	To put the history of the past 20 years simply, the law didn't  
work very well. 
</P>
<P>
	It used up excessive amounts of money and allowed a succession  
of counsels to pursue their targets without the normal restraints 
imposed on criminal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a way, though, that unhappy experience is beside the point  
now. The political reality is that both Democrats and Republicans 
have their own reasons to oppose extending the Ethics in Government 
Act when it expires this summer. ... 
</P>
<P>
	That being the case, there is now an overwhelming majority which  
wants to let the law expire. That decision having essentially been 
made, the only question left is whether there is any reason to 
regret it. 
</P>
<P>
	We find no reason for tears or hesitation. ...  
</P>
<P>
	Allowing the OIC statute to expire simply means we return to the  
way this nation operated before 1978. If the president fails to see 
that the laws are ``faithfully executed'' -- that is, fails to 
periodically appoint special prosecutors when necessary or fails to 
cooperate with them after their appointment -- the only punishment 
he or she will face is the wrath of the American people at the next 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not, and never was, a perfect system.  
</P>
<P>
	But, then, as we have lately learned, neither was its  
replacement. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 28  
</P>
<P>
	Houston Chronicle, on the independent counsel law:  
</P>
<P>
	History makes a poor argument for extending the law authorizing  
the office of independent counsel. More than $150 million spent by 
21 independent counsels over 20 years has brought seemingly 
interminable investigations and few significant convictions. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of an independent counsel statute still would allow  
the U.S. attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor. The late 
Leon Jaworski was appointed by President Nixon's Justice Department 
and went on to gather evidence that drove Nixon from office and 
sent more than a dozen of his subordinates to prison. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of the independent counsel system should not rest upon  
a single independent counsel, but the case of Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr demonstrates a glaring failure if the goal of the 
statute is to remove politics from the process. 
</P>
<P>
	An occasion might arise when a special prosecutor is hamstrung  
and a counsel independent of the Justice Department is needed to 
root out wrongdoing in high places. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, millions of dollars would be saved and little  
justice lost if Congress failed to renew the independent counsel 
statute and allowed it to expire. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 23  
</P>
<P>
	Clarksburg (W.Va.) Telegram, on federal crime laws:  
</P>
<P>
	If America wants to reduce crime, Congress needs to pass tough  
new federal laws, right? Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has enacted a flood of federal criminal laws since 1970  
and they haven't worked. That's the conclusion of a task force 
sponsored by the American Bar Association. The task force spent two 
years preparing a report called ``Federalization of Criminal Law.'' 
...
</P>
<P>
	So why, then, has Congress been so eager to pass new federal  
crime laws? The answer is simple: Congressmen are afraid of 
appearing soft on crime. A heinous crime is committed. Calls go out 
for a new federal law to keep it from happening again, and Congress 
obliges, even if there are already adequate state laws in place. 
...
</P>
<P>
	We suggest that every member of Congress have printed in giant  
letters on his or her office wall the key conclusion of the ABA 
report: ``There is no persuasive evidence that federalization of 
local crime makes the streets safer for American citizens.'' 
Perhaps that would remind our congressmen that the way to fight 
crime isn't to add to the federal bureaucracy, but to make sure 
that state and local law enforcement agencies have the resources 
needed to do the best job they can.

	The Tampa (Fla.) Tribune, on the Ronald Reagan Turnpike:  
</P>
<P>
	Last year it was reported nationwide that the state Legislature  
renamed the Florida Turnpike the Ronald Reagan Turnpike. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill to honor the former president did pass, but it only  
pretended to change the name of the 265-mile toll road. Hesitant 
lawmakers ``designated'' it in Reagan's honor, and only a few signs 
went up. News stories, maps and most signs still refer to the 
highway by its old name. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan was a popular president who will be remembered for  
hastening the breakup of the Soviet Union through his 
uncompromising stand against the evil it represented. He had the 
courage of his convictions. And heaven knows he had convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Legislature can summon a fraction of Reagan's political  
courage, it will correct last year's half-hearted tribute with a 
plain, bold law that declares the money-making road officially the 
Ronald Reagan Turnpike. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 25  
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times, on federal banking proposal:  
</P>
<P>
	Know Your Customer is an innocuous-sounding regulation that  
found its way onto the Federal Register two months ago. Thanks to 
attentive Internet privacy groups, the snoopy practices proposed by 
financial regulators may not survive much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed new rule would require federally chartered banks to  
identify every customer for the federal government and would 
mandate tracking of ordinary customer banking transactions. Credit 
unions and state-chartered banks that aren't members of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. also would be roped into the Know Your 
Customer scheme. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators say the scheme is needed to protect the  
banking system against drug-related money-laundering. But existing 
rules already require private financial institutions to report most 
cash transactions of $10,000 or more. Banks also must file reports 
of suspicious transactions with the Treasury Department if they 
believe a customer is engaging in criminal activities. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no need for an additional federal mandate directing  
banks to snitch on customers making ordinary financial 
transactions. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 24.  
</P>
<P>
	The State, Columbia, S.C., on Education Secretary Richard  
Riley's plan for teacher training: 
</P>
<P>
	Uh-oh. Few teachers say they're ready for the students they get  
or the technology they're using, according to ... the U.S. 
Education Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 20 percent of 4,049 teachers surveyed said they were  
confident about using modern technology, about working with 
students from diverse backgrounds, students limited in their 
ability to speak and write English or students who are disabled. 
Despite the current cry for accountability, only 28 percent felt 
``very well prepared'' to use assessment techniques. ... 
</P>
<P>
	With this report in hand, Education Secretary Richard Riley is  
talking about teacher training and teacher quality. ... 
</P>
<P>
	He wants states to consider a three-stage licensing process.  
Beginning teachers who pass written exams would be awarded a 
three-year license. New teachers would be assisted by the more 
experienced, and at the end of the three-year trial must pass an 
evaluation by experienced educators to acquire a professional 
license. ... 
</P>
<P>
	While Riley has no authority over the states, his ideas about  
strengthening the teacher corps should be considered right now, as 
the Legislature looks at raising teacher pay above the Southeastern 
average and providing a pay hike for nationally certified teachers. 

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	East Oregonian, Pendleton, on Social Security:  
</P>
<P>
	Now that the impeachment distraction is behind us, the federal  
government will turn its attention to a problem most of us agree is 
our most important: Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Before we can really fix Social Security, we must define exactly  
what it should be, and more importantly, what it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
	It's apparent we cannot keep operating the program as we have in  
the past. We must implement change now, while it won't be so 
painful, instead of waiting until something drastic is required. 
</P>
<P>
	Investing Social Security money is highly controversial, but it  
does make sense for people to have more control of how their money 
is used. But making these decisions could create another 
bureaucracy that none of us want. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers must understand that we want a strong Social Security  
system that doesn't break the taxpayers but provides a secure 
retirement for those who need it. That's a tall order, and how we 
get there from here is bound to be an interesting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, though, it's one we must take. So let's start now and  
not stop until it's done right. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 28  
</P>
<P>
	The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, on Rep. Bob Livingston:  
</P>
<P>
	Bob Livingston has stayed out of the national spotlight in the  
two months since he announced his resignation, just as he did for 
most of his two decades in the U.S. House of Representatives. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, most Americans knew little about Livingston's  
hard work or behind-the-scenes influence in November, when he 
became a national figure by unseating Newt Gingrich as House 
speaker. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Livingston presented himself as a pragmatist -- which is  
precisely what the House needed. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Yet as the House prepared to impeach President Clinton for  
breaking the law to conceal his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, 
Rep. Livingston was accused of hypocrisy when he disclosed 
extramarital affairs of his own. Convinced that his personal 
history would have interfered with his ability to lead, Rep. 
Livingston shocked his colleagues by stepping aside. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Life goes on. In time, the trauma of the impeachment debate will  
fade, and Louisiana's delegation will slowly rebuild its clout in 
Washington. If New Orleans area residents are lucky, our future 
representatives in Congress will display the same professionalism, 
diligence and political integrity that Mr. Livingston possesses. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 24  
</P>
<P>
	The Lima (Ohio) News, on seizure of cars of suspected drunken  
drivers: 
</P>
<P>
	There's only one way to say it -- New York City has crossed the  
line. 
</P>
<P>
	The city, in a crackdown on drunken driving, has started seizing  
private property on the mere suspicion of drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City is not the first political jurisdiction to trample  
civil rights in an effort to battle drinking and driving. Many 
jurisdictions, including Ohio, allow for random checkpoints in an 
effort to find drunken drivers. Ohio also calls for automatic 
license suspensions for refusal to take a breathalyzer test, all 
without a trial. 
</P>
<P>
	These tactics should be anathema to anyone who values freedom.  
Police should not be randomly stopping drivers without probable 
cause, taking driver's licenses without a trial or seizing lawful 
property without a trial. Police officers and petty bureaucrats are 
quickly becoming judge and jury in the nation's push to combat 
drunken driving. 

</P>
<P>
	March 2  
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times, London, on the European Union's  
agricultural policy: 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of having barely three weeks left to reach agreement,  
France ... demanded and won a postponement in the European Union 
negotiations on reforming the common agricultural policy. It is 
hard to see what any delay can achieve. Capping the CAP is an 
essential precondition for any deal on Agenda 2000, the package 
aimed at a general reform of the EU finances. If that cannot be 
agreed before the end of this month, it probably will not be agreed 
before the end of 1999, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	An outsider to the arcane process of CAP negotiations might  
think it logical that France, the most important farm producer in 
the EU, should be fighting a last-ditch battle to preserve the old 
system of price support, which has resulted in mountains of excess 
produce over the years. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Thanks to 40 years of subsidies, France now has probably the most 
efficient agricultural sector in the EU. The majority of its 
farmers can compete extremely well on world markets without any 
subsidies at all. And yet they still demand their cash.

	March 1  
</P>
<P>
	Il Giornale, Milan, on the Hezbollah attack against Israel:  
</P>
<P>
	The Hezbollah attack against Israel last Sunday in Lebanon was a  
hard blow to Israel's military and political prestige. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only do Hezbollah guerrilla fighters seem to have improved  
their tactics, they also seem to have moles inside Israel's 
commands. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli responses all seem inadequate to counter the Shiite  
guerrilla. To any retaliation from Israel, Hezbollah responds with 
a counter-reprisal in southern Lebanon. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It is a serious political concern for (Prime Minister Benjamin)  
Netanyahu. Despite his threats against the Hezbollah, Netanyahu 
knows he cannot provide an effective response. 
</P>
<P>
	If the military response is limited, then it will produce no  
effects. If it is a massive attack against Lebanon or Syria, then 
it can be counterproductive and Netanyahu may risk losing the 
elections next May, just like it happened to Shimon Peres in 1996. 
...
</P>
<P>
	In reality, only Syria and Iran can stop the Hezbollah  
guerrilla. 

</P>
<P>
	March 3  
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald, on prospect of  
independence or autonomy from Indonesia for East Timor: 
</P>
<P>
	It is vital to disarm groups whose murderous attacks inflame the  
passion for revenge, escalate violence and so jeopardize hopes of 
reconciliation among East Timorese. Without reconciliation there 
can be no peace. The problem of paramilitary groups, many armed by 
Indonesia, will have to be faced if it persists. (Australian 
Foreign Minister Alexander) Downer is right to rule out for the 
time being a U.N. peacekeeping force. The primary responsibility 
for stabilizing the situation in East Timor rests with the 
Indonesian Government and the people of East Timor. They are the 
ones who will have to live together. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 2  
</P>
<P>
	Clarin, Buenos Aires, on Guatemala truth commission:  
</P>
<P>
	In Guatemala, the Commission for Historical Clarification has  
just delivered its report on the violence witnessed by that country 
in the 36 years leading up to the signing of a peace accord in 
1996. It is an account of the hell created by the conflict between 
superpowers, by authoritarian rule and by poverty. In that small 
Central American nation, whose population is about 12 million 
inhabitants, political violence caused the death and disappearance 
of more than 200,000 people. And the report ... holds the army and 
security forces responsible for the vast majority of the crimes. 
... The land of the Mayas suffered a long war which, in addition to 
the huge number of victims, left the national territory devastated 
and much of the population in great poverty. Shedding light on the 
events of the past is an important step toward the consolidation of 
the peace process.

<P>
	Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Cambodian loans:  
</P>
<P>
	The third conference on aid to Cambodia ended on Feb. 26,  
agreeing to extend an additional $470 million in assistance. As the 
largest donor to Cambodia, Japan has pledged another $100 million 
in grants and technical assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Cambodia's problems cannot be attributed solely to its  
underdeveloped politics. Its consumption tax, which was introduced 
in January to strengthen the state's finances, has contributed to 
the confusion because of uncertainty regarding the scope of the tax 
and the methods of tax collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the donors attending the Tokyo conference agreed to  
increase their aid to Cambodia because of a desire to see the 
country achieve self-reliance. We hope that Hun Sen does not betray 
the hopes of the international community. ... 
</P>
<P>
	As Cambodia's largest donor, Japan must play a major role in  
monitoring how assistance money is spent. Eradicating the suspicion 
that the aid money is being diverted to line the pockets of a 
handful of influential Cambodians is a necessary prerequisite to 
achieving political and social stability. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 3  
</P>
<P>
	The Straits Times, Singapore, on Indonesia-Singapore  
relationship: 
</P>
<P>
	It is a fact that Singapore, a dot on the map of Southeast Asia,  
is bordered by the fourth-largest country in the world. But to 
characterize that dot as red, which Indonesian President B.J. 
Habibie did a while ago, or to label it a Chinese enclave, as his 
senior adviser Dr. Dewi Fortuna Anwar has done, amounts to 
political and racial comentaries that go beyond stating the 
geographically obvious. ... 
</P>
<P>
	They are unfortunate, unfair and indeed provocative. The legacy  
of three decades of close bilateral relations, and of happy 
co-existence as members of the Asean family, is eroded every time 
uncalled-for remarks such as these appear. 
</P>
<P>
	... Why, then, is Jakarta casting aspersions on Singapore? It  
could well be that the compulsions of Indonesian domestic politics 
created by its economic crisis are weighing heavily on its foreign 
policy choices. The city state, a neighbor as small as it is close, 
is witnessing the fallout from that process. However, as a 
sovereign and independent state, it is not going to bow to the 
unwarranted pressure that is being exerted on it.

<HEADLINE> Leafs' McCauley Taken to Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto Maple Leafs center Alyn McCauley was  
taken from the ice on a stretcher after being checked hard into the 
boards early in the third period of a game against the New Jersey 
Devils on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	McCauley was driven heavily into the end boards by Devils  
defenseman Sheldon Souray at the 6:51 mark of the third period. 
McCauley's left shoulder and head appeared to take the brunt of 
Souray's hit against the glass next to New Jersey goalie Martin 
Brodeur. 
</P>
<P>
	McCauley appeared to lose consciousness and lay motionless on  
the ice for several minutes. He was attended to by four emergency 
personnel including Maple Leafs team doctor Leith Douglas who 
directed the crew to fit McCauley with a neck brace. McCauley was 
lifted onto a stretcher and taken along with his fiancee to Toronto 
Western Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials said that he suffered a head injury and that he  
had movement in all of his extremities. He was to spend the night 
in hospital and be re-examined Thursday. While the injury was not 
considered serious, coach Pat Quinn was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was unconscious for quite a while,'' Quinn said. ``We won't  
know anything until the evaluation is complete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey was leading 3-2 at the time, and the Devils went on  
to a 5-2 victory. The game was delayed about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	It been a tough season for McCauley, who was playing in just his  
fourth game after missing 22 with a knee injury.

<HEADLINE> Europe: Dollar Higher; Gold Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The dollar was up against other major currencies  
in European trading today. Gold was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0900, down from 1.0927 Tuesday. The  
dollar was quoted at 121.22 Japanese yen, up from 120.60. At midday 
in New York, the euro was quoted at $1.0888 and the dollar was 
quoted at 121.65 yen.

<HEADLINE> Bush Forms Presidential Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Republican Gov. George W. Bush says the  
formation of an exploratory committee -- to raise money and measure 
voter support for the 2000 presidential campaign -- won't distract 
him from his day job. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving to disarm potential critics, Bush said Tuesday that he  
plans to keep working in Texas until the Legislature ends its 
session on Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've told you all numerous times that I'm going to stay home,  
fight for the tax cuts, fight for a bill to ... end social 
promotion (of students) and do my job as governor,'' he said. 
``Then I will begin to travel around the nation and to listen to 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who made his announcement the same day Republican Pat  
Buchanan declared himself a presidential candidate, declined to 
comment on President Clinton but did say he would set a different 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll let the historians judge President Clinton. ... I intend  
to conduct myself in office the way I have here in the state of 
Texas, to bring dignity and honor to the office,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee announcement surprised no one. Advisers had been  
putting out the word for more than a week, but it was the first 
public step Bush has taken toward a White House race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a formal date in mind yet,'' Bush said of a final  
decision to run. ``I do know that, first things first, I'm going to 
start raising money to determine whether or not there is an 
interest beyond just people coming to Austin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raising money has not been a problem for the man polls rank  
among the front-runners for the Republican nomination. Records show 
he received about $16 million in his 1994 challenge of Democratic 
Gov. Ann Richards, and $17.7 million for last year's re-election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats quickly questioned the sincerity of Bush's pledge to  
focus on business at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``As he has an exploratory committee, there will be more and  
more people coming in to visit,'' said Molly Beth Malcolm, chair of 
the state Democratic Party. ``He has a day job that right now is 
the most critical thing -- looking out for the citizens of this 
state who elected him as governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 52, sounded the ``compassionate conservatism'' themes that  
have become his trademark. Alternating between English and Spanish, 
he said his national vision would echo his Texas record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll have a plan to encourage prosperity. But I want to make  
sure prosperity is for everybody, not a handful,'' he said. ``I 
don't want anybody left behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush often has cited his worries about the impact of a national  
campaign on his wife, Laura, and their twin 17-year-old daughters.

<HEADLINE> Logging Deal Saves Redwood Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The Headwaters Forest is finally in  
public hands following a $480 million trade praised by some 
environmentalists and condemned by others as offering too much 
money for too little. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than a decade of court battles and demonstrations --  
and a weekend of tense negotiations -- Pacific Lumber Co. agreed 
just before Monday's midnight deadline to turn over the ancient 
redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of the 12-square-mile forest gives state and  
federal officials control over the largest stand of ancient 
redwoods that remained in private ownership. Some of the trees are 
as tall as 20-story buildings and more than 2,000 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific Lumber also accepted new timber-cutting and habitat  
preservation restrictions on its remaining 330 square miles of 
redwoods and other trees, including logging bans for 12 ``lesser 
cathedral'' redwood stands, some dating back roughly 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Habitat Conservation Plan, which will last for 50 years no  
matter who owns the property. It forbids logging on the steepest 
hillsides and requires no-cut buffer zones along all year-round and 
seasonal streams in its vast timberlands in Humboldt County, about 
250 miles north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement ``is a big step toward protecting the ancient  
forests of Northern California,'' said Sierra Club Executive 
Director Carl Pope. 
</P>
<P>
	But other environmentalists condemned the plan for failing to  
restrict logging in more of the craggy redwood forests, home to 
more than 160 wildlife species. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have only protected a tiny fragment of what has already  
been fragmented,'' said Julia ``Butterfly'' Hill, vowing to remain 
in the redwood tree near the Headwaters groves s to protest the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters shouted similar complaints during a news conference  
held by the governor, state officials and environmental leaders in 
a grove of a dozen small redwoods outside the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about the orphans of the Headwaters Forest agreement? Too  
many areas are sacrificed,'' shouted Susan Moloney of Garberville. 
``What we got is great, but we needed so much more. It was too 
little for too much money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While federal and state officials said they made no concessions  
after Pacific Lumber rejected the plan on Friday, company president 
John Campbell said a series of clarifications assured they will be 
able to make a profit harvesting timber. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said there had been ``subtle changes'' that will allow  
them to selectively cut trees on unstable ground before the 
``no-cut'' buffer zones are identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will help improve our yield,'' he said. ``They have  
decided it is appropriate for us to selective log while we do the 
watershed assessment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But state Resources Secretary Mary Nichols said federal and  
state biologists had only provided Pacific Lumber with letters 
revising their estimates of how much lumber they believe the firm 
can cut annually under the new restrictions, from 137 million to 
170 million board-feet annually. 
</P>
<P>
	She said those figures ``are revised estimates, not concessions.  
... There are no side agreements. It's not a compromise. These are 
science-based numbers.''

<HEADLINE> Randy Johnson Avenges Loss to UA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Revenge is sweet, Randy Johnson joked, even  
after 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Johnson faced the University of Arizona, he walked  
six and was shelled for six runs on 13 hits in a 7-3 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	That was 1985. He was no Big Unit then, just an extremely tall,  
extremely wild junior at USC. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson took the mound against the Wildcats again on Wednesday,  
making his Arizona Diamondback debut by methodically striking out 
four of the six batters he faced in two perfect innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting back at U of A after all those beatings I used to  
take at USC,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the college players, 19-year-old Keoni DeRenne and  
21-year-old Dennis Anderson, managed to bounce out to shortstop, 
the biggest groundouts of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was almost like the Eiffel Tower because I'm only  
5-foot-7,'' DeRenne said. ``He's immense. It was just awesome, man. 
Hopefully they got it on videotape because I'd like to show it to 
my kids someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who warned last week not to expect anything  
overwhelming from him in spring training, threw 31 pitches. Five 
were call strikes, seven were swinging strikes, six were fouls, 11 
were balls and two were hit in play. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw a couple of breaking balls and change-ups, but mostly  
four-seam and two-seam fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little disappointed the breaking ball wasn't there but  
I'm always that way in spring training,'' Johnson said. ``I just 
went out there to work on my mechanics and my arm strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who signed a four-year, $52.4 million contract with the  
Diamondbacks, strolled to the mound at Tucson Electric Park under 
bright sunshine in 80-degree weather. In the distance beyond left 
field, the Catalina Mountains provided a scenic backdrop to what 
amounted to a historic moment for the second-year franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondback purple was the fourth major-league uniform  
Johnson has worn. He started his career with Montreal and spent 9 1/2 
seasons as a Seattle Mariner. For a half-season last year, he was a 
Houston Astro. Now he's the marquee addition to a high-priced 
rotation that could vault Arizona into National League contention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting,'' Johnson said, ``not nearly exciting as the  
first start I make in LA (the April 5 season opener against Kevin 
Brown in Dodger Stadium) or probably even more so when I make my 
first start at Bank One. But it's going to be an exciting four 
years for this organization and for myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd obviously favored the college kids.  
</P>
<P>
	``You've beat him before, you can beat him again,'' one fan  
yelled. 
</P>
<P>
	As they looked up at the 6-foot-10 left-hander, probably the  
most intimidating pitcher in the game, the college players showed 
no obvious fear but were plenty anxious, helping Johnson out by 
swinging at a few high hard ones out of the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson didn't want to hit anybody.  
</P>
<P>
	``I get worried if it's a guy up there making millions of  
dollars, let alone a young kid trying to get a college education,'' 
he said. ``He might be president of the United States someday. You 
never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks eventually won the game 10-2, an outcome that  
will be quickly lost to the big-leaguers in the 162-game season to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
	But the six college players who went to the plate against  
Johnson will never forget it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just to have the opportunity to face Randy Johnson, it's like  
a dream come true, it's like a childhood dream,'' said Erik Torres, 
who struck out on three pitches. ``Yeah, three pitches, but those 
three pitches meant a lot to me.''

	Lewinsky Discusses Affair on TV  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky on Wednesday disclosed an  
abortion, thoughts of suicide, and she gave the world an unabashed 
account of her life. In an ABC television interview and a separate 
book, the 25-year-old former White House intern spoke openly of 
sexual encounters with the president and several other men. But she 
saved some of her sharpest words for Kenneth Starr, the prosecutor 
who transformed her affair with Clinton into an impeachment crisis 
while providing her immunity from criminal charges. Ms. Lewinsky 
said in her book, ``Monica's Story,'' that Starr's office ``was 
sick'' for asking so many detailed questions about her sexual 
encounters. Also, Ms. Lewinsky said she now regards President 
Clinton ``to be a much bigger liar than I ever thought.''

	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- President Clinton paid back the loyalty of

Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli raise $2 million for a 
re-election campaign three years away. Appearing at a 
$1,000-per-ticket reception for Torricelli's 2002 re-election bid, 
Clinton praised him as a ``ferocious advocate'' for New Jersey and 
human rights and thanked him for his support.

	Arizona Executes 2nd German Citizen  
</P>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- Despite pleas from the German government,  
a German citizen was executed Wednesday, a week after his brother 
was put to death for the same crime. Walter LaGrand, 37, died in 
the gas chamber for his role in the 1982 murder of a bank manager. 
His brother Karl, 35, was executed Feb. 24. Both brothers chose the 
gas chamber in hopes that courts would rule that the method is 
cruel and unusual punishment and therefore unconstitutional. The 
case drew widespread attention in Germany, which has no death 
penalty, prompting repeated diplomatic protests.

<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- A two-year probe of Sweden's business  
dealings with Nazi Germany showed that little of the gold and other 
treasures accepted by the small neutral country were plundered from 
European Jews, a commission said Wednesday. The government 
commission had been appointed to determine the extent to which 
stolen gold, diamonds, art and other assets passed through Sweden 
as part of its trade with Germany during World War II. ``Sweden was 
not like Norway, where the state actually confiscated Jewish 
property,'' commission member Lennart Kanter said. ``We were not 
like Switzerland, which was known as the banking country'' of the 
1940s German regime.

	UN: Violence Helps Spread of AIDS

<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Violence against women is helping to

Marital abuse, sexual coercion, rape and the trafficking of women 
and children are forms of violence that lead directly to HIV 
infection, experts told the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women. 
Violence against girls and women throughout the world causes more 
death and disability among females between the ages of 15 and 44 
than cancer, malaria, traffic accidents and even war, according to 
the World Health Organization.

<HEADLINE> Duke Is Favored in ACC Hoops Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Even Duke's challengers are doubtful that  
anyone can beat the top-ranked Blue Devils in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (29-1) swaggers into the Charlotte Coliseum for the  
four-day event after compiling a record-setting 16-0 league mark 
and 24.3-point average winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen of Duke's ACC wins were by double digits, and no team  
got closer than eight points against a starting five that all made 
one of the first three all-conference teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is going to beat Duke. Who is going to beat them?''  
said Virginia coach Pete Gillen. ``As Dave Odom has said, as Bill 
Guthridge has said, it's going to be boring. They're a wrecking 
machine. I hate to say that, but I'm just being frank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gillen, whose ninth-seeded club lost twice to Duke by 46 points  
in the regular season, even joked that his team might ``take a 
vacation or forfeit'' instead of playing its first-round game 
Thursday night against the Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	``We voted on whether to play the game or not,'' said Gillen.  
``Our seven walk-ons said, `Play the game,' and our six healthy 
scholarship said, `No.' So, we will play. 
</P>
<P>
	``The walk-ons like the meal money, staying at a hotel and  
missing school. Our scholarship guys want to be with their 
girlfriends. But we will be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Duke is riding a 24-game winning streak and has generally  
toyed with the rest of the ACC all season, history shows that going 
undefeated in league play doesn't necessarily guarantee an ACC 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the previous seven undefeated teams in ACC play went on  
to lose in the tournament, including the two most recent teams -- 
North Carolina in 1984 and '87. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you are the favored team, other teams look at that as a  
great opportunity to get a notch in their belt. And this would be 
something if somebody was to beat Duke. It would be a great 
accomplishment,'' said North Carolina coach Bill Guthridge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils have dominated the ACC regular season in the  
'90s with six championship, but has gone 4-6 in the league 
tournament since winning its only crown of the decade in '92. 
</P>
<P>
	So, coach Mike Krzyzewski is well aware of the pitfalls -- no  
matter how dominant his teams has looked. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of things that can happen,'' said Krzyzewski.  
``At this time of the year you get even more attention than you do 
during the regular season. You can start listening to the wrong 
things. This team has not done that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the other thing is if you change focus, you start  
playing it safe, you don't attack and you don't look to get better. 
Those are also dangerous things that can happen to a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many believe Duke's closest competition will come from No. 5  
Maryland, a team still with a chance at a No. 1 seed in the NCAA 
tournament if it can knock off the Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-seeded Terrapins (25-4) set a school-record with 13  
wins in the ACC, but still finished three games behind Duke in the 
standings and lost to them by 18 points twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've had a great deal of success against us but we've  
beaten them at times in the last five or six years,'' Maryland 
coach Gary Williams said of Duke. ``Nobody has beaten Duke this 
year. If we have a mental block against them then everybody else 
does too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Terrapins would love another shot at Duke, but Williams said  
playing in the Puerto Rico Shootout back in November helped his 
team learn a lesson about looking ahead to opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played three games in three days and we were supposed to  
play Kentucky in the championship game, but it didn't work out that 
way,'' Williams said of the Wildcats losing before the title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand it's a win or go home situation. You don't get  
any takeovers. To look past any game to get ready for a certain 
team is ridiculous at this time of year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland will play the winner of the Florida State-Clemson game,  
which opens the tourney on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two games Friday will pit No. 4 seed Wake Forest  
(16-12) against No. 5 seed N.C. State (17-12), while two-time 
defending champion North Carolina, the No. 3 seed, takes on No. 6 
seed Georgia Tech (15-14) in the nightcap. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15th-ranked Tar Heels (22-8) are gunning for their fifth ACC  
tournament title of the '90s, but are coming off a 20-point home 
loss against Duke and haven't been playing particularly well of 
late. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what has happened. We've gotten too relaxed, too  
comfortable out there,'' UNC point guard Ed Cota said of North 
Carolina's recent slump. ``We're not making the extra passes 
anymore. People are putting their heads down and looking to score 
on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you watched us play early in the season, the ball movement  
we had, how we played defense together, and you watch us know, it's 
totally different.''

<HEADLINE>  IOC Status May Be Changed in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House was asked Wednesday to help  
clean up the Olympic bribery scandal, a simmering million-dollar 
corruption case that one gold medalist compared to a drug test for 
the leaders of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of a scathing ethics report that said the world's  
biggest sports event was run by a corrupt club, President Clinton 
was urged to place the International Olympic Committee under the 
same federal law that deals with dishonest foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl, who sent the request  
to Clinton in a letter, said such action would be an important step 
toward cleansing the Olympics of the ``global crisis'' of the Salt 
Lake City scandal, in which bidders paid more than $1.2 million to 
try to buy the votes that helped win the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``To do any less would mean facing a future that might include  
the loss of the games and noble ideals they profess,'' Hybl said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said USOC oversight of Salt Lake bidders had been  
``abysmal.'' USOC executive director Dick Schultz said the scandal 
was ``embarrassing.'' Both promised it would not recur, and 
unveiled internal reforms aimed at making sure it did not. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to put in place procedures, policies and  
individuals who will not allow this to happen again,'' Hybl said at 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said he and Hybl had called IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch early Wednesday to tell him about the steps the USOC was 
taking, including the request to the White House to label the 
committee a public international organization covered under the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pleased we would call and tell him what we were going  
to do,'' Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC leaders said they would wait for the IOC to carry out its  
own promised reforms at a special general assembly March 17-18, and 
Hybl said Samaranch should stay in office as changes are made. 
</P>
<P>
	But others made it clear the IOC, the target of harsh criticism  
this week from the ethics panel headed by former Senate Majority 
Leader George Mitchell, was under pressure to deal with the scandal 
quickly and completely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do hope the IOC continues to clean its house,'' said Olympic  
track champion Jackie Joyner-Kersee, now a special assistant to 
Hybl. ``It's just like dealing with drug testing. You're guilty 
until the results come back clean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee and four-time Olympic swimming gold medalist John  
Naber said hearing the tales of IOC members receiving expensive 
gifts, lavish travel, college help for their families and piles of 
cash had been hard for athletes to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ``We have to get back to the  
athletes. They are the ones who are going to suffer, while other 
people decorate their homes nicely and drive new cars. For 
athletes, the Olympic Rings are a dream. They may have been 
tarnished, but for the athletes the rings must still shine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Samaranch should not resign, although ``all fingers are  
pointing back in his direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Naber, a TV commentator and head of a U.S. Olympic alumni  
association, said anyone who ``willfully and intentionally'' broke 
IOC rules ``should immediately and forevermore lose the right to 
make those rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled, and at least 19  
more remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some heads already have rolled, and I'm not sure we're  
finished yet with the bloodletting,'' Naber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said the USOC's executive committee had approved all the  
recommendations made by the Mitchell panel, including a ban on 
bid-city assistance funds for IOC members and foreign athletes, 
strengthening USOC controls over American cities bidding for the 
games, and setting up an office to deal with conflict-of-interest 
and ethics issues. Schultz said that office would be modeled after 
corporate agencies and could include watchdogs both inside and 
outside the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
	All meetings of the USOC board of directors and executive  
committee will be open to the public, and all members will be 
expected to attend at least three-quarters of the meetings, Hybl 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the USOC would increase participation by  
Olympic-level athletes in its decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the committee will place a permanent staff member  
in Salt Lake to oversee organizers and require that any gifts or 
payments to committee staff members and officials for Olympic 
activities be turned over to the USOC's chief financial officer. 
USOC rules already limit gifts to $25.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Murder Case Remains Unpunished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Willie Edwards Jr. was a 25-year-old  
rookie truck driver for Winn-Dixie supermarkets when he was called 
into work on the afternoon of Jan. 23, 1957. He never returned 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards' truck was found later that day with the door open, the  
keys in the ignition and some cheese and crackers on the front 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have long believed Edwards was abducted by four men  
with ties to the Ku Klux Klan who mistakenly believed he had made 
advances at a white woman. The group allegedly took him to the 
Tyler Goodwin Bridge in Montgomery and forced him, at gunpoint, to 
jump into the Alabama River. 
</P>
<P>
	His death was ruled a drowning.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, more than 40 years after the death, a grand jury has  
returned no indictments against his attackers despite a deathbed 
confession from one alleged suspect and the cooperation of another. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very, very upset with it, because I had the impression  
that we were going to get an indictment,'' Edwards' widow, Sarah 
Salter, said Tuesday from her home in Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery County District Attorney Ellen Brooks said the grand  
jury declined to indict because of insufficient evidence and 
previous immunity agreements. Two of the four suspects have died. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the family's second attempt to resolve the case that  
began when the body of Edwards was pulled from the river by a 
fisherman three months after he vanished. Edwards left two children 
and a third on its way. 
</P>
<P>
	According to grand jury testimony from Raymond Britt Jr., who  
turned government witness, he and three other white men went 
looking for a black delivery man who supposedly had made a pass at 
a white woman. They found Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time his body was found months later, officials said  
advanced decomposition made determining a cause of death 
impossible. Edwards' death was treated as an accident until 1976, 
when the state attorney general's office began to re-investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	That year, Britt, Henry Alexander, Kyle Livingston Jr. and James  
York were indicted. The case was later thrown out because the judge 
ruled prosecutors had failed to establish how Edwards died. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who died in 1992, confessed to the killing on his  
deathbed, according to his former common-law wife, Diane Alexander. 
She did not reveal the confession until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Edwards' family asked Ms. Brooks to re-open the  
investigation and had the body exhumed. After testing, Judge 
Charles Price ordered the state to change Edwards' cause of death 
from ``unknown'' to drowning. 
</P>
<P>
	Homicide became the official reason.  
</P>
<P>
	Britt, the only living suspect who has admitted to participating  
in the slaying, could not be prosecuted because he was granted 
immunity in 1976 after agreeing to cooperate in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, Britt claimed Livingston was one of the four men  
who forced Edwards off the bridge, but later recanted and said he 
had mistakenly identified Livingston. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston has denied involvement, telling The Montgomery  
Advertiser on Monday, ``I'm tired of my name being connected to 
it.'' Britt did not return a message left at his home in Jackson, 
Miss. York has died. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite concluding that ``Edwards was murdered in Montgomery  
County by members and-or associates of the Ku Klux Klan,'' grand 
jurors refused to return any new indictments two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my opinion, as a prosecutor for nearly 20 years, there is  
insufficient evidence to pursue criminal prosecution for any of the 
people responsible for the death of Willie Edwards,'' Ms. Brooks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Malinda Edwards, 45, daughter of the slain man, said she is  
exploring her options and has begun consulting other attorneys. 
``None of this adds up to me,'' she said from Columbus, Ohio. ``I 
just cannot let this rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither can Mrs. Salter.  
</P>
<P>
	``I will not stand still until I get justice for him. I'm going  
to keep on if it takes the rest of my life to do it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards and Mrs. Salter both say they want the men  
responsible for Willie Edwards' death to pay a price for their 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm quite sure they have lived a good life and they have not  
been prosecuted,'' Mrs. Salter said. ``It doesn't seem like it's 
going to get anywhere, not in Montgomery, Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand it, and I never will understand it,'' she  
said. ``I don't know the law very much, but I just feel like things 
weren't done right.''

<HEADLINE> Court: Schools Must Pay Nurses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public schools must finance one-on-one nursing  
care for some disabled students throughout the school day, the 
Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in a decision that may strain 
educational budgets across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting 7-2 in the case of an Iowa teen-ager, the court said  
public financing is required under the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act because the federal law's exemption for 
``medical services'' applies only when a doctor's help is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision's immediate impact is certain: Iowa's Cedar Rapids  
Community School District must pay tens of thousands of dollars a 
year to provide nursing care for Garret Frey, a quadriplegic on a 
ventilator who is thriving as a high school sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling's broader impact is cloudier.  
</P>
<P>
	The court's two dissenters said the decision ``blindsides unwary  
states with fiscal obligations they could not have anticipated.'' 
But Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court that Congress 
wanted to ``help guarantee that students like Garret are integrated 
into the public schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contacted at his Cedar Rapids school and told about his victory,  
Garret said: ``It's going to help a lot of other kids, not just me 
and other kids in Iowa. It's going to help all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National School Boards Association was less enthusiastic.  
``At the current time, the public educational system in this 
country is not adequately funded to provide full medical services 
for approximately 17,000 students with severe disabilities,'' said 
Anne L. Bryant, the group's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want Garret in school -- he's an excellent student,'' she  
said. ``But schools can't do it alone. The federal government needs 
to pay its share of a less-than-adequately funded special education 
service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government now pays about 12 percent of the nation's  
special education costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration had sided with Garret, 16. State and  
local school boards should look to Medicaid as well as Department 
of Education state grants to help ``work for the types of services 
at issue,'' said Judith Heumann, assistant secretary of education 
for special education and rehabilitative services. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal law, first approved in 1975, provides that all  
children with disabilities receive a ``free appropriate public 
education.'' Under it, public schools are required to provide 
various ``special education and related services,'' but an 
exception is made for medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stevens described Garret as a ``friendly, creative and  
intelligent young man'' who was paralyzed from the neck down in a 
motorcycle accident when he was 4. 
</P>
<P>
	His daily health care includes urinary catheterization,  
suctioning of his tracheotomy, providing food and drink, 
repositioning in his wheelchair, monitoring his blood pressure and 
responding to the alarms on his ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
	Cedar Rapids school officials said the special help Garret  
requires so he can attend high school is so involved and expensive 
that it should be considered medical treatment. The nation's 
highest court disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	The court acknowledged that the school district ``may have  
legitimate financial concerns'' in providing continuous, one-on-one 
nursing care, but said the court's only role is to interpret what 
the federal law requires. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress intended to open the door of public education to all  
qualified children and required participating states to educate 
handicapped children with non-handicapped children whenever 
possible,'' Stevens wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining him were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices  
Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas dissented.  
</P>
<P>
	Through most of his schooling, Garret has been assisted by a  
licensed practical nurse, paid through an insurance policy and 
money from the $1.3 million settlement with the motorcycle company 
involved in the accident that paralyzed him. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision could subject the school district to more than  
$285,000 in legal fees and nursing costs, although there's little 
agreement between the school district and Garret's mother, Charlene 
Frey, over the costs involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The school district has estimated annual costs at between  
$30,000 and $40,000 in addition to the $10,000 to $12,000 now spent 
to provide Garret with a teacher associate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Freys' lawyer has called those estimates inflated, saying a  
registered nurse could combine both the health and the teacher 
associate duties, costing the school district a total of about 
$18,000 a year.

<HEADLINE> King, Boxer Reach Unique Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Boxing promoter Don King agreed Wednesday to  
share proceeds from a boxer's next four bouts with a rival promoter 
in a deal that ends a civil trial and puts a federal judge in the 
unusual position of monitoring the pact. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is history,'' King said, suggesting that some order was  
needed in the business of boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement cut short King's testimony in a case brought by  
boxer Miguel Angel Gonzalez, a super lightweight who last year 
fought to a draw with six-time world champion Julio Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	King and Dan Goossen will co-promote the bouts in what both  
described as a historic pledge to work together, sharing expenses 
and profits, with U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack as the final 
arbitrator of any disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollack, who will be 93 this year, told a jury as he dismissed  
them that he had told both sides in the legal dispute to try to 
reach a deal during lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was pleased that during ``these remaining years in  
the twilight of my time, I get a chance to do more than just call 
balls and strikes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors leaving the courtroom said they doubted they could have  
declared either side a clear winner because the boxing world was 
such a mix of handshakes, verbal deals and contracts written in 
English for boxers who speak another language. 
</P>
<P>
	Juror Anger Blucher Hong called the boxer and King ``bullheaded  
and stubborn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juror Michael Morrison acknowledged that jurors laughed along  
with King as he testified but added, ``Once you take away the hot 
air and the verbage, I'd never want to draw up a contract with 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 68-year-old King, wearing a tie designed as an American  
flag, praised Gonzalez as reliable and honest, saying the boxer had 
promised he would be his promoter for life. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a wonderful kid, your honor. He's being enslaved,'' King  
told Pollack, suggesting that the boxer was being persuaded by 
others to break his deal with King. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollack, though, was skeptical of King's insistence that he had  
clearly explained to Gonzalez that he was signing a contract for a 
single bout that required him to remain with King for subsequent 
fights. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked King whether he spoke Spanish and then traded phrases  
with him before slipping in a line that caused King to laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ahhh! You tried to trick me. That's in French!'' King said as  
the judge smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	After the settlement was reached, Gonzalez said through an  
interpreter that he was pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I want now is to go fight,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	King said an alliance between promoters such as the one he  
reached with Goossen might make it easier to communicate with 
boxers about contracts so they do not take disputes about them to 
court as frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be the promoter took advantage of the fighter.  
Today the fighters take advantage of the promoters,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Washington-area shock jock who lost his job  
last week for making a racially insensitive reference to the Texas 
dragging death of James Byrd, Jr. apologized Wednesday ``to anyone 
and everyone who was hurt'' by it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a pathetic attempt at morbid racial humor,'' said Doug  
``The Greaseman'' Tracht, who was fired from his morning drive job 
at WARW Radio Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing a portion of a song by Grammy-award winning  
recording artist Lauryn Hill, Tracht had said, ``No wonder people 
drag them behind trucks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement led station management to suspend him and sparked  
national outrage among black leaders and broadcasters. After 
protests and a deluge a phone calls WARW Radio fired Tracht. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sorrow is for anyone and everyone who was hurt by my  
statement,'' said Tracht, adding that ``mere apologies are not 
enough.'' He spoke at a news conference organized by former boxing 
promoter Rock Newman. 
</P>
<P>
	This was not the first time that Tracht had run afoul of the  
black community. In 1986, in a reference to the Martin Luther King 
holiday, he said, ``Kill four more and we can take the week off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracht apologized to the Byrd family, the national  
African-American community, Hill, his fans and listeners, his 
co-workers and his wife, who said his latest gaffe also prompted 
her to consider taking an afternoon flight to the West Coast never 
to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Local radio talk show host Joe Madison is trying to arrange for  
Tracht to visit the Byrd family in Jasper, Texas. ``I would like to 
fly out there and talk to them personally and let them know how 
sorry I am,'' said Tracht. ``Whatever I can do physically, 
emotionally for the Byrd family I will do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracht says that his public apology was not designed to help him  
get a new job or an offer to return to WARW. ``I'm here to reclaim 
my reputation back,'' said Tracht. 
</P>
<P>
	But Les Brown, a motivational speaker and talk show host on WMMJ  
Radio in Washington said, ``I don't believe that there is any place 
in radio for people like ``Greaseman'' and others who are 
encouraging racism.''

<HEADLINE>  IOC Status May Be Changed in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House was asked Wednesday to help  
clean up the Olympic bribery scandal, a simmering million-dollar 
corruption case that one gold medalist compared to a drug test for 
the leaders of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of a scathing ethics report that said the world's  
biggest sports event was run by a corrupt club, President Clinton 
was urged to place the International Olympic Committee under the 
same federal law that deals with dishonest foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl, who sent the request  
to Clinton in a letter, said such action would be an important step 
toward cleansing the Olympics of the ``global crisis'' of the Salt 
Lake City scandal, in which bidders paid more than $1.2 million to 
try to buy the votes that helped win the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``To do any less would mean facing a future that might include  
the loss of the games and noble ideals they profess,'' Hybl said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said USOC oversight of Salt Lake bidders had been  
``abysmal.'' USOC executive director Dick Schultz said the scandal 
was ``embarrassing.'' Both promised it would not recur, and 
unveiled internal reforms aimed at making sure it did not. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to put in place procedures, policies and  
individuals who will not allow this to happen again,'' Hybl said at 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said he and Hybl had called IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch early Wednesday to tell him about the steps the USOC was 
taking, including the request to the White House to label the 
committee a public international organization covered under the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pleased we would call and tell him what we were going  
to do,'' Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC leaders said they would wait for the IOC to carry out its  
own promised reforms at a special general assembly March 17-18, and 
Hybl said Samaranch should stay in office as changes are made. 
</P>
<P>
	But others made it clear the IOC, the target of harsh criticism  
this week from the ethics panel headed by former Senate Majority 
Leader George Mitchell, was under pressure to deal with the scandal 
quickly and completely.

	``I do hope the IOC continues to clean its house,'' said Olympic  
track champion Jackie Joyner-Kersee, now a special assistant to 
Hybl. ``It's just like dealing with drug testing. You're guilty 
until the results come back clean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee and four-time Olympic swimming gold medalist John  
Naber said hearing the tales of IOC members receiving expensive 
gifts, lavish travel, college help for their families and piles of 
cash had been hard for athletes to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ``We have to get back to the  
athletes. They are the ones who are going to suffer, while other 
people decorate their homes nicely and drive new cars. For 
athletes, the Olympic Rings are a dream. They may have been 
tarnished, but for the athletes the rings must still shine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Samaranch should not resign, although ``all fingers are  
pointing back in his direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Naber, a TV commentator and head of a U.S. Olympic alumni  
association, said anyone who ``willfully and intentionally'' broke 
IOC rules ``should immediately and forevermore lose the right to 
make those rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled, and at least 19  
more remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some heads already have rolled, and I'm not sure we're  
finished yet with the bloodletting,'' Naber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said the USOC's executive committee had approved all the  
recommendations made by the Mitchell panel, including a ban on 
bid-city assistance funds for IOC members and foreign athletes, 
strengthening USOC controls over American cities bidding for the 
games, and setting up an office to deal with conflict-of-interest 
and ethics issues. Schultz said that office would be modeled after 
corporate agencies and could include watchdogs both inside and 
outside the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
	All meetings of the USOC board of directors and executive

said.

activities be turned over to the USOC's chief financial officer.

get a new job or an offer to return to WARW. ``I'm here to reclaim 
my reputation back,'' said Tracht.

in radio for people like ``Greaseman'' and others who are 
encouraging racism.''

<HEADLINE>  Alonzo Mourning Blames Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The only person Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning  
blames these days is himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he would blame the refs and cheap shots from  
opponents. Now he's a smarter, calmer and improved version of 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this is a game of mistakes,'' he said. ``I'm my biggest  
critic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, Mourning missed three shots in the final  
seconds of the fourth quarter against the New York Knicks. That 
sent the game into overtime, and nearly cost Miami the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat won 85-84, with Mourning grabbing the final rebound as  
time ran out after Patrick Ewing missed a jumper that could have 
won it for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I rushed a lot of things,'' Mourning said, sounding almost  
apologetic. ``I made some bad decisions. I've got to make better 
decisions. Fortunately, we came up with a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Mourning would grow so frustrated he forgot  
basketball and took to his fists. 
</P>
<P>
	Case in point: Game 4 of last year's playoff against the Knicks.  
Mourning got into a fight with Larry Johnson and was suspended. The 
Heat lost Game 5, and Miami coach Pat Riley said Mourning's short 
fuse cost the Heat the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Many also remember Mourning coming unraveled as Dennis Rodman  
taunted and hounded the 6-foot-10 center when Miami lost two 
playoff series to the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite still being pushed around by opponents -- Tuesday it was  
Chris Dudley who appeared to frustrate Mourning the most -- he 
stands his ground and keeps his cool. 
</P>
<P>
	No whining to officials. The only talking he does is to himself.  
It's not unusual to see Mourning admonish himself after missing a 
shot or blowing a play on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, Mourning finished with 28 points, 11 rebounds  
and seven blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of things I should have done to help this  
team have an easier outcome, without a doubt,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So changed is Mourning, that he has yet to foul out of a game  
this season. He seems more focused, even making free throws, 
usually his weakness. Against the Knicks he went 10-for-13. Against 
the Orlando Magic on Sunday he was 14-for-15. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm working on trying to be a mistake-free player,'' Mourning  
said. ``There are a lot of things I have to work on as a player if 
I'm going to help contribute to this ball club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His mentor, Ewing, said Mourning's approach to the game really  
hasn't changed, just people's impression of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zo always has been focused,'' he said. ``He's not doing  
anything different than he's done in the past. Maybe you all should 
respect him a little more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley is impressed by Mourning's work.  
</P>
<P>
	``Zo plays very, very hard,'' Riley said following the Knicks  
game. ``He did not shoot the ball well, but he plays with a lot of 
heart.''

<HEADLINE> Doctors Cutting Rate of Delirium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Doctors cut the rate of delirium among elderly hospital patients  
40 percent by training the staff to recognize and counteract the 
danger signs before confusion, agitation and hallucinations set in, 
a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The steps were simple -- for example, making sure patients get  
enough fluids, taking them for walks and keeping them mentally 
active. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, led by Dr. Sharon Inouye, a professor of medicine and  
geriatrics at the Yale University School of Medicine, was published 
in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to delirium, prevention is considered crucial,  
because the condition may not be entirely reversible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once delirium occurs, the cat is kind of out of the bag,''  
Inouye said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delirium hits more than 2.3 million elderly hospital patients a  
year, adding up to $4 billion a year to Medicare and increasing the 
costs of rehabilitation and home care after patients leave, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She studied 852 patients at Yale-New Haven Hospital who were at  
least 70 and had risk factors such as severe illness, trouble 
thinking or seeing, or signs of kidney trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	A nurse, several specialists and volunteers were trained to  
recognize and treat danger signs such as immobility, dehydration, 
and trouble thinking, sleeping, seeing or hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, patients with trouble sleeping would get warm milk  
or herbal tea at bedtime, relaxation tapes or music, and back 
massage. Nurses would use vibrating beepers and silent pill 
crushers to keep the ward quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-four of the patients who didn't get the special treatment  
became delirious, compared with 42 in the treatment group -- or 15 
percent vs. 9.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The program cost about $327 per patient.  
</P>
<P>
	The length and cost of their hospital stays were not affected.  
Inouye said she is following the cases to see whether the lower 
rate of delirium translated into better health -- and lower expenses 
-- in the year after the hospital stay. 
</P>
<P>
	At Yale-New Haven, the board was so impressed with the program  
that it made it permanent, and it now serves more than 800 elderly 
patients a year.

<HEADLINE> IOC Status May Be Changed in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee wants the White  
House to place the scandal-ridden IOC under federal laws that will 
force leaders of the games to live up to the ``noble ideals they 
profess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saying strong action was needed to avoid ``the loss of the  
Olympic Games,'' USOC president Bill Hybl said today he would ask 
President Clinton that the International Olympic Committee be 
identified as a public international organization under the Federal 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expected other nations ``to support this initiative  
as an important way to truly level the playing field'' for all 
cities seeking to stage the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl's announcement was contained in the USOC's formal response  
to a report by a special ethics panel that said the IOC had 
fostered a ``culture of improper gift-giving'' that led to the Salt 
Lake City bribery scandal, the worst in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his request to the White House, Hybl said the  
USOC's executive committee had approved all the recommendations 
made by the ethics panel led by former Senate Majority Leader 
George Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	These include a ban on bid-city assistance funds for foreign  
athletes, strengthening USOC controls over American cities bidding 
for the games and setting up a compliance office to deal with 
conflict-of-interest issues in the bid process. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl also said all meetings of the USOC board of directors and  
executive committee would be open to the public. The USOC also 
ordered all members to attend at least three-quarters of its annual 
meetings and said it would increase participation by Olympic-level 
athletes in its decision making. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl and executive director Dick Schultz also said the USOC  
would place a permanent staff member in Salt Lake to oversee 
Olympic organizers. They added that all committee staff members and 
officials would now have to turn over any gifts to the USOC's chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very saddened about what was going on, and it was  
hurting the Olympic family,'' said Olympic track champion Jackie 
Joyner-Kersee, now a special assistant to Hybl. ``Our hard work 
should not be tarnished by what was going on, but change is in 
progress and we are all working hard to make sure we can be proud 
to be Olympic athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said the Salt Lake City scandal, in which 30 of the IOC's  
115 members have been implicated, was ``the most serious 
challenge'' to the Olympics in 105 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This challenge has become a global crisis that demands the  
most aggressive possible action and a commitment to change,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Mitchell commission focused on the IOC, it also  
criticized USOC policy for allowing Salt Lake bidders too much free 
rein. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said the USOC accepted the criticism and was ready to make  
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time to find the flaws, correct the mistakes and create  
a system that will ensure that these mistakes never happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must return the games and the attention to the athletes,  
the most important members of the Olympic family. It is their 
dreams that we must make possible.''

<HEADLINE> Cargo Ship's Bow Hits Beach Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALDPORT, Ore. (AP) -- The broken bow of the cargo ship New  
Carissa washed back onto the beach Wednesday after attempts over 
the past month to firebomb it, pump it and tow it out to sea all 
failed to make the oil-laden menace go away. 
</P>
<P>
	The bow nosed onto the beach at dawn just off a rocky stretch of  
the Oregon coast after a storm 50 miles out in the Pacific ripped 
the hulk free from the tug that was towing it out to sea to be 
sunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Just hours earlier, Coast Guard Capt. Mike Hall lit a cigar to  
celebrate the departure of the wreckage and said: ``Certainly the 
worst-case scenario is that she would come up on shore again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of the grounding -- 60 miles north of where the ship  
originally scraped bottom Feb. 4 -- sticky tar balls began showing 
up on the beach, apparently from the bow's tanks, which were still 
holding up to 130,000 gallons of heavy bunker fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers in yellow rain slickers fanned out near the 420-foot  
wreck with shovels to scoop up oil, and booms were set up to 
protect the fragile estuary around nearby Alsea Bay. At least five 
birds were seen coated with oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard officials scrambled to bring in another tug to pull  
the wreck back out to sea, but high winds and 20-foot swells 
prevented them from getting started. 
</P>
<P>
	For residents along Oregon's ruggedly beautiful coast, the ship  
has taken on the persona of a horror-flick villain who simply will 
not die. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jan Livingstone of the town of Yachats heard the ship broke  
free of its tow line Tuesday night, she told her husband in jest: 
``It will be on our beach in the morning.'' When she woke up, it 
was making its way through the surf outside her window. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, we were just joking,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The cargo ship originally ran aground near Coos Bay in a storm  
and began leaking some of the 400,000 gallons of fuel oil aboard. 
Officials feared a disastrous spill if the ship broke apart in the 
surf, so they used plastic explosives and napalm to set the ship 
ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fire succeeded in burning away only about half the oil  
on board, and the ship split in two, fouling the beaches with 
70,000 gallons of black slime. 
</P>
<P>
	After storms scuttled a painstakingly slow process of trying to  
pump the oil out, authorities went forward with a plan to tow the 
bow 200 miles out to sea and sink it with gunboats in thousands of 
feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
	They were using what they thought was an extra-tough,  
3-inch-thick, 1,100-yard tow rope flown in from the Netherlands. 
But the line frazzled from rubbing against the bow and snapped in a 
storm that kicked up 70 mph winds and 30-foot swells. Soon, it was 
Coos Bay all over again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to have not seen it here now,'' said Coast Guard  
spokesman Matthew Brewer. ``We're just going to have to do it all 
again.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs Amish Labor Exemptions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amish children would be allowed to work in  
sawmills and other woodworking settings under legislation the House 
passed to get around Labor Department child-protection regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, approved Tuesday on a voice vote, was needed to  
help preserve Amish religious traditions that call for youngsters 
to work in apprenticeship settings beyond eighth grade. Critics 
questioned the wisdom of letting teen-agers work in potentially 
dangerous settings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inexperience, small size and the lack of maturity can all act  
to increase the risk of accidents,'' said Rep. William Clay of 
Missouri, ranking Democrat of the House Education and Workforce 
Committee. ``It poses undue jeopardy in the health and safety of 
children too young to legally smoke, too young to consume alcohol 
products and too young to defend this country in the military.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters termed the bill ``common-sense legislation'' to  
resolve a conflict between government regulations and the Amish way 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is extremely important that we strike a delicate balance  
between honoring the differences between religions of this country 
and having a safe and healthy workplace,'' said Tim Roemer, D-Ind. 
``This legislation strikes this principal compromise between these 
two interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure now goes to the Senate, where a similar bill died  
last year partly over doubts about the constitutionality of 
exempting one religious group. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the labor committee,  
urged lawmakers to disregard the constitutional considerations, 
saying that was for the courts and not Congress to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would let Amish teen-agers work in sawmills,  
woodworking shops and other industries considered essential by the 
Amish but harmful by the Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal child-protection laws prohibit children under 16 from  
working in manufacturing operations such as sawmills and children 
under 18 from working in other hazardous occupations, even for 
tasks that do not require operating mechanical equipment. Amish 
businesses have been fined thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amish are known for shunning modern conveniences and taught  
to live apart from the world and abstain from worldly goods. Some 
150,000 Amish live in 22 states and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Their religious traditions forbid formal schooling beyond eighth  
grade, and youngsters are supposed to work with family and 
community members to gain hands-on experience in a craft. Although 
the Amish livelihood has traditionally been rooted in agriculture, 
many families have turned to woodworking and other small industries 
because of the growing costs of farming. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Amish view this work as part of their schooling,'' said  
Rep. Joseph Pitts, R-Pa., the bill's chief sponsor. ``The 
regulations have severely threatened the lifestyle and religion of 
this humble community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation, teen-agers would be able to work in  
limited woodworking settings and still would be prohibited from 
directly operating mechanical equipment.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Pastor Accused in Church Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The former pastor of a tiny church that  
burned in 1996 amid a series of church blazes around the South was 
accused Wednesday of setting the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Daniel Harris, 37, who now lives in Marlow, Okla., was  
charged with one count of arson. He faces up to 20 years in prison 
and a fine of up to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Johnson said Harris had not yet  
been arrested. Johnson would not answer questions about a possible 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris could not be reached for comment. A telephone operator  
said there was no listing for an Eric Daniel Harris in Marlow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky Missionary Baptist Church near Benton burned on  
Aug. 24, 1996, amid a series of fires in both predominantly black 
and white churches. Kentucky Missionary's 45-member congregation is 
white. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after the fire, Harris said in an interview: ``We were  
out here shedding tears and helping each other get through this. 
It's like watching your home burn.'' He said in the interview that 
a passing motorist noticed the fire and contacted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rev. Dennis McClintic, who replaced Harris as pastor about two  
years ago, said the congregation is heartbroken and somewhat 
stunned by the news of Harris' indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to pray for his family. We are going to pray for  
him. The members here are not ones to hold a grudge,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Backstreet Boys Use Choir for Album </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- The Backstreet Boys recruited some local  
talent to sing backup on the youthful heartthrobs' next album, 
``Millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Littrell, a member of the quintet and a 1994 graduate of  
Tates Creek High School, was home Monday to direct 45 local choral 
students for the song ``Perfect Fan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tune was written for Littrell's mother, and he said using  
the choir -- made up mostly of current or former Tates Creek 
students -- was a gesture of appreciation toward choir teacher Barry 
Turner, who encouraged Littrell to try for a singing career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never really pictured myself to be a singer before that,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Backstreet Boys' current self-titled album has been on  
Billboard's top album list for 77 weeks. Their hits include ``Quit 
Playing Games (With My Heart).''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans End Rally / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated early today  
on the Chicago Board of Trade as a two-day rally prompted increased 
farmer selling of ample stored supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers were taking advantage of higher prices to get rid of  
crops that have seen little sign of increasing in value over the 
past few months, as weak demand walks hand-in-hand with large world 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also fell under pressure from a worsening currency  
crunch in Brazil, which may lead to increased selling of competing 
crops there. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat retreated on ideas that moisture over the weekend may  
benefit newly emerged crops, while cooler weather may slow rapid 
early development. Wheat rose sharply a day earlier on fears 
below-normal temperatures in winter wheat growing regions would 
damage the crop, which accounts for about 75 percent of total U.S. 
wheat production. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures fell in step with soybeans and wheat.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery fell 3 cents to $2.60 3/4 a bushel; May corn  
fell 1 1/2 cents to $2.14 1/4 a bushel; May oats fell 1/2 cents to $1.04 3/4 a 
bushel; May soybeans fell 2 cents to $4.69 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while feeder cattle were mixed and pork futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle rose .05 cent to 67.75 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .23 cent to 73.17 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell .78 cent to 42.27 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell .32 
cent to 47.45 cents a pound.

	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A member of the Ku Klux Klan has been  
sentenced to 26 1/2 years in prison for his role in a nightclub 
shooting that wounded three black teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton Spires Jr., 28, apologized for the shooting and  
condemned the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish people would stay out of this organization and put an  
end to it,'' Spires said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spires and Joshua England, 20, had attended a Confederate flag  
rally in October 1996 and were driving and drinking later in the 
day when they came upon a crowd of mostly black individuals outside 
Club Illusion in Pelion. 
</P>
<P>
	England admitted last year that he fired a rifle 11 times into  
the crowd while Spires drove. He was sentenced to nearly 26 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Spires may still be charged with perjury and  
obstruction of justice for testimony he gave in a previous Klan 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Horace King, grand dragon of the Christian Knights in South  
Carolina, was ordered by a jury last year to pay $8 million for 
inciting Klansmen to torch a predominantly black church. 
</P>
<P>
	Spires testified at the trial that King suggested to him the  
idea of shooting up a black nightclub. Spires later admitted he 
lied. King has repeatedly said he does not encourage violence by 
Klansmen.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Do OK With Gretzky Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Rangers have suddenly found  
themselves after losing Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	Since their top scorer was sidelined by a neck injury on Friday,  
the Rangers have put together a three-game unbeaten streak to keep 
their playoff hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone would have thought we'd have the success  
that we've had over the last three games -- five points out of six 
against the quality of teams we've played,'' Rangers coach John 
Muckler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all very good hockey clubs, so over the last three  
games you have to be proud of our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First, the Rangers beat the Phoenix Coyotes 3-0. Then the  
Philadelphia Flyers 6-5. And Tuesday night, the Rangers tied the 
league-leading Dallas Stars 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been an impressive stretch for the Rangers, not only  
because of the teams they have played but because of their injury 
situation. Gretzky hasn't been the only one out. Todd Harvey, Jeff 
Buekeboom and Peter Popovic have also been sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone realizes that collectively, we have to fill the  
void,'' said Adam Graves, who has played on the top line with 
Gretzky for most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury to Gretzky couldn't have come at a worse time for the  
Rangers. They're in a five-team struggle for a playoff berth. Even 
with Tuesday night's tie, they dropped four points out of the final 
spot, currently held by the Boston Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said he ``could see the desperation  
(in the Rangers') eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers thoroughly impressed Hitchcock.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was as hard as this team has played us in a long time,''  
Hitchcock added. 
</P>
<P>
	That has basically been the Rangers' game plan since Gretzky  
went down and the team learned he would be missing for a minimum of 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing better defensively,'' Muckler said. ``We're  
doing more forechecking. A lot of people have stepped up. We talked 
about this when Wayne went down. The guys in the dressing room 
weren't afraid of that challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing as a team. They're working hard. They believe  
in each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petr Nedved has been among the most prominent of the Rangers to  
step forward. Since taking over Gretzky's center spot on the 
Rangers' top line, Nedved has so far produced three goals and three 
assists in the three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Another key player in the streak has been Graves, who scored his  
30th goal Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does so many things for us,'' goaltender Mike Richter said  
of Graves. ``He's a great penalty killer. Once he gets the puck, 
he's a very difficult player to get it away from. He battles in 
front. He gets hard goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York's special teams have also rated a star in the last  
three games as the Rangers evened their home record at 14-14-3. 
Against Dallas, the Rangers killed all seven of the Stars' power 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our play has improved and that has given us the confidence and  
the ability to win games,'' Richter said. ``We finally started 
making Madison Square Garden a tough place to play.''

<HEADLINE> Webster Accused Again of Forging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONACA, Pa. (AP) -- Mike Webster, the Pittsburgh Steelers center  
who was elected to the NFL Hall of Fame, has been accused of 
forging prescriptions at another pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster, who was charged last week with forgery at a pharmacy in  
Rochester, was charged Tuesday with presenting bogus prescriptions 
for Ritalin at three pharmacies in Center Township, about 25 miles 
northwest of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster, 46, lives in the township.  
</P>
<P>
	He retired from the Kansas City Chiefs in 1990 after winning  
four Super Bowl rings with the Steelers. Since then, his troubles 
include a failed marriage, brief homelessness and illness. Webster 
said he had minor heart attacks, depression and post-concussion 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritalin is used to treat hyperactivity, and police said it can  
be abused as a stimulant. Webster obtained it 18 times at the 
Med-Fast Pharmacy, Wal-Mart and the CVS Pharmacy, township police 
Officer Jeffrey Stone alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	The prescriptions bore the name of Dr. Jerry Carter of Allegheny  
General Hospital in Pittsburgh, but Carter told police he did not 
write them.

<HEADLINE> Crude Up on Lower Inventories  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Energy futures moved sharply higher Wednesday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange, bolstered by unexpectedly sharp declines last 
week in U.S. crude inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee and cocoa futures posted sharp  
declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices jumped 3.2 percent after industry group the  
American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that inventories 
plunged 5.903 million barrels last week to 326,751 million barrels, 
confounding expectations for an increase and erasing what had been 
a year-over-year surplus in supplies. Inventories now are 1.01 
million barrels below levels at the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, and a similar one from the U.S. Energy Department,  
provided sudden support to a market that had seen prices hovering 
at 12-year lows for months. Prices at this time last year were 19 
percent higher, but on their way down following a worsening global 
economic crisis and continued world overproduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices were further supported Wednesday amid continued  
concern about Iraq's ability to pump oil through its pipeline 
following U.S. air strikes on targets in no-fly zones in the south 
and north of that country. The sudden decline in U.S. stockpiles 
now provides some room for upward revisions in prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Unleaded gasoline futures also rose sharply, helped by news that  
Tosco Corp. planned to shut its 170,000 barrel-a-day Avon plant in 
California following a fire last week. That led to fears gasoline 
destined for the important Northeast market might be diverted west 
as the peak demand season nears. 
</P>
<P>
	Several refineries in recent weeks have slashed operations on  
the East Coast for routine maintenance or because of slim profit 
margins for refined products. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for April delivery rose 42 cents to 12.93 a barrel; April  
heating oil rose 1.07 cents to 33.55 cents a gallon; April unleaded 
gasoline rose 1.47 cents to 39.91 cents a gallon; April natural gas 
rose 2.7 cents to 1.723 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures fell sharply on the Board of Trade of the City of  
New York amid perceptions supplies will continue to outpace demand 
as the peak European and American consumption period winds down. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee supplies from top producers Brazil and Colombia and  
several other Latin American nations continue to reach U.S. shores, 
offering roasters the opportunity to hold out for the lowest 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	May arabica coffee fell 3.15 cents to $1.01 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures tumbled a second day on the New York Board of  
Trade, touching their lowest levels in four years, amid a lack of 
buyers for crops arriving from Ivory Coast and Ghana, the world's 
largest producing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The peak consumption period, in which chocolate makers buy cocoa  
to make their goods, is winding down as most complete Easter 
holiday production. The heavy buying season is not expected to 
increase dramatically until late summer, when manufacturers begin 
gearing up for Halloween candy-making. 
</P>
<P>
	May cocoa fell $13 to $1,228 a ton.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules Against Student Prayer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court has upheld limited prayer  
at public school graduation ceremonies but says student-led prayers 
at high school football games are unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	In a decision released Monday by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals, the majority ruled that student-led prayers were allowable 
at solemn events like graduations. But the court said football 
games don't share the ``singularly serious nature'' of graduations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prayers are to be delivered at football games -- hardly the  
sober type of annual event that can be appropriately solemnized 
with prayer,'' Judge Jacques Wiener wrote for the majority in the 
2-1 decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberty Legal Institute, which supports prayer at school  
functions, called the ruling ``an outrage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The government has no right to control the content of our  
children's prayers,'' Kelly Shackelford, chief counsel for the 
Plano-based group, said Tuesday. ``The decision is wrong, flat 
wrong and extremely dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case involves the Santa Fe Independent School District,  
which sought to allow prayers before football games and also wanted 
to remove restrictions against mentioning specific deities, such as 
Jesus, at graduation ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Samuel Kent ruled in 1996 that the district  
outside Houston could not tamper with the restrictions on 
graduation prayers, but he allowed the same set of standards to be 
used for football games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5th Circuit panel, ruling from New Orleans, agreed with Kent  
that restrictions on proselytizing and sectarian language may not 
be lifted but overturned his ruling allowing football game prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two unidentified parents brought the lawsuit against the  
district in 1995, claiming that football game prayers violated the 
constitutional separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Griffin, attorney for the parents, said he believes the  
ruling applies not only to football games but to all 
school-sponsored athletic events. The 5th Circuit's jurisdiction 
covers Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In his dissent, Judge Grady Jolly said the majority ruling  
violated the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, for the first time in our court's history, the majority  
expressly exerts control over the content of its citizens' 
prayers,'' Jolly wrote. ``And it does so notwithstanding that the 
Supreme Court has never required, suggested, hinted, or implied 
that the Constitution controls the content of citizens' prayers in 
any context.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa A. Brown, an attorney for the school district, said she did  
not know if the district would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court, which has barred compulsory prayer in public  
school classes since 1962, ruled in 1992 that public schools could 
not require prayers in graduation ceremonies. Since then, advocates 
of school prayer have turned to student-led observances, with mixed 
results in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, U.S. District Judge Ira DeMent struck down an Alabama  
law that would have allowed ``nonsectarian, nonproselytizing, 
student-initiated, voluntary prayers'' at all school-related 
events. He said the law would be coercive and lead to ``excessive 
entanglement'' between religion and government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court rejected the appeal filed by Alabama.

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes Lawsuit Vs. University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Eight students injured by spectators  
celebrating a Wisconsin football victory in 1993 cannot sue 
university officials, the state Supreme Court ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	The court deadlocked 3-3, upholding a ruling by the 4th District  
Court of Appeals in a two-paragraph decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson, whose husband is a UW-Madison  
professor, removed herself from the case without comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court agreed last year with the argument that the  
employees were protected against lawsuits because they worked for 
state government. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials named in the lawsuit included athletic  
director Pat Richter and chancellor David Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrating students trying to reach the playing field at Camp  
Randall Stadium Oct. 30, 1993 after a victory over Michigan crowded 
against a 4-foot-high chain link fence whose gates were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-nine people were injured. Some were trampled. Football  
players waded into the crowd to pull victims to their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans were unaware of the pileup and continued celebrating  
on the field until an official announced that one person had no 
pulse and was not breathing. The crowd then stepped aside for 
ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
	Several people sued, contending their injuries would not have  
occurred if gates had not been closed by security guards at the end 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	They argued that UW officials knew there might be a stampede and  
that closing the gates constituted negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge William Johnston ruled state employees were immune  
from the lawsuit. Eight students appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The appellate court ruled that Ward and Richter had no personal  
responsibility to manage the crowds.

<HEADLINE> CBO Enters Social Security Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a stinging assessment of both sides in the  
Social Security debate, Congress' top budget analyst said Wednesday 
that President Clinton would spend billions of the program's 
surpluses for other initiatives while a Republican effort to 
protect the money seems likely to fail. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine print of Clinton's budget acknowledges that in the next  
few years he would use some Social Security money for other 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	But rhetorically, the president has emphasized that the bulk of  
the surpluses should be set aside to buttress Social Security and 
Medicare for the baby boomers' retirements. And he has accused 
Republicans of wanting to squander the money for tax cuts instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan would actually spend $35 billion in Social  
Security money in fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, for other 
programs, according to a Congressional Budget Office report 
presented by CBO Director Dan Crippen to the Senate Budget 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president of the United States is not following his  
admonition,'' said committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., citing 
the CBO analysis. ``He only saves some of'' the Social Security 
trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to spend a penny of the Social Security  
surplus,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``And we're not going to 
use a penny of it to cut taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration says it would reserve the entire Social  
Security surplus over the next 15 years, but concedes that it 
wouldn't save all of it in every individual year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to look at the big picture. This is not a one-year  
snapshot,'' said Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House 
Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year's overall federal surplus would be $98 billion under  
Clinton's plans for using surpluses to bolster Social Security and 
other programs, including investing some of the money in the stock 
market. But without any changes in current law, the black ink would 
be $133 billion, CBO said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crippen also told the Senate budget panel that the agency has  
``not found a way'' for lawmakers to set aside Social Security's 
surpluses and ensure they not be used for anything else. Any law 
setting aside money can be undone by subsequent laws approved by 
lawmakers eager to get at the money, CBO officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	That worry was echoed by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan, who told another congressional panel that, regardless of 
any promises today, he fears politicians inevitably would be 
tempted to spend future budget surpluses on other things such as 
tax cuts or other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBO testimony was a blow to Republicans, whose leaders have  
been moving toward a plan aimed at setting aside the Social 
Security money. House and Senate leaders want to agree to a 
proposal this week that would let them argue they are not using 
Social Security surpluses for tax cuts, hoping to deflect Clinton's 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., House Speaker Dennis  
Hastert, R-Ill., and others met Wednesday hoping to agree on a 
broad range of budget issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues included consideration of a Domenici plan requiring  
that Social Security surpluses be used to buy down the publicly 
held national debt. It would take 60 votes in the 100-member Senate 
to use the money for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can only do what you can do,'' Lott said later. ``And a  
lockbox that requires 60 votes in the Senate to get that money ... 
is pretty effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said the toughest challenge if  
lawmakers want to use surpluses today to bolster Social Security in 
the future is finding a way to make sure the money will actually be 
saved. 
</P>
<P>
	While he likes plans that would pay down the national debt,  
thereby spurring growth of the economy and increasing future tax 
revenues, Greenspan said it's too likely that lawmakers won't stick 
to those plans. 
</P>
<P>
	An option that might be more effective, the Fed chairman said,  
is to use the surpluses to set up private investment accounts. That 
way, individual Americans would have the money and do the saving.

	Greenspan: Caution on Budget Surplus  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
tackled the problem of saving budget surplus money today before a 
House Commerce subcommittee. He said today's surpluses must be 
saved if they're to help fund Social Security later, when baby 
boomers need it. He mentioned alternatives of using funds for 
startups of private investment accounts, or paying down the 
national debt, making continued surpluses more likely. Whatever 
path is taken, he said, the important thing is national savings.

	Computer Stocks Have Rough Day  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Computer stocks dropped after 3Com Corp., which  
sells Internet data, voice and video systems, said that 
third-quarter operating earnings will be far below analysts' 
expectations because of an ``unexpected slowdown'' in sales to 
businesses in the United States and Latin America. 3Com's statement 
followed similar warnings of soft computer sales from Compaq 
Computer and Micron Electronics, a unit of Micron Technology. 3Com 
stock was down 2 3/8 at 24 5/8 in leading volume in Nasdaq trading, after 
dropping from 27 late yesterday in after-hours trading. Stocks were 
also pushed lower by the bond market, where prices sank after the 
National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of 
non-manufacturing activity rose to 57.0 percent in February, from 
January's 54 percent. But, the group's index of non-manufacturing 
prices eased, to 46.5 percent from 47 percent.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The early success of firms offering internet

get in. Last week, Gateway announced that it would throw in a free 
year of its Internet service with any computer purchase of more 
than $1,000. But even more threatening to the stranglehold of the 
pay-for-service providers has been the early success of some new 
rivals that let you dial up for free. One such is Freeserve, which 
has more than a million Britons signed on since it began operating 
in September. It has already surpassed America Online as Britain's 
most popular Internet access provider.

real people to promote its business online. Amway, known for its 
cheery salespeople who sell household goods to friends in their 
living rooms, announced today that it will launch a new Web site, 
Quixtar.com, in September. Amway's move online isn't a reach for

	No-Additive Cigarettes Not Safer

no additives does not mean they are safer. The agreement will 
settle a charge by the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates 
advertising, that the ads for Winston ``no additives'' cigarettes 
are deceptive. The federal agency charged that RJR implied in the 
ads, without any basis, that the Winston cigarettes are safer to 
smoke because they contain no additives.

U.S. sales surged a surprising 17 percent, due in part to 
aggressive spending on rebates and other discounts. GM saw 
improvement across the board compared with February 1998. Its car 
sales were up 19 percent, while sales of light trucks increased 15 
percent. The No. 1 automaker has been trying to reverse a slide in 
its U.S. market share, which fell to 29 percent last year.

	Hong Kong, Disney Discuss Theme Park  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner  
appears to be a step closer to entering China in a major way, as 
Hong Kong and Disney officials confirmed today they have been in 
talks about building a theme park in the former British colony. It 
might be located on an outlying island where the new airport is 
located. A decision is expected by June. Disney, which already has 
parks in the United States, France and Japan, including Tokyo 
DisneySea opening in 2001, could benefit from a Hong Kong theme 
park to ``gain a foothold in the region'' to build business for 
everything from movies to consumer products, said James Zoltak, 
West Coast Editor of Amusement Business magazine, a trade 
publication.

	Japanese Imports of Wine Double  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Move over, sake. The Japanese, encouraged by  
affordable foreign brands and reports of health benefits, are 
guzzling imported wine in record amounts. Wine imports more than 
doubled in 1998 to reach all-time highs both in terms of volume, 
88.5 million gallons, and value, $1.4 billion, the Tokyo Customs 
Office says.

	U.S. Levies Sanctions in Trade Fight

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration said today that,  
starting immediately, more than $500 million worth of European 
imports will be subject to eventual punitive trade sanctions 
because of an ongoing trade fight between the U.S. and Europe over 
bananas. The sanctions would take effect immediately but would be 
paid retroactively when, and if, a World Trade Organization panel 
approves the United States' request to penalize the importers. The 
100 percent punitive duties, by doubling prices, could effectively 
knock products ranging from French handbags to German coffeemakers 
out of the U.S. market.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Will Explain Tripp's Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Virginia congressman demanded to know today  
why the Defense Department was paying Linda Tripp more than $90,000 
a year at the same time it is making drastic cuts elsewhere in the 
Pentagon's civilian work force. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll answer that one for the record,'' Defense Secretary  
William Cohen told Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., indicating he would 
submit his answer in writing later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspected you would,'' Moran told Cohen, who was testifying  
before the House Appropriations defense subcommittee on President 
Clinton's fiscal 2000 defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran, who represents the northern Virginia suburbs of  
Washington, where many Pentagon workers live, said it was 
``something that has been griping me for some time,'' particularly 
since so many of civilian defense jobs in the area had been cut by 
Clinton in the name of government streamlining. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp, the Pentagon worker who secretly recorded conversations  
with Monica Lewinsky about her young co-worker's relationship with 
President Clinton, began a new job Wednesday, working as a public 
affairs specialist in the Defense Manpower Data Center. She will 
keep her previous salary of $94,098. 
</P>
<P>
	She will work in an office building near the Pentagon.  
</P>
<P>
	Tripp's turning over of the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr led eventually to Clinton's impeachment trial, where he was 
acquitted. Although in her previous position as director of the 
Joint Civilian Orientation Conference she had an office in the 
Pentagon, she mostly worked from home once the scandal erupted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see that one particular employee, who has been paid over  
$90,000 a year for the last two years to do nothing, by her own 
admission, she spent much of her year listening to some stupid 
adolescent talk about her sex life,'' Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So you've rehired her in some makeshift job that looks to be  
another kind of job that gives a black eye to the credibility of 
the whole federal work force,'' Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp, who lives in Maryland, is under investigation there by a  
state prosecutor who is looking into whether she violated 
Maryland's wiretapping law.

<HEADLINE> Man Ordered Killings for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An immigrant who got his start pumping gas and  
became a millionaire with a chain of service stations in four 
states has been convicted of ordering two contract killings to 
protect his operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gurmeet Singh Dhinsa, 36, was found guilty today in federal  
court of murder in the aid of racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also convicted of rigging gas pumps to rip off motorists,  
evading taxes and terrorizing fellow immigrants who threatened to 
expose him. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury will return on Monday to hear evidence on whether he  
should get the death penalty or life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Dhinsa arrived in the United States in 1982 from India's Punjab  
region and took a job pumping gas. He saved enough money to lease 
that gas station, then began opening others. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, his City Gas chain had 51 stations in New York, New  
Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware, and employed 300 people. Annual 
revenue topped $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But the city repeatedly cited Dhinsa for overcharging customers.  
And in 1990, he was arrested in the kidnap-torture of one of his 
attendants. He served 90 days in jail on lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, another City Gas employee vanished. When the employee's  
brother confronted Dhinsa, the businessman allegedly paid a 
criminal to kill the brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Dhinsa struck again in 1997, ordering the  
killing of a cab driver who was cooperating in an FBI investigation 
of City Gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Benton Campbell described Dhinsa as a ``man who uses  
murder as a way of doing business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Gerald Shargel said Dhinsa was a victim of  
false testimony from the hit men and rumors spread by a rival 
faction of Sikhs in New York.

<HEADLINE> Chiang Booted From Taiwan Banknotes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- In another sign his legacy has fallen, the  
face of late Chinese Nationalist leader Gen. Chiang Kai-shek will 
disappear from most of Taiwan's banknotes, giving way to symbols of 
high-tech industry and lively students. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiang's smiling face will be removed from the notes for 500 and  
1,000 Taiwanese dollars, which are worth about $15 and $30, but 
will appear on a newly minted, and presumably less circulated, 200 
dollar note, worth about $6, the Central Bank said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	After leading China through World War II before he lost a civil  
war to the Communists and retreated to Taiwan, Chiang was long 
revered as Taiwan's absolute leader. But admiration for Chiang has 
dropped steadily since his death in 1975, and opposition parties -- 
legalized after the end of martial law in 1987 -- have branded him a 
dictator. 
</P>
<P>
	As Chiang's image is removed from the larger-denomination bills,  
designs of students, baseball players, and indigenous endangered 
species of salmon, birds and deer will appear. 
</P>
<P>
	The face of Sun Yat-sen, who led the revolution that overthrew  
the last Chinese emperor and founded the Chinese republic in 1911, 
will remain on Taiwan's smallest-denomination banknote, the 100 
dollar bill, worth about $3. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose Lin, a Taipei office worker, welcomed the change.  
</P>
<P>
	``For a long while, we have had too many political symbols and  
too few designs with indigenous color,'' she said. But Lin agreed 
it was a good idea to keep Chiang on some small bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``People still respect him and there is no need to eliminate all  
his images,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Chiang's death, he had remained a symbol for Taiwan's  
reunification with China, a goal since placed on the back burner by 
his Nationalist successors who have sought to affirm the island's 
separate status from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiang's portraits and statues have been removed from local  
government offices controlled by opposition politicians. But his 
name is still used for Taipei's international airport and a 
memorial park dedicated to him in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	While seeking images to replace Chiang on the banknotes,  
authorities rejected suggestions they use political figures 
considered to have contributed to developing Taiwan prior to 1949. 
They likely wanted to avoid any perceptions that they were seeking 
to promote Taiwan's formal independence from China. 
</P>
<P>
	Those figures included Liu Ming-chuan, the first Qing dynasty  
governor of Taiwan, appointed in 1886, and Koxinga, the 
half-Japanese patriot who drove 17th century Dutch colonizers out 
of Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	The new banknotes will start circulating in July next year when  
the Central Bank takes over currency making duties from the Bank of 
Taiwan, a big commercial bank, under a government restructuring 
plan.

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio Sued for $45M Over Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leonardo DiCaprio is being sued for $45 million  
by a man who says the ``Titanic'' star incited a friend to hit him 
after the man told DiCaprio to leave his girlfriend, actress 
Elizabeth Berkley, alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Roger Wilson, 41, says in court papers he was attacked  
outside the Asia de Cuba restaurant in New York on March 4, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Through his lawyer, DiCaprio denied the charges.  
</P>
<P>
	Wilson says he went to the restaurant to confront DiCaprio and  
his friend, actor Jay Ferguson, over alleged telephone calls to 
Berkley, the star of the movie ``Showgirls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, who appeared in two of the ``Porky's'' movies, says he  
scolded DiCaprio's publicist for divulging Berkley's phone number. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, papers filed Tuesday say, a drunken Ferguson told  
Wilson that it was he who called Berkley and then invited Wilson 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	As Ferguson followed Wilson outside, an intoxicated DiCaprio  
``turned to his posse'' and told them to beat Wilson up, court 
papers say. Outside the restaurant, Wilson says, DiCaprio's group 
surrounded him and called him names that disparaged his 
masculinity. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's lawyer, Paul Licalsi, says his client was hit only once  
because other members of the group pulled the attacker away. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCaprio's lawyer, Paul Callan, issued a statement calling  
Wilson's court papers ``a collection of false claims, lies and 
defamatory misrepresentations regarding an incident provoked by the 
irresponsible behavior of Mr. Wilson himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiCaprio is in Thailand filming ``The Beach,'' his publicist Ken  
Sunshine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson could not be found for comment.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsels Losing Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is trying to build  
momentum in Congress for allowing the independent counsel law to 
expire on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional officials said President Clinton's personal  
attorney, Bob Bennett, would argue the administration's case 
against the Watergate-inspired law in testimony today before the 
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, battered by Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr's five-year probe, reversed course Tuesday and announced it 
was withdrawing support for the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's witnesses are speaking to a Congress  
already hostile to renewing the law. Angered by independent counsel 
investigations of President Reagan and then Clinton, lawmakers of 
both parties oppose the law's renewal without at least a major 
overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	House members and senators have suggested changes in the law,  
but without a consensus, sentiment is growing for letting it 
expire. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the administration for the first time went on record  
against the statute when Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder told a 
House subcommittee that it ``has failed in its goal of removing 
politics from the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The act was supposed to increase trust in our government;  
unfortunately, it has diminished it,'' Holder told the House 
Judiciary subcommittee on commercial and administrative law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The climate of politicization pervades the process, regardless  
of which way a specific decision, investigation or prosecution 
comes out,'' he said in prepared remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a marked reversal from five years ago, when Clinton and  
Attorney General Janet Reno successfully lobbied for the law's 
renewal. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder emphasized several times that the administration's  
reversal ``does not have to do with any particular inquiry or 
investigation. It has to do with the fact that the types of 
decisions we are talking about here can be controversial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Barry Toiv said Clinton ``concurs  
with the judgment of the Justice Department that the statute should 
not be renewed -- that its flaws outweigh its benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv said Clinton's judgment was ``a policy decision based on  
his observation of how the law's been implemented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning from subcommittee Chairman George Gekas,  
R-Pa., Holder told the panel that he first secured Reno's approval, 
then submitted his testimony to White House Counsel Charles Ruff 
late last week. ``He indicated to us that we proceed,'' Holder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law provides for an independent counsel selected by three  
judges to investigate allegations against specified administration 
officials. Reno has had seven independent counsels appointed in 
Clinton's six years in office, more than any other attorney 
general. 
</P>
<P>
	Without renewal, the law will expire June 30 and any future  
investigations of high-ranking government officials would be 
handled by the Justice Department. In rare cases, Holder said, the 
attorney general could appoint special prosecutors in cases where 
conflicts of interest clearly exist. 
</P>
<P>
	That was how the system worked until President Nixon fired  
special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal. 
Nixon's move convinced Congress that probes of presidents and other 
high-ranking officials should be conducted by outsiders not 
accountable to those they investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one years after its inception, Republicans and Democrats  
complain the law does not hold independent counsels accountable for 
their conduct of investigations or for the millions of public 
dollars they spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder also told the panel that Justice officials met recently  
with Starr and listened to his objections about the department 
investigating his conduct during the Clinton probe, but no 
negotiations took place and Reno will make any final decisions 
about who will conduct the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Beckham Stars in Manchester Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Dwight Yorke scored the goals but it was David  
Beckham who inspired Manchester United to a 2-0 victory over Inter 
Milan in the European Champions Cup on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The talented midfielder set up both goals with right wing  
crosses before halftime and Manchester United, whose only Champions 
Cup success was in 1968, will be confident of reaching the 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	In other quarterfinal matches, defending champion and seven-time  
titlist Real Madrid was held to a 1-1 tie at home by Dynamo Kiev 
and Bayern Munich downed Kaiserslautern 2-0 in a meeting of two 
German Bundesliga clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Juventus, which is bidding to make the final for the fourth  
season in a row, beat Olympiakos 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	It was clearly Beckham's night in the Old Trafford confrontation  
with Diego Simeone, the player whose self-confessed play-acting led 
to the Englishman's much-publicized expulsion in last summer's 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Simeone played inventively and forcefully in Inter's  
midfield, Beckham set up both of Yorke's goals with precision 
crosses from the right. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Inter defenders left Yorke unmarked in the seventh minute  
as he headed home Beckham's measured cross and, when the 
fair-haired star launched another from the right just before 
halftime, the Tobagan striker climbed above the Inter defense for 
his eighth goal in seven Champions Cup games. 
</P>
<P>
	``David Beckham was absolutely magnificent,'' United manager  
Alex Ferguson said. ``But we had a lot of good players. Two-nil is 
a great result for us and we will score over there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrei Shevchenko gave Dynamo Kiev a 56th minute lead at the  
Bernabeu stadium in Madrid but Predrag Mijatovic hit back for Real 
11 minutes later as the defending titlist earned a tie. 
</P>
<P>
	Two goals in four minutes put Bayern in charge of its showdown  
with Kaiserlautern, the team which surprisingly beat it to the 
Bundesliga title last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Struggling in the league without star striker Alessandro Del  
Piero who is out until next season with a serious knee injury, 
Juventus went two goals ahead on Filippo Inzaghi's shot in the 38th 
and Antonio Conte's 11 minutes from the end.

<HEADLINE>  Radio Personality Sorry for Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Washington-area shock jock who lost his job  
last week for making a racially insensitive reference to the Texas 
dragging death of James Byrd, Jr. apologized Wednesday ``to anyone 
and everyone who was hurt'' by it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a pathetic attempt at morbid racial humor,'' said Doug  
``The Greaseman'' Tracht, who was fired from his morning drive job 
at WARW Radio on Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing a portion of a song by Grammy-award winning  
recording artist Lauryn Hill, Tracht had said, ``No wonder people 
drag them behind trucks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement led station management to suspend him and sparked  
national outrage among black leaders and broadcasters. After 
protests and a deluge a phone calls WARW Radio fired Tracht. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sorrow is for anyone and everyone who was hurt by my  
statement,'' said Tracht, adding that ``mere apologies are not 
enough.'' He spoke at a news conference organized by former boxing 
promoter Rock Newman. 
</P>
<P>
	This was not the first time that Tracht had run afoul of the  
black community. In 1986, in a reference to the Martin Luther King 
holiday, he said, ``Kill four more and we can take the week off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracht apologized to the Byrd family, the national  
African-American community, Hill, his fans and listeners, his 
co-workers and his wife, who said his latest gaffe also prompted 
her to consider taking an afternoon flight to the West Coast never 
to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Local radio talk show host Joe Madison is trying to arrange for  
Tracht to visit the Byrd family in Jasper, Texas. ``I would like to 
fly out there and talk to them personally and let them know how 
sorry I am,'' said Tracht. ``Whatever I can do physically, 
emotionally for the Byrd family I will do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracht says that his public apology was not designed to help him  
get a new job or an offer to return to WARW. ``I'm here to reclaim 
my reputation back,'' said Tracht. 
</P>
<P>
	But Les Brown, a motivational speaker and talk show host on WMMJ  
Radio in Washington said, ``I don't believe that there is any place 
in radio for people like ``Greaseman'' and others who are 
encouraging racism.''

<HEADLINE> Retirement Community Now a City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAGUNA WOODS, Calif. (AP) -- When elected officials went to work  
Wednesday in America's newest and perhaps oldest city, they learned 
it was Leisure World no longer. 
</P>
<P>
	With all precincts reporting, 51.7 percent of the 10,336 voters  
supported turning the gated retirement community of Leisure World 
into a city, now called Laguna Woods. Absentee votes were still 
being counted, but they weren't expected to change the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory Tuesday also led to election of an interim council  
for the city, which has a minimum age of 55 and average age of 77. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an awful lot of work to do,'' said Bert Hack, one of  
five council members elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the vote was so close, there's fence-mending to do with  
neighbors who didn't want their private retirement community of 
18,000 to become just another town. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to keep things the way they were,'' Hack said. ``While  
there are a lot of changes happening outside, we want to keep 
things the way they are in the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leisure World, about 50 miles south of Los Angeles, advertised  
itself as the biggest retirement center on the West Coast. Opened 
in 1964, it is slightly younger than Leisure World in Seal Beach, 
to the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of cityhood had worried that the new government would  
encourage strip malls around the community or try to raise taxes in 
more direct ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep asking those people who left the city, `Why do you want  
to be in a city?''' said Bea Hassel Rogatz, oldest council 
candidate at 91 and a cityhood opponent. She was not elected. 
</P>
<P>
	The fenced enclave has two professional golf courses, eight  
tennis courts, an 844-seat theater, five large swimming pools, 
spas, lawn bowling greens, shuffleboard courts and a fitness 
center.

	Legislation proposed Tuesday by Democratic lawmakers would  
require credit card companies to give their customers that news in 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Minimum payments are the nicotine'' of the credit card  
industry; ``they should carry proper warnings,'' said Mary Rouleau, 
legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, drafted by Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., would require  
card issuers to spell out in billing statements how long it would 
take customers to pay off their debt, and the total cost including 
interest, if they made only the minimum monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would compel credit card companies to spell  
out more clearly and conspicuously how long their enticingly low 
``teaser'' rates for new accounts last, and what higher rates will 
replace them. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the companies would have to clearly disclose any  
conditions under which the introductory ``teaser'' rate may be 
revoked, such as failure to make monthly payments on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit card companies ``are taking advantage of current law to  
hook new customers with misleading promotions and to encourage 
customers to carry increasing debt burdens,'' said LaFalce, who is 
the House Banking Committee's senior Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are living in an age of 'buyer beware' in terms of credit  
cards,'' he said in a statement. ``Card issuers have increased the 
number and amount of fees, shortened payment periods, and contrived 
hidden penalties that can readily double or triple interest 
charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 House lawmakers, all Democrats, have endorsed the  
legislation, which also would put restrictions on new credit card 
accounts for people under age 21. In addition, the bill would ban 
card issuers from canceling accounts or imposing new fees on 
customers who pay off their monthly balances in full. 
</P>
<P>
	With personal bankruptcies continuing to soar, lawmakers of both  
parties last week began pushing legislation backed by credit card 
companies that would make it harder for people to erase their debts 
in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	LaFalce's bill could eventually be attached to the bankruptcy  
overhaul legislation, as happened last year, when the House passed 
such legislation. The Senate adjourned last year without voting on 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of a sweeping rewrite of the bankruptcy laws,  
including consumer groups, insist that the credit card networks, 
and the banks that control them, share the blame for mounting debt 
by aggressively mailing millions of solicitations to entice 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong economy, the number of Americans filing  
personal bankruptcies last year reached a record 1.4 million, up 
more than 300 percent since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Big credit card networks, notably Visa and MasterCard, and  
retail-business groups have said their losses from forgiven debts 
in bankruptcy have forced them to raise interest rates for 
consumers who handle credit responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McGarry, a spokesman for Visa USA Inc., said the  
information the card issuer provides to consumers concerning fees, 
interest rates and other terms already is adequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., principal sponsor of the legislation  
to overhaul the bankruptcy laws, wasn't immediately available for 
comment on the Democrats' credit card proposals.

<HEADLINE> Big East Tourney Said Unfair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Big East coaches all agree that since the league  
expanded to 13 teams in 1995, the postseason tournament just hasn't 
been fair. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Rutgers, West Virginia and Notre Dame forced the  
change in the tournament format to include a fourth day of 
competition for all but the top three seeds. To a man, the coaches 
agree the champion will always be one of the teams that only plays 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win four games on four straight days, even for a terrific  
basketball team, is one heck of an accomplishment. I just don't 
know if many teams have ever done that,'' said Connecticut coach 
Jim Calhoun, whose Huskies (25-2) are the top seed in the 
tournament for the fifth time in the last six years. ``The extra 
day of rest for us will be good. From trying to win the Big East 
and then playing the following week, it's a huge advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other teams with a bye into Thursday's quarterfinals are  
Miami (21-5) and St. John's (23-7). 
</P>
<P>
	It's a new area for Miami coach Leonard Hamilton.  
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't gotten to that day, but I'm sure it's going to be  
nice,'' he said. ``Each year there are different goals and this 
year we're going in thinking we have a legitimate chance of winning 
the title because of the extra day. Maybe not a day of rest, but 
one of preparation will benefit the team. You won't expend as much 
energy in a practice as in a game, but that extra day of 
preparation will make you look better going into that first game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In today's games, fourth-seeded Syracuse (19-10) faced No. 13  
Boston College (6-20); while No. 5 Villanova (20-9) played No. 12 
West Virginia (10-18); No. 6 Rutgers (17-11) met No. 11 Pittsburgh 
(14-15); No. 7 Providence (16-12) faced No. 10 Georgetown (14-14); 
and No. 8 Notre Dame (14-15) met No. 9 Seton Hall (14-13). 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's tournament saw the 11th, 12th and 13th seeds win  
opening-round games and that would be devastating this year for the 
likes of Syracuse, Providence and Rutgers as they try to secure 
spots in the NCAA's field of 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutgers, which came into the tournament on a four-game losing  
streak, may even need a second win like it got last year when it 
reached the semifinals as a No. 12 seed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing we're concerned with now is getting back to  
playing good basketball and getting a much-needed win over Pitt,'' 
coach Kevin Bannon said. ``The upperclassmen will remind the others 
of last year and we may watch a little tape of it, but I want them 
to have a different attitude. Go in with a little chip on our 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them they have to win a game to get in the tournament  
and they're fine with that. We want to go there and win a couple of 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim could feel confident his Orangemen  
would get an at-large bid, barring a shocking loss to Boston 
College. Still, there was so campaigning to do for the rest of the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``With so many back and forths in the league it comes down to  
where did you finish,'' he said. ``Our conference has three top 10 
teams (No. 3 Connecticut, No. 9 Miami and No. 10 St. John's) and a 
lot of other good teams. The conference deserves as many bids as 
possible. Providence and Rutgers can play their way in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown, which won its opener over Miami last year as a 13th  
seed, needed a first-round win to keep its 25-year postseason 
streak alive because a team cannot be invited to the NIT with a 
sub-.500 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NIT would mean a lot to me personally and a lot to team,''  
said Hoyas coach Craig Esherick, who replaced John Thompson 
following his sudden resignation during his 27th season at 
Georgetown. ``Back in January, we were fighting for our lives to 
play consistently. We had a good month of February, winning some 
games. Give an awful lot of credit, if we do end up in a 
tournament, to the players for what they went through with the 
change.''

<HEADLINE> Fishermen Sue To Protect Steelhead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) -- Sport fishermen and environmentalists  
have sued federal officials in a bid to list southern Oregon and 
Northern California steelhead as a threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San  
Francisco against the National Marine Fisheries Service closely 
parallels one in Portland that forced the agency to list coho 
salmon in coastal Oregon as a threatened species last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund filed the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	Just as they had with coho salmon, the fisheries service  
initially recommended steelhead in the Klamath Mountains Province 
and the Northern California unit merited protection under the 
Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
	As with coho, the agency decided to hold off the listing because  
of state efforts initiated by Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber and 
followed to a lesser degree by California. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oregon Salmon Plan emphasized voluntary efforts by private  
landowners to restore and protect spawning habitat, a sharp 
departure from the Endangered Species Act, which imposes penalties 
for destroying habitat and protected species. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Endangered Species Act does not permit the federal  
government to make a decision not to list a species on the grounds 
that there are state conservation efforts in effect when those 
state conservation efforts are voluntary or unimplemented,'' said 
Mike Sherwood, an attorney for the Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisheries Service spokesman Brian Gorman said the coho reversal  
and the latest lawsuit did not change the agency's feeling that the 
Oregon Salmon Plan represents a better way to save species from 
extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're convinced this approach of getting grassroots support  
through conservation plans is the right way to go,'' Gorman said. 
``It appears to be working in some areas of Oregon.''

<HEADLINE>  Radio Personality Sorry for Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Washington-area shock jock who lost his job  
last week for making a racially insensitive reference to the Texas 
dragging death of James Byrd, Jr. apologized Wednesday ``to anyone 
and everyone who was hurt'' by it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a pathetic attempt at morbid racial humor,'' said Doug  
``The Greaseman'' Tracht, who was fired from his morning drive job 
at WARW Radio on Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing a portion of a song by Grammy-award winning  
recording artist Lauryn Hill, Tracht had said, ``No wonder people 
drag them behind trucks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement led station management to suspend him and sparked  
national outrage among black leaders and broadcasters. After 
protests and a deluge a phone calls WARW Radio fired Tracht. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sorrow is for anyone and everyone who was hurt by my  
statement,'' said Tracht, adding that ``mere apologies are not 
enough.'' He spoke at a news conference organized by former boxing 
promoter Rock Newman. 
</P>
<P>
	This was not the first time that Tracht had run afoul of the  
black community. In 1986, in a reference to the Martin Luther King 
holiday, he said, ``Kill four more and we can take the week off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracht apologized to the Byrd family, the national  
African-American community, Hill, his fans and listeners, his 
co-workers and his wife, who said his latest gaffe also prompted 
her to consider taking an afternoon flight to the West Coast never 
to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Local radio talk show host Joe Madison is trying to arrange for  
Tracht to visit the Byrd family in Jasper, Texas. ``I would like to 
fly out there and talk to them personally and let them know how 
sorry I am,'' said Tracht. ``Whatever I can do physically, 
emotionally for the Byrd family I will do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracht says that his public apology was not designed to help him  
get a new job or an offer to return to WARW. ``I'm here to reclaim 
my reputation back,'' said Tracht. 
</P>
<P>
	But Les Brown, a motivational speaker and talk show host on WMMJ  
Radio in Washington said, ``I don't believe that there is any place 
in radio for people like ``Greaseman'' and others who are 
encouraging racism.''

<HEADLINE> Funeral for D-Backs' Robinson Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The funeral for former major league pitcher  
Ken Robinson, killed in an automobile accident, will be held Friday 
in Jacksonville, Fla., the Arizona Diamondbacks said. 
</P>
<P>
	The service will begin at 11 a.m. at the Mandarin United  
Methodist Church. A prayer meeting will be held at 7 p.m. Thursday 
at Corey-Kerlin Funeral Home in Jacksonville. Burial was planned at 
the Oaklawn Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 29, was the passenger in a car that left a Tucson  
highway and overturned early Sunday. Robinson, a relief pitcher for 
Toronto in 1995 and 1997 and for Kansas City in 1996, was 
pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, John Rosengren, 26, has been charged with  
second-degree murder because police suspect he was under the 
influence of alcohol. Rosengren is free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson and Rosengren, also a pitcher, were coming off surgery  
last season. Both were in Tucson to await the start of the 
Diamondbacks' minor league spring training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson lived in Jacksonville with his wife, Lorrie, and the  
couple's 1-year-old son, Chase. 
</P>
<P>
	The family asked that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made  
payable to the Chase N. Robinson Memorial Fund, with the money to 
be used for the child's education.

<HEADLINE> After 100 Years, Coward Celebration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Noel Coward had ``a talent to amuse,'' as the  
lyric in his own song, ``If Love Were All,'' so elegantly put it. 
He also possessed a famously incisive, epigrammatic wit. 
</P>
<P>
	And in this centennial year of his birth, the late English  
dramatist and songwriter is proving ripe for reappraisal, with a 
cavalcade of play revivals, galas and tributes planned at home and 
abroad of virtually every extant piece of Coward -- maybe even his 
``Calvacade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1950s and '60s embraced gritty, working-class dramas from  
such Angry Young Men as John Osborne. But earlier writers like 
Coward and his contemporaries Somerset Maugham and Terence Rattigan 
look set to endure, as theatergoers realize that plays about 
society swells can be provocative as well as entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``Noel deserves our celebration,'' said actress Lynn Redgrave,  
who was directed by Coward in a now-legendary 1964 National Theater 
revival of his ``Hay Fever.'' Redgrave might play the eccentric 
Madame Arcati in a Los Angeles production of Coward's ``Blithe 
Spirit'' at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's our man,'' said Michael Imison, a former agent for the  
Coward estate and coordinator of the current spate of centenary 
goings-on. ``He's one of the great world figures we can claim as 
being English.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-seven years after his death, Coward's soigne  
sophistication still embodies a certain English classiness -- 
cigarette and bon mot always at the ready. 
</P>
<P>
	A stand-up comedian, he wasn't. Ever droll, he remains.  
</P>
<P>
	Consider the following, for example, from ``Blithe Spirit'':  
</P>
<P>
	Ruth: ``If I died, I wonder how long it would be before you  
married again?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles: ``You won't die. You're not the dying sort.''  
</P>
<P>
	Or lyrics that have become part of the language, such as ``Don't  
put your daughter on the stage, Mrs. Worthington,'' and ``Don't 
let's be beastly to the Germans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Coward who wrote:  
</P>
<P>
	``The Stately Homes of England,  
</P>
<P>
	``How beautiful they stand,  
</P>
<P>
	``To prove the upper classes  
</P>
<P>
	``Have still the upper hand.''  
</P>
<P>
	And it was ``Mad Dogs and Englishmen'' of 1931 that assured his  
immortality: 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Philippines, there are lovely screens  
</P>
<P>
	``To protect you from the glare;  
</P>
<P>
	``In the Malay states, they have hats like plates  
</P>
<P>
	``Which the Britishers won't wear.  
</P>
<P>
	``At twelve noon, the natives swoon,  
</P>
<P>
	``And no further work is done;  
</P>
<P>
	``But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun.''  
</P>
<P>
	For Coward, seriousness -- or, to be more accurate, earnestness --  
was as repellent as the suburban background into which he was born 
and as quickly as possible left behind, first as a child actor and 
then as the author of 50 or so plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning with ``The Vortex'' in 1924, a portrait of drug  
addiction and love between an older woman and a younger man 
(nowadays, he would be called a ``boy toy''), Coward depicted 
sexual mores and social finesse -- or sometimes lack thereof -- in 
ways that remain trenchant, funny, and often wounding. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Coward's writings are almost always on view, even  
without the milestone birthday celebration -- the dramatist was born 
Dec. 16, 1899, in Middlesex, west London. 
</P>
<P>
	``Present Laughter,'' his endearingly narcissistic play about  
vainglorious Garry Essendine, an actor clearly patterned on 
himself, has had four major London and New York revivals in the 
last two decades, with George C. Scott and Frank Langella among the 
actors donning smart dressing gowns to play Gary. The 1942 comedy 
may emerge in the West End once again if Ian McKellen decides to 
take a recent sell-out production in the Yorkshire city of Leeds to 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	Coward's 1930 play, ``Private Lives,'' contains perhaps the most  
famous balcony scene besides ``Romeo and Juliet.'' Elizabeth Taylor 
and Joan Collins are just two legends who have tackled the barbed 
comedy, with mixed results, on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	London revisits the play May 13 at the National, where Juliet  
Stevenson is expected to play Amanda Prynne, the divorcee reunited 
on the Riviera with her former husband and favorite sparring 
partner, Elyot Chase (to be played by Anton Lesser). 
</P>
<P>
	Time-honored audience pleasers, these plays are part of a Coward  
canon of favorites that includes ``Design for Living,'' a play 
whose central (and bisexual) menage-a-trois can seem decidedly 
steamy in some directors' hands. 
</P>
<P>
	That play is on course for a late-summer London revival -- the  
first-ever Coward production of veteran director Peter Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a play I've wanted to do for 20 years,'' said Hall,  
adding that he found the 1933 comedy ``very strange and haunting -- 
the last 20 minutes are absolutely amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No less amazing is the way the play manages to be deeply serious  
about the characters' frivolity and passion. 
</P>
<P>
	As one exchange puts it:  
</P>
<P>
	Ernest: ``You're -- you're insane! You can't be serious.''  
</P>
<P>
	Gilda: ``I'm not serious! That's what's so dreadful. I feel I  
ought to be but I'm not. ... It's shameful, I know, but I can't 
help it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time that revival arrives in London, ``Hay Fever'' should  
be back on the London stage, as well, with 1998 Tony nominee 
Geraldine McEwan (``The Chairs'') playing the daffy Judith Bliss, a 
hostess who takes self-absorption to comical extremes. The role was 
a Broadway success for Rosemary Harris in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever the fantasist, Judith regards her grown children, Simon and  
Sorel, as a rebuke to her advancing age: 
</P>
<P>
	Simon: ``I don't see any point in trying to be younger than you  
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judith: ``At your age, dear, it would be indecent if you did.''  
</P>
<P>
	And what about the rest of Coward -- the remaining plays, 300  
songs, collections of short stories and verse, and at least five 
screenplays? 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many talents Noel had, it's difficult to pin one  
down,'' 80-year-old Graham Payn, Coward's longtime lover, said in 
an interview from the French Riviera resort of Cannes. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you realize, partly because of his sexuality, was that he  
dealt with themes and ideas which are very, very modern,'' said 
Philip Hoare, a Coward biographer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was never just about blue-rinse matrons going to Saturday  
matinees,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coward is a man who wrote about drug abuse, women taking  
younger lovers, who wrote about sexuality,'' he said. ``His plays 
were openly challenging the status quo of the '20s and '30s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKellen, an Academy Award nominee for his performance in ``Gods  
and Monsters,'' had never acted in a Coward play on stage until his 
recent run in ``Present Laughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Noel's plays are about topics still thought to be pretty  
dangerous in the theater,'' McKellen said, ``and to make comedies 
of them was very clever indeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On occasion, Coward took self-analysis still further. A frequent  
actor in his own work, he starred in the 1965 West End premiere of 
his ``A Song at Twilight,'' about a successful writer forced one 
baleful evening to own up to his bisexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	Revived in January in London, where actor Corin Redgrave  
(brother of Lynn) made an impressive Coward surrogate, the play 
seemed to pertain less to its nominal inspiration, Somerset 
Maugham, and more to Coward's fascination with masks and facades 
and what is revealed when they fall away. 
</P>
<P>
	Half a dozen other Coward plays, revues and compilations are in  
production. London will have a gala tribute on Oct. 24 at the 
Theater Royal, Drury Lane, while a similar New York event is set 
for Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Too much of a good thing?  
</P>
<P>
	``It is dangerous, I think,'' said Hoare, the biographer. ``If  
you're exposing the work to a new generation that doesn't know his 
entire history, they go and see `A Song at Twilight' and think, 
`Why is this man a genius?' You need also to show them `Private 
Lives.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``My own view of Coward is he's very uneven,'' said Joel Kaplan,  
chairman of the department of drama and theater arts at England's 
Birmingham. ``(But) the best of his work can stand its ground with 
virtually anything the English theater has produced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fantastic. It really is,'' Payn, the writer's former  
lover, said of all the hoopla. ``Noel would be very thrilled. He 
really would.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Planes Nearly Collide Over Kansas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Two large cargo planes almost collided  
33,000 feet over Kansas after apparently losing radio contact with 
an air traffic control center, a federal investigator said today. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured.  
</P>
<P>
	The incident Tuesday morning involved a Federal Express  
McDonnell Douglas DC-10 traveling from Portland, Ore., to Memphis, 
Tenn., and an American International Airways Lockheed L-1011 en 
route from Los Angeles to Indianapolis, National Transportation 
Safety Board air safety investigator Jim Silliman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're continuing the investigation, trying to get more details  
from both cargo holders,'' Silliman said today from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	One crew said it might have come as close as 100 feet, Silliman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a spokesman for Kitty Hawk Inc., which recently bought  
American International Airways, disputed that report. 
</P>
<P>
	``The closest report I'm getting from the crews, it was a half a  
mile,'' Tom Christopher said from the Grapevine, Texas-based 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Both planes apparently lost contact with the Kansas City control  
center. 
</P>
<P>
	Air traffic controllers reported that the two planes merged into  
one blip on radar, The Washington Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of one crew said their plane might have come as close as  
100 feet to the other, Silliman said.

<HEADLINE> Hair Test May Reveal Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A test for breast cancer can be done be analyzing a single pubic  
hair, Australian researchers reported today in the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Radiologists at the University of New South Wales in Sydney  
found that microscopic characteristics in the hair may reveal 
whether a woman has breast cancer. They also believe that the hair 
may indicate whether a woman is carrying a certain gene mutation 
that raises the risk of later developing the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Pubic hair was found to be easier to read than scalp hair  
because it it less likely to be damaged by perms, dyes or the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Other scientists, however, said the study is too small to be  
conclusive. They also questioned whether the method is an 
improvement over existing tests -- mammograms for finding cancer, 
blood tests for identifying genetic risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The test is not approved for clinical use.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the researchers, radiologist Veronica James, said the  
hair test could help women living in poor, remote areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Samples for this test could be posted from anywhere in the  
world in an envelope,'' Ms. James said. ``In many poorer countries, 
no mammography is available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers used sensitive X-ray equipment to analyze the  
scalp hair of 23 women who earlier had been diagnosed with breast 
cancer, and found their hair contained one or more extra rings in 
the keratin, or protein layer. Of 28 women who were known to be 
cancer-free, all but four did not have the extra rings. 
</P>
<P>
	The same pattern was found in 12 women whose pubic hair was  
analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can look at the patterns we are getting from our hair  
samples and know that the diseased ones are different from the 
normal ones because they have changed in structure,'' Ms. James 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five women in the study had not been diagnosed with breast  
cancer, but earlier tests found they carried a mutation of the 
BRCA-1 gene associated with an inherited form of the disease. Hair 
from all five patients contained full or partial extra rings 
similar to those in the breast cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. James said the results suggest that a woman's hair could  
indicate the presence of the BRCA-1 mutation even before cancer is 
detected. 
</P>
<P>
	David Savitz, chairman of epidemiology at the University of  
North Carolina, said pubic hair is a more reliable biological 
sample than scalp hair; he has used it to determine people's 
history of cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the Australian study was too small and its results  
must be repeated in larger studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Savitz said he also questions widespread screening for the rare  
BRCA-1 form of the disease -- which accounts for as few as three in 
211 breast cancer cases, according to one 1998 study -- especially 
when there is no ``useful'' way to prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
	Women who have the defective genes sometimes choose drastic  
options, such as having their breasts removed while they are still 
healthy.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Taps Dole As Kosovo Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In sending Bob Dole to Kosovo, President  
Clinton is following a familiar pattern of his presidency: reaching 
out to political leaders to serve as special envoys on difficult 
missions overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, through Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, has  
asked Dole to intercede with the Kosovar Albanians. The 1996 
Republican presidential candidate will leave soon for the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole earned a reputation as a consensus-builder when he was  
Senate majority leader, and the administration hopes he can bring 
those same deal-making talents to bear in trying to promote a 
tentative peace agreement to end the yearlong bloody civil war in 
the Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole ``is an eminent figure who has a lot of credibility with  
the Kosovar Albanians because he has spoken out on their behalf 
over the years,'' said State Department spokesman James Foley. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who came to the presidency without much foreign policy  
experience, has often relied on political figures to do heavy 
diplomatic lifting. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, he teamed former President Carter with Sam Nunn, then a  
Democratic senator from Georgia, and retired Gen. Colin Powell to 
make a deal with Haiti's military rulers -- an eleventh-hour pact 
that averted a U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter also has embarked on missions to Sudan, South America and  
North Korea, but some of the trips were initiated by the former 
president rather than Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's predecessor as Senate majority leader -- Maine Democrat  
George Mitchell -- was tapped by Clinton as special envoy to the 
peace talks on Northern Ireland. For three years, Mitchell 
tirelessly commuted across the Atlantic to broker an accord finally 
reached in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton appointed civil rights leader and two-time presidential  
candidate Jesse Jackson as his special envoy to Africa. And he sent 
former Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., to Cambodia in 1997 to meet 
with coup leader -- now prime minister -- Hun Sen. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Clinton sent Bill Richardson, then a Democratic  
congressman from New Mexico, to Iraq to meet with Saddam Hussein 
and gain the release of two Americans imprisoned for four months 
after straying across the Iraqi border with Kuwait. Earlier, 
Richardson had gone to North Korea for Clinton. He went on to 
become U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and is now energy 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	The tricky part for the special envoy is in knowing how far to  
go. 
</P>
<P>
	From the administration's vantage point, Carter went past the  
boundary with statements in North Korea and then in Haiti that 
seemed to contradict U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole has never been known to lack opinions, particularly when it  
comes to the administration's Balkan policies. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, as recently as last month, he advocated that all  
Serb forces be withdrawn from Kosovo, even though the tentative 
agreement that emerged from 17 days of talks near Paris calls for 
allowing 2,500 Serb police to stay in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The presence of Serb forces benefits no one except Milosevic.  
A zero tolerance policy for all Serb forces and Albanian 
paramilitary forces is the only way to make Kosovo safe and 
secure,'' Dole wrote in a Feb. 5 opinion article in The Washington 
Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole has also called for a clear exit strategy and a referendum  
after three years that includes the option of full independence for 
Kosovo, an option the Clinton administration does not support. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has used Dole in the past on a mission to the Balkans.  
</P>
<P>
	He appointed Dole chairman of an international commission formed  
in 1996 to investigate the disappearance of people during the 
1991-1995 wars in Croatia and Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	In that capacity, Dole went to Belgrade in early 1998 and met  
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. While that meeting 
appeared to be cordial, Dole had harsh words to say about Milosevic 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me be clear,'' Dole said in a speech in September, ``the  
only language Milosevic understands is force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Dole could help lend credibility to the Clinton  
administration where it needs it the most -- if not in Kosovo, then 
on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time Bob Dole is associated with something, it has a good  
possibility of success,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who is 
skeptical of the Clinton administration's proposal to contribute 
2,500 Americans to a NATO peacekeeping force if there is a peace 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remain skeptical. But when Bob Dole makes a suggestion, I'll  
listen,'' Kerrey said.

<HEADLINE> Intern: Clinton Sorry He Got Caught </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a tell-all interview followed up by her  
288-page book, Monica Lewinsky says she believes President Clinton 
was ``sorry he got caught'' when their affair was revealed to the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief portion of her interview with Barbara Walters played  
on TV today, Ms. Lewinsky said that she felt like ``a piece of 
trash'' the day Clinton was forced to admit their affair on 
national television and apologized to the nation -- but not to her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt dirty and I felt used and I was disappointed,'' Ms.  
Lewinsky said. The full interview will be aired tonight on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by Ms. Walters whether Clinton really cared for her, Ms.  
Lewinsky said, ``Some days I think yes and some days I think no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky was shown on the clip watching Clinton's televised  
apology to the nation last Aug. 17, the day he gave his grand jury 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by Ms. Walters whether she believes Clinton felt remorse,  
Ms. Lewinsky said that as a politician, ``I think he's sorry he got 
caught.'' But she added that ``when I think of the person I thought 
Bill Clinton was, he had genuine remorse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The short portion was the first videotape aired of the  
interview, although partial transcripts have leaked out. 
</P>
<P>
	In material that leaked out earlier, Ms. Lewinsky said she  
regrets her role in causing pain and suffering not only for her own 
friends and family, but for Clinton's family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've apologized in private to my family and to my friends ...  
I would like to publicly acknowledge that I recognize the pain and 
the suffering that they've gone through because of this,'' Ms. 
Lewinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't dream of asking Chelsea and Mrs. Clinton to forgive  
me,'' she said. ``But I would ask them to know that I am very sorry 
for what happened and for what they've been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walters won the first interview with Ms. Lewinsky since the  
former White House intern's affair with Clinton burst into the 
headlines on Jan. 21, 1998. Ms. Lewinsky, who received immunity 
from prosecution for cooperating with investigators, was prohibited 
from speaking publicly until Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
office gave the go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview was timed to help promote her book -- ``Monica's  
Story,'' written with Princess Diana biographer Andrew Morton -- 
which goes on sale Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv refused to comment on the  
Lewinsky interview and book. But asked Tuesday whether Ms. 
Lewinsky's words would finally bring an end to the story, Toiv 
said, ``I think I can safely say 'No' to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's was not the only scandal book heading for the  
stores. Today, the New York Post said British writer Gordon Thomas 
claims in a book that an Israeli spy tapped Ms. Lewinsky's 
telephone and recorded 30 hours of conversations between her and 
Clinton, then used the material to blackmail the president. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jerusalem, David Bar-Illan, senior adviser to Prime Minister  
Benjamin Netanyahu, said, ``We don't respond to every bit of 
nonsense published either in newspapers or in book form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv said today, ``The book is nonsense. To tell you the truth,  
booksellers ought to consider selling it in the fiction section.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said, ``This  
story is nonsense. It's fiction. ... The security of the 
president's communication is sound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the ABC interview, Ms. Lewinsky, 25, was asked: ``Is Bill  
Clinton a sensuous, passionate man?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Gosh, I'll probably get in trouble for saying this,'' Ms.  
Lewinsky began, before describing the president as ``a very sensual 
man'' who feels conflicted because of his ``strong religious 
upbringing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he struggles with his sensuality because I don't think  
he thinks it's OK,'' she said. ``I think he tries to hold himself 
back. And then can't any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky had stinging words for Mrs. Tripp. ``I pity her,''  
Ms. Lewinsky said. ``I would hate to be her.''

<HEADLINE> Redford To Open Theater in Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Robert Redford believes the spirit of his Sundance  
Film Festival will be right at home around Fenway Park, an area in 
which he plans to operate 11 new movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Redford announced a new Sundance Cinema Center that will  
showcase independent films in a $40 million building to be built 
behind historic Fenway Park, home to baseball's Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex -- which would add 1,800 new theater seats -- also  
would contain a film library, two screening rooms, an auditorium, a 
restaurant and two bars. Pending approval, construction will start 
in one year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sundance Cinema Center ``will bring the spirit of the  
Sundance Film Festival to the already vibrant independent film and 
film-going community in Boston,'' Redford said Monday.

<HEADLINE> Bennett Convicted on Some Counts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors said they will retry businessman  
Patrick Bennett on charges he ran the biggest pyramid scheme in 
U.S. history, accusations on which a federal jury was unable to 
reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The Syracuse businessman was charged with swindling more than  
22,000 investors out of $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. District Court jury said Tuesday it was deadlocked on  
those charges, despite a plea by Judge Thomas Griesa to continue 
deliberating. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors, who had the case for 12 days, convicted Bennett of  
perjury, conspiracy and obstructing a federal investigation -- 
charges considered to minor to his defense since Bennett admitted 
to them in testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	He could get up to five years in prison on each charge.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had accused Bennett of using Bennett Funding Group  
to cheat investors in 46 states by enticing them to invest in 
leases for office equipment that sometimes didn't even exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett lined his own pockets with more than $13 million and  
used some of the money to buy Vernon Downs racetrack near Syracuse, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors alleged Bennett also ordered that tens of  
millions of dollars of the company's money be spent on gambling 
ventures, including $19 million for a gambling barge. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett admitted in court that he lied to the Securities and  
Exchange Commission after it began investigating his company in 
1993. But he said he never intended to defraud investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat Bennett did not intend to defraud the investors of Bennett  
Funding Group,'' his lawyer, Mark Gombiner, said in closing 
arguments. ``He told you that he lied to the SEC. He admitted those 
lies to you, and he is prepared to pay the consequences for them.''

<HEADLINE> Nicklaus Hopes To Play Memorial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Golden Bear is ready to come out of  
hibernation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus, back at New England Baptist Hospital to meet with  
the doctors who gave him a new hip six weeks ago, expects to be 
chipping and putting in two to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Nicklaus and Dr. Benjamin E. Bierbaum, head of orthopedic  
surgery at New England Baptist Hospital, said the rehabilitation 
was going well. So well, in fact, Nicklaus joked that he would 
begin playing golf Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Realistically, Nicklaus expects to be back on the links in four  
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The 59-year-old winner of a record 18 professional majors was  
troubled for years by a degenerative left hip. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus tried to avoid hip replacement surgery with a rigorous  
exercise routine, but finally yielded when the hip began to affect 
his quality of life as well as his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going to the shopping center with my wife or playing  
athletics, going fishing or hunting, or anything like that, I 
couldn't do it. All I did was hobble,'' Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Nicklaus agreed to use a ceramic hip replacement as  
part of a study directed by Bierbaum and involving 10 hospitals. 
Ceramic is smoother than materials typically used in hip implants 
and is believed to last longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus will miss the Masters in April for the first time in 40  
years. But he hopes to play in the Memorial Tournament the first 
week of June, although he and his doctors agree that playing the 
BankBoston Classic in August is more likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Memorial is still my goal, but whether I'll make that or  
not, I doubt it,'' said Nicklaus, who has putted only 12 times in 
the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll certainly be able to play golf by then, but whether or  
not I'll be able to play four or five days in a row and handle the 
fatigue of that is a question. But it gives me a goal and if I 
don't make that, I've got the Open right after and the Senior right 
after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he would prefer not to, Nicklaus, who currently uses a  
cane to help support his weight, admitted he'll consider riding a 
cart for part of the Senior Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather do it and do it the way I'm physically supposed  
to do it,'' Nicklaus said. ``But if I can only walk half a round 
and it would allow me to get started, then that would probably be 
appropriate. But I would prefer not to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he isn't ready to walk the courses, Nicklaus has made  
great strides since the Jan. 27 operation. He can now tie his own 
shoes, bend his knee above a 90 degree angle, and most importantly, 
he danced at son Michael's wedding Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did the four-legged two-step,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the next several weeks, Bierbaum said Nicklaus will work on  
antigravity exercises, like leg lifts, as well as follow a swimming 
regimen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is being functional,'' Nicklaus said.  
``Once you're functional, you can do anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the hip problems, Nicklaus became the oldest player to  
finish in the top 10 in the Masters last April when he thrilled the 
Augusta gallery yet again with a final-round 68 to tie for sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was hobbling so badly in the summer that he pulled out of  
the British Open, ending his streak of 146 consecutive majors. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first time Nicklaus has missed the Masters  
since 1958, four years before he turned pro.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Ringo Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ringo Starr was 22 when he became the drummer  
for the Beatles. It was August 1962, before the Beatles became the 
world's most popular band. 
</P>
<P>
	Decades after the Beatles disbanded, Starr, 58, still finds it  
``a thrill every night'' to play drums and sing with some of his 
favorite musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Starr is on the road with his latest All-Starr Band --  
there have been five in the past 10 years -- playing 30 dates in 22 
U.S. cities. The tour ends in Orlando, Fla., on March 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I thought about doing it in 1989, I didn't want to end up  
in front all night. I get other drummers and other singers, plus 
guitars and keyboards. It's a great way for me to do it. I do my 
stuff, say 'Hi, peace and love,' and I play on the drum kit,'' 
Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's All-Starr band includes Timmy Cappello, Simon Kirke,  
Gary Brooker, Todd Rundgren and Jack Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the Beatles would be doing a reunion tour if John  
Lennon were alive, Starr said, ``I have no idea.'' Then he added, 
``More than likely. We would have stood a better chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Miramax Films just announced plans to release the  
Beatles' 1964 film, ``A Hard Day's Night,'' with new footage and a 
digitally restored soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the breakup of the Beatles, Starr has appeared in more  
than a dozen movies. 
</P>
<P>
	He has also made some solo albums, recording whatever interests  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	His first album was ``Sentimental Journey,'' filled with songs  
from his childhood. His second was a country-music album recorded 
in Nashville, Tenn. His third, ``Ringo,'' released in 1973, had a 
little help from his former Beatle bandmates (although they weren't 
in the recording studio at the same time). 
</P>
<P>
	Starr answered questions while the All-Starr Band was in New  
York for two concerts at the Beacon Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	1. Why do you put together the All-Starr Bands, and how do you  
know the musicians you choose will work well together? 
</P>
<P>
	Starr: I do it because I get to play with an incredible array of  
musicians. I personally have a lot of fun. We don't know if it'll 
work. We end up in rehearsals and pray to God it is going to 
happen. So far in the 10 years it has always worked. 
</P>
<P>
	2. The next All-Starr Band live CD will be released in May. Are  
you disappointed that radio doesn't pick up your new material? 
</P>
<P>
	Starr: You'd like all radio stations to pick up on you. There's  
a lot of pressure on most stations just to play top 40s or oldies 
but goldies -- which I slip right into. There are still some DJs 
around but they're being dictated to by the policy of the station. 
I must have had dinner with every radio station in America. They 
still don't play it (the new music). Maybe it's the food, I don't 
know. 
</P>
<P>
	3. How did you feel when the Beatles came to New York the first  
time? 
</P>
<P>
	Starr: It was like this big octopus was coming up to bring the  
plane down; the energy was coming to get it. The kids were outside 
waiting for us. There was media madness going on. We had all these 
TVs on and radios on in the hotel. We could call a radio station 
and hear ourselves. It was incredible. It was the most exciting 
period of my life. 
</P>
<P>
	4. How would you describe touring with the All-Starr Band?  
</P>
<P>
	Starr: It is not quite so crazy now. Touring is touring. The gig  
-- playing the show -- is the best thing you can do. We're musicians. 
Getting there is boring. You get on the bus, plane or train, go to 
the other places. If they had that transporter -- if it was actually 
'Star Trek' -- it would make life a lot easier. Playing the gigs is 
the thrill. 
</P>
<P>
	5. When you recorded ``With a Little Help From My Friends,'' did  
you think it would become an anthem or were you thinking of it only 
as an album track? 
</P>
<P>
	Starr: Just an album track. I didn't think, 'Oh, in 1999 I'll be  
out touring with the All-Starrs singing it.' At the time, you're 
just doing it. Thank God I did do that track. Other friends -- with 
their help -- have given me a career, really, these last 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Fall Again / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell again Wednesday as investors  
remained bearish, pushing the yield to a seven-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 5/32, or  
$11.56 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose to 5.69 percent from 5.61 percent late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the yield was this high was July 31, when the  
yield was 5.71 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices sank after the National Association of Purchasing  
Management said its index of non-manufacturing activity rose to 57 
in February, from January's reading of 54. Analysts said the 
increase was a sign that inflation was on the rise, even though the 
same group's index of non-manufacturing prices eased to 46.5 from 
47. 
</P>
<P>
	Many believe the Federal Reserve is poised to slow borrowing and  
spending with a boost in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan declined to address monetary policy  
during Social Security testimony before the House Commerce 
Committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising interest rates hurt bonds by making their yields less  
competitive, while inflation makes fixed-income investments less 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market Tuesday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities fell 3/32 point, while intermediate maturities fell 7/32 
to 1/2 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.87 
points to 1,276.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 4.59 percent as the  
discount fell 0.07 percentage point from late Tuesday to 4.47 
percent. Six-month yields fell to 4.71 percent, as the discount 
fell 0.02 percentage point from late Tuesday to 4.54 percent. 
One-year yields rose to 4.87 percent, while the discount fell .03 
percentage point from Tuesday's auction rate to 4.63 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.75 percent from 4.69 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 123 5/8 from 124 1/32. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.25 percent from 5.23 percent Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Gives Differing Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky's sworn testimony is at odds  
with parts of her book and TV appearance, while assertions she 
makes about former friend Linda Tripp conflict with evidence 
gathered in Kenneth Starr's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	'My mom knew ... that I was involved with'' Clinton, but ``I  
don't think she understood it to be in such a sexual way that it 
was,'' Ms. Lewinsky told ABC's Barbara Walters. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not exactly what Ms. Lewinsky told Starr's grand jury  
last Aug. 20. Testifying about her mother, Ms. Lewinsky said that 
``I might have said something to her like, `We fooled around.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And Ms. Lewinsky told prosecutors that after being subpoenaed in  
the Paula Jones case, she transported the dress stained from an 
encounter with Clinton to her mother's New York apartment, where it 
was stored in a closet. Though she criticized Starr on many points 
in her book and on TV, Ms. Lewinsky has never disputed Starr's 
characterization of her mother -- as one of the 11 people to whom 
she confided her relationship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky says she was being used by her then-friend Mrs.  
Tripp to set up the president of the United States. Mrs. Tripp said 
it was the other way around, that Ms. Lewinsky was trying to set 
her up. The evidentiary record and Ms. Lewinsky's own words seem to 
support Mrs. Tripp. 
</P>
<P>
	According to what she told the grand jury, Ms. Lewinsky was  
being used by Clinton as an intermediary to Mrs. Tripp when 
Clinton's alleged unwanted sexual advance against Kathleen Willey 
was about to surface in the news media. Mrs. Willey had confided 
the alleged episode to Mrs. Tripp, something that Clinton had been 
warned about from Ms. Lewinsky. Only after Ms. Lewinsky repeatedly 
tried to persuade her friend to lie in the Paula Jones case about 
the Willey matter did Mrs. Tripp began secretly taping their phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky said she lied when she told Mrs. Tripp she was  
going to deny her relationship with Clinton because she feared for 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was not a very truthful statement,'' Ms. Lewinsky said in  
the ABC interview. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she simply wanted Mrs. Tripp not to reveal the  
Clinton-Lewinsky relationship to the Jones lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's attacks on Starr come with the prosecutor in  
trouble at the Justice Department, which is investigating whether 
Starr's office improperly failed to disclose possible contacts with 
Mrs. Jones' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding more and more like a friend of the Clinton White House,  
Ms. Lewinsky suggests the Jones' lawyers, in their sexual 
harassment case against the president, colluded with Starr's office 
by supplying a copy of Ms. Lewinsky's false affidavit denying a 
sexual relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's answer to Ms. Lewinsky's accusation may do little to  
quiet his critics: It wasn't the Jones lawyers, but conservative 
Washington lawyer James Moody, Mrs. Tripp's attorney at the time, 
who faxed the affidavit to Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody apparently got the affidavit from the Jones lawyers, who  
met with Mrs. Tripp hours after the FBI sting operation where she 
had met Ms. Lewinsky on a false pretext, then delivered the former 
White House intern into the hands of Starr's prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	In her book, Ms. Lewinsky said the actions of the FBI agents  
suggested they were aware of the danger of Starr's investigators 
revealing they had the false affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky asserts that Starr prosecutor Michael Emmick called  
her lawyer, William Ginsburg, during one exchange that day and 
``offered to fax her new attorney a copy of her false affidavit,'' 
author Andrew Morton writes in ``Monica's Story,'' based on his 
interviews with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two FBI agents, however, pulled him roughly away from the  
phone. They realized Ginsburg would instantly understand that'' 
Starr's office ``had seen a copy before it had been filed'' in 
court, ``which meant in all probability it had come from Paula 
Jones' lawyers,'' the book says.

<HEADLINE> Expos, Quebec in Money Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUEBEC (AP) -- The Expos' future in Montreal grew more uncertain  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Quebec government held to its refusal to use tax money to  
build a new downtown ballpark, and managing partner Claude Brochu 
said the team can survive only with government help. 
</P>
<P>
	Quebec finance minister Bernard Landry said province's stand had  
not changed: no tax money for professional sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who earn $50,000 a year don't want to see their taxes  
used to make life easier for people who earn millions of dollars a 
month,'' Landry said. ``There are economic spinoffs (to baseball), 
but that isn't the determining factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't like increasing Quebec's industrial base with  
aluminum plants. There can't be a solution that is hard on 
taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Landry said the government is confident it had public backing  
for its refusal to get involved financially in the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not news Brochu wanted to hear.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a really tough situation, make no mistake about it,''  
he said at the club's training camp in Jupiter, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu said government money is essential.  
</P>
<P>
	``To be able to compete with American cities, where on average  
public support for stadia is in the area of 80 percent, you can't 
ask Canadian teams to build their own buildings, worry about 
foreign exchange, worry about municipal taxes, worry about sales 
taxes, worry about any number of any other things and be 
competitive,'' Brochu said. ``It's impossible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Lucien Bouchard and Prime Minister Jean Chretien have  
said they can't help sports teams, although the federal government 
reportedly is willing to turn over the proposed downtown stadium 
site for $1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos were told by major league baseball to have a new  
ownership group and stadium financing in place by March 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials said that after that date, Brochu has the  
right to move the Expos out of Montreal ``in the best interests of 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what will happen after the deadline, Brochu said it was up  
to major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said the Expos definitely will be in Montreal this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu said that he needs a two-thirds vote of the partnership  
to sell the club. But a two-thirds vote doesn't force him as 
general partner to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos' attendance reached a high of 2,208,175 in 1980. Last  
season, attendance as 914,717.

<HEADLINE> News Corp. Completes TV Guide Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- News Corp.'s sale of TV Guide to cable  
channel-guide operator United Video Satellite Group Inc. has been 
completed, but the media group controlled by Rupert Murdoch will 
retain significant oversight of the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, completed Tuesday, United Video has  
been renamed TV Guide Inc. Anthea Disney, head of Murdoch's News 
America Publishing Group and a former TV Guide editor, will take 
over as chairwoman and chief executive of TV Guide Inc. Joe Kiener, 
president of News America Publishing, will be president of the new 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Boylan III, who had been United Video's president, will  
now report to Disney as executive vice president of TV Guide Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	TV Guide had been part of News America Publishing, along with  
the HarperCollins book publisher, the Weekly Standard magazine and 
News Corp.'s Internet publishing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney and Kiener will retain their positions with News Corp.,  
but Disney said she will devote most of her time to TV Guide Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	United Video announced in June it would acquire control of TV  
Guide for $2 billion, which included giving News Corp. a 44 percent 
stake in the new company. The new TV Guide Inc. includes the 
magazine and cable's TV Guide Channel, an on-screen listings guide 
that was formerly known as the Prevue Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	TV Guide is still the nation's top-selling weekly magazine, with  
a circulation of 12.6 million, but its readership has been 
slipping. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to reach more readers, TV Guide plans to launch a  
large-size edition that will focus more on cable programming. It 
will contain the same listings and share some stories with the 
traditional smaller version. 
</P>
<P>
	The new edition will be sold through cable operators and  
newsstands in selected markets and will probably debut in May, 
Kiener said.

<HEADLINE> Retailers Report Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Kmart Corp. and Tiffany &AMP; Co. topped Wall Street's expectations  
with strong fourth-quarter profit reports. Kmart's business was 
fueled by shoppers looking for affordable prices and wide 
selection, while Tiffany attracted consumers willing to spend top 
dollar for luxury goods. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Kmart Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Troy, Mich.-based Kmart, which is the nation's third-largest  
retailer, earned $353 million, or 65 cents a share, in the fourth 
quarter ended Jan. 27, compared with $186 million, or 35 cents a 
share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 results include a $114 million charge relating to a  
voluntary early retirement program. Excluding the charge, earnings 
were 50 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter were $10.4 billion, up from $9.75 billion  
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart's results topped Wall Street analysts' expectations. Its  
stock fell 18 3/4 cents to $17.50 in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kmart is on the right track and gaining speed,'' said Floyd  
Hall, Kmart chairman, chief executive and president. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart enjoyed strong sales of key brands, including Martha  
Stewart Everyday home fashions, Route 66 apparel and accessories 
and Sesame Street children's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	It also found success in its recently reformatted Big Kmart  
stores, which pair full supermarkets with its discount stores 
concept. Of Kmart's 2,161 stores, 1,245 are now Big Kmarts. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Kmart earned $518 million or $1.01 a share,  
compared with $249 million or 51 cents per share for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 results include a $19 million pretax charge for its  
early retirement programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the year totaled $33.67 billion, up from $32.2 billion  
a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to last year's earnings, Kmart also released  
Wednesday its sales figures for February, the first glimpse of how 
it is doing in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Same-store sales, which tracks sales at stores open more than a  
year, rose 5.8 percent last month. Total sales, which includes all 
of its stores, rose 7.4 percent in February. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Tiffany &AMP; Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based upscale retailer earned $53.29 million, or  
$1.49 a share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, compared with

</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 20 percent to $442.8 million, up from $367.7 million  
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffany's results topped Wall Street analysts' expectations. Its  
stock closed up $2.12 1/2 at $61 in trading on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffany's sales in the United States rose 24 percent from a year  
ago, fueled by continued U.S. economic growth and high levels of 
consumer confidence. Shoppers bought up lots of its gold and silver 
jewelry, crystal vases and china dinnerware. 
</P>
<P>
	Its international sales were up 21 percent from a year ago, with  
gains even coming in economically troubled Asia. Sales in Japan 
rose 13 percent.

	``Despite challenging conditions in certain markets during the  
year, Tiffany's growth strategies continued to demonstrate their 
ability to generate strong sales and earnings growth,'' said

<HEADLINE> German's Execution Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- Amid pleas of mercy from the German  
government, a federal appeals court on Wednesday ordered Arizona 
not to use the gas chamber to execute a German man whose brother 
was put to death last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to issue a stay for  
Walter LaGrand, 37, who was scheduled to die in a cloud of cyanide 
fumes Wednesday afternoon for his role in the 1982 murder of a bank 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judges did say that the gas chamber is cruel and unusual  
punishment, and therefore unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The state appealed to the Supreme Court, but it was unclear when  
the execution would proceed. If the state is forced to ask for 
another death warrant from the Arizona Supreme Court, it would 
likely hold up the execution for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the 9th Circuit issued a stay in a nearly identical  
appeal by LaGrand's brother, Karl. But the Supreme Court overturned 
it in a matter of hours, and Karl was executed by injection for his 
part in the bank murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter LaGrand's case also was heard Wednesday in the  
International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands. Germany 
asked the world court to intervene after Arizona Gov. Jane Hull 
rejected appeals from German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and 
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer to stop the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The international court has no enforcement powers, but in a  
special, half-hour hearing, Judge Christopher Weeramantry of Sri 
Lanka urged the U.S. government to use ``all the measures at its 
disposal'' to prevent the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also said the United States should pay unspecified  
damages for the death of LaGrand's brother, Karl, 35, who was the 
first German citizen executed in the United States since World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	Like his brother, Karl requested the gas chamber in hopes that  
the Supreme Court would agree that the method is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court disagreed and lifted the 9th Circuit's stay. Karl  
then accepted the state's last-minute offer of lethal injection. 
Walter rejected such an offer and said he would prefer a more 
painful execution in the gas chamber to protest the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Arizona executed an inmate in the gas chamber, in  
1992, his death took 11 minutes and was considered so gruesome that 
the law was changed to require lethal injection. Killers sentenced 
to death before 1992, like the LaGrands, are given a choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany does not have the death penalty and contends Arizona  
failed to advise the LaGrand brothers of their right to consular 
assistance at their trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona officials conceded they violated the Vienna Convention  
but insisted the LaGrands were accorded all the rights any U.S. 
citizen would have received. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 38 states with capital punishment, only Arizona,  
California, Maryland, Missouri and Wyoming offer the gas chamber as 
an optional method, according to Richard Dieter, executive director 
of the National Death Penalty Information Center. Only 10 of the 
more than 500 inmates executed since the death penalty was restored 
in 1976 have been put to death in the gas chamber, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Book Not Kind to Ginsburg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- William Ginsburg, a once-obscure malpractice  
lawyer who talked his way to stardom in the Monica Lewinsky case, 
is portrayed as a villain in the new book about the former White 
House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Hired by Ms. Lewinsky's father to represent his daughter,  
Ginsburg is described in ``Monica's Story'' as a relentless 
self-promoter, a meddler in the Lewinsky family's private affairs, 
a purveyor of crude comments and a man who shaded the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg denied the allegations when portions of the book were  
read to him. ``Her need to blame me is understandable,'' he said. 
``She can't blame her parents. They're part of her support tree. So 
I'm a very good person to take shots at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the months after Ms. Lewinsky's name burst into public view  
in January 1998, the only way to miss the Los Angeles attorney was 
to give up television and radio and never read a newspaper. He 
appeared on every Sunday talk show. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Ginsburg was serving publicly as Ms. Lewinsky's  
lawyer, spokesman and bodyguard, he generated increasing friction 
in the Lewinsky family and eventually was replaced by two veteran 
Washington attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg acted as a surrogate father when he accompanied Ms.  
Lewinsky around Washington in the early months of the scandal, 
telling reporters how he knew her when she was an infant. 
</P>
<P>
	``He maintained that he had kissed her inner thighs when she was  
just six days old -- even though in reality he did not meet her 
until she was in her early twenties,'' the book by Andrew Morton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not true,'' Ginsburg said. ``I knew her when she was  
very young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A chapter on Ginsburg begins with his telling Ms. Lewinsky that  
at a dinner in March 1998, President Clinton told the lawyer to 
wish his client ``all the best.'' Ms. Lewinsky was elated that 
``the man she had striven so valiantly to protect still cared ... 
It was only about a month later that she discovered that Ginsburg 
had been pulling her leg,'' the book said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no memory of that,'' Ginsburg replied.  
</P>
<P>
	In the moments when Ms. Lewinsky craved privacy, the book said,  
Ginsburg would tip off the media on her whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1998, he invited Ms. Lewinsky to accompany him to  
Philadelphia for an American Bar Association speaking engagement, 
so she could escape her Washington apartment. Ginsburg told her 
they would visit the Liberty Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Believing they would arrive incognito, Ms. Lewinsky was ``taken  
aback'' to find camera crews, still photographers and reporters 
massed outside their hotel, the book said. One journalist walked up 
and asked when they would be visiting the Liberty Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg said he didn't tip off the media, but speculated that  
the bar association did so. 
</P>
<P>
	The book said Ginsburg told Ms. Lewinsky's father, Bernard, that  
he was trying ``to wean her off the limos'' to move around 
Washington -- when, in fact, she usually walked or took a cab when 
she covertly left her apartment in the Watergate complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth emerged only when she noticed her father signing yet  
another large check to Ginsburg, to pay a bill which included 
$5,000 for limos for 'Monica's security,''' the book related. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg said he did order cars with drivers for Ms. Lewinsky's  
safety because ``hordes of reporters were surrounding us,'' along 
with ``paparazzi'' on motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
	One particular action by Ginsburg led to his firing by the  
Lewinsky family. In ``An Open Letter to Kenneth Starr'' that 
appeared in ``California Lawyer'' magazine, Ginsburg virtually 
admitted that Ms. Lewinsky and the president had sexual relations -- 
although at the time she was standing by her affidavit in the Paula 
Jones case denying an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The article was designed in part to ``bring the president to  
reality,'' the lawyer said.

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs To Vote on IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The partners at Goldman Sachs Group LP, the last  
of Wall Street's large private investment banks, will vote next 
week on whether to sell a stake in the firm to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm's 220 partners are to vote on the deal Monday. If  
approved, it would clear the way for a stock sale of 10 to 15 
percent of the firm in May or June. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs originally planned to go public last year but  
aborted its attempt in September because turmoil in financial 
markets scared off many investors and ate into Goldman's profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts and investors said Goldman Sachs' IPO last year would  
have valued the firm at about $30 billion. They estimated, however, 
that the IPO would be discounted by as much as 25 percent in 
today's market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market would not place as high a valuation on Goldman now,  
but it would still provide it with a very handsome valuation 
because of Goldman's pedigree,'' said Michael Flanagan, an 
independent brokerage industry analyst with Financial Service 
Analytics. 
</P>
<P>
	While the stock market has gained 11 percent since Goldman Sachs  
abandoned its plans, the firm's public competitors, such as Merrill 
Lynch &AMP; Co. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. are still trading 
off their highs. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Jon S. Corzine stepped down as co-chief executive in  
order to focus on the firm's initial public stock offering, and 
many insiders expect him to leave after the sale is complete. For 
now, Corzine shares the chairman's title with Henry M. Paulson Jr., 
who took over as the sole chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The two officials issued a joint statement, saying: ``We have  
recommended that the firm become a public company to secure 
permanent capital to grow; to share ownership broadly among our 
employees; and to permit us to use publicly traded securities to 
finance strategic acquisitions that we may elect to make in the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry watchers, including Goldman Sach's former  
co-chairman John Whitehead, have expressed concern that the 
130-year-old firm would lose some of its prestige and control by 
becoming a public company. 
</P>
<P>
	But Flanagan bets Goldman will do all that it can to preserve  
its reputation as one of the most desirable places to work on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been known as an elite, private culture,'' he said, ``and  
I suspect the firm would like to retain elements of that mystique 
to the extent that a public firm can.''

<HEADLINE> 'Monica's Story' Criticizes Tripp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Meddlesome witch. Praying mantis. Delusional.  
Monica Lewinsky and her family spared no venom when describing 
Linda Tripp in Ms. Lewinsky's book, ``Monica's Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, a Pentagon employee who surreptitiously taped  
conversations with Lewinsky and turned them over to prosecutors, is 
portrayed as a disgruntled, manipulative and disturbed woman who, 
in an act of revenge, lured her young friend into a trap to 
incriminate President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is like a meddlesome witch, a praying mantis,'' says  
Marcia Lewis, Ms. Lewinsky's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp ``sought Monica out, a vulnerable easy target,'' Mrs  
Lewis said. She also calls Mrs. Tripp ``delusional'' and says she 
had ``an obsession with Clinton, at one point claiming that Hillary 
Clinton was jealous of her because she suspected that she was 
having an affair with the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp had a ``secret addiction: she was trying to live her  
life through Monica, the book says. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some bizarre reason of her own, she was stalking'' Ms.  
Lewinsky, the book says. ``Not physically, but attempting to invade 
her psyche.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent interviews, Mrs. Tripp, who worked at the White House  
before being transferred to the Pentagon, has said that she exposed 
the relationship out of concern for Ms. Lewinsky because Clinton 
``abused, used, discarded'' the former intern. 
</P>
<P>
	She has also said that Ms. Lewinsky passed along ``threats''  
from Clinton and concealed information that would hurt the 
president, who was impeached as a result of the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp began a new job at the Pentagon on Wednesday, keeping  
her previous salary of $94,098 a year. She had been working at home 
since the scandal broke in January 1998, but now will work as a 
public affairs specialist in an office at the Defense Manpower Data 
Center near the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Couter, her spokesman, said Mrs. Tripp had no comment on  
the book. Mrs. Tripp, the Pentagon worker who secretly recorded 
conversations with Ms. Lewinsky about her young co-worker's 
relationship with President Clinton, began a new job Wednesday, 
working as a public affairs specialist in the Defense Manpower Data 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to now, Ms. Lewinsky has made few public statements about  
Mrs. Tripp. The book provides the first glimpse of Ms. Lewinsky's 
view of her former friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp is likened to Svengali, a character in a 19th century  
novel who, through hypnosis, transforms a talentless young woman 
into a famous vocalist. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like she was brainwashing me,'' Ms. Lewinsky says.  
</P>
<P>
	When she poured out the story of her affair with the president  
in long phone calls with Mrs. Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky thought she was 
confiding in a friend, the books says. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she was gently being ``lured into a trap, the unwitting  
bait with which to catch the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book suggests that Mrs. Tripp was motivated to betray her  
young friend out of revenge against the White House and a deep 
loathing for Ms. Lewinsky, who represented everything Mrs. Tripp 
was not: ``Young, pretty, well-educated, sexually liberated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky and her family were elated when Maryland  
prosecutors decided to investigate whether Mrs. Tripp had broken 
state law by secretly taping phone conversations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone in our family wants Linda Tripp to lie awake at night  
worrying about going to jail,'' Ms. Lewinsky says in the book.

<HEADLINE> Morrison Treatment Delays DUI Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Retired heavyweight Tommy Morrison failed to  
appear on a drunken driving charge Wednesday because he is serving 
time in a drug treatment facility under another court's order, his 
lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Special District Judge Kyle Haskins postponed Morrison's case  
until April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Dan Kramer said he learned that his client had begun  
serving 30 days in an alcohol and drug treatment facility stemming 
from a conviction in Delaware County. Another attorney for Morrison 
said the facility is in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been in there approximately a week,'' Kramer said.  
</P>
<P>
	Caleb Raynolds, assistant district attorney for Tulsa County,  
requested a bench warrant for Morrison's arrest. The judge took the 
request under advisement. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison pleaded innocent in August to a charge of driving under  
the influence of alcohol, driving while his license was revoked and 
failing to stop at a red light. 
</P>
<P>
	The former WBO heavyweight champion was arrested in Broken  
Arrow. Police said he had tried to fill his car with gas, but drove 
off with the nozzle and hose still attached to the tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison failed two breath tests with alcohol levels of 0.18 and  
0.17, reports showed. The legal limit in Oklahoma is 0.10. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, a Delaware County jury convicted him on  
charges of driving under the influence. An appeal of his six-month 
jail term resulted in a court order to spend 30 days in a treatment 
facility, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison retired from boxing in 1996 after testing positive for  
the virus that causes AIDS. Kramer said he did not know the status 
of Morrison's health.

<HEADLINE>  Jets Sign Atwater to $8.3M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- It worked with Bryan Cox, so why not with  
Steve Atwater? 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Jets signed the veteran free safety, an eight-time  
Pro Bowl player for Denver, to bolster their secondary and provide 
leadership for the defense. That was exactly what linebacker Cox 
did in last season's Jets turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he feels like he has something to prove again. I can  
sense it in the player, just like Bryan had it when he came here,'' 
coach Bill Parcells said of Atwater, who signed a three-year, $8.3 
million contract that includes a $1.8 million bonus. ``What you're 
always curious about when you have a player like this is, is the 
fire still burning? Does he still want to do it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater says there will be no problems in that area after he was  
cut by the two-time champion Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``The former team I played with, I think they felt like I  
couldn't play anymore,'' he said. ``I'd like to show them and show 
the world that Steve Atwater can still play football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Known as an aggressive tackler, Atwater, 32, sometimes was  
replaced on passing downs in Denver. The Broncos apparently felt 
they could do just as well with younger players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets struggled at the position last year, using rookie Kevin  
Williams and journeyman Jerome Henderson, who was released last 
week. Their other safety, Victor Green, had a good season and is 
similar to Atwater in style. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater had five tackles in the AFC title game against the Jets,  
with a forced fumble and a tipped pass that resulted in an 
interception. He plans to be just as active with the Jets, whose 
defense he praised. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I noticed was guys flying around to the  
ball,'' Atwater said. ``That's my characteristic. I like coming to 
the ball, and I like to get there full-speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons -- who lost to the Broncos in the Super Bowl -- the  
Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles also expressed an 
interest in Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, if I didn't have full confidence that he was able  
to do what we're asking him to do, he wouldn't be here,'' said 
Parcells, who noted that Atwater was on the field for 96 percent of 
the Broncos' defensive snaps last season. ``You can watch a guy 
play and know what you've got. This guy is involved in heavy 
traffic most of the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The signing came a day after the Jets committed $19.5 million to  
quarterback Vinny Testaverde in a three-year contract extension. 
The club, aggressive as promised during the offseason, also has 
signed quarterback-punter Tom Tupa, tight end Eric Green and 
defensive end Mike Frederick. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said the Jets are not finished with offseason  
transactions, including trades. Only 15 players remain from the 
roster Parcells inherited when he took over the ballclub in 
February 1997.

<HEADLINE> $4 Billion in Foreign Aid Requested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agency for International Development is  
asking Congress for nearly $4 billion in foreign aid next year, 
with increases in development assistance, child survival programs 
and AIDS prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to see the day when our foreign assistance budget is  
far greater than it is today,'' said Brian Atwood in appealing to 
the House International Relations Committee for a 1.6 percent 
budget increase. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Atwood's final appearance before the committee after six  
years as AID chief. He is to become ambassador to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood, who has had to deal with years of declining foreign aid,  
outlined proposals for non-military assistance totaling $2.5 
billion for Asia and the Near East, $818 million for Africa and 
$653 million for Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, AID's budget request for fiscal 2000 is $7.2 billion, a  
$118 million increase over this year. The funding is part of the 
$21.3 billion international affairs budget President Clinton has 
sent to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood heard complaints from lawmakers ranging from government  
purchase of foreign cars to population policies. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised a report on vehicle purchases by his agency.  
</P>
<P>
	In response to a question by Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., Atwood  
said he disagreed with media mogul Ted Turner's proposal for a 
``one-child'' policy for all couples worldwide to help control the 
world's population. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he appreciated Atwood's answer, because Turner's $1  
billion contribution to the United Nations gives him influence on 
global issues. ``Big Brother shouldn't be telling us we can't have 
brothers and sisters,'' Smith said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite budget cuts in recent years, Atwood said the United  
States remains the world's leading donor nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we turn away from the developing world, we invite more  
failed nations, more suffering, more disease, more civil wars and 
terrorism,'' he said. ``We risk exposing ourselves to dangers from 
which all our military might cannot protect us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among major items in AID's proposed budget are:  
</P>
<P>
	--$930 million in non-military support to Israel, a $150 million  
decrease from 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	--$715 million for Egypt, down $60 million.  
</P>
<P>
	--$150 milion for Jordan for water management and other  
non-military programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--$512 million for the African Development Fund, a $59 million  
increase over this year. 
</P>
<P>
	--$457 million to expand private markets, support agriculture and  
set up small-scale credit programs for the rural and urban poor 
</P>
<P>
	--$445 million for child survival programs, including $25 million  
for an initiative to eradicate polio. 
</P>
<P>
	--$400 million for family planning programs worldwide.  
</P>
<P>
	--$290 million to support international efforts to ``reduce the  
threat of global climate change, conserve biological diversity, 
support sound energy services and manage natural resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--$220 million for disaster assistance, up $20 million.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Sign Tackle Mark Wheeler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles filled a defensive  
need for the first time in NFL free agency, signing tackle Mark 
Wheeler to a four-year contract Wednesday. Terms of the contract 
were not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials hope Wheeler will bolster a defense that allowed an  
average of 4.6 yards per running play in 1998, ranking 27th in the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really excited,'' said Eagles defensive coordinator Jim  
Johnson, who said Wheeler would compete with Bill Johnson and 
Hollis Thomas for a starting job. ``Looking at free agency, we were 
looking for a guy to bring some toughness as far as a 
run-stopper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler spent four seasons in Tampa Bay and the last three in  
New England. The former Texas A&AMP;M player was a third-round draft 
pick by the Bucs in 1992. He had five sacks and 61 tackles in 16 
starts at nose tackle that year. 
</P>
<P>
	He started 30 games in the next three seasons and 15 games  
during New England's 1996 Super Bowl season, then had four sacks 
and 36 tackles after starting 14 games the following year. Last 
season, he played in only 10 games, suffered a sprained knee, and 
ended with just 26 tackles and no starts.

	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Vero Beach is trying to avoid joining  
Brooklyn as a former home of the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	The team has trained for the last 50 springs in the small  
eastern Florida city. But now the Dodgers are thinking of switching 
their spring base to Arizona -- unless Vero makes a better offer. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the state's House Tourism Committee approved a  
bill that essentially would allow the Dodgers to stay in their 
spring stadium, but not own it. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill now goes to the state's House Finance and Taxation  
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 20 major league teams that train in Florida, only the  
Dodgers own their facility. The others are owned by a county, city, 
or a combination of both. 
</P>
<P>
	But now the Los Angeles franchise has been offered a $15 million  
complex on the Fort McDowell, Ariz., Mohave-Apache Indian 
Community. That complex, which would include a stadium, practice 
fields, clubhouse and offices, could be ready by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida bill would authorize the use of a county tourism tax  
-- a tax on hotels and motels -- to go toward acquisition of a 
stadium. Under state law, that money now can be used for stadium 
construction and renovation, but not purchase of an existing 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	In essence, Indian River County would buy the stadium from the  
Dodgers, then lease it back to them. 
</P>
<P>
	That could mean a big cut in operating expenses, even for one of  
baseball's richest teams. Rupert Murdoch's Fox Group recently 
purchased the Dodgers from the O'Malley family, which had owned the 
team since 1950 and moved it to the West Coast in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bill's sponsor, state Rep. Charles Sembler, said he's  
not concerned about the team's economics. He's concerned about the 
city's economics. The Dodgers generate about $30 million annually 
for the community. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indian River County is either retirement or citrus,'' Sembler  
said. ``The only thing that we have is the Vero Beach Dodgers. If 
we were competing for a new team today, there is no way it would 
happen. This is one small portion, but without it, the Dodgers in 
essence will be gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But another lawmaker says he can't understand why a sports  
franchise owned by a huge corporation needs financial help from a 
city of 17,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``With them paying the enormous, outrageous salaries, why don't  
we require them to take a few pennies off of each of their salaries 
to fund all of these things they want,'' state Rep. Jerry Melvin 
said. ``They charge so much for the games, the average taxpayer 
can't go to them anyhow.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Eligible for Matching Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of his first major presidential  
fundraiser, Democrat Bill Bradley announced Wednesday that he had 
raised enough money in enough states to qualify for federal 
matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal money won't start flowing until Jan. 1, 2000. But  
Bradley touted his achievement as a sign he can compete in the big 
leagues of political fundraising. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's presidential campaign reported to the Federal Election  
Commission that it has raised at least $5,000 in amounts of $250 or 
less in 21 states -- one more state than required to qualify for 
matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning next year, the federal government will match up to  
$250 of an individual's total contributions to qualified 
presidential primary candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Bradley campaign chairman Doug Berman said  
Bradley ``is reaching out to people at the grassroots level and 
receiving support from people who have never been active in 
politics before but want to make a difference for their country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley holds a $1,000-a-head fundraiser Thursday in New Jersey,  
the first of four such events in the next six weeks. The others 
will be in Chicago, San Francisco and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, for now the only Democrat challenging Gore for the  
Democratic nomination, hopes to raise at least $20 million for the 
primary.

<HEADLINE> Nobody Predicting Winner in Big 12 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- If momentum counts for much, Colorado  
and Oklahoma State could be the teams to beat in the Big 12 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But as wide open as this four-day event appears to be, coming on  
the heels of a topsy-turvy conference season when consecutive wins 
or losses constituted a long streak, momentum may be worth nothing 
more than anybody's last jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when you go into the postseason you get rejuvenated,''  
Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson said. ``Too much emphasis is put on 
matchups and how you're playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Oklahoma State (19-9 overall, 10-6 Big 12), which  
meets 12th-seeded Baylor (6-23, 0-16) on Thursday afternoon, may be 
playing better than it has all year. And eighth-seeded Colorado 
(16-13, 7-9) will take a four-game winning streak into its 
first-round match Thursday against ninth-seeded Iowa State (15-14, 
6-10). 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing real well right now,'' said Oklahoma State coach  
Eddie Sutton, whose Cowboys have won three of their last four. 
``Overall, I think we're playing our best ball of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the night matches on Thursday, No. 7 seed Kansas State  
(18-11, 7-9) plays No. 10 Texas A&AMP;M (12-14, 5-11) and No. 11 Texas 
Tech (13-16, 5-11), goes against Nebraska (18-11, 10-6), and Big 12 
player-of-the-year Venson Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor is the only Big 12 team ever to go winless through the  
conference season. But that gives little comfort to Sutton, who 
beat the Bears 76-63 and 75-47 already this year and knows how hard 
it is to beat any team three straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will be a very fired-up basketball team,'' Sutton said.  
``When you start losing, it is tough to get out of the downward 
spiral. It's like an avalanche. I think they'll come in and try to 
prove they are a better team than they've shown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor coach Harry Miller has insisted all year that his team is  
not about to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our mood is very good, upbeat,'' Miller said. ``We look at  
this as a fresh start. I do think our team can be competitive and I 
do think we have a chance to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we play our hardest, we can come close and win,'' Baylor  
forward Jamie Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado and Iowa State split their two-game series, each  
winning at home. But for momentum, it might be hard to beat the 
come-from-behind 52-50 victory the Cyclones notched against Kansas 
in the regular season finale on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good win for us. Our players worked hard to get  
rewarded,'' Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy said. ``We have 
probably our toughest challenge of the year, and also our best 
opportunity against Colorado.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado senior Kenny Price is not one to put much stock in  
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody starts fresh now,'' he said. ``What happened in the  
games before will have nothing to do with what happens here this 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the second round on Friday, the winner of game No. 1 will  
meet regular season champion Texas (18-11, 13-3), followed by the 
winner of game No. 2 against fourth-seeded Oklahoma (20-9, 11-5). 
The game No. 3 winner goes against second-seeded Missouri (20-7, 
11-5), at No. 22 the Big 12's only ranked team. In the final game 
Friday, it will be third-seeded Kansas (19-8, 11-5) against the 
winner of game four. 
</P>
<P>
	The past two years in this tournament, everyone was fighting for  
the right to fall victim to Kansas in the championship game. But 
there's no way to predict a winner now. 
</P>
<P>
	``In basketball today there are fewer and fewer actual upsets,''  
said Missouri coach Norm Stewart, whose team has won two in a row, 
including a 54-47 victory over Texas in the regular-season finale. 
``Parity makes things possible. That's why there's such interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The tournament is wide open,'' Texas coach Rick Barnes said.  
``You can just look at the way the league played out the last 2 1/2 
weeks. Any team can believe that they can win.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Takes Up Education Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate opened the politically charged  
education debate Wednesday, taking up legislation to expand to all 
50 states a pilot program that gives them greater discretion over 
how to spend federal education dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Flexibility Partnership Act enjoys bipartisan  
support in the Senate, among the nation's governors and from 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But support for the measure is not unanimous.  
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone, a liberal Democrat, opposes the  
bill because he says there is no research to prove that a five-year 
demonstration project underway in a dozen states has improved 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a November 1998 report by the General Accounting Office,  
which audits federal programs, found inconclusive results so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone also said poor and minority pupils could suffer under  
an expanded program because states and school districts could get 
around accountability provisions in the federal law that directs 
education funds to those children. 
</P>
<P>
	``This piece of legislation doesn't lead to any additional  
opportunity for low-income children,'' argued Wellstone, noting 
that the measure would not increase funding to pay for other needs 
-- including more teachers and early education, nutrition and school 
repair programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., whose state is one of 12 participating  
in the pilot, rejected arguments that the program hurts children. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no examples of abuse ... not one,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wyden, a co-sponsor of the bill with Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn.,  
cited a Maryland school that was able to cut its class sizes from 
25 pupils to 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Ed-Flex'' program also gave low-income Oregon high school  
students opportunities to take college-level computer courses, he 
said. They had been limited to enrolling in the courses offered by 
their high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased flexibility ``doesn't serve fewer poor kids,'' Wyden  
said. ``It serves more of them and it serves them better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even the bill's sponsors acknowledged that the proposal was  
a small, first step toward addressing a host of issues plaguing 
public education -- a top agenda item for both political parties, 
each jockeying to take the lead on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is no silver bullet,'' Frist said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Ed-Flex program began in 1994 as a pilot effort in six  
states. It doubled in 1996 to 12 states -- Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, 
Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, 
Oregon, Texas and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for increased accountability, the program gives  
local school districts greater control over how federal education 
funds can be spent on locally designed school improvement 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the bill's fate in the Senate was unclear. A similar  
version cleared a Senate committee last summer, but the full Senate 
didn't consider it in time. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate over the measure could extend into next week with  
Democrats offering amendments to strengthen the bill's 
accountability provisions. Another possible amendment -- one 
expected to draw Republican opposition -- would authorize the 
remainder of Clinton's plan to hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce 
class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Clinton would veto the bill if it doesn't include  
the provision, White House spokesman Barry Toiv declined to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House Education and Workforce Committee voted  
33-9 -- with support from 10 of 22 Democrats -- to send a companion 
education bill to the full House. A vote could come as early as 
next week, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill is S. 280; the House version is H.R 800.

<HEADLINE> Lomas Brown Going to Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) -- A day after seemingly changing his mind  
about leaving the Arizona Cardinals, tackle Lomas Brown signed a 
three-year contract Wednesday with the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	The $10.75 million deal included a $3 million signing bonus.  
</P>
<P>
	During a news conference in the backyard of Brown's home in  
suburban Phoenix, he signed a contract that had been faxed to him 
by the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 26, had been expected to sign Tuesday with the expansion  
team but his agent, Lamont Smith, spent much of the day in new 
negotiations with the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	A fixture at left tackle with the Cardinals the last three  
seasons, Brown reconsidered his decision Tuesday after Arizona 
offered a $2 million signing bonus and a two-year deal said to be 
about the equal of Cleveland's first two years but with more money 
for the coming season. 
</P>
<P>
	With Brown gone, the Cardinals reportedly will concentrate on  
keeping free-agent linebacker Jamir Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know something will happen within a week. I don't know  
what,'' Miller said.

<HEADLINE> FAA Orders Fuel Tank Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Boeing 737 operators were ordered to conduct  
new inspections of the plane's center fuel tank for potential 
wiring problems that could spark a fire inside the fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration issued an airworthiness  
directive Wednesday, requiring operators of Boeing 737-100, -200, 
-300, -400 and -500 series aircraft to inspect the wiring of the 
direct current powered float switch, a device which automatically 
closes the fueling valve when the fuel tank is nearly full. That 
prevents overfilling. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency order, effective March 18, requires the removal and  
inspection, or deactivation, of the float switch before an aircraft 
accumulates 30,000 total flight hours or within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators must remove the float switch from the center fuel tank  
and inspect the wiring for evidence of chafing, such as electrical 
arcing or worn insulation. Depending on the findings, operators may 
reuse the float switch and install protective Teflon sleeving and 
wiring, or install a new float switch with Teflon sleeved wiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Alternatively, operators may deactivate the float switch and  
paint a ``caution'' sign adjacent to the aircraft-fueling panel 
that indicates a conservative maximum fuel capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost for deactivation of the float switch and installation  
of a caution sign is estimated at $180 per aircraft, $212,580 for 
the domestic fleet. The cost for inspection, removal and 
reinstallation or replacement of the float switch is estimated at 
$1,080 per aircraft, $1.3 million for the U.S. fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine Boeing 737 is the most common passenger aircraft  
in the world. There are 2,984 planes in the worldwide fleet that 
fall within the scope of the airworthiness directive, of which 
1,181 are registered in the United States. Most major American 
airlines fly the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	While the order doesn't apply to foreign carriers, their home  
civil aviation authorities tend to follow FAA guidance on safety 
matters.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Disney Discuss Theme Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong officials have been in talks with the  
Walt Disney Co. about building a theme park here and expect to 
decide by the end of June on whether to proceed, financial 
secretary Donald Tsang said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsang said the talks have involved building a park on outlying  
Lantau Island. He cautioned that much remains to be done to 
conclude the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	A Disney spokesman here confirmed that the company is in  
preliminary talks with the Hong Kong government to ``explore the 
feasibility of locating a theme park destination resort in Hong 
Kong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disney, based in Burbank, Calif., has theme parks in Florida,  
California, France and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsang confirmed the long-rumored talks with Disney as he  
presented a budget proposal that includes both a tax rebate and a 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the budget plan would dip into Hong Kong's cash  
reserves to cover expenses in the coming fiscal year, Tsang 
insisted the territory is ``living within our means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed merging the stock and futures exchanges and a  
pay freeze for civil servants. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget for the fiscal year that begins April 1 will be 242  
billion Hong Kong dollars, the equivalent of $31 billion, slightly 
lower than this year's estimated expenditures of 245.1 billion Hong 
Kong dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsang said in his budget speech that financing next year's  
spending will force the government to reduce its financial reserves 
to 389 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $49.9 billion, by March 2000 
from an estimated 458 billion Hong Kong dollars as of April 1, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted Hong Kong's economy can recover later in the year  
and show annual growth of 0.5 percent for 1999, compared with a 
drop of 5.1 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are signs that we have passed the worst of the crisis,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky May Get McDougal Subpoena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whitewater figure Susan McDougal's lawyers are  
weighing whether to subpoena Monica Lewinsky and another figure 
from the impeachment drama to testify at her upcoming trial on 
charges of obstructing the Whitewater investigation, sources 
familiar with her case say. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move would likely draw public interest to Mrs. McDougal's  
trial, set to begin next week in Little Rock, Ark., but the sources 
said they expected the trial judge would have to rule on the 
controversial idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said Mrs.  
McDougal's defense team is discussing whether to subpoena Ms. 
Lewinsky and Julie Hiatt Steele to testify about their experiences 
with prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Both women have criticized the 
tactics of the independent counsel investigating President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, a former business partner of Clinton and his  
wife, Hillary, is to be tried in federal court on criminal contempt 
and obstruction of justice charges for refusing to cooperate with 
Starr in the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said subpoenas have not yet been requested from U.S.  
District Judge George Howard Jr., who is overseeing the trial, but 
that Starr's office was aware of the defense team's idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Independent Counsel Jackie Bennett said Tuesday he could  
not comment on the matter. Attorney Mark Geragos, who represents 
Mrs. McDougal, also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Summoning Ms. Lewinsky could transform Mrs. McDougal's trial  
from a sideshow in the long-running Whitewater investigation to a 
major event. Mrs. McDougal's lawyers probably would have to show 
that Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Steele have testimony directly relevant 
to the alleged offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's new book, ``Monica's Story,'' states that the  
image of Mrs. McDougal leaving a courthouse in handcuffs in 1996 
``has come to symbolize the iniquities of Kenneth Starr's ruthless 
pursuit of the President and First Lady.'' Mrs. McDougal's defiance 
``earned her ... a place in the pantheon of all-American 
heroines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, who along with her late ex-husband, James, formed  
the Whitewater land venture with the Clintons, is charged with 
defying a judge's order and refusing to answer Starr's questions 
before a federal grand jury investigating Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal has repeatedly said she refused to answer Starr's  
questions because she did not trust the prosecutor, a Republican, 
and believes Starr has waged a vendetta against the Clintons. She 
has said she believed Starr would prosecute her if she failed to 
deliver damaging evidence against the Clintons, adding that she 
knows of no illegal acts by the first family. 
</P>
<P>
	But her former husband, a longtime Clinton supporter who  
defended the first family for years, reversed course a year and a 
half before his death and testified that the president and first 
lady were involved in wrongdoing in their Arkansas business 
dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said Mrs. McDougal's legal team would like to use  
testimony from Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Steele to argue that their 
experiences bore out their client's fears about cooperating with 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky has alleged that Starr's prosecutors, during their  
initial encounter with her, threatened her with prosecution if she 
refused to cooperate against the president, kept her at a hotel for 
hours and urged her not to call her lawyer. Ms. Lewinsky also 
alleges they urged her to wear a body wire to try to implicate 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of tortuous negotiations, the former White House  
intern struck a deal to cooperate with Starr in exchange for 
immunity from prosecution, but she harbors bitterness toward him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele was charged earlier this year with three counts of  
obstruction of justice and one of making a false statement for 
providing testimony that cast doubt on her former friend Kathleen 
Willey's allegation that Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr alleged he has evidence showing Ms. Steele made up her  
account.

<HEADLINE> Peace Corps May Get More Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Peace Corps volunteers would  
increase from the current 6,700 to 10,000 over the next four years 
under a bill passed by the House on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you take a look at the impact it has on the world  
community ... there is no American program that has been a better 
ambassador for America and its values than the Peace Corps,'' Rep. 
Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said during debate on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, passed 326-90, would authorize $270 million for the  
program in 2000, $298 million for 2001, $327 million for 2002 and 
$365 million for 2003. Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., and Sen. 
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., have introduced similar legislation in 
the Senate. The White House supports the bill as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., who introduced the bill, said that  
management of the Peace Corps has improved. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S.-based staff has been reduced 13 percent, and more of the  
program's resources are being allocated overseas since Mark Gearan 
became director in September 1995, Campbell said. The annual cost 
of a volunteer has been decreased 14 percent since then. 
</P>
<P>
	The Peace Corps received nearly 10,000 applications in 1998 from  
people wanting to volunteer, Gearan said.

<P>
	``We're seeing a resurgent interest in the Peace Corps with  
young Americans and those not so young,'' he said. About 8 percent 
of volunteers are over 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said the bill also would make changes in the law ``so  
that Peace Corps volunteers and employees will have most of the 
benefits of being a member of the Foreign Service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Peace Corps has always enjoyed a bipartisan support in the  
Congress, and the proposed increases in this bill really represent, 
I think, a very small investment for a large return,'' Rep. Anna 
Eschoo, D-Calif., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace Corps volunteers receive living expenses, health care  
coverage and a readjustment allowance after their service. They 
work to help fight hunger, bring clean water to communities, teach 
children, increase crop yields, help start new small businesses and 
work to stop the spread of AIDS, among other missions.. 
</P>
<P>
	The program began March 1, 1961, a few months after President  
Kennedy first proposed the idea of an international volunteer 
organization while giving a speech to University of Michigan 
students in Ann Arbor, Mich., 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, more than 150,000 Americans have volunteered in the  
program in over 130 countries. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New Electric Bicycle Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEBASTOPOL, Calif. (AP) -- Except for a square battery pack  
mounted where the water bottle might go, the ZAP! ElectriCruizer 
looks like one of those old-fashioned Schwinns your father rode 
when he was young. 
</P>
<P>
	But start pedaling, press the little yellow lever, and without a  
sound, an electric charge powers the bike up to 14 mph. Suddenly, 
steep hills become a thing of ease. Short trips to the grocery 
store don't have to involve a car. Biking to work can be 
sweat-free. And if you want to slow down or stop, just let up on 
the lever. 
</P>
<P>
	No huffing, no puffing -- and no pollution.  
</P>
<P>
	Retired engineer Gerry Diamond likes his so much he sold his  
car. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few weeks was all it took me to realize that everything I  
really wanted to do, I could use a bike,'' says Diamond, who lives 
in Seattle. ``By choosing a simpler lifestyle, I find my life is 
lot less stressful than other people around me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ZAP! hasn't been able to fill orders fast enough since Gary  
Starr and Jim McGreen began their company five years ago. Now the 
company has about 50 employees, and had made $2.5 million in sales 
in 1998 before the busy Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
	They've sold 22,000 electric bikes, scooters, motorcycles,  
tricycles and do-it-yourself kits despite scant advertising. They 
say sales have doubled from 1997, all through word-of-mouth 
endorsements and a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other electric bikes out there, but the company says  
only ZAP! bikes can be used with or without electricity, an 
innovation they say gives them about 80 percent of the market. The 
battery powers a motor behind the seat that when engaged grips the 
rear tire and propels the bike forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest downside may be the cost, with ZAP! products ranging  
in price from $600 for a Zappy scooter to $2,000 for the 
Electricycle moped. Even the kit, which the company says can be 
used to convert almost any bike, costs $375. 
</P>
<P>
	Among ZAP!'s rivals is Lee A. Iaococca, the former Chrsyler  
Corp. chairman who is heading a venture that expects to sell 1,000 
electric bicycles a week that can be used with or without 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Iacocca said last month that the EV Global Motors E-Bikes will  
sell for $995 for the base model and up to $1,300 for the top-line 
model. He said his company has recruited about 90 dealers in 
Arizona, California, Florida and Hawaii to sell the bikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr had been hoping to market alternatives to gas-powered  
vehicles since the 1970s oil crunch. McGreen was tinkering with a 
working model for an electric bike. They decided to go into 
business after meeting each other at an electric vehicle 
association meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal was to make a better bicycle,'' says McGreen, who used  
to ride motorcycles competitively. ``Americans own them but don't 
ride them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They named their company for Zero Air Pollution, headquartered  
it in this small Sonoma County town, and eventually developed 
several models. 
</P>
<P>
	The most popular has been the Zappy, a 35-pound foldable scooter  
with a handle that travels up to 13 mph. The company boasts that 
it's small enough to fit in a school locker and ``With practice, 
you can even do tricks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sebastopol's eight-man police force was an early ZAP! customer.  
Today, 150 agencies use them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a real good tool for law enforcement,'' says  
Sebastopol policeman Bob Smith. ``They enable us to get up to 
something resembling a traffic speed a lot quicker than just 
pedaling, and without getting pooped out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a few hours to charge the batteries, which plug into  
any outlet and last about 14 miles. The more powerful ZAP! 
PatrolBikes, used by police, travel up to 20 mph but last only 
seven miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Bicycle shops that cater to tourists are buying ZAP! Bikes, and  
about 20 percent of sales go to foreign customers, including people 
in cities that have banned gas-powered mopeds. They've also shipped 
to Austria, Switzerland and Taiwan, which have offered tax rebates 
to citizens who buy electric bikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Global warming and noise pollution are important problems, but  
Starr says his customers buy ZAP! bikes ``because they're 
cost-effective, practical and fun. Once you get on you don't want 
to get off.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Tries To Remain Upbeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Kentucky has been the monster of the  
Southeastern Conference tournament in the 1990s, running up a 20-1 
record while winning it six of the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after only their second losing February since Adolph Rupp  
came to Kentucky 69 years ago, the 14th-ranked Wildcats look 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn, Tennessee, Arkansas and Florida all head for this week's  
tournament in Atlanta with more momentum than the Wildcats (22-8, 
11-5 SEC), whose hopes of a third national title in four years have 
flickered with losses in four of their last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeded No. 2 out of the SEC East, Kentucky has a first-round bye  
and on Friday faces the winner of Thursday's South 
Carolina-Mississippi game. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, coach Tubby Smith and his players put a brave face  
on the team's slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we've lost some tough games on the road and at  
home,'' Smith said. ``But when I look at the stats from last year 
and this year, there's not much difference in the teams. The ball 
bounces certain ways certain years, and obviously it wasn't our 
year to get the proper bounces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have the utmost confidence in this team,'' center Jamaal  
Magloire said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like we can win the (SEC) tournament,'' said point  
guard Wayne Turner, who said he and the team's other seniors held a 
players-only meeting after Sunday's regular season-ending loss to 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were making the younger guys realize our season isn't  
over,'' Turner said. ``We just want them to understand the season 
is not over yet, it's not coasting time, it's time to put it in 
overdrive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last year, when the Wildcats closed with a rush, this  
year's team stumbles into the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky started strong, with successive December wins over  
UCLA, Kansas, Miami, Indiana, Maryland and Georgia Tech, then 
opened league play with a 35-point victory over Florida. Later in 
January, the Wildcats bounced back from a home loss to Tennessee to 
hand Auburn its first loss of the season, and by the end of the 
month they were 8-1 in the conference and 19-4 overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came back-to-back road losses at Florida and Alabama,  
followed later in February by a loss at Arkansas and a 
season-ending defeat Sunday at Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The result has been widespread pessimism in the bluegrass about  
the chances of this year's team following in the footsteps of its 
predecessors and playing in Kentucky's fourth straight national 
title game. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Smith reminded reporters of the relative youth of  
his team, which has just four upperclassmen on its 13-man roster. 
In addition, Smith said, the Wildcats have struggled to counter the 
adjustments other teams have made as the season has progressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, for one, swept Kentucky by packing it in under the  
basket and playing tough, physical defense that forced Kentucky to 
take outside shots. Lacking a consistent outside shooter, the 
Wildcats were a combined 4-of-28 on 3-pointers in two losses to the 
Vols. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of the team's 31 percent 3-point shooting, Smith said  
his players need to start taking more 3s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some good 3-point shooters,'' he said, citing  
seniors Turner, Scott Padgett and Heshimu Evans, as well as 
freshman Desmond Allison. Smith said a renewed commitment to the 3 
could lead to more open looks and more passes from the interior to 
the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the notion of the Wildcats suddenly making themselves  
over into a long-distance bomb squad raises questions about the 
team's direction going into the postseason, Smith argued that the 
Wildcats' lack of a clear style of play is a strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I like about our team is that we can do a lot of  
different things. I think we're very versatile,'' he said. ``We're 
a team that can play many different ways, and I think that's why 
we'll go far and I think that's why we've got a good shot at going 
a long way in postseason play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how he could be so confident about a team that won just  
three of its last seven games, Smith responded simply: ``Because I 
want to be positive.''

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Enrique Laguerre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Six weeks ago, the Reliquary, a  
little-known literary magazine, began a letter-writing campaign to 
introduce a Puerto Rican writer to organizers of the Nobel Prize in 
Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Puerto Ricans quietly applauded the Reliquary's spunk.  
Then the whole island joined the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, radio stations in the U.S. commonwealth broadcast the  
address of the Swedish Academy, urging listeners to back Enrique 
Laguerre for the world's highest literary prize. 
</P>
<P>
	School classes are sending packages of letters. Universities and  
politicians are joining the movement along with the island's 
intellectual elite, including author Rosario Ferre, the 1995 U.S. 
National Book Award finalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last month, the island's House of Representatives and  
Senate issued a resolution signed by Gov. Pedro Rossello urging his 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Laguerre's 31 historical novels explore the cultural and  
economic struggles of a Spanish-speaking island that this year 
marked a century since U.S. troops wrested it from Spain -- setting 
in motion a still-unresolved identity crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute of Puerto Rican Culture sent its official  
nomination to the academy last month, along with copies of every 
major work by Laguerre. Friends donated out-of-print editions to 
the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``I, personally, am joining with many other Puerto Ricans who  
are in favor of this nomination,'' Rossello said. ``This is a just 
petition and it reflects the depth and validity of (Laguerre's) 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national pride in the novelist, and the campaign it has  
inspired, appear to reflect a revival of the century-old battle to 
carve a cultural identity for Puerto Rico separate from the United 
States. In December, Puerto Ricans rejected U.S. statehood in a 
controversial non-binding referendum called by Rossello. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedish Academy, which awards the prizes, has a rigid policy  
of not commenting on nominations and never revealing Nobel Prize 
candidates. Under its rules, previous laureates, members of the 
academy, university literature professors and presidents of 
national authors' or cultural organizations can nominate authors. 
</P>
<P>
	Laguerre, whose wavy head of hair and twinkling eyes belie his  
92 years, said he is flattered by the sudden attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have spent my whole life trying to ennoble the history of my  
country -- that's what has always driven me, almost desperately, to 
write,'' he said. ``So this brings me a lot of personal 
satisfaction, because it means the people of my country have 
understood me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laguerre's novels are highly regarded in Latin America and are  
required reading in Puerto Rican schools, but few have been 
translated from Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have been spectacular local best sellers. But only ``The  
Labyrinth,'' a portrait of a fictional dictatorship inspired by the 
Dominican Republic, is well known outside Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``La Llamarada'' (``The Blaze'') and ``La Resaca'' (``The  
Undertow''), about the exploitation of Puerto Rican sugar workers 
in the 1930s, are staples of literature courses on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``La Llamarada,'' Laguerre's protagonist describes workers as  
they wait to be paid what little money is not taken out of their 
salaries by the company store: 
</P>
<P>
	``Next to me a sad, discolored hillbilly took out a penny. He  
contemplated it a long time. Then he put it back in his pocket. The 
boy selling the brown sweets came up to offer them. The man 
doubted. He put his hand in the pocket, caressed the miserable coin 
and wrinkled the space between his eyebrows, thinking perhaps of 
his worsening misfortune, the nakedness of his children. He shook 
his head from shoulder to shoulder, saying to the kid, 'I'm telling 
you, no!' And he started to whistle a bit to scare away the grief 
and the pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Solar Montoya'' (``Montoya's Plot'') deals with Puerto Rican  
coffee growers and ``Ceiba en el Tiesto'' (``Silk-cotton Tree in 
the Flowerpot'') is about the emigration of islanders to the United 
States. ``Cauce sin Rio'' (``Riverbed Without a River'') examines 
the island's transformation from an agrarian to industrial center. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are important works, enriched with the words of Puerto  
Rico and the culture of the different regions,'' said Ricardo 
Alegria, director of the Center for Advanced Studies of Puerto Rico 
and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	Laguerre was born in rural Moca, Puerto Rico, during the period  
when the United States was trying to ``Americanize'' its new colony 
by requiring that schools teach all subjects in English to their 
Spanish-speaking pupils. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like all of the scholars of those times, I am a product of  
that absurd schooling,'' he said in a recent autobiographical 
article. ``Over time, I had to re-educate myself by way of 
reading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote -- and burned -- three novels before a university  
professor encouraged him to publish ``La Llamarada'' at age 25. 
</P>
<P>
	With his work, ``the Puerto Rican novel stops being a mere  
projection of the traditional European novel,'' wrote critic 
Josefina Rivera de Alvarez in her ``Dictionary of Puerto Rican 
Literature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Laguerre focuses ... on the problems of our countrysides, our  
villages and our cities, but amplifying his vision with an 
ever-broadening technique,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former governors Rafael Hernandez Colon and Luis A. Ferre  
(novelist Rosario Ferre's father) have sent letters to Stockholm 
backing Laguerre's nomination. So have the presidents of Puerto 
Rico's main universities. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the culture committee in the island's house of  
representatives urged all 78 municipalities to send their 
endorsements. The Puerto Rico Federation of Teachers and the 
island's main trade unions have joined the call. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alegria acknowledged such grassroots efforts are unlikely to  
sway the academy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been hard for our country to make known our  
culture to those kinds of bodies because it's always the diplomats 
who serve as publicity agents,'' he said. As a United States 
territory, ``we lack a diplomatic corps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter, said Laguerre.  
</P>
<P>
	``To know that my people have listened to me, that's the  
greatest prize I could ever get,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> GE To Cut 225 Jet Engine Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYNN, Mass. (AP) -- The General Electric Co. said it will lay off  
200 to 225 jet-engine production workers here this month because it 
failed to win a large contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said about two-thirds of those laid off will be hourly  
workers, and the remainder will be salaried employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs will reduce the number of workers at the plant to an  
all-time low of about 4,800, said Richard Gorham, a company 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all cost-driven on our production end. No other area  
of our business will be affected,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, United Parcel Services Inc. chose Pratt &AMP; Whitney in  
Connecticut, rather than GE, to produce engines for its cargo 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract was worth up to $3 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a significant loss for us,'' said Robert N. Risch, GE's  
government relations manager in New England. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've won our share of contracts to be sure, but when you drop  
a big one, you have to adjust to it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Mayor Studies Olympic Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Mayor Mel Lastman and Paul Henderson, former head  
of Toronto's bid for 1996 Olympics, remain at odds concerning 
questionable expenses from the city's failed bid campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just had it out,'' Henderson said Tuesday after meeting  
with Lastman in an attempt to explain the committee's expenditures 
in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the expenses Lastman wants examined are: $150,000 in Swiss  
watches, $12,500 for airfare for International Olympic Committee 
member Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo and $2,880 to 
charter a private plane for IOC president Jean-Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said there were no checks issued, but I've got check  
numbers,'' Lastman said of the committee's financial records. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those check numbers appear to cover airfare for IOC  
members, he said. Others appear to have gone to companies like 
Longines Wittnauer for watches. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson accused the mayor of being a ``cheap-shot artist'' and  
said the former Toronto Olympic Organizing Committee has nothing to 
hide. 
</P>
<P>
	``My problem is I'm reconstructing events from 12 years ago from  
the top of my head -- the city has all the records,'' Henderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the committee may have issued checks to IOC members for  
travel costs not covered by sponsors but stressed all were 
legitimate business expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss watch deal didn't cost the committee a penny, he  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the committee's contract with Longines Wittnauer  
supports his statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The company offered $5,000 cash and 25 watches valued at $500  
each a year for 4 1-2 years in a letter dated March 19, 1987 in an 
effort to help the city's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider myself an aboveboard kind of guy and when someone  
like Lastman questions my integrity, I don't handle it well,'' 
Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said the watches were given to volunteers who worked  
on the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The city council is expected to vote soon on ordering an audit  
of the records. If they don't, the records will be turned over for 
examination by a special committee.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers' Sheffield Likes Left Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Gary Sheffield smiled, knowing the  
question was coming. 
</P>
<P>
	No, he said quietly, he didn't object to a move to left field  
because he'll do anything to help the Los Angeles Dodgers win. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 30, Sheffield thinks that because of a reputation that goes  
back to the late 1980s when he was playing for Milwaukee, and 
perhaps because of his high salary, people have preconceived 
notions about him. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Dodgers signed Devon White to play center field during  
the offseason, that meant for certain that Raul Mondesi would move 
back to right, as he preferred, and Sheffield would go from right 
to left. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately, it was speculated Sheffield would balk at the  
change. 
</P>
<P>
	Never happened, he said. And general manager Kevin Malone  
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a team player,'' Malone said. ``I don't know how Gary  
was in the past, I know how he is now. I had heard about his 
reputation. I don't know who this guy used to be. He just wants to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll play first, third, wherever. He's been working out hard,  
he's real focused. I've always respected him as a player, I've 
gotten to know and respect him as a person. He's much more cerebral 
than he's given credit for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield set a single-season salary record last year, earning  
more than $14.9 million. His earnings were boosted by a $5 million 
bonus he received for agreeing to a trade from the Florida Marlins 
in May, a trade he has no regrets about now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm comfortable here, I want to spend the rest of my career  
with the Dodgers,'' he said. ``This is a great organization that 
treats its players right. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go out as one, we've got to think as one. The No. 1 goal is  
to win ball games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield has had two terrific seasons -- 1992 with San Diego  
(.330, 33 homers) and 1996 with the Marlins (.314, 42 homers). But 
he's always been hampered by injuries, and last year was no 
exception -- he missed the final 25 games because of a severely 
sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, he hit .302 with 22 homers, 85 RBIs and 22 stolen  
bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ankle's fine,'' he said. ``They say I would have been  
better off breaking it. It took the whole season of working out, it 
took four months for the swelling to go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield was injured in a rundown between third base and home  
plate, and he believes he learned a lesson from it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being too aggressive gets you hurt,'' he said. ``I think  
that's what's happened to me. That's mainly how my injuries have 
occurred, on the basepaths, trying to make something happen that's 
not there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I come into camp, (staying healthy) is my No. 1  
goal. If I can play 150, 160 games, my numbers can be among the 
best in the game.''

<P>
	Malone certainly agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``His bat speed compares to anybody,'' he said. ``I've seen him  
carry a team offensively by himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield admitted his ability in left was one of the few  
question marks on the Dodgers, but added, ``I didn't think twice 
about it, to be honest with you. There's no reason I can't play the 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Malone: ``I think he's going to be a natural in left  
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield, a key member of Florida's World Series-winning team  
in 1997, relishes the role of team leader. He also realizes the 
knock on his reputation won't disappear overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something I'll have to live with the rest of my life,''  
he said. ``I know I am (a good person). There's no doubt in my 
mind. I feel like I can make a lot of things happen, on and off the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look for what kind of numbers I can put up. Numbers  
aren't the most important thing. It's when you produce.''

<HEADLINE> Military Pay Boost Concerns Cohen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen is cautioning  
Congress that a military pay-raise bill gaining wide congressional 
support may force cutbacks in other vital Pentagon programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern has been: Will Congress pay for it?'' said Defense  
Secretary William Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	He reminded the Senate Budget Committee on Tuesday that the  
measure, approved overwhelmingly by the Senate on Feb. 25 and now 
before the House, is $7 billion to $11 billion more costly over 
five years than the pay-and-benefit package President Clinton 
proposed for the military in his fiscal 200 budget. 
</P>
<P>
	And Congress has not said where it would find the additional  
money, which represents a 4.8 percent across-the-board military pay 
raise next January and expanded educational and retirement 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not paid for, I then come back with a $7 billion or  
$11 billion hole in the budget, which I then have to take out of 
modernization or operations,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also said a provision of the bill that would allow GI  
educational benefits to be passed along to other family members 
needs more study. He suggested it could lead to a ``GI Bill without 
the GI.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently the GI Bill provides educational benefits for active  
members of the service and veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question would become in the future: Do we then have a  
benefit passed on to that service member's children, who then have 
the benefit but don't have the obligation of actually serving?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed the legislation by a 91-8 margin, even though  
the point was made at the time that senators were violating their 
own budget process in voting for new spending without first coming 
up with a way to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen's objections are not new. He made roughly the same points  
in a letter to senators when the bill was under debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is now before the House and its Armed Services  
Committee, where the bigger pay raise also has wide support. 
Congressional sponsors of the package said the money somehow will 
be found -- even if it means raising the defense spending cap and 
dipping into the anticipated surplus -- in a way that does not 
require cuts in other defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, it seems unlikely that President Clinton would  
veto the more generous pay and benefits package. ``We never want to 
be in a position of saying we're paying our people in the military 
enough. We're not,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget would raise salaries of the nation's 1.4  
million active-duty military by 4.4 percent next January, with 3.9 
percent increases in succeeding years. The Senate-passed bill 
starts out with a 4.98 percent raise, then awards further annual 
increases at half a percentage point above the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the administration and Senate measures would allow service  
members to retire at 50 percent of their salaries after 20 years of 
service, up from the 40 percent level now. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration proposal does not contain a provision for  
transferring GI Bill benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate-passed measure would increase the monthly GI Bill  
educational stipend from $528 to $600, eliminate the $1,200 that 
military members now must pay up front to be eligible, and permit 
unused GI educational benefits to be transferred to other family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're nervous about the transfer of GI benefits,'' said Deputy  
Defense Secretary John Hamre. ``It represents an IOU against our 
modernization program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The overall pay-and-benefit package was the first piece of  
legislation to pass the Senate after the end of President Clinton's 
impeachment trial, and it gained overwhelming support even though 
it violated a legal spending cap for Pentagon spending -- and 
supporters gave no indication of how it would be financed. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen told the committee that the administration felt it's own  
package, including the 4.4 percent increase ``would adequately 
address the needs of service men and women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also reiterated the administration's request to authorize  
new rounds of base closings, in 2001 and 2005. It would save up to 
$3 billion per year, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-led Congress has reacted coolly thus far to the  
request for additional base closings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, while not addressing the  
base-closing issue directly, complained that the Pentagon was 
wasting billions through inefficiency and poor management 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a total breakdown in controls. It's so bad the books  
can't be audited,'' Grassley said.

<HEADLINE> Chaos Erupts in Alabama Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Saying he feared a ``madman,'' an  
Alabama Democrat threatened to call for the National Guard after 
the Republican lieutenant governor reclaimed his powers over the 
state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell Barron, the Senate president pro tem, was so furious  
Tuesday that he also threatened to begin impeachment proceedings 
against Lt. Gov. Steve Windom. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have done nothing but create anarchy and chaos,'' Barron  
said. ``We are fearful of giving this power to a madman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scrum started when Windom, the first Republican elected  
lieutenant governor in Alabama this century, pushed through new 
operating rules on the opening day of the regular session that 
restored much of his power to control the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	He had lost most of those powers in January during an  
organizational session controlled by new Democratic Gov. Don 
Siegelman and his allies. Windom took them back Tuesday with a 
quick voice-vote that set off howling protests. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, among other things, allow Windom to appoint new  
committees to consider major bills. The rules could be rewritten 
again when the Senate meets today. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening of a regular session is normally a congenial day  
when senators bring their families to visit. Tuesday was anything 
but congenial. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Vetter, a retired school principal visiting from  
Claremore, Okla., described the Senate chamber as a ``war zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five-year-old Crystal Smitherman, daughter of Sen. Rodger  
Smitherman, became so frightened by the screaming adults that she 
started crying.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of Lewinsky TV Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Barbara Walters' interview of Monica Lewinsky,  
which aired Wednesday night on ABC: 
</P>
<P>
	BARBARA WALTERS: One juror, at the grand jury, asked you why you  
kept having affairs with married men. Why did you? Why do you? 
</P>
<P>
	MONICA LEWINSKY: I have to say that was the most difficult  
question to answer in my entire experience with the grand jury. It 
was the most pointed question.... I know I will never have an 
affair with a married man again. ...But, clearly to me, what I've 
come to see is that that happened because I didn't have enough 
feelings of self-worth. So that I didn't feel that ... I was worthy 
of being number one to a man. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	BW: You showed the president your thong underwear. Where did you  
get the nerve? I mean -- who does that? 
</P>
<P>
	ML: ...If you take my word for it, it was a small, subtle,  
flirtatious gesture. And that's me. 
</P>
<P>
	BW: Was it saying ``I'm available?''  
</P>
<P>
	ML: I think it was saying, ``I'm interested, too. I'll play.''  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	BW: Did you ever say to yourself, ``I'm doing something wrong.  
This is bad for the president. This is bad for the country.'' Did 
you ever think about that? 
</P>
<P>
	ML: Now with everything that's happened, ... I feel bad that I  
didn't. But, I didn't at that time. I was enamored with him. And I 
was excited. And I was enjoying it. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	ML: I think that one of the things that people have not been  
able to look at in this past year is that they looked at this and 
said 'this is about a man and a woman, and not the president and an 
intern.' He was very tender with me. He was very affectionate. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	BW: Did your mother ever try to break off this relationship?  
</P>
<P>
	ML: Yes! Yes she did. But anyone who knows me knows that I'm  
stubborn, and from the time I was 2 years old, one of my first 
phrases was, with my hands on my hips, ``You're not the boss of 
me!'' And I've been that way ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	(Ms. Lewinsky is asked about her blue dress, which became a key  
piece of evidence in the investigation.) 
</P>
<P>
	BW: Ken Starr's people didn't know you had this dress. Why did  
you turn it over to them? 
</P>
<P>
	ML: Because I had to. Getting and keeping my immunity became  
very important to me. For I needed to take care of myself and my 
family. No one else was worried about me. 
</P>
<P>
	BW: Did you feel you had to then tell the whole truth about  
absolutely everything, including this dress? 
</P>
<P>
	ML: You bet. And I did. ...Every man I have met since this thing  
has happened eventually says to me, ``So, what's the real story 
with the dress?'' And it's humiliating. I wish I hadn't had it. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	(The discussion turns to May 24, 1997, when Clinton ended the  
relationship.) 
</P>
<P>
	BW: You said that when you left Bill Clinton's office that day,  
you sobbed in the arms of (presidential secretary) Betty Currie. 
And there were times when she escorted you into the president's 
office and left and so forth. Do you think that Betty Currie was an 
enabler? 
</P>
<P>
	ML: I certainly know that this relationship could not have  
continued the way it did, when I was at the Pentagon and the 
president was obviously at the White House, without Betty. 
</P>
<P>
	BW: In retrospect, do you think that Betty Currie knew about  
your relationship with the president? 
</P>
<P>
	ML: She strikes me as the type of woman that probably wouldn't  
even have allowed herself to think that. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	(The questions focus on talking points that Ms. Lewinsky  
provided to Linda Tripp.) 
</P>
<P>
	BW: Now Linda Tripp says that she believes that the notion that  
you wrote those on your own is about as likely as you co-authoring 
the Gettysburg Address with Lincoln. ...So her question is, and the 
question of other people is, how are you able to use those legal 
terms? I mean, you're not that informed. You're not that smart. Did 
anyone help you with these talking points? 
</P>
<P>
	ML: No. I had been working on my own affidavit with my attorney  
at the time. I've been told by the prosecutors and by my own 
attorneys I should go to law school. I guess I have a knack for it. 
I sat down at the computer and typed it out. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	BW: You learned (on Jan. 16, 1998) that Linda Tripp had taped  
your conversations. ...How did you feel when you learned for the 
first time that she'd taped you? 
</P>
<P>
	ML: Gutted and violated and betrayed. And scared.  
</P>
<P>
	BW: I understand that you're restricted in (discussing) the  
events of those days and what happened when you were in the room 
with Ken Starr's people and the FBI agents. But can you tell us how 
you were feeling... 
</P>
<P>
	ML: Oh, I was, I was petrified. ... I have never been so afraid  
in my entire life. I wanted to die. I wanted to kill everybody in 
the room. ... I was just very scared. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	(How Ms. Lewinsky felt after she dealt with federal  
prosecutors.) 
</P>
<P>
	ML: I felt very responsible.  
</P>
<P>
	BW: Responsible for what?  
</P>
<P>
	ML: For everything that was going to happen, and that had  
happened. And, I didn't want him to get into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	BW: You were worried about Bill Clinton? More than about  
yourself? More than about your mother? 
</P>
<P>
	ML: No. I was worried about my mom more than I was worried about  
the president. And then I was worried about the president, and then 
I was worried about myself. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	BW: If you had to do it all over again, would have had the  
relationship with Bill Clinton? 
</P>
<P>
	ML: There are some days that I regret that the relationship ever  
started and there are some days that I just regret that I ever 
confided in Linda Tripp. 
</P>
<P>
	BW: Monica, are you still in love with Bill Clinton?  
</P>
<P>
	ML: No. ...Sometimes I have warm feelings, sometimes I'm proud  
of him still, and sometimes I hate his guts. And, um, he makes me 
sick. 
</P>
<P>
	BW: What will you tell your children, when you have them?  
</P>
<P>
	ML: Mommy made a big mistake.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Sen. Won't Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Sen. Fred Thompson said he will not run  
for president in 2000, saying it would be impractical for three 
Tennessee candidates to be in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican said a lot of people from around the country had  
encouraged him to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was surprising to me. (I thought) I should not dismiss this  
out of hand, and I didn't,'' he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said he will support former Gov. Lamar Alexander, a  
Tennessee native who is due to announce next week that he will be 
making his second attempt at the Republican nomination. Alexander 
and Thompson are old friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, also from Tennessee, is seeking the  
Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was elected to the Senate in 1994 to fill the remaining  
two years of Gore's term. He was re-elected in 1996 to a full 
six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Now chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, he  
was minority counsel for the Senate Watergate Committee in the 
early 1970s and later became an actor, appearing in movies such as 
``The Hunt for Red October'' and ``In the Line of Fire.''

<HEADLINE> Springer Defends Show at Oxford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Jerry Springer evoked the memory of a princess in  
defending his TV talk show, which often erupts into a slugfest 
between guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Princess Diana talked publicly about the same topics featured on  
``The Jerry Springer Show,'' he said Tuesday during a debate at the 
Oxford Union, Oxford University's debating society. 
</P>
<P>
	``She talked about not being faithful in her marriage, she  
talked about bulimia and she talked about even contemplating 
suicide,'' Springer said in an apparent reference to her tell-all 
interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana died in a 1997 car crash with her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed.  
</P>
<P>
	Springer said there is ``a lot of elitism'' in the criticism of  
his show and its guests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because they don't speak the queen's English, because they're  
not rich or powerful or famous and they didn't go to Oxford or our 
Harvard, we seem to call them trash,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not trash, they're human beings,'' said Springer, in  
Britain for a promotional tour.

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jack Atlas, who made some of the earliest  
movie trailers and started a company devoted to making the 
previews, died Friday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlas became a key figure in the trailer industry during the  
past 40 years of their evolution and was an authority on their 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his career in MGM's publicity department and later  
worked full-time creating previews. MGM was one of the first 
studios with a full-time trailer production staff, and only a dozen 
companies in the world produced trailers at the time Atlas started. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailers grew in popularity with ``talkies,'' and over the years  
evolved into a key marketing strategy for new film releases. Today, 
more than 100 companies make trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	After working for MGM and then Columbia, he started his own  
production company, Atlas Organization, in 1973, which made 
trailers for films and Ted Turner's television enterprises.

president of Tacoma's longshore union, died Saturday after he 
collapsed outside his hotel while on business in Germany. The cause 
of death was not made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Braach rose from an entry-level dockworker to become president  
of Local 23 and a major player in West Coast port labor matters. He 
was elected local president last year and had been active in union 
matters since the early 1990s.

Wednesday of cardio-respiratory failure. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	During Harrington's 28 years at Peachtree Presbyterian, its  
membership went from 2,400 to the current nearly 12,000.

</P>
<P>
	``Herb was the best, a class act,'' said John Reid, AP vice  
president for technology. ``He was justifiably proud of all his 
accomplishments during his three decades with the AP, but he was 
even prouder of the people he worked with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley, who worked for the wire service for 30 years, began with  
the AP when stories were moved over land lines at 55 words a 
minute. He helped oversee its transition to the computer age, with 
transmissions via satellite that handle 1,000 times that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley rose through the ranks of the Boston office, taking  
charge of northern New England operations and then southern 
California in 1975. He rose to deputy director of communications

	WINFIELD, Kan., (AP) -- Stuart Mossman, a guitar maker,  
entertainer and entrepreneur, died Tuesday after a long 
hospitalization following a heart attack. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Mossman built 6,000 guitars from 1968 to 1984, first in his  
garage and later in a factory with 28 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	His guitars attracted the attention of professionals and  
celebrities, including John Denver, Eric Clapton, Albert Lee, Doc 
Watson, Hank Snow, Cat Stevens and Merle Travis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mossman stopped making guitars when he suffered severe headaches  
and a skin condition caused by the chemicals used in guitar-making. 
The company was sold to a former employee and moved to Garland, 
Texas, where Mossman guitars are still being built.

	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Rev. Norman Perry, editor-in-chief of St.  
Anthony Messenger magazine since 1981, died Monday of heart 
failure. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry, a Franciscan priest ordained in 1958, oversaw editing and

<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Shirley Satin Simmons, who appeared in  
television commercials and exercise videos with her son, fitness 
guru Richard Simmons, died Sunday. She was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Simmons, a New York City native, was a tap dancer when she  
met Leonard D. Simmons Sr., a singer and master of ceremonies, at a 
theatrical boarding house in Philadelphia in 1938, according to 
Leonard Simmons Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	They married and performed under the stage names Bobby and  
Shirley Leonard. They moved to New Orleans in 1939, where Mrs. 
Simmons tap danced in Bourbon Street variety shows. 
</P>
<P>
	After Leonard Jr. and Richard were born in 1946 and 1948, she  
abandoned show business and went to work selling cosmetics. She 
retired in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	When Richard Simmons became well known through his exercise  
programs and fitness videos, his mother often was with him. She 
appeared in commercials with him and did an exercise video, ``The 
Silver Foxes,'' with the parents of other celebrities, including 
Sylvester Stallone's father and Dustin Hoffman's mother.

                         *Dusty Springfield    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Singer Dusty Springfield, the husky-voiced white  
soul singer who put her stamp on the 1960s with such hits as ``Son 
of a Preacher Man'' and ``Wishin' and Hopin','' died Tuesday of 
breast cancer. She was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	The Encyclopedia of Popular Music paid tribute to her inviting  
voice, saying she could ``chill the spine and warm the heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springfield's finest album is considered 1969's ``Dusty in  
Memphis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though she started out in several groups, her first solo success  
came in 1964 with the jaunty ``I Only Want To Be With You.'' Other 
hits included ``I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself'' and 
``You Don't Have to Say You Love Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, she returned to the charts by teaming up with the Pet  
Shop Boys duo for the pop single ``What Have I Done to Deserve 
This?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her resurgence was capped this decade with the inclusion of  
``The Son of a Preacher Man'' on the ``Pulp Fiction'' soundtrack, 
which introduced her to a whole new audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Her breast cancer was diagnosed in 1994 shortly after she  
recorded her most recent album, ``A Very Fine Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springfield's death came 11 days before she was to be inducted  
into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at a ceremony in New York, 
along with Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen.

<HEADLINE> US, China To Continue WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky was  
in Beijing today preparing for what are expected to be tough new 
negotiations over China's bid to enter the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Top trade officials from both countries are looking for fresh  
ideas to reach an agreement with the United States before Premier 
Zhu Rongji, who oversees China's economic reforms, visits the 
United States in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to bring proposals. I'm here to listen to what  
the Chinese have to say,'' Barshefsky said as she left her hotel to 
prepare for talks later today with China's foreign trade minister, 
Shi Guangsheng. 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings with Shi and other officials of the Ministry of  
Foreign Trade and Cooperation were scheduled to continue through 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the WTO, the body that sets trade rules, would give  
China low-tariff access to export markets and shield it from 
unilateral trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	China wants to be admitted as a developing country under  
conditions that would allow it to retain some trade barriers to 
protect its industries. 
</P>
<P>
	China is worried that opening its markets more could undermine  
key industries and throw even more people out of work when 
debt-ridden state factories already are laying off millions of 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	China began 13 years ago trying to gain entrance to the  
predecessor of the World Trade Organization. The United States and 
other WTO members have urged Beijing to move faster in cutting 
tariffs and opening markets to more foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing U.S. trade deficit with China reached nearly $57  
billion last year, second only to the gap with Japan. Opening 
markets further could help boost China's imports of foreign 
products, U.S. officials contend,

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Launches Troop Buildup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia launched a major troop buildup  
today in a riot-torn provincial capital, and soldiers fired warning 
shots to prevent Christians and Muslims from clashing. 
</P>
<P>
	Troops fired in the air in front of a church in coastal Ambon  
and blocked hundreds of Muslim refugees, some carrying knives, who 
tried to approach Christians protesters from a nearby mosque. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nation's capital, Jakarta, about 2,000 Islamic students  
gathered outside military headquarters and accused soldiers of 
supporting Christian rioters. They chanted ``holy war'' and ``God 
is great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, military chief Gen. Wiranto dismissed the police  
chief in charge of Ambon, where religious clashes have claimed at 
least 38 lives in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 150 people have been slain since the violence erupted  
in January in Maluku province, once known as the Spice Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest unrest in Ambon, Maluku's capital, broke out after a  
Christian refugee was stabbed at a church. Angry Christian men then 
tried to stop a car believed to be owned by Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, five people were killed when Christians attacked  
worshippers at a mosque near Ambon, 1,400 miles east of Jakarta. 
The military denied its officers shot four Muslims and refuted 
allegations that it had taken sides in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of houses have been burned and tens of thousands of  
people have fled their homes in the Ambon rioting. Rival mobs have 
fought with swords, bows and arrows and gasoline bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,400 troop reinforcements arrived in Ambon, on Tuesday  
and today. Their numbers bolstered hundreds of police and soldiers 
already in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiranto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, pledged  
that hundreds more soldiers would be sent to Ambon in the next few 
days and said they had orders to shoot troublemakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ordered the troops to shoot at their feet so as to paralyze  
them, but not kill them,'' Wiranto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of houses have been burned, and tens of thousands of  
people have fled their homes in the rioting. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, the students condemned the military's handling of  
the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The soldiers are involved. They are taking sides,'' said one  
protester, who identified himself as Reza. 
</P>
<P>
	About 90 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people are Muslim,  
making it the world's most populous Islamic state. Much of Ambon's 
population, however, is Christian.

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Utah Jazz, coming off two straight appearances in the NBA  
Finals, have impeccable credentials. The Portland Trail Blazers are 
looking to reach the same level. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, the Blazers just might have begun that climb  
with a 102-100 double-overtime victory against Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just like playing in the playoffs,'' said Portland  
guard Jim Jackson, who has never been in a postseason game. ``For 
us, in a way, it was a statement game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making the biggest statements were Rasheed Wallace and Isaiah  
Rider. Wallace scored 22 points and sank two free throws with 17 
seconds left in the second overtime. Rider scored five of his 18 
points in the second extra period. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love crunch time. That's when the big-time players step  
up,'' Rider said. ``I felt like I was lethargic for a lot of the 
game, and I wanted to show that I was a gamer, and I had the 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland (10-3) is 6-0 at home. The Jazz dropped to 11-3, their  
only losses coming on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, we should have been blown out of the game, the way we  
played,'' Utah's Greg Foster said. ``I think we were lucky just to 
be in the position we were. Just too many mistakes, too many 
offensive rebounds for Portland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the NBA, it was Miami 85, New York 84 in overtime;  
Detroit 108, Chicago 78; Sacramento 111, Vancouver 101; Dallas 112, 
L.A. Clippers 99; San Antonio 99, Houston 82; Indiana 88, Denver 
81; Washington 97, Atlanta 77; Cleveland 116, Boston 99; Milwaukee 
94, New Jersey 86; and Minnesota 89, Golden State 78.

                        *Heat 85, Knicks 84, OT    	
</P>
<P>
	At Miami, the matchup of former Georgetown centers featured  
Patrick Ewing's season-high 31 points and Alonzo Mourning's 28 
points, 11 rebounds and seven blocked shots for the Heat. But Ewing 
missed a 14-footer as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing had 16 rebounds and six blocks. But he missed two shots  
and committed a turnover in the final two minutes of regulation, 
then missed the potential game-winning jumper over P.J. Brown in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took the best shot I could. I thought it was going in,''  
Ewing said. ``I feel bad. I had a really good game all along, but 
it went south at the end. I think I got too tentative.'' 
</P>
<P>
                        *Pistons 108, Bulls 78    	
</P>
<P>
	Detroit handed Chicago its worst loss ever at the United Center;  
the previous worst was an 18-point loss to Philadelphia last week. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Detroit's first victory in Chicago since March 1990. Joe  
Dumars is the only Piston still left from the 1990 squad, which won 
a second straight NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit had six players in double figures, led by Grant Hill's  
17 points. Dumars scored 16 points on 4-of-8 shooting from 3-point 
range. The Pistons are 5-0 since Dumars' return from a hamstring 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Kings 111, Grizzlies 101    	
</P>
<P>
	Chris Webber scored 36 points, four short of his career high,  
and pulled down 17 rebounds as Sacramento won at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	Vlade Divac scored 19 and added eight rebounds. Webber, who has  
led the Kings in scoring 11 times in 15 games and put up 20 or more 
points 12 times this season, was 17-for-21 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings, who lead the league at 99.1 points per game, are 7-2  
when scoring 100 or more points and 0-6 when held below triple 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareef Abdur-Rahim led the Grizzlies with 29 points and 12  
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Spurs 99, Rockets 82    	
</P>
<P>
	Tim Duncan had 23 points and 14 rebounds for visiting San  
Antonio, which sped to a 53-37 halftime edge as former Houston 
guard Mario Elie had 15 first-half points, but sat out the second 
half with a strained left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery Johnson, who played with the Rockets during the 1991-1992  
season, hit eight of his 18 points in the first five minutes of the 
final period and added a season-high 13 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Scottie Pippen led Houston with 21 points.  
</P>
<P>
                     *Mavericks 112, Clippers 99    	
</P>
<P>
	At Dallas, Michael Finley scored 20 points and A.C. Green had 19  
points and 12 rebounds, both season highs, as the Clippers remained 
winless. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubert Davis added 18 points and Steve Nash and Gary Trent had  
16 each to help the Mavericks to their fifth victory in seven 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Taylor's 18 points and 13 rebounds paced the Clippers,  
who fell to 0-13 and remain the only NBA team without a victory. 
The 1988-89 Miami Heat hold the league record for the worst start, 
opening 0-17. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Pacers 88, Nuggets 81    	
</P>
<P>
	Indiana held Denver without a field goal for more than seven  
minutes in the final period and used a 16-1 run to clinch it. 
</P>
<P>
	Reggie Miller had 21 points for the winners, with Chris Mullin  
adding 18 points, connecting on all five of his 3-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Denver's seventh consecutive road loss and its seventh  
straight loss to Indiana. Denver got a season-high 28 points from 
Nick Van Exel. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Wizards 97, Hawks 77    	
</P>
<P>
	Washington ended a four-game losing streak as Mitch Richmond  
scored 28 points. Juwan Howard added 20 points and Rod Strickland 
had 18 as the Wizards shot 42-for-71 (59 percent) for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant Long led Atlanta with 17 points and Anthony Johnson added  
14. 
</P>
<P>
	Wizards coach Bernie Bickerstaff missed his second consecutive  
game with the flu. He did not make the trip to Atlanta with the 
team. Assistant Jim Brovelli took over his duties Monday night 
against Philadelphia and again against the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Cavaliers 116, Celtics 99    	
</P>
<P>
	At Cleveland, Shawn Kemp scored 22 points and Bob Sura added a  
season-high 19 as the Cavs broke the 100-point mark for the first 
time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland shot 58.1 percent from the field just one night after  
making a franchise-low 21 field goals on 29.6 percent shooting in a 
loss at New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Mercer led Boston with 22 points. Celtics rookie Paul  
Pierce, who entered the game averaging 20.4 points, scored just two 
and shot 0-for-11 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Bucks 94, Nets 86    	
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Robinson scored eight of his 18 points in the final 2:49  
as Milwaukee scored 11 of the last 13 points at New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets, who lost for the seventh time in eight games and fell  
to 3-11, trailed by 19 in the first half, but rallied to take an 
84-83 lead on Eric Murdock's 3-point shot with 3:03 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robinson hit a jump shot to give the Bucks the lead for  
good. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Allen had 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Bucks, while  
Keith Van Horn led the Nets with 27.

19 in the fourth quarter for Minnesota, which had lost three in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Mills scored 21 points to lead the visiting Warriors, who  
lost for just the third time in nine games. Golden State (6-8) has 
fallen apart in the fourth quarter in its past two games, this time 
hitting going only 4-for-19 from the field.

<HEADLINE> Mummy, Skeleton Found in Egypt Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A top Egyptian archaeologist crawled through  
dusty passageways today, and during a two-hour search broadcast 
live to an American audience found a mummy believed to be up to 
4,200 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox TV broadcast the look into unexplored rooms of two tombs and  
a small pyramid of Queen Khamerernebty II on the Giza Plateau, site 
of the Sphinx and the great pyramids on the outskirts of Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the mummy found may be older than the famed  
3,300-year-old King Tut discovery in 1922, Giza Plateau's chief 
archeologist noted after the broadcast that ``it is a regular 
mummy'' -- lacking any sort of royal stature. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains likely were of the high priest Kai, who performed  
rituals inside the temples and taught the king's children, Zahi 
Hawass said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawass had hoped to find the remains of Queen Khamerernebty II,  
whose pyramid is near the Sphinx. But when he ventured 60 feet down 
through a narrow passageway, crawling and ducking all the way, he 
found an incomplete burial chamber. Inside, there was a skeleton he 
believed could have been a grave robber. 
</P>
<P>
	``No pyramid is similar to this at all,'' he told The Associated  
Press after the broadcast. ``The entrance and the chambers were 
unfinished and the queen was never buried here. She is buried 
somewhere else in a tomb and therefore, this pyramid was never 
used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Hawass and officials for the American network behind  
``Opening the Lost Tombs: Live From Egypt,'' which took place 
Tuesday evening in the United States -- early today in Cairo -- were 
excited about their project. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is very good for television to do something  
different and make archeology more fun and cool,'' Fox executive 
producer Peter Isacksen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paintings on the walls inside the temple of Kai's wife and  
daughter were the most impressive find, Hawass said. They showed 
``butchers bringing thighs of cows and it shows people bringing 
offerings, women standing. ... It's beautiful life scenes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawass said an artist's signature was found in Kai's tomb; in  
the past, paintings found on the walls have been unsigned. He also 
discovered a skeleton believed to be that of Kai's wife and another 
thought to be Kai's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	During the broadcast, Hawass held up several pieces of pottery  
to the camera, saying they were remnants of jars for drinking beer 
in the afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
	The program cost Fox $3 million, including a contribution to  
Egypt's antiquities department made in return for government 
permission for the broadcast, network officials said.

<HEADLINE> Law Would Force Clear Card Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Quick: How long would it take to pay off a  
$3,000 credit card balance by making a typical monthly minimum 
payment of 2 percent of the balance, at an interest rate of 18 
percent? 
</P>
<P>
	Answer: About 30 years.  
</P>
<P>
	Legislation proposed Tuesday by Democratic lawmakers would  
require credit card companies to give their customers that news in 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Minimum payments are the nicotine'' of the credit card  
industry; ``they should carry proper warnings,'' said Mary Rouleau, 
legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, drafted by Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., would require  
card issuers to spell out in billing statements how long it would 
take customers to pay off their debt, and the total cost including 
interest, if they made only the minimum monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would compel credit card companies to spell  
out more clearly and conspicuously how long their enticingly low 
``teaser'' rates for new accounts last, and what higher rates will 
replace them. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the companies would have to clearly disclose any  
conditions under which the introductory ``teaser'' rate may be 
revoked, such as failure to make monthly payments on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit card companies ``are taking advantage of current law to  
hook new customers with misleading promotions and to encourage 
customers to carry increasing debt burdens,'' said LaFalce, who is 
the House Banking Committee's senior Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are living in an age of 'buyer beware' in terms of credit  
cards,'' he said in a statement. ``Card issuers have increased the 
number and amount of fees, shortened payment periods, and contrived 
hidden penalties that can readily double or triple interest 
charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 House lawmakers, all Democrats, have endorsed the  
legislation, which also would put restrictions on new credit card 
accounts for people under age 21. In addition, the bill would ban 
card issuers from canceling accounts or imposing new fees on 
customers who pay off their monthly balances in full. 
</P>
<P>
	With personal bankruptcies continuing to soar, lawmakers of both  
parties last week began pushing legislation backed by credit card 
companies that would make it harder for people to erase their debts 
in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	LaFalce's bill could eventually be attached to the bankruptcy  
overhaul legislation, as happened last year, when the House passed 
such legislation. The Senate adjourned last year without voting on 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of a sweeping rewrite of the bankruptcy laws,  
including consumer groups, insist that the credit card networks, 
and the banks that control them, share the blame for mounting debt 
by aggressively mailing millions of solicitations to entice 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong economy, the number of Americans filing  
personal bankruptcies last year reached a record 1.4 million, up 
more than 300 percent since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Big credit card networks, notably Visa and MasterCard, and  
retail-business groups have said their losses from forgiven debts 
in bankruptcy have forced them to raise interest rates for 
consumers who handle credit responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McGarry, a spokesman for Visa USA Inc., said the  
information the card issuer provides to consumers concerning fees, 
interest rates and other terms already is adequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., principal sponsor of the legislation  
to overhaul the bankruptcy laws, wasn't immediately available for 
comment on the Democrats' credit card proposals.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Disney Discuss Theme Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner  
visited China last fall, he was impressed by the large number of 
McDonald's restaurants. He would later tell shareholders, he felt 
``completely sure'' the Chinese people ``love Mickey no less than 
Big Mac.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Mickey appears to be a step closer to entering China in a  
major way. Hong Kong and Disney officials said Wednesday they have 
been in talks about building a theme park in the former British 
colony, possibly on an outlying island where the new airport is 
located. A decision is expected by June. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney, which already has parks in the United States, France and  
Japan, including Tokyo DisneySea opening in 2001, could benefit 
from a Hong Kong theme park to ``gain a foothold in the region'' to 
build business for everything from movies to consumer products, 
said James Zoltak, West Coast Editor of Amusement Business 
magazine, a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disney obviously doesn't want to just go in and make a splash  
in the Hong Kong market,'' said Zoltak. ``It's looking at China and 
the giant population. It's looking at Southeast Asia. .... It is an 
emerging economy. It has a lot of potential. The time to get in is 
before it booms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Countries throughout Asia are reeling from an economic crisis.  
Hong Kong is sunk in a recession with high unemployment, a sharp 
drop in tourism and a weak real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
	Local boosters believe a Disney park could help change all that,  
and support for the park runs deep. Rumors of the theme park talks 
have sent up the price of stocks in tourism-sensitive businesses 
such as Cathay Pacific and Kowloon Motor Bus Co. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only a couple of years ago that Disney was under attack  
from China over the Martin Scorsese film ``Kundun,'' which was 
critical of China's Tibet policies. But relations have thawed since 
then, with Eisner visiting the country last fall. In June, Disney 
named veteran executive John Feenie to oversee the entertainment 
and media company's expanding ventures in China. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is a nation of enormous opportunity for our company,''  
Eisner said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong financial secretary Donald Tsang confirmed the theme  
park talks in his annual budget address. He said the discussions 
have involved building a park on Lantau Island, where the new 
international airport was built. He cautioned that much remains to 
be done to conclude the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials declined to discuss the size of a possible park or how  
it would be financed and operated. For the new park in Tokyo, for 
instance, Disney licenses its names and characters acts as a 
consultant on the park's construction and operation. The park will 
be fully owned and operated by Oriental Land Co. which also owns 
and operates Tokyo Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
	In Burbank, Calif., Disney spokesman John Dreyer said Wednesday  
the talks with Hong Kong are in a ``very preliminary stage'' but 
noted: ``There's tremendous long-term potential in Asia and in 
China and we're exploring expanding all of our businesses in 
China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The process of building a theme park takes some time,'' added  
Dreyer. ``We prefer to build in a downturn and come in on an 
upturn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The theme park business is far from a sure bet in China and  
efforts to build parks on the mainland have largely stumbled in the 
last couple of years. Investors have misjudged customer projections 
and the challenges of dealing with the Chinese bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zoltak of Amusement Business said Hong Kong is ``a  
completely different animal. It's a modern city and incomes are 
higher.'' Also, Hong Kong draws tourists from throughout southeast 
Asia, as well as North America and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably a good place to do this,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Since opening the original Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., in  
1955, Disney has expanded to Tokyo, France, and Florida, where it 
as four parks in the Orlando area. It is adding a second park in 
Anaheim and is considering adding a small park in France.

<HEADLINE> Hino Motors Cuts Administrators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese truckmaker Hino Motors Ltd. will reduce  
its administrative staff by 10 percent, or 400 jobs, this year by 
asking employees to volunteer for early retirement, the company 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hino, an affiliate of Toyota Motor Co., is expected to suffer a  
huge loss for the fiscal year ending in March because truck sales 
have fallen sharply since Japan sank into recession last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hino would likely fire some workers to reach the target if too  
few volunteer for early retirement, the Nihon Keizai newspaper 
reported, citing Hino President Hiroshi Yuasa. 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokesman refused to comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Firing workers is still extremely rare at big companies in  
Japan. Most companies choose instead to trim work forces by 
freezing new hiring, or finding jobs for workers in affiliated 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Hino, which has 9,600 employees, will likely post a net loss of  
about 30 billion yen ($248 million) for the year ending March 31, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's most recent forecast was for a net loss of 9.2  
billion yen ($76 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Hino hasn't announced a revision to its forecast for earnings  
but planned to make such an announcement in mid-March, said the 
spokesman, who declined to give his name.

<HEADLINE> Hair Test May Reveal Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Australian researchers say they have developed a test for breast  
cancer that can be done be analyzing a single pubic hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Radiologists at the University of New South Wales in Sydney  
found that microscopic characteristics in the hair may reveal 
whether a woman has breast cancer. They also believe that the hair 
may indicate whether a woman is carrying a certain gene mutation 
that raises the risk of later developing the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Pubic hair was found to be easier to read than scalp hair  
because it it less likely to be damaged by perms, dyes or the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Other scientists, however, said the study is too small to be  
conclusive. And they questioned whether the method is an 
improvement over existing tests -- mammograms for finding cancer, 
blood tests for identifying genetic risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The test is not approved for clinical use.  
</P>
<P>
	The study was reported Thursday in the journal Nature.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the Australian researchers, radiologist Veronica James,  
said the hair test could help women living in poor, remote areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Samples for this test could be posted from anywhere in the  
world in an envelope,'' Ms. James said. ``In many poorer countries, 
no mammography is available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, researchers used sensitive X-ray equipment to  
analyze the scalp hair of 23 women who earlier had been diagnosed 
with breast cancer, and found their hair contained one or more 
extra rings in the keratin, or protein layer. Of 28 women who were 
known to be cancer-free, all but four did not have the extra rings. 
</P>
<P>
	The same pattern was found in 12 women whose pubic hair was  
analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can look at the patterns we are getting from our hair  
samples and know that the diseased ones are different from the 
normal ones because they have changed in structure,'' Ms. James 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five women in the study had not been diagnosed with breast  
cancer, but earlier tests found they carried a mutation of the 
BRCA-1 gene associated with an inherited form of the disease. Hair 
from all five patients contained full or partial extra rings 
similar to those seen in the breast cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. James said the results suggest that a woman's hair could  
indicate the presence of the BRCA-1 mutation even before cancer is 
detected. 
</P>
<P>
	During the research, the scientists realized that a lifetime of  
chemicals and sun had damaged the molecular structure of the 
women's hair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their scalp hair was useless until it grew out again three  
months later,'' Ms. James said. ``So with a lot of fun and 
laughter, the women disappeared behind a curtain with scissors and 
envelopes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Savitz, chairman of epidemiology at the University of  
North Carolina, said pubic hair is a more reliable biological 
sample than scalp hair; he has used it to determine people's 
history of cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Australian study was too small and its results must be  
repeated in larger studies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Savitz said he also questions widespread screening for the rare  
BRCA-1 form of the disease -- which accounts for as few as three in 
211 breast cancer cases, according to one 1998 study -- especially 
when there is no ``useful'' way to prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
	Women who have the defective genes sometimes choose drastic  
options, such as having their breasts removed while they are still 
healthy.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Opens Market to Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- Bahrain, the leading financial center in  
the Middle East, opened its doors Wednesday for increased foreign 
participation in stock trading in an effort to boost its economy. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a decree issued by Bahrain's ruler, Sheik Isa bin  
Salman Al Khalifa, citizens of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation 
Council will be allowed to own 100 percent stakes in companies 
listed in the local stock exchange, the official Gulf News Agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Other foreigners will be allowed to hold 49 percent stakes, the  
agency added quoting Commerce Minister Ali Saleh al-Saleh. 
</P>
<P>
	The GCC includes Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and  
the United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
	The decree ``represented a distinguished step in the body of the  
law related to the economic environment and investment in 
Bahrain,'' al-Saleh was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was intended to attract investment to the tiny Gulf  
state as it tries to reduce its dependence on dwindling oil 
resources. The low world oil prices have also added to the island's 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, GCC nationals could own up to 49 percent stake in  
local listed companies and other foreigners were allowed a 
collective ownership of 24 percent with an individual limit of one 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 companies are listed on the island's stock exchange.

<HEADLINE> Museum Is Treasure House of Dross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- What's all mixed-up and odd, weird and sad? Ask  
the people at ``The Museum of ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of what? The folks running London's newest museum, at The  
Bargehouse on South Bank, aren't yet sure. But they do know one 
thing: Throw anything away, even if it's only a candy wrapper, and 
someone will love it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Museum of ... is exploring its future in a series of  
temporary guises. Over 20 months, it will be The Museum of Me, The 
Museum of Emotions, The Museum of the Unknown or The Museum of the 
River Thames. 
</P>
<P>
	At the moment, this warehouse relic of wharves long gone is  
operating as The Museum of Collectors. 
</P>
<P>
	But whatever it's called, there are no masterpieces here.  
</P>
<P>
	Instead, visitors will find a wall of drink cans, plastic bags  
hanging on a stairway, and the entire floor of one room covered in 
Kinder Surprise toys -- those little playthings collected from 
hollow chocolate eggs by Jayne Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fascinated by not knowing what's inside,'' Ms. Jordan  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Rawley contributed a tree branch stuck through a wire  
fence, though the rest of the tree had been removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cut out that bit of fence -- you can call me a vandal or a  
liberator -- and collected the result,'' he says. It makes him think 
about the divide between nature and culture, and ``reminds me of 
the boundaries society places on the individual,'' he explains. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Weedon, a collector of plastic trolls, aspires to no such  
philosophical heights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I began rescuing trolls when I couldn't bear to see them  
rejected by children,'' she says. ``They are great company so long 
as they don't all talk at once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Michael Harrison's Dolly Parton memorabilia includes the  
item supreme, in a glass case with a note signed by the lady 
herself: ``This is a piece of carpet taken from my Music Room when 
I redecorated our home in Nashville, Tenn., in 1989.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Persephone Watkins, an assistant at the museum, says that when  
she first heard about the collection, she thought Harrison must be 
deranged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now,'' she says, ``I love it.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Bargehouse is an old warehouse that was turned into an arts  
center by Coin Street Community Builders, local people who won a 
fierce campaign a decade ago to save their historic district close 
to William Shakespeare's Globe theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors who sign the museum's guest book are asked, ``What  
museum do you wish existed?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among their answers: coat hangers, graffiti, ice, obsessions and  
compulsions, coal mines, industrial accidents, anything with 
gelatin in it, and ``things that never work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the entrance are scores of little paper bags, all signed  
and dated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to create our own collection, so when we opened in  
November, we asked everyone who came in to leave us something,'' 
says Louise King, the museum's communications manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Contributions include a shopping list, a lighter, a receipt from  
a Chinese restaurant, German postage stamps, bus and train tickets, 
``my name cut out of a newspaper,'' a disposable razor, a 
testosterone skin patch and ``my hair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's interesting to see what's private and personal,'' Ms.  
Watkins says. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-pound note someone left, worth about $33, ``didn't stay  
long, I'm sorry to say.''

<HEADLINE> German's Execution Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- Amid pleas of mercy from the German  
government, a federal appeals court on Wednesday ordered Arizona 
not to use the gas chamber to execute a German man whose brother 
was put to death last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to issue a stay for  
Walter LaGrand, 37, who was scheduled to die in a cloud of cyanide 
fumes Wednesday afternoon for his role in the 1982 murder of a bank 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judges did say that the gas chamber is cruel and unusual  
punishment, and therefore unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The state appealed to the Supreme Court, but it was unclear when  
the execution would proceed. If the state is forced to ask for 
another death warrant from the Arizona Supreme Court, it would 
likely hold up the execution for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the 9th Circuit issued a stay in a nearly identical  
appeal by LaGrand's brother, Karl. But the Supreme Court overturned 
it in a matter of hours, and Karl was executed by injection for his 
part in the bank murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter LaGrand's case also was heard Wednesday in the  
International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands. Germany 
asked the world court to intervene after Arizona Gov. Jane Hull 
rejected appeals from German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and 
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer to stop the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The international court has no enforcement powers, but in a  
special, half-hour hearing, Judge Christopher Weeramantry of Sri 
Lanka urged the U.S. government to use ``all the measures at its 
disposal'' to prevent the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also said the United States should pay unspecified  
damages for the death of Karl LaGrand, 35, who was the first German 
citizen executed in the United States since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Like his brother, Karl requested the gas chamber in hopes that  
the Supreme Court would agree that the method is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court disagreed and lifted the 9th Circuit's stay. Karl  
then accepted the state's last-minute offer of lethal injection. 
Walter rejected such an offer and said he would prefer a more 
painful execution in the gas chamber to protest the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Arizona executed an inmate in the gas chamber, in  
1992, his death took 11 minutes and was considered so gruesome that 
the law was changed to require lethal injection. Killers sentenced 
to death before 1992, like the LaGrands, are given a choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany does not have the death penalty and contends Arizona  
failed to advise the LaGrand brothers of their right to consular 
assistance at their trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona officials conceded they violated the Vienna Convention  
but insisted the LaGrands were accorded all the rights any U.S. 
citizen would have received. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 38 states with capital punishment, only Arizona,  
California, Maryland, Missouri and Wyoming offer the gas chamber as 
an optional method, according to Richard Dieter, executive director 
of the National Death Penalty Information Center. Only 10 of the 
more than 500 inmates executed since the death penalty was restored 
in 1976 have been put to death in the gas chamber, he said.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Executes 2nd German Citizen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- Despite pleas from the German government,  
a German citizen was executed Wednesday in a cloud of cyanide fumes 
-- a week after his brother was put to death for the same crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter LaGrand, 37, died in the gas chamber for his role in the  
1982 murder of a bank manager. His brother Karl, 35, was executed 
Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter LaGrand apologized to the families of his victim.  
</P>
<P>
	``To all my loved ones, I hope they find peace. To all of you  
here today, I forgive you and I hope I can be forgiven in my next 
life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	LaGrand was pronounced dead 18 minutes after cynanide pellets  
were dropped into a pan of distilled water and sulfuric acid below 
his seat in the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	As a cloud of mist rose, he began coughing, shook his head and  
gagged several times. Minutes later, his head slumped forward. He 
coughed again, raised his head and slumped forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Both brothers chose the gas chamber in hopes that courts would  
rule that the method is cruel and unusual punishment and therefore 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	In both cases, the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a federal appeals  
court's restraining order barring Arizona from the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl LaGrand accepted the state's last-minute offer of lethal  
injection. Walter LaGrand rejected such an offer and said he would 
prefer a more painful execution in the gas chamber to protest the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The case drew widespread attention in Germany, which has no  
death penalty, prompting repeated diplomatic protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter LaGrand's case also was heard Wednesday in the  
International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands. Germany 
asked the World Court to intervene after Arizona Gov. Jane Hull 
rejected appeals from German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and

	The court also said the United States should pay unspecified  
damages for the death of Karl LaGrand, who was the first German 
citizen executed in the United States since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were born in Augsburg, Germany, and moved to  
southern Arizona as children after their mother married an American 
serviceman. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Arizona executed an inmate in the gas chamber, in  
1992, his death took 11 minutes and was considered so gruesome that

<HEADLINE>  Jury Gets Cable Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Jurors today began weighing the fate  
of a Marine pilot charged with involuntary manslaughter for flying 
his jet into an Italian ski lift cable, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight Marine officers closeted themselves shortly after 2  
p.m. following summations by prosecutors and defense lawyers that 
lasted nearly four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement, prosecutor Maj. Daniel Daugherty described  
Capt. Richard Ashby as ``outright dangerous,'' but Ashby's lawyer 
countered that it was an accident ``and nothing more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When he violated all these things and didn't know local rules  
and regulations, people died and a $60 million aircraft is in 
ruins,'' Daugherty said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason the accused is guilty ... is he was too low, he was  
too fast, he was too aggressive. He was outright dangerous,'' 
Daugherty said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his closing statement, defense attorney Frank Spinner posed  
the question of whether the tragedy was ``a training accident or 
was it something more?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a training accident and nothing more,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Testimony in Ashby's manslaughter trial began Feb. 8 and ended  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was at the controls of an  
EA-6B Prowler jet on Feb. 3, 1998, when it struck the Mount Cermis 
gondola cable near Cavalese, Italy. He is charged with involuntary 
manslaughter and other counts and could get 206 years in prison if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	In his summation, Daugherty said the safe conduct of the flight  
depended on Ashby's decisions, but he made bad choices -- flying the 
jet above the 517 mph restriction for the low-level training 
mission, and far below the 2,000-foot altitude limit. Ashby's jet 
hit the cable 370 feet above the valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Daugherty argued that Ashby should have known he was flying too  
low and too fast by merely looking around. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have the roads, the cars, the houses, the humanity of it  
all. Captain Ashby ignores it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner said a number of factors converged as Ashby flew the jet  
down the alpine valley -- the ground rose 150 feet, the altimeter 
malfunctioned and an optical illusion made Ashby believe he was 
flying higher than he really was. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't avoid what you can't see,'' he said. ``This was a  
trap. This was an accident waiting to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby testified earlier he didn't know about the mission's speed  
limit and thought the altitude restriction was 1,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Daugherty said that to hide evidence of their recklessness it  
appeared Ashby and his navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 
destroyed a videotape on which Schweitzer had filmed the early 
portions of the flight. The tape has never been located. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby testified earlier that he took the tape to his quarters,  
where Schweitzer picked it up. Ashby never saw it again, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The simple conclusion you can draw is that tape and video  
camera had nothing to do with the accident,'' Spinner told jurors 
today. ``It was a private tape; it wasn't a government tape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree the gondola cable wasn't marked on the map  
Ashby was issued by the Air Force. Ashby testified last week that 
he didn't know of the ski lift and that he didn't see the cable 
until the last second. 
</P>
<P>
	``Negligence is knowing the cable is there and flying as if it  
is not. ... Negligence is not the occurrence of normal deviations 
in flight,'' Spinner said. ``It would have been negligence if that 
aerial cableway was on their map and they ignored it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a brief recess after closing arguments, Vera Eyskens,  
whose daughter Rose Marie Eyskens of Kalmthout, Belgium, died in 
the accident, embraced Daugherty. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened on the final leg of a 42-minute training  
route through the Italian Alps. Europeans were outraged, and 
Italians demanded that U.S. landing rights be revoked at bases in 
their country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't recall in 20 years of investigating accidents any  
pilot being held criminally responsible for an accident,'' said 
Jeff Edwards, an investigator who worked for the defense team. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers have suggested the aviators were charged because  
of political pressure that went as high as the White House.

dismissed.

<HEADLINE>  Jury Gets Cable Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Jurors today began weighing the fate  
of a Marine pilot charged with involuntary manslaughter for flying 
his jet into an Italian ski lift cable, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight Marine officers closeted themselves shortly after 2  
p.m. following summations by prosecutors and defense lawyers that 
lasted nearly four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement, prosecutor Maj. Daniel Daugherty described  
Capt. Richard Ashby as ``outright dangerous,'' but Ashby's lawyer 
countered that it was an accident ``and nothing more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When he violated all these things and didn't know local rules  
and regulations, people died and a $60 million aircraft is in 
ruins,'' Daugherty said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason the accused is guilty ... is he was too low, he was  
too fast, he was too aggressive. He was outright dangerous,'' 
Daugherty said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his closing statement, defense attorney Frank Spinner posed  
the question of whether the tragedy was ``a training accident or 
was it something more?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a training accident and nothing more,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Alonzo Mourning Blames Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The only person Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning  
blames these days is himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he would blame the refs and cheap shots from  
opponents. Now he's a smarter, calmer and improved version of 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this is a game of mistakes,'' he said. ``I'm my biggest  
critic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, Mourning missed three shots in the final  
seconds of the fourth quarter against the New York Knicks. That 
sent the game into overtime, and nearly cost Miami the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat won 85-84, with Mourning grabbing the final rebound as  
time ran out after Patrick Ewing missed a jumper that could have 
won it for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I rushed a lot of things,'' Mourning said, sounding almost  
apologetic. ``I made some bad decisions. I've got to make better 
decisions. Fortunately, we came up with a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Mourning would grow so frustrated he forgot  
basketball and took to his fists. 
</P>
<P>
	Case in point: Game 4 of last year's playoff against the Knicks.  
Mourning got into a fight with Larry Johnson and was suspended. The 
Heat lost Game 5, and Miami coach Pat Riley said Mourning's short 
fuse cost the Heat the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Many also remember Mourning coming unraveled as Dennis Rodman  
taunted and hounded the 6-foot-10 center when Miami lost two 
playoff series to the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite still being pushed around by opponents -- Tuesday it was  
Chris Dudley who appeared to frustrate Mourning the most -- he 
stands his ground and keeps his cool. 
</P>
<P>
	No whining to officials. The only talking he does is to himself.  
It's not unusual to see Mourning admonish himself after missing a 
shot or blowing a play on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, Mourning finished with 28 points, 11 rebounds  
and seven blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of things I should have done to help this  
team have an easier outcome, without a doubt,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So changed is Mourning, that he has yet to foul out of a game  
this season. He seems more focused, even making free throws, 
usually his weakness. Against the Knicks he went 10-for-13. Against 
the Orlando Magic on Sunday he was 14-for-15. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm working on trying to be a mistake-free player,'' Mourning  
said. ``There are a lot of things I have to work on as a player if 
I'm going to help contribute to this ball club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His mentor, Ewing, said Mourning's approach to the game really  
hasn't changed, just people's impression of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zo always has been focused,'' he said. ``He's not doing  
anything different than he's done in the past. Maybe you all should 
respect him a little more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley is impressed by Mourning's work.  
</P>
<P>
	``Zo plays very, very hard,'' Riley said following the Knicks  
game. ``He did not shoot the ball well, but he plays with a lot of 
heart.''

<HEADLINE> Allstate, Money Manager Make Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The nation's largest publicly traded auto and  
home insurer and a Massachusetts-based money management firm have 
formed a joint venture to sell stock-linked retirement saving 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate Corp, in partnership with Boston-based Putnam  
Investments, plans to begin selling in May variable annuities, a 
combination of mutual funds and insurance policies that has become 
increasingly popular with Americans as a retirement plan option. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in variable annuities has soared in the past five years  
because they let people make tax-deferred investments in the stock 
market, providing income to the buyer until death. U.S. variable 
annuity assets exceeded $700 billion at the end of last year and 
sales for the year totaled $100 billion, the Northbrook, Ill.-based 
Allstate said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the U.S. population getting older and living longer,  
variable annuities are an increasingly attractive popular 
retirement savings tool,'' said Louis G. Lower, chairman and chief 
executive of Allstate's life insurance subsidiary, which accounted 
last year for 20 percent of the company's profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Putnam's portfolio managers will oversee the mutual fund  
investments, and Allstate will manage the insurance assets. The 
products will be distributed, via Putnam's wholesaling force, 
through its partnerships with banks, broker-dealers and financial 
advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership represents a shift for Allstate away from its  
current system of selling mainly life and property-casualty 
coverage through its 15,000 agents, a core business that in recent 
years has seen slowing growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate chairman Edward Liddy said the joint venture, which has  
few startup costs, is just one step among several that may be taken 
to boost the company's bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal really is to expand our company, to get into other  
channels of distribution ... and to acquire more customers,'' Liddy 
said. ``That doesn't preclude (acquisitions) on the 
property-casualty side.''

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky May Face McDougal Subpoena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whitewater figure Susan McDougal's lawyers are  
weighing whether to subpoena Monica Lewinsky and another figure 
from the impeachment drama to testify at her upcoming trial on 
charges of obstructing the Whitewater investigation, sources 
familiar with her case say. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move would likely draw public interest to Mrs. McDougal's  
trial, set to begin next week in Little Rock, Ark., but the sources 
said they expected the trial judge would have to rule on the 
controversial idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said Mrs.  
McDougal's defense team is discussing whether to subpoena Ms. 
Lewinsky and Julie Hiatt Steele to testify about their experiences 
with prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Both women have criticized the 
tactics of the independent counsel investigating President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, a former business partner of Clinton and his  
wife, Hillary, is to be tried in federal court on criminal contempt 
and obstruction of justice charges for refusing to cooperate with 
Starr in the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said subpoenas have not yet been requested from U.S.  
District Judge George Howard Jr., who is overseeing the trial, but 
that Starr's office was aware of the defense team's idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Independent Counsel Jackie Bennett said Tuesday he could  
not comment on the matter. Attorney Mark Geragos, who represents 
Mrs. McDougal, also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Summoning Ms. Lewinsky could transform Mrs. McDougal's trial  
from a sideshow in the long-running Whitewater investigation to a 
major event. Mrs. McDougal's lawyers probably would have to show 
that Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Steele have testimony directly relevant 
to the alleged offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, who along with her late ex-husband, James, formed  
the Whitewater land venture with the Clintons, is charged with 
defying a judge's order and refusing to answer Starr's questions 
before a federal grand jury investigating Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal has repeatedly said she refused to answer Starr's  
questions because she did not trust the prosecutor, a Republican, 
and believes Starr has waged a vendetta against the Clintons. She 
has said she believed Starr would prosecute her if she failed to 
deliver damaging evidence against the Clintons, adding that she 
knows of no illegal acts by the first family. 
</P>
<P>
	But her former husband, a longtime Clinton supporter who  
defended the first family for years, reversed course a year and a 
half before his death and testified that the president and first 
lady were involved in wrongdoing in their Arkansas business 
dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said Mrs. McDougal's legal team would like to use  
testimony from Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Steele to argue that their 
experiences bore out their client's fears about cooperating with 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky has alleged that Starr's prosecutors, during their  
initial encounter with her, threatened her with prosecution if she 
refused to cooperate against the president, kept her at a hotel for 
hours and urged her not to call her lawyer. Ms. Lewinsky also 
alleges they urged her to wear a body wire to try to implicate 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of tortuous negotiations, the former White House  
intern struck a deal to cooperate with Starr in exchange for 
immunity from prosecution, but she harbors bitterness toward him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele was charged earlier this year with three counts of  
obstruction of justice and one of making a false statement for 
providing testimony that cast doubt on her former friend Kathleen 
Willey's allegation that Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr alleged he has evidence showing Ms. Steele made up her  
account.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Imports of Wine Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Move over, sake. The Japanese, encouraged by  
affordable foreign brands and reports of health benefits, are 
guzzling imported wine in record amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Wine imports more than doubled in 1998 to reach all-time highs  
both in terms of volume, 88.5 million gallons, and value, $1.4 
billion, the Tokyo Customs Office says. 
</P>
<P>
	France was the top exporter, with 29.1 million gallons, for a  
32.9 percent market share. Next were Italy, with 14.7 percent and 
Chile with 9.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States was fourth, with 6.6 million gallons for a  
market share of 7.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Wine sales have been climbing steadily since 1994, but a real  
boost came in late 1997 with reports that wine, particularly red, 
could play a role in preventing hardening of the arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Red wine-producing countries have benefited. Imports of French  
wine more than tripled between 1994 and 1998, and sales of Chilean 
wine, among the most affordable of foreign brands, jumped by nearly 
17 times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese still have a way to go, however, before matching  
the wine-drinking habits of the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Per capita consumption is around a half gallon a year in Japan --  
compared to 16.4 gallons in France, 15.6 gallons in Italy and 1.8 
gallons in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Weapons Monitors Urged for Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal research laboratories have been asked  
to speed up development of more sophisticated systems for detecting 
chemical and biological agents, so they can be in place during the 
next Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've challenged our national laboratories to complete this  
important system by 2002 -- in time to make it available for use at 
the Olympics in Salt Lake City,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said the rapid detection of a release of chemical or  
biological agents by terrorists ``could turn a medical nightmare 
into a manageable problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to the National Press Club, Richardson said he was  
confident researchers at the federal labs will be able to develop 
within three years biological agent detectors ``small enough to fit 
into the hand of a fireman or a cop that tells within seconds if a 
chem-bio agent is present.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently such detection equipment normally fills a room in a  
laboratory and often takes days to fully analyze the agent. 
Researchers have developed an instrument the size of a suitcase 
that can analyze a biological agent within hours. 
</P>
<P>
	But Richardson said more research on even smaller equipment and  
faster analysis is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wants the labs to ``demonstrate and deliver the first  
phase of a biological detection system -- an integrated network of 
sensors and analytical software in time for use at the next Winter 
Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Rogue countries, terrorists and the suppliers of the nuclear,  
biological and chemical tools of their trade are using increasingly 
sophisticated means to evade detection,'' he warned. ``Our methods 
and technology must outpace this growing threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he also had directed the labs to expand  
cooperation in nuclear proliferation detection efforts. He 
announced creation of a Nuclear Proliferation Data Exploitation 
Center through which experts would share information on nuclear 
proliferation and make it available to U.S. intelligence agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration asked Congress for $32 million for the next  
fiscal year, an increase of nearly 70 percent, for chemical and 
biological defense programs, he said.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Cutting Rate of Delirium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A few simple training steps for staff helped doctors cut the the  
rate of delirium among elderly hospital patients by 40 percent, 
researchers reported today in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the steps were making sure patients get enough fluids,  
taking them for walks and keeping them mentally active. Staff were 
trained to recognize and counteract the danger signs before 
confusion, agitation and hallucinations set in. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to delirium, prevention is considered crucial,  
because the condition may not be entirely reversible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once delirium occurs, the cat is kind of out of the bag,''  
said Dr. Sharon Inouye, a professor of medicine and geriatrics at 
the Yale University School of Medicine who led the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Delirium hits more than 2.3 million elderly hospital patients a  
year, adding up to $4 billion a year to Medicare and increasing the 
costs of rehabilitation and home care after patients leave, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She studied 852 patients at Yale-New Haven Hospital who were at  
least 70 and had risk factors such as severe illness, trouble 
thinking or seeing, or signs of kidney trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	A nurse, several specialists and volunteers were trained to  
recognize and treat danger signs such as immobility, dehydration, 
and trouble thinking, sleeping, seeing or hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, patients with trouble sleeping would get warm milk  
or herbal tea at bedtime, relaxation tapes or music, and back 
massage. Nurses would use vibrating beepers and silent pill 
crushers to keep the ward quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-four of the patients who didn't get the special treatment  
became delirious, compared with 42 in the treatment group -- or 15 
percent vs. 9.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The program cost about $327 per patient.  
</P>
<P>
	The length and cost of their hospital stays were not affected.  
Inouye said she is following the cases to see whether the lower 
rate of delirium translated into better health -- and lower expenses 
-- in the year after the hospital stay. 
</P>
<P>
	At Yale-New Haven, the board was so impressed with the program  
that it made it permanent, and it now serves more than 800 elderly 
patients a year.

<HEADLINE> RJR To Clarify Some Cigarette Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ads for Winston ``no additives'' cigarettes  
will carry a disclaimer saying they are no safer to smoke than 
other cigarettes, under a proposed agreement announced Wednesday by 
federal regulators who claim the ads are misleading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission had charged that ads by R.J.  
Reynolds Tobacco Co. implied the Winston cigarettes are safer to 
smoke because they contain no additives. The FTC, which regulates 
advertising, called the marketing deceptive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, there's no such thing as 'Safe Smoke,''' said Jodie  
Bernstein, the FTC's director of consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, RJR agreed to include a disclosure in its  
ads that states: ``No additives in our tobacco does NOT mean a 
safer cigarette.'' The disclosure must appear in a rectangular box 
40 percent the size of the Surgeon General's cigarette health 
warning and in a clear and prominent location. Reynolds would also 
instruct its sales representatives to place a disclosure on any ads 
in stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission voted 4-0 to accept the proposed agreement.  
Commissioner Orson Swindle said he was convinced that ``many 
consumers interpret ads containing express 'no additive' claims to 
mean that Winston's are not as harmful as other cigarettes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swindle also noted the ``unusually extensive'' nationwide  
campaign launched by Winston in August of 1997 to promote the ``no 
additives'' cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds disputed the notion that consumers equate ``no  
additives'' with safer cigarettes. The company said it has never 
made a direct or implied claim in its marketing materials that the 
products are less hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
	``We disagree with the FTC's premise, and our own research  
demonstrated that smokers do not interpret the phrases to mean that 
Winston is safe or safer than other cigarettes,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Carole Crosslin stressed that RJR has publicly said  
it does not believe the risks associated with smoking are reduced 
with ``no additives'' cigarettes. The disclosure reflects the 
company's position on the issue, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed settlement, Reynolds must include the  
disclosure in all advertising for Winston no-additive cigarettes, 
regardless of whether the advertising contains a ``no additive'' 
claim, for a period of one year beginning no later than July 15, 
1999. After that, Reynolds must include the disclosure in all 
products that it represents as having no additives. 
</P>
<P>
	Public health groups had asked the FTC to investigate R.J.  
Reynolds' ad campaign in 1997, after the company reformulated its 
Winston brand to remove all additives. On Wednesday, the groups 
applauded the settlement, calling it an important first step in 
cracking down on deceptive cigarette ads. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR ``has had a long history of engaging in this sort of  
behavior,'' said John Garrison, who heads the American Lung 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure is not required if Reynolds has scientific  
evidence showing that ``no additive'' cigarettes pose lower health 
risks than other cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed agreement is subject to a 60-day comment period  
before the FTC decides whether to make it final.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced in S.C. KKK Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A Ku Klux Klan member was sentenced to 26 1/2  
years in prison Wednesday for his role in a nightclub shooting that 
wounded three black teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton Edward Spires Jr., 28, apologized for the shooting and  
condemned the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish people would stay out of this organization and put an  
end to it,'' Spires said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spires and Joshua England, 20, had attended a Confederate flag  
rally in October 1996 and were driving and drinking later in the 
day when they came upon a crowd of mostly black individuals outside 
Club Illusion in Pelion. 
</P>
<P>
	England admitted last year that he fired a rifle 11 times into  
the crowd while Spires drove. He was sentenced to nearly 26 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Spires could face further punishment.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said he may still be charged with perjury and  
obstruction of justice for testimony he gave in a previous Klan 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Horace King, grand dragon of the Christian Knights in South  
Carolina, was ordered by a jury last year to pay $8 million for 
inciting Klansmen to torch a predominantly black church. 
</P>
<P>
	Spires testified at the trial that King suggested to him the  
idea of shooting up a black nightclub. Spires later admitted he 
lied. King has repeatedly said he does not encourage violence by 
Klansmen.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Soar / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks soared today as investors were cheered  
by a decline in interest rates and a falling yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 249.30 points,  
or 1.79 percent, to close at 14,170.36. On Tuesday, the average 
closed down 300.69 points, or 2.11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar jumped to 121.18 yen in late afternoon trading, up  
1.10 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and higher than its late New 
York level of 120.23 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rose after the central bank drove Japan's already super  
low short term interest rates to nearly zero by flooding the 
interbank loan market with cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The call rate, which big banks use when they make overnight  
loans to each other, fell to as low as 0.02 percent, from 0.07 
percent the day before. Other interest rates, including those for 
long term bonds, fell in line. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower rates were welcomed by the stock market, where  
investors had worried that a recent rise in interest rates would 
erode corporate profits by raising borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the weakening yen boosted exporter stocks  
because Japanese products are more competitive abroad when the yen 
falls. 
</P>
<P>
	By the close of trading the Nikkei had nearly recovered from its  
big decline Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday's drop was overdone,'' said Kazuhiro Nomura, head of  
trading at Paribas Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 7.73 points, or 0.71 percent, to 1,099.81 
points. The TOPIX closed down 15.73 points, or 1.42 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the main section fell to 395.30 million shares, from  
457.38 million shares Tuesday. Rising shares outnumbered declines 
691 to 411, while 195 issues finished the day unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the falling Japanese interest rates pulled  
the yen lower against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining interest rates could lower the return to investors on  
everything from bank deposits to government bonds. A country's 
currency often falls when interest rates do on the theory that some 
investors will pull their money out of the county to seek higher 
returns elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	After trading as low as 119.88 yen in the morning, the dollar  
surged to as high as 121.30 yen in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at 132.25 yen, up from 131.08 yen late  
Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.690 percent from Tuesday's finish of 
1.805 percent, driving its price up to 100.88 yen from 99.96 yen.

<HEADLINE> IRS Warns About Refund Hoax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service is warning  
taxpayers about a scam in which people falsely are led to believe 
they can deduct from their income taxes money they have paid into 
Social Security through payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS already has blocked 1,100 such refund claims around the  
country, totaling about $95 million, officials said Wednesday. 
Total income tax refunds paid out through Feb. 26 have reached 
$43.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In the scam, a taxpayer is charged a ``paperwork'' fee of $100  
plus a percentage of any refund received by someone who then 
prepares a return claiming lifetime Social Security payroll taxes 
as a deduction. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nothing more than a hoax designed to fleece the  
victims for the upfront fee,'' said Ted Brown, IRS assistant 
commissioner for criminal investigation. ``The law does not allow 
such a refund of Social Security taxes paid, and the IRS will 
contact taxpayers filing these claims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said taxpayers should question anyone who offers to  
prepare a return for a percentage of the refund or charges a fee 
that seems unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers who believe they were subjected to the scam or who  
know anything about can call the IRS at 1-800-829-1040.

	Manhunt Starts for Tourists Killers  
</P>
<P>
	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Ugandan and Rwandan soldiers set out on  
foot patrols today in a joint manhunt for the Rwandan rebels who 
hacked to death eight foreign tourists visiting a lush jungle 
famous for its rare gorillas. Two Americans, four Britons and two 
New Zealanders were killed Monday after the Congo-based Hutu rebels 
raided several tourist camps in the area made famous by the 1988 
film ``Gorillas in the Mist.'' More than a dozen foreigners were 
kidnapped in the rebels' crusade to undermine Rwanda's Tutsi-led 
government and its ally, Uganda. At least six other tourists 
escaped, but three were still missing.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is trying to build  
momentum in Congress for allowing the independent counsel law to 
expire on June 30. Congressional officials said President Clinton's 
personal attorney, Bob Bennett, would argue the administration's 
case against the Watergate-inspired law in testimony today before 
the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. The administration, 
battered by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's five-year probe, 
reversed course yesterday and announced it was withdrawing support

	AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia today sent hundreds of  
reinforcements to riot-torn Ambon Island and ordered troops not to 
take sides in fighting between Muslims and Christians. In the 
capital, Jakarta, about 2,000 Islamic students protested outside 
military headquarters, accusing soldiers of supporting Christian 
mobs. Religious clashes have claimed at least 38 lives in and 
around Ambon in the past week. About 150 people have been slain 
since the violence erupted in Maluku province, once known as the 
Spice Islands, in January. On Monday, five people were killed when 
Christians attacked worshippers at a mosque near Ambon, which is 
1,400 miles east of Jakarta.

mass grave holding hundreds of Tamil civilians killed by the army, 
the government said today. Yasntha Kodagoda, government lawyer, 
said the inquiry will be held despite the fact all courts in the 
northern city of Jaffna, near the site of the alleged grave, have 
been closed because of rebel threats. A site on the outskirts of 
Jaffna is believed to contain the bodies of 300 Tamils who

<HEADLINE> Athletics' Stairs Has New Physique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Once stocky, Matt Stairs has shed about 25 pounds  
of fat on an all-protein diet and a rigorous workout schedule. The 
reason for this offseason burst of activity is simple: He plans to 
go 20-20 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting 20 homers and 20 stolen bases are two reasons the  
Oakland Athletics outfielder put himself at the mercy of team 
strength coach Bob Alejo this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked out hard,'' Stairs said. ``Bob put me on a strict  
protein diet, we did a lot of cardiovascular every day for about 45 
minutes, then weight training for another two hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stairs, 31, is still following the routine. As proof, he held  
out a cup of foamy brown goo: a protein shake. He also eats 12 to 
14 eggs a day and about five or six chicken breasts or steaks. 
</P>
<P>
	A while back, he was still able to eat bread before noon. No  
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to like going to Burger King,'' he said, shaking his  
head. ``Now I go to Burger King and get four BK Broilers and throw 
the bread away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Stairs has lost about 25 pounds of fat and has added  
muscle, for about 9 pounds of total weight loss. He lost four 
inches from his midsection alone, prompting him to joke that he can 
now see his stomach muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I had those,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	At 5-foot-9, Stairs is now down to 206, less than he has weighed  
for most of this decade, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Stairs hit 26 home runs and stole eight bases in 11  
attempts. But he was hampered by an inflamed Achilles tendon that 
kept him mostly in a designated hitter role. He had surgery to 
correct the problem during the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight season the Canadian-born Stairs had  
more than 25 homers; in 1997, he had 27. 
</P>
<P>
	So the A's already know he can hit. They're betting the leaner  
and more determined Stairs will reach his steals goal, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matt runs better than most people give him credit for, and I  
know he worked out religiously in the offseason,'' manager Art Howe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to going 20-20, Stairs said he'd like to drive in  
100 runs and score 100 runs. And he'd like to spend more time in 
the outfield, which is where his newfound stamina comes in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I wanted to get to the point where I could play 120  
games in the outfield,'' he said. ``That's what we're shooting for: 
120 games. I figured the best way to do it was to get into top 
shape and go from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he wasn't working out, Stairs was doing what all good  
Canadians do in the winter -- watching hockey. Stairs, who now lives 
in Oakland, has season tickets to San Jose Sharks games. 
</P>
<P>
	He said being a fan was a pleasant break from his workout  
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Stairs originally wanted to play hockey, but it wasn't  
in the cards, especially after he made the Canadian Olympic 
baseball team that went to Seoul in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried out (for hockey),'' he said, letting his Canadian  
accident slip. ``But I suffered a bad knee injury and that was it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't decide to play baseball, really. I guess it was  
politics back then, they needed somebody from the East Coast to 
play on the Olympic team and I made it.''

<HEADLINE> Plan Drawn To Protect Maine Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- Remote blocks of privately owned Maine  
forest, amounting to an area bigger than Rhode Island, will be 
protected from development in a multimillion-dollar deal that lets 
the owner continue harvesting trees. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction is ``the largest single conservation easement  
ever undertaken in the United States and, we believe, in the 
world,'' Gov. Angus King said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The land is scattered through northern and western Maine in some  
of its most remote and wild regions. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes bald eagle nesting sites, one of Maine's most  
productive peregrine falcon nesting areas, more than 2,000 miles of 
frontage along lakes and rivers, and habitat for dozens of rare and 
endangered species of plants and animals, King said. 
</P>
<P>
	A family that has been a major landowner in Maine since the  
1840s is granting an option to the New England Forestry Foundation 
to purchase development rights on nearly 1,180 square miles. The 
entire state of Rhode Island covers 1,045 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
	In effect, the Pingree family is selling its right to develop  
the land for about $30 million. It retains ownership of the land 
and its trees, and will continue paying property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The private, nonprofit foundation, dedicated to protecting the  
region's working forest, said private donations will be raised to 
pay for the easement. No public money is being sought. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal won't affect public access to the land, which has  
traditionally been open to hunting, fishing and camping. Similar 
policies are followed by the paper companies that own huge areas of 
Maine forest. 
</P>
<P>
	But by keeping developers out, outdoors enthusiasts are assured  
continued access, said George Smith of the Sportsman's Alliance of 
Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we lose is when it's sold into small parcels,'' said  
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The easement bars development that is not directly associated  
with forest management, said Steve Schley of Pingree Associates 
Inc., who began working on the deal for the highly private family 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Loggers could, for example, build a sawmill while trees are  
being harvested. 
</P>
<P>
	Jym St. Pierre, Maine director of RESTORE: The North Woods,  
praised the Pingrees but said the deal falls far short of creating 
a public park as his group desires. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need is public wilderness. This is neither public nor  
wilderness,'' St. Pierre said. He also questioned whether enough 
private money will be found to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine has the lowest percentage of public land ownership of land  
in the nation, according to the State Planning Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunters, anglers and some environmental groups hailed the deal  
as a major step toward protection of the 26 million-acre Northern 
Forest that stretches across northern New England. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the Nature Conservancy bought a 286-square-mile  
tract of remote Maine forest from International Paper Co. for $35.1 
million. That land, amounting to nearly 1 percent of Maine, also is 
to be protected from development. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in December, conservation groups, private foundations,  
corporations and three state governments said they would purchase 
nearly 297,000 acres of paper company land in New York, Vermont and 
New Hampshire.

<HEADLINE> Lions Sign Ex-Redskins QB Frerotte </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Gus Frerotte, a free-agent quarterback who  
spent the past five seasons with the Washington Redskins, signed 
with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday as a backup to starter Charlie 
Batch. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Frerotte, 27, a Pro Bowler for Washington in 1996, was released  
by the Redskins last month. The Redskins avoided paying him a $1.25 
million roster bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	At Washington, where he was a seventh-round draft choice in 1994  
from Tulsa, he started 45 games, including one last season when he 
lost his starting job to Trent Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Over his career, the 6-foot-3, 240-pound Frerotte was  
744-of-1,422 for 9,769 yards and 48 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're delighted to have Gus Frerotte in our program,'' Lions  
coach Bobby Ross said Wednesday. ``As we approached the offseason, 
one of our priorities was to sign a backup quarterback who has 
started and won in the NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frerotte is expected to be the backup to starter Charlie Batch.  
</P>
<P>
	Also on Wednesday, the Lions announced the signings of free  
agents Paul Spicer, a defensive end; Dwayne Morgan, a guard; and 
Cory Sauter, a quarterback.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan'' won  
best picture and Terrence Malick (``The Thin Red Line'') won best 
director honors at the Chicago Film Critics Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg paid homage to movie critic Gene Siskel, who died last  
month. Siskel and TV partner Roger Ebert used the power of 
television for the better ``and have done a remarkable thing for 
the motion pictures,'' Spielberg said in accepting his award 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebert toasted the Spielberg in return, noting that some  
filmmakers appeal to mass audiences while others strive for high 
art, but few achieve both in the same film. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our winner tonight has done that,'' said Ebert.  
</P>
<P>
	British stage veteran Ian McKellen won best actor for his role  
in ``Gods and Monsters,'' an account of the final days of British 
film director James Whale. 
</P>
<P>
	Cate Blanchett won best actress for her portrayal of Queen  
Elizabeth in the film ``Elizabeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Bates won best supporting actress for her role as the  
eccentric political fixer in ``Primary Colors,'' while Billy Bob 
Thornton won best supporting actor for his work in ``A Simple 
Plan.''

<HEADLINE> Sharpton Arrested at Diallo Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Minutes after promising civil disobedience until  
the police officers who killed an unarmed man last month are 
brought to justice, the Rev. Al Sharpton and 10 supporters were 
arrested Wednesday for blocking traffic near Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was charged with disorderly conduct after they sat  
down at a busy intersection. Sharpton had just finished speaking at 
a rally in front of the nearby New York Stock Exchange that drew 
about 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpton was cheered as he was led into a police van. All of the  
protesters were released after being issued summonses. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was protesting the shooting death of Amadou Diallo on  
Feb. 4. Four officers who fired 41 bullets at Diallo have yet to be 
questioned in the shooting and remain on desk duty. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury is hearing evidence in the case.

<HEADLINE> Wisc.-Milwaukee Hoops Coach Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Ric Cobb was fired Wednesday as coach of the  
Wisconsin-Milwaukee men's basketball team after failing to post a 
winning season in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Men's basketball is our flagship sport,'' athletic director  
Bud Haidet said. ``It's imperative to the overall athletic program 
that our men's basketball team be successful. I feel a change in 
the coaching staff is needed to accomplish our goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haidet said a search for Cobb's replacement was under way and he  
hoped to have a replacement as early as April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb, whose coaching contract expires at month's end, was  
reassigned to director of community outreach, a new job in the 
athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I really don't know what the reassignment is. I  
mean, this was all done in a five-minute period,'' Cobb said by 
phone from his home. ``They brought me in and told me I'd been 
reassigned and the athletic director told me how much he liked me 
and they went through the reassignment papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a done deal when I went in the meeting. I didn't have a  
say-so in anything,'' Cobb said. ``So, I don't know what I'm going 
to do at this stage. I'm still working at UWM, and I'll look at 
some options if anything comes up. I don't know if I want to stay 
in coaching or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb, who was 28-81 in four seasons, said his successor will  
reap the benefits of a slowly revitalized program that is poised to 
succeed under juniors-to-be Chad Angeli, Damion Ninkovic and Jared 
Hardwick. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great situation for somebody coming behind me because  
this team should be the MCC champions next year,'' Cobb said. ``I 
felt the team was turning the corner. ... It's a shame I won't be 
there to lead them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers finished 8-19 this season after losing to  
Wisconsin-Green Bay in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference 
tournament, in which Cobb's teams went 0-4.

<HEADLINE> Feds Tackle Major Antitrust Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- During the 1980s, a declawed Federal Trade  
Commission would have been unlikely to take on a high-profile 
antitrust case against one of the world's biggest technology 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But in just a week, the commission will face off against Intel  
Corp. in the other major computer-courtroom drama unfolding in 
Washington -- bringing it out from behind the shadow of its sister 
federal antitrust agency, the Justice Department, and its case 
against Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-stakes Intel case is indicative of the changing tide at  
the commission, which almost doubled its antitrust enforcement 
actions from 1997 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	With an aggressive leadership and buoyed by some large  
victories, the commission in recent years has vigorously exercised 
the authority given it by the 1976 Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust 
Improvements Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``The principal reason is not our doing but the world's doing,''  
said Robert Pitofsky, the commission's chairman. ``The behavior by 
some firms really raises antitrust questions more frequently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, a wave of mergers has swept the nation in the past few  
years. More than $1 trillion in mergers occurred in fiscal year 
1998, and nearly 4,800 requests were filed by companies to have 
merger proposals reviewed by antitrust agencies as required by law. 
That is a 28 percent increase from previous years' filings. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, many believe the FTC has been newly aggressive in  
using its antitrust power and in grabbing headlines from Justice, 
harkening back to the 1960s, when it argued many antitrust cases 
before the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Intel case was probably filed in part to say, `Hey, look  
at us! We're here, too, and we can enforce the same laws,''' said 
Bill Shughart, a University of Mississippi economics professor. 
Shughart, who worked at the FTC in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
said he couldn't imagine the commission at that time bringing a 
similar complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission alleges that Intel illegally withheld from three  
companies technical information about its new generation of 
computer chips to ``extort'' valuable technology that the companies 
developed independently. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., makes 
chips that run 80 percent of world's computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts attribute a good part of the agency's new gusto to  
Pitofsky, a lawyer sworn in as commissioner in 1995. In 1994, 
Pitofsky chaired a Pentagon advisory panel to address whether the 
defense industry should be granted antitrust exemptions as it 
downsized in the post-Cold War era. The task force recommended 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman is the first to admit that mergers are not  
intrinsically harmful but rather the inevitable consequence of 
economic globalization, deregulation and an increase in the 
importance of high-tech industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's probably a sensible response to some changes that  
are going on,'' Pitofsky said. ``But independent deals can be very 
much of a threat to consumer welfare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the FTC and Justice both embroiled in big computer cases,  
the fine line that distinguishes the two agencies seems a bit 
blurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally there has been a gentleman's agreement between the  
two agencies not to compete to file lawsuits against the same firms 
at the same time,'' said Shughart. An agency might opt for a case 
based on workload or prior expertise: Airline mergers tend to end 
up at Justice, gasoline companies at the FTC. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies with mergers of a certain size must inform both  
agencies. Historically, the assistant attorney general of the 
antitrust division -- currently Joel Klein -- and the FTC chairman 
chat by phone to determine jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has handled probably two-thirds of all mergers, because  
it has broader jurisdiction on civil matters, said Robert Burka, a 
private antitrust expert. In contrast, Justice can bring criminal 
cases and the FTC can't. 
</P>
<P>
	After its period of vigilant regulation in the 1960s, the FTC in  
the late 1970s moved away from traditional antitrust cases and 
focused instead on trying to stop states from using legislation to 
create monopolies, said Don Boudreaux, president of the Foundation 
for Economic Education in Irvington, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the early 1990s, the commission started to accelerate its  
activity in mergers and predatory pricing, producing a string of 
successes: 
</P>
<P>
	--Staples and Office Depot in July of 1997 called off their $3.5  
billion merger after the commission got a court injunction arguing 
the deal would reduce competition and lead to higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rite Aid Corp. dropped a $1.8 billion deal with Revco in 1996  
after the FTC said Rite Aid would gain too much of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitofsky concedes some deals can create efficiencies that could  
benefit consumers. He cites the alliance between Chrysler Corp. and 
Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, approved in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``We became fairly persuaded there were true efficiencies in  
putting together the two companies,'' Pitofsky said.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Sen. Not Running for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Sen. Fred Thompson says he will not run  
for president in 2000 and will support his fellow Tennessean, 
former Gov. Lamar Alexander, in the race for the Republican 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said yesterday that his Senate workload will preclude a  
run for the White House and he thinks it would be impractical for 
three men from Tennessee to be in the race. Vice President Al Gore 
is expected to seek the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander plans to formally announce his candidacy Tuesday in  
Nashville and Thompson said that encouraged him to rule out his own 
race now. He said he supports Alexander because ``he has a basic 
conservative message, but he's moderate in temperament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had ``never been on the verge'' of running for  
president despite media speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it hadn't been for his announcement coming up, I'd probably  
just kind of let it die a natural death,'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was elected to the Senate in 1994 to fill the remaining  
two years of Gore's seat after Gore was elected vice president. He 
was elected in 1996 to a full six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	He was minority counsel for the Senate Watergate Committee in  
the 1970s, and later became an actor in movies such as ``The Hunt 
for Red October'' and ``In the Line of Fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said he was surprised when ``a lot of people ... from  
various parts of the country'' had encouraged him to run, adding he 
thought ``I should not dismiss this out of hand, and I didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now these are uncertain times. People may be more in the  
mood for caretaker government than any bold initiatives right now 
for a while.''

<HEADLINE>  Expos, Quebec in Money Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUEBEC (AP) -- The Expos' future in Montreal grew more uncertain  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Quebec government held to its refusal to use tax money to  
build a new downtown ballpark, and managing partner Claude Brochu 
said the team can survive only with government help. 
</P>
<P>
	Quebec finance minister Bernard Landry said province's stand had  
not changed: no tax money for professional sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who earn $50,000 a year don't want to see their taxes  
used to make life easier for people who earn millions of dollars a 
month,'' Landry said. ``There are economic spinoffs (to baseball), 
but that isn't the determining factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't like increasing Quebec's industrial base with  
aluminum plants. There can't be a solution that is hard on 
taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Landry said the government is confident it had public backing  
for its refusal to get involved financially in the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not news Brochu wanted to hear.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a really tough situation, make no mistake about it,''  
he said at the club's training camp in Jupiter, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu said government money is essential.  
</P>
<P>
	``To be able to compete with American cities, where on average  
public support for stadia is in the area of 80 percent, you can't 
ask Canadian teams to build their own buildings, worry about 
foreign exchange, worry about municipal taxes, worry about sales 
taxes, worry about any number of any other things and be 
competitive,'' Brochu said. ``It's impossible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Lucien Bouchard and Prime Minister Jean Chretien have  
said they can't help sports teams, although the federal government 
reportedly is willing to turn over the proposed downtown stadium 
site for $1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos were told by major league baseball to have a new  
ownership group and stadium financing in place by March 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials said that after that date, Brochu has the  
right to move the Expos out of Montreal ``in the best interests of 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what will happen after the deadline, Brochu said it was up  
to major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said the Expos definitely will be in Montreal this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu said that he needs a two-thirds vote of the partnership  
to sell the club. But a two-thirds vote doesn't force him as 
general partner to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos' attendance reached a high of 2,208,175 in 1980. Last  
season, attendance as 914,717.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smoking Pill Said To Top Patch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In the first head-to-head comparison, the anti-smoking drug  
Zyban proved twice as good as the nicotine patch in helping people 
kick the habit, and both together were even more effective. 
</P>
<P>
	Used together, they helped more than 35 percent of smokers stay  
off cigarettes for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The patch had disappointing results, working no better than a  
dummy pill or patch. But the researchers themselves disagreed over 
whether the findings were a fluke, since other studies have shown 
the patch works. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, led by Dr. Douglas Jorenby of the University of  
Wisconsin Medical School's Center for Tobacco Research and 
Intervention, was reported in Thursday's New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Using both methods at the same time was especially effective in  
helping people prevent weight gain during the first seven weeks. 
Those using both the patch and Zyban put on about 2.4 pounds, 
compared with 3.6 for either method alone and 4.6 on placebos, or 
dummy treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people say the fear of gaining weight stops them from  
even trying to quit smoking or can sabotage them early in the 
process,'' Jorenby said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 46 million Americans smoke, and it will eventually kill  
half of them, at a rate of about 400,000 a year. Three-quarters of 
smokers want to quit, but at most 5 percent manage to do so on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyban is the brand name for the antidepressant bupropion. Since  
Zyban was approved in 1997 as the first non-nicotine product to 
help smokers quit, doctors have written 4 million prescriptions for 
it, according to Glaxo Wellcome Inc., the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very high success rate with bupropion is extremely  
encouraging,'' said Dr. Alan Leshner, director of the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse. Adding behavioral treatment to the mix 
should bring even more success, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaxo Wellcome paid for the study. Jorenby has organized  
presentations for Glaxo Wellcome. Seven of the 11 other researchers 
also have worked for Glaxo Wellcome, Novartis -- which made the 
patches studied -- or a competitor in the quit-smoking business. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a habit of at least 15 cigarettes a day to qualify for  
the study. Smokers who were depressed were turned down. All 893 
participants got patches to stick on and pills to take, but some of 
the patches and pills were dummies. 
</P>
<P>
	After four weeks, the patch had significantly better results  
than the placebo. Buproprion alone was more effective than the 
patch, and both treatments were better yet. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year, more than 35 percent of the people getting both  
treatments were still not smoking, compared with about 30 percent 
of those on bupropion alone. But only 16.4 percent of those on the 
patch were smoke-free, compared with 15.6 percent of those whose 
used placebo patches and pills. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorenby said the finding was a fluke. Other studies have shown  
about a 30 percent success rate for the patch, according to Dr. 
Neal Benowitz of the University of California at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who failed on nicotine once don't do very well if you  
re-treat with nicotine. My guess is that a fair number of people 
had tried a nicotine patch or nicotine gum before,'' Benowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did include people who had used patches before, but  
there wasn't any significant difference in their quit rates, said 
another of the researchers, Dr. Michael Fiore, director of the 
tobacco research center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the difference between bupropion and the patch is a  
real one,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Sante Fe Bus Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Two people were killed and more than 30  
injured when a bus carrying elementary school students home from a 
ski outing crashed and overturned on a narrow canyon road. 
</P>
<P>
	One child and one adult died Tuesday after being thrown through  
the windshield just outside Santa Fe, Sheriff Ray Sisneros said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of students walking along the roadway. They  
were bleeding and crying and frantic,'' said Whitney Russell, who 
came upon the scene moments after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were scared,'' said Kevin Henson of the Santa Fe County  
Fire Department. ``They were saying, `Call my Mom.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Katherine Eagleson, whose 11-year-old son was hurt in the crash,  
said the boy described children being tossed around inside the 
vehicle ``like a box of marbles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dead were identified as Eric Garcia, 11, and Gary Apodaca,  
44, an adult chaperone. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus that crashed was one of three that was carrying students  
from six local elementary schools back from the Santa Fe Ski Area. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-three people were treated for injuries; one remained in  
critical condition late Tuesday and three were in serious 
condition. Many were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus driver, Robert Heusner, told investigators the brakes  
had failed, Sisneros said. But the owner of the bus company, Ray 
Sena, said his fleet had new brakes installed only two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus went up onto an embankment and struck a large rock  
before overturning, sheriff's Capt. Terry Delgado said.

<HEADLINE> US Seeks Funds for Embassy Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department wants to spend close to  
$300 million next year to improve security at American embassies 
around the world. Some Republicans on Capitol Hill say that's not 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``The department's inability or refusal to accelerate  
construction of safer embassies leaves us vulnerable to additional 
attacks from terrorists interested in making political 
statements,'' Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., said at a hearing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Undersecretary of State Bonnie R. Cohen, who oversees management  
issues, acknowledged that 80 percent of U.S. embassies have been 
built too close to the street ``and are in need of substantial 
security improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The state of disrepair of many of our buildings overseas is  
shocking,'' Cohen said at a hearing of the House International 
Relations subcommittee overseeing operations. 
</P>
<P>
	She cited problems at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, where she  
said sewer gas leaks through the building. She pointed out that 
non-Americans also are endangered by inadequate conditions, noting 
that most of the 250 people killed and 5,500 wounded in the U.S. 
embassy bombing in Nairobi were Kenyans. 
</P>
<P>
	That bombing and another one in Tanzania at the same time last  
August prompted the stepped-up concern for embassy security. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's concerns followed similar objections to the  
administration approach by Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., last month, who 
said the administration should be spending about $700 million more, 
for a total of $1 billion next year increasing embassy security. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith suggested more aggressive pursuit of a $3 billion plan to  
step up protection over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly,'' said Smith, ``I am concerned that the cost of this  
delay could be measured in the lives of Americans and other 
innocent people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He challenged the administration to come up with a revised plan  
for protecting 122 diplomatic missions and said he would help see 
that actions are fully funded. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, testifying at a Senate  
hearing last month, said every embassy is under threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen's testimony Tuesday included a summary of steps taken to  
improve the safety of embassies since the bombings, including:

<HEADLINE> Duke's Battier Plans To Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- No. 1 Duke's chances of winning the  
Atlantic Coast Conference tournament already looked pretty good. 
They got even better Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Battier, whose severely sprained left ankle kept him out  
of the Blue Devils' regular-season finale, went through a one-hour 
practice at full speed Wednesday night and reported no problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring any overnight complications from pain or swelling,  
Battier said he expected to be on the floor Thursday night when the 
Blue Devils (29-1) meet Virginia (14-15) in a first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's safe to say I'll play,'' Battier said.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Krzyzewski wasn't ready to pronounce Battier  
completely recovered but said he was impressed with how the 
sophomore forward looked in the spirited workout at the Charlotte 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was very encouraging,'' Krzyzewski said.  
</P>
<P>
	The coach said he would not start Battier but would use him  
according to feel. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's feeling good and I'm feeling good,'' Krzyzewski said,  
``he'll play a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Battier said he had planned to practice on a limited basis  
Wednesday night, but the ankle felt so good early in the session 
that he decided to keep testing it. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the session ended, Battier had worked up a good  
sweat by taking part in all the team drills. He dunked several 
times, hit a number of 3-pointers, set some picks, made some solid 
plays on defense and ran the floor well, looking all the while like 
he wasn't bothered by the high ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Battier appeared much more at ease than Krzyzewski, who  
is scheduled for hip replacement surgery as soon as the season 
ends. Krzyzewski limped around the practice floor and alternately 
leaned on the scorer's table or sat on the Duke bench to rest the 
sore hip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just can't move around well,'' he said, breaking into a wide  
smile. ``But it doesn't hurt my thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Battier put an ice bag on his ankle after practice, a move he  
called nothing more than standard procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really kind of surprised at how good it felt,'' he said.  
``As the practice went along, I decided to do more and more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's good news for a team that just completed an unprecedented  
16-0 run through the ACC and has won 24 games in a row. Battier is 
one of the nation's best defenders, as evidenced by his 
team-leading 30 charges taken and 53 blocks, second only to center 
Elton Brand's 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Battier, the Blue Devils closed the regular season with  
a 20-point victory over North Carolina last Saturday. Battier's 
replacement, freshman Corey Maggette, had 14 points and 11 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys on this team are real competitive,'' point guard William  
Avery said. ``Shane's probably looking at it like he can't let this 
guy come in and take his job.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Declares Victory in Feb. Sweeps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC has come out on top during the crucial  
February ``sweeps'' period, helped by the strength of its Thursday 
night schedule and popular miniseries like ``The '60s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight's interview of Monica Lewinsky by Barbara Walters on ABC  
isn't expected to change the standings even though it is counted 
for sweeps, a key ratings period used to set local advertising 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's victory came despite losing last week's prime-time ratings  
race to CBS, Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Through Sunday night, NBC had a 10.1 rating and 16 share for the  
month, CBS was second at 9.8 and 16, ABC had an 8.2 and 13, Fox had 
a 7.1 and 11, the WB had a 3.5 and 5 and UPN was at 2.1 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC Entertainment President Scott Sassa said the surge in  
viewership on certain nights over the last few weeks was good news 
for all networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you provide good programming, you can certainly increase  
the network shares,'' he said. ``We think the networks are really 
in a good position right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Moonves, president and chief executive of CBS Television,  
congratulated NBC but also took a swipe at his competitor, saying 
NBC relied on a ``great amount of stunting'' to win sweeps. He 
referred to the successful miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa said NBC, unlike CBS, stuck to the schedule it set at the  
start of the year and didn't rely on any last-minute 
reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC and Fox were both down in comparison with November sweeps,  
but that could change for ABC. ``It ain't over until the intern 
sings,'' quipped ABC Entertainment President Stu Bloomberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Big events proved successful for the networks last week. CBS's  
airing of the Grammy Awards, while down slightly from last year, 
was the fourth most-watched show of the week behind the NBC 
Thursday night troika of ``ER,'' ``Frasier'' and ``Friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part one of NBC's ``Alice in Wonderland'' finished sixth for the  
week for NBC, although its ratings couldn't quite match the level 
of last May's ``Merlin.'' ABC was successful with its Sonny and 
Cher TV movie, ``And the Beat Goes On,'' and CBS hit with ``Too 
Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, CBS had a 10.6 rating and 17 share, the highest  
weekly rating for a network this year excluding Super Bowl week. 
NBC had a 10.0 and 16, ABC had an 8.2 and 13 and Fox had a 7.6 and 
12. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 3.5 rating and 5  
share, UPN had a 1.9 rating and 3 share and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' dominated the evening news competition  
with a 9.0 rating and 18 share, its widest margin over CBS in 
nearly two years and over ABC in one year. ABC's ``World News 
Tonight'' had an 8.1 rating and 16 share and the ``CBS Evening 
News'' was at 7.5 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Feb. 22-28, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 20.2; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 17.7; 
``Friends,'' NBC, 17.6; ``The Grammy Awards,'' CBS, 16.6; 
``Jesse,'' NBC, 15.0; ``NBC Sunday Night Movie: Alice in 
Wonderland,'' NBC, 14.8; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 14.3; 
``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 14.2; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 14.1; 
``Home Improvement,'' ABC, 12.9.

<HEADLINE> Search on for Killers of Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Ugandan and Rwandan soldiers set out on  
foot patrols today in a manhunt for the Rwandan rebels who hacked 
to death eight foreign tourists visiting a jungle famous for its 
rare gorillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Americans, four Britons and two New Zealanders were killed  
Monday after the Congo-based Hutu rebels raided tourist camps in 
the area made famous by the 1988 film ``Gorillas in the Mist.'' 
More than a dozen foreigners were kidnapped in the rebels' crusade 
to undermine Rwanda's Tutsi-led government and its ally, Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	At least six other tourists escaped, but three were still  
missing. Their nationalities were not known. 
</P>
<P>
	Ugandan and Rwandan soldiers joined forces today in pursuit of  
the rebels responsible for the slaughter. At a news conference 
today, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said his government would 
capture or kill the insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't catch them, we shall kill them,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Museveni said Ugandan authorities were partly responsible for  
the killings because park rangers failed to alert the military that 
there was a security problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``The park authorities should have foreseen this problem and  
asked for support,'' he said. ``We therefore regret this mistake. 
on the one hand it is the criminality of the Interahamwe (rebels) 
but on the other hand there was also laxity on our own people in 
respect to guarding these wonderful visitors of ours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Museveni and others said the killers will be chased down.  
</P>
<P>
	``They are in Congo. We're going after them,'' said Ugandan Lt.  
Charles Kakaire. ``We're trying to surround them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Ugandan commander said soldiers tracked the rebels to a  
base in Congo's Virunga National Park on Tuesday, killing some of 
the rebels as they scattered. 
</P>
<P>
	Ugandan police initially said the tourists were killed in the  
crossfire of an army rescue attempt. But Uganda's deputy chief of 
military intelligence, Noble Mayombo, told The Associated Press 
today the account ``was a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayombo, speaking at the morgue while the bodies were being  
identified, said he expected the identification process to be 
completed by this evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The written messages left on the mutilated bodies were an ugly  
warning in a place of breathtaking beauty: ``Americans and British, 
we don't want you on our land. You support our enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Ross, an American-born tour operator and pilot who was  
among the survivors, said in Kampala that the rebels rounded up 
tourists from several camps and marched them through the jungle. He 
saw five bodies, their heads crushed and bodies deeply slashed, 
with no signs of gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came across the first set of bodies. The women that we'd  
been told would be escorted back had been killed on the spot,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI team was in Uganda and that an investigation was under  
way, said Virgil Bodeen, press attache at the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebel letters to Ugandan chiefs two weeks ago warned that  
Britons and Americans would be targeted, but the threats were not 
passed on to British tour operators or diplomats, The Express 
newspaper of London reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The two dead Americans were Rob Haubner, 48, and his wife, Susan  
Miller, 42. Haubner's computer company, Oregon-based Intel Corp., 
said they were on their third trip to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of one of the four British victims, Mark Lindgren,  
23, said he graduated from university last year and was two weeks 
into a three-month tour of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Briton who was killed was identified by British media as  
Steven Roberts, 27, an amateur pilot from Edinburgh, Scotland. 
Ugandan police today identified the other two British victims as 
Martin Friend and Joan Cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	Two New Zealanders among the dead were identified as Rhonda  
Avis, 27, of Auckland, and Michelle Strathern, 26, of Timaru. Mrs. 
Avis' husband, Mark, escaped, New Zealand Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade spokesman James Funnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ugandan officials said three tourists, all men, were still  
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those kidnapped late Sunday were three Americans, six  
Britons, three people from New Zealand, an Australian and a Swiss 
woman, government officials said. Uganda said French, Danish and 
Icelandic tourists also were at the raided camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The tourists were abducted at campgrounds on the edge of Bwindi  
National Park, known as the Impenetrable Forest, the starting point 
for visitors hoping to glimpse the 320 mountain gorillas that 
remain along the border mountain's slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels are Hutu fighters who fled Rwanda after killing more  
than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus in the 
1994 genocide there. They are angry at Uganda for supporting the 
Tutsi-dominated Rwandan government, and have been carrying out 
cross-border raids from bases in eastern Congo, often ambushing 
vehicles and kidnapping or killing passengers.

<HEADLINE> Parent Held in Teacher Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A minister is accused of breaking the jaw of a  
math teacher who gave his daughter a poor grade in conduct, the 
Boston Herald reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Leonard, headmaster of the Jeremiah Burke High School,  
said the teacher tried to walk away from an argument with Dale 
Robinson, an associate minister of the Greater Love Tabernacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 35, allegedly chased the teacher and punched him in  
the head twice yesterday. Leonard said he, security officers and 
other administrators broke up the fight. Robinson then fled. 
</P>
<P>
	Math teacher Antonio Centeio, who had given Robinson's daughter  
a D-minus in conduct and effort, was treated at Massachusetts 
General Hospital and discharged. 
</P>
<P>
	``We anticipate some parents will always be concerned or  
unsatisfied around report card time,'' said Leonard. ``But in this 
case, the value system seems to be a little warped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Herald said Robinson, who is 6-foot-8 and weighs 250 pounds,  
was a basketball star at English High School in 1982 and played the 
role of the starting center for the Utah Jazz in the 1996 film 
``Celtic Pride.''

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stocks rose Wednesday on positive  
local news, with the big Tokyo market soaring on lower interest 
rates and a weaker Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose  
249.30 points, or 1.79 percent, to close at 14,170.36. On Tuesday, 
the average had lost 300.69 points, or 2.11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the currency market, the U.S. dollar jumped to 121.18 yen in  
late trading, up 1.10 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and higher 
than its late New York level of 120.23 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rose after the central bank drove Japan's already  
super-low short-term interest rates to nearly zero by flooding the 
interbank loan market with cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors who had worried that a recent rise in interest rates  
would erode corporate profits by raising borrowing costs welcomed 
the lower rates, while the weakening yen boosted exporter stocks. 
Japanese products are more competitive abroad when the yen falls. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares ended slightly higher, after seesawing  
through the afternoon session as Financial Secretary Donald Tsang 
announced a new budget that analysts said contains little good 
news. 
</P>
<P>
	Confirmation that the territory is in serious talks with Walt  
Disney Co. on building a theme park here gave the market a slight 
boost, but the lack of new measures to stimulate the property 
market quickly dampened any enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended up 8.82 points, or 0.09  
percent, at 9,922.40. The index had slumped 106.88 points Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Zoo Puts Chimps on Birth Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Zoo has had it with all the  
monkey business among the chimpanzees. 
</P>
<P>
	After the surprise birth of Toshi a month ago and tests  
confirming two more pregnancies, four of the adult female chimps at 
the zoo are being given birth control pills. 
</P>
<P>
	The mystery is that the three breeding-age males have had  
vasectomies. The oldest male, 45-year-old Toto, didn't have a 
vasectomy because he's never produced offspring or showed an 
interest in breeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other males -- 2-year-old Ripley and 4-year-old Glenn -- are  
believed to be too young to breed. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood samples from Jedeo, 20, Shaun, 10, Herrard, 9, and Glenn  
will be taken to determine paternity. They will also take a blood 
or semen sample from Toto. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't been ruled out, but it's unlikely,'' said Vicki  
Bingaman, the zookeeper who crushes the birth control pills and 
mixes it with the chimps' morning strawberry yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests show 12-year-old Gracie will likely give birth at the end  
of the month and 15-year-old Regina should deliver sometime this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we had a fail-proof method with the vasectomies.  
But the urologist who helped with these vasectomies told me that 
there is a 1 percent failure rate in humans. The rate for chimps is 
unknown,'' Dr. Cynthia Stringfield said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The zoo now has 14 chimps, 11 of them zoo-born.

<P>
 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	
</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: James Van Der Beek  
</P>
<P>
	 *Image:* James Van Der Beek first caught the public's attention  
when the coming-of-age series ``Dawson's Creek'' debuted on the WB 
network last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people may want to kill me after they hear this, but  
'Dawson's' is the first pilot I ever filmed, the first I ever 
auditioned for,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Van Der Beek was born on March 8, 1977, in  
Cheshire, Conn. He attended Cheshire Academy boarding school. 
Although he struggled with dyslexia, he won an academic scholarship 
and become a member of the National Honor Society. 
</P>
<P>
	He attended Drew University in Madison, N.J., but left school  
after winning his ``Dawson's Creek'' audition. 
</P>
<P>
	As the character Dawson Leery, Van Der Beek and his high school  
friends face the issues of sex, romance, fidelity and trust in an 
upper-middle class Massachusetts community. 
</P>
<P>
	``I laugh that Dawson has all these female fans, because I was  
just as big of a dork in high school and nobody had a crush on 
me,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Der Beek also stars in the box-office hit, ``Varsity  
Blues,'' playing a high school football player who gets the chance 
to prove himself when the school's star quarterback is hurt. The 
film is set in a fictional, football-mad Texas town. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Quote: ``There was definitely a parallel between what happens  
to me in the movie and what happened to me with 'Dawson's Creek.' 
We had a scene in a restaurant in Austin, and I had to leave 'cause 
it's a college town and people had seen me and it got around and, 
um, it got nuts.''

<HEADLINE> One Killed in Alabama Storms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLY SPRINGS, Texas (AP) -- Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes  
ripped across the South, destroying homes and knocking out power 
for thousands of people. One person was killed early today in 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	The stormy weather, boiling up along a quickly moving cold  
front, struck Texas during the evening Tuesday, with at least seven 
tornadoes reported in east Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	One tornado destroyed three houses and damaged more than 20  
others in tiny Holly Springs, about 110 miles northeast of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never heard anything that loud before,'' said resident  
Alissa Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people from the Holly Springs area were in serious  
condition today at Jasper Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	As the line of storms rolled across Alabama early today, a  
possible tornado struck Millbrook in the central part of the state, 
downing numerous trees and power lines. One man was killed in his 
sleep when a tree fell onto his home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Monroe, La., wind ripped the roof off the Ouachita Parish  
High School gymnasium, canceling a basketball game as shards of 
glass fell to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was working in the concession stand and had my back to the  
glass making change for someone,'' said Beth Long. ``I heard a loud 
noise, then someone grabbed me and pulled me down. Glass flew 
everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two people had minor injuries. The school was closed today.  
</P>
<P>
	Some 23,000 customers lost power in Louisiana. Power outages  
also were reported in central Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside Jackson, Miss., Hinds County Sheriff Malcolm McMillan  
said the aluminum roof was ripped off of a building at the penal 
farm his department operates in Raymond. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Hail an inch in diameter hammered the south side of Little Rock,  
Ark.

<HEADLINE> AIOC's Coles Urged To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian International Olympic  
Committee member Phil Coles should resign after being implicated in 
the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, the head of Melbourne's 
Commonwealth Games bid said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the interests of all Australia and indeed the sporting  
community, Mr. Coles should do the right thing and step down after 
the revelations of the $60,000 that was spent by Salt Lake City 
entertaining him,'' Ron Walker told Australian Broadcasting Corp. 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said the International Olympic Committee's guidelines  
were obscene. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're prepared to exonerate people that accept the  
largesse of the bidding city to the tune of $60,000, obviously Salt 
Lake City weren't doing that because they love Phil Coles ... 
obviously they were doing it for a reason,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For them (the IOC) to say the guidelines were met is  
ludicrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles flew to Lausanne, Switzerland last weekend to speak with a  
special IOC panel investigating the cash-for-bribes scandal 
involving Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC will recommend to either expel, reprimand or exonerate  
him for allegedly accepting money from Salt Lake officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of the investigation are expected in the next few days.  
</P>
<P>
	Coles is one of the most influential sports officials in the  
host country of the 2000 Olympics. He has always maintained he 
acted within the IOC guidelines, and threatened court action 
against the Salt Lake investigators.

<HEADLINE> Workers' E-Mail Subject to Snooping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Like e-mailing dirty jokes? Don't try sending one to Texas  
Health Resources workers. This Southwest hospital chain uses 
special software to automatically track and detect unseemly 
electronic messages exchanged by 3,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	So much for free-flowing electronic communications. In a growing  
corporate backlash against inflammatory and potentially 
incriminating messages, companies are cracking down on e-mail with 
measures that go well beyond merely issuing bureaucratic warnings 
about abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	All in all, 20 percent of companies were regularly peeking at  
e-mails last year, up from 15 percent in 1997, the American 
Management Association says. Use of technology is exploding, 
reflected by a quadrupling in sales of monitoring software last 
year at Content Technologies Inc., a Kirkland, Wash., maker. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a good reason why: A recent string of legal cases has  
underscored e-mail's power as a key prosecution weapon, raising 
concern among employers that offensive messages could become a 
legal hot potato down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronic messages helped Kenneth Starr corroborate Monica  
Lewinsky's grand jury testimony about her lurid affair with the 
president, dug out by prosecutors from Lewinsky's home desktop and 
government machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department, in its antitrust case against Microsoft  
Corp., presented scores of e-mails written by chairman Bill Gates 
and other top executives to bolster claims that Microsoft unfairly 
squeezed rivals such as software maker Netscape Communications 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Further dogging corporate legal departments, twin Supreme Court  
rulings last spring made it easier for employees to sue for sexual 
harassment in the workplace, lending libelous undertones to 
sexually explicit messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll frequently have attorneys call e-mail the smoking gun  
of the 90s,'' says Michael Overly, a Los Angeles lawyer 
specializing in electronic communications in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	It's ready artillery: Unlike written correspondence, e-mail is  
difficult to ever really delete because of the many ways it's 
stored in computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Its immediacy encourages employees to freely express themselves,  
far less thoughtfully than in a printed letter that needs to be 
signed, sealed and delivered. 
</P>
<P>
	And e-mail's popularity is exploding: About 60 million Americans  
communicate electronically, double from two years ago, says the 
Forrester Research firm of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits aren't just embarrassing; they're costly, even before  
going to trial. Defendants responding to subpoenas can spend many 
thousands of dollars retrieving old e-mails from all the places 
they are stored, including laptops, desktops and central company 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	While most companies still rely on periodic reminders that  
e-mail users stick to business, stricter measures are spreading. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1990s version of paper-shredding, Littel International  
Inc., a Chicago-area maker of factory equipment, plans to start 
this month to being routinely deleting employees' old e-mail 
messages from central computers ``so it's no longer usable against 
us,'' says Steve Chowanski, Littel's director of management 
information services. 
</P>
<P>
	E-mails stored on workers' desktops won't be erased, but Littell  
plans to monitor electronic exchanges for extra reassurance. 
</P>
<P>
	More litigious industries such as insurance, however, may not  
have the option of deleting old messages because companies are not 
allowed to toss information that might be used in on-going 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why the pre-emptive measures. In a high-profile dismissal  
last year, the Salomon Smith Barney Inc. investment firm sacked a 
respected Wall Street analyst, Dean Eberling, for allegedly sharing 
pornographic electronic messages. Eberling didn't return several 
phone calls; Salomon had no comment beyond a brief statement. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Chubb &AMP; Co. insurance firm last year fired an on-site  
consultant for transmitting proprietary information to prospective 
customers outside the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion in e-mail use has forced companies to employ  
ever-more vigilant watchdogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Health Resources three years ago licensed software from  
Content Technologies that matches taboo keywords in employees' 
outgoing and incoming e-mail against a stored list. Once alerted, 
technicians examine the message further to see if it violates 
company policy. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T Corp. wants to go one better than its current software,  
which weeds out incoming e-mails deemed offensive or part of junk 
mailings that could clog internal networks. The nation's largest 
telephone company says it is developing technology to 
``understand'' taboo e-mail phrases -- not just single words -- and 
thereby become more accurate about the mail it vetos. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to upgrading its e-mail monitoring, AT&AMP;T has  
installed software that blocks employees' access to a lengthy list 
of offensive Web sites, updated weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like smuggling at borders. You might suspect  
something is going on, but you have a feeling you will never wipe 
it out,'' AT&AMP;T spokesman Burke Stinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a tricky task. Enforcers say they try to step lightly to  
avoid seeming like an electronic Big Brother who intrudes on 
perfectly innocent exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a particular challenge at AT&AMP;T, where about 3,500  
employees are married to each other. Stinson recalls that a few 
years ago he was taken to task by AT&AMP;T investigators for exchanging 
affectionate e-mails with his wife, another AT&AMP;T public relations 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I were questioned in separate rooms and  
reprimanded. Since I was the fella who instigated the e-mail, I 
have on my record a note that says I had done this,'' Stinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, some privacy advocates say the clampdown may already  
have gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that when you enter a workplace you don't give up all  
your constitutional rights,'' said David Banistar of the Electronic 
Privacy Information Center, a Washington-based watchdog group that 
is pushing for federal legislation that would limit corporate 
prying. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are limitations as part of working there, but one  
shouldn't be subject to constant monitoring and surveillance.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seattle SuperSonics center Olden Polynice was  
fined $5,000 by the NBA on Wednesday for making an obscene gesture 
at fans after a game in Sacramento.

I'll tell you, if one of them had hit me, they were going to get

<HEADLINE> Race May Have Motivated Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND PARK, Fla. (AP) -- They were high school sweethearts, one  
black one white. The woman was shot and killed while riding in the 
man's car last month. 
</P>
<P>
	A 23-year-old man was arrested yesterday and charged with the  
black woman's killing, described by police as a possible hate 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some remarks made at a bar prior to him leaving the  
night of the shooting, that he was going to go out and shoot a 
black person,'' Lt. Glenn Osani said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jody J. Bailey, 20, was killed Feb. 24 when the driver of  
another car pulled up next to the car she was riding in and fired 
at least five rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	She was hit in the temple and pronounced dead at the hospital.  
Her fiance, Christian Martin, 20, was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Robert R. Boltuch of Sunrise at a friend's house  
on Tuesday, Osani said. He was not armed and did not resist arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Boltuch, 23, who had been working as a waiter until the  
shooting, was booked at the Broward County Jail on charges of 
first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin and Bailey were high school sweethearts who'd dated for  
three years. Both were students at Florida Atlantic University. 
</P>
<P>
	Osani said the State Attorney's Office will make a decision on  
whether or not to charge Boltuch with a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I emphasize the fact that the race aspect is still only a  
possible motive,'' Osani said. 
</P>
<P>
	A hate crime classification upgrades the possible penalties if  
there are convictions. First-degree murder in Florida can result in 
a death sentence.

<HEADLINE> Boat Deaths Prompt Safety Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The commercial fishing industry is ranked the most  
dangerous industry in America, a grim distinction highlighted by 
four recent sinkings that killed 11 East Coast clam fishermen in 
less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
	With that background, a Coast Guard safety panel is expected to  
recommend mandatory inspections of fishing boats and licensing of 
skippers, said panel member Bob Higgins, a Coast Guard safety 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the different issues brought to the table, licensing  
and inspections were the two leading components,'' Higgins said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel was created in January after the four fishing vessels  
sank in the Atlantic between Dec. 28 and Jan. 18. Three accidents 
took place off New Jersey's coast, and one happened off New 
Bedford. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial fishing has 131 deaths per year per 100,000  
employees, according to the Occupational Health and Safety 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has rejected licensing requirements three times because  
of concern the industry already is over-regulated. And the 
recommendations will probably meet with widespread opposition from 
the industry, which some say is drowning in regulations that 
protect fish. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fishing fleet is in such a battle over fishing  
regulations, this will be one more thing they'll put out and the 
guys will go berserk,'' said William Adler, a lobsterman and member 
of the Coast Guard's commercial fishing enforcement working group. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they're trying to stomp out all possible ways people  
can get killed and that's very important. But the sinkings are 
still going to take place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's recommendations are due March 19.

<HEADLINE> Sharon Proposes Unity Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon today  
proposed creating a government of national unity in order to 
postpone May elections and help find a way to end Israel's 
occupation in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition Labor Party rejected Sharon's plan, saying it was  
proof that the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has 
failed to solve any of the nation's pressing problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon may have floated the idea, in part to take the air out of  
a surprise pledge by Labor Party leader Ehud Barak that, if elected 
in the May 17 vote, he would bring Israeli troops home within a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Netanyahu is leading a government that has been bogged down in  
every field,'' the Haaretz daily quoted Barak as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon is Netanyahu's closest political ally and it is unlikely  
the foreign minister would have made the suggestion without 
clearing it with Netanyahu first. 
</P>
<P>
	With his earlier pledge, Barak placed the debate over Israel's  
17-year military presence in Lebanon at the heart of the election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	There is growing frustration in Israel over the guerrilla war in  
southern Lebanon, where 901 Israeli soldiers have died since 1982. 
Seven Israelis have been killed this year in ambushes and roadside 
bombings by the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group Hezbollah. 
</P>
<P>
	In an attempt to take back the initiative in the election  
campaign, Netanyahu said he would also try to pull troops out of 
Lebanon within a year, though he said he could not commit to a 
date. In a television talk show Tuesday evening, the prime minister 
invited Barak to present his plan to the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon said a broad-based government was needed to solve  
Israel's most pressing problems, including the guerrilla war in 
Lebanon and the unfinished negotiations with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We immediately need to set up an emergency national unity  
government, headed by Likud and Labor, in order to make a decision 
on a unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon and on implementing the 
(peace) agreement with the Palestinians,'' the Yediot Ahronot daily 
quoted Sharon as saying. Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, 
confirmed the remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, Defense Minister Moshe Arens said that  
Israel may walk away from a U.S.-brokered 1996 agreement with 
Hezbollah that neither side will target civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	Arens told The Jerusalem Post in an interview published today  
that he felt the understandings with Hezbollah hurt Israel's 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a large measure (the agreements) tie the Israeli Defense  
Forces' hands and won't allow it to use its full capability and 
provide a large degree of immunity to the Hezbollah,'' Arens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Israel might abandon the understandings, Arens said:  
``It is a possibility among a number of options that we have to 
look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement, both sides pledge not to fire from or  
into civilian areas. An international monitoring group reviews 
compliance.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fluctuate; Dow Down 4.34 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes wavered between positive and  
negative territory as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
reiterated reservations about investing Social Security funds in 
equities. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 4.34 at 9,293.27. The blue-chip index had risen as high as 
9,337.00, up nearly 40 points, before retreating. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 1.44 at 1,226.94, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index was up 2.94 at 2,261.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues led advancers by 11 to 9 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where volume came to 341.10 million shares, up from 
Tuesday's pace of 314.08 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing a Congressional subcommittee this morning, Greenspan  
warned that President Clinton's proposal to invest a significant 
portion of the nation's Social Security Trust Fund could render the 
stock market less efficient. It could also harm the economy, he 
said, by potentially channeling investment dollars into poorer 
performing companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks ruffled a market that was already poised to continue  
the correction it started last week. That correction has been 
focused in technology shares, and no other sector has stepped 
forward to lead the market higher, said Scott Bleier, chief 
investment strategist at Prime Charter in New York. ``This market 
is locked in a trading range,'' Bleier said. ``You are in the 
process of building some very serious negative sentiment, far more 
negative than we've see in several months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Michael Farr, a partner in the investment firm of Farr,  
Miller &AMP; Washington, in Washington D.C.: ``You're looking to what 
might be a stimulus for the markets, and it's certainly not coming 
from Mr. Greenspan this morning,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials were led lower by Union Carbide, which was  
down 1 5/8 at 43 3/16 after rising 9 percent Tuesday on takeover 
speculation. Consumer stocks were also lower, with Eastman Kodak 
down 1 3/8 at 63 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were mixed after another warning about  
declining computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest one, from 3Com Corp., which sells data, voice and  
video systems for the Internet and intranets. The company said late 
Tuesday that third-quarter earnings from ongoing operations will be 
about 23 cents a share, far below analysts' previously expected 36 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The company blamed an ``unexpected slowdown'' in sales to  
businesses in the United States and Latin America. 3Com stock was 
down 3 3/8 at 23 5/8 in leading volume in Nasdaq trading, after dropping 
Tuesday in after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the technology sector was turning higher after a  
mixed morning. Intel was up 1 15/16 at 111 3/4 in Nasdaq trading, but 
Dow component Hewlett-Packard, which gained Tuesday on a 
restructuring announcement, was up another 5/16 at 68 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices were lower after the National Association of  
Purchasing Management said its index of non-manufacturing activity 
rose to 57.0 percent in February, from January's 54 percent. But, 
the group's index of non-manufacturing prices eased, to 46.5 
percent from 47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullish economic data erased a slight gain in bonds this  
morning. The 30-year Treasury was down 23/32 point at 5.66 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The higher interest rates will exacerbate a slower economy, so  
that things are feeling kind of toppy in the stock market here,'' 
Farr said.

<HEADLINE> Concorde May Be Banned in Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Concorde -- the pride of European aviation  
and the world's only supersonic passenger jet -- would be banned 
from the United States under a bill the House passed Wednesday to 
retaliate against new environmental rules the European Union is 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
	Indignant House members passed by voice vote a measure that  
would keep Concorde aircraft from operating over U.S. soil if the 
European Parliament adopts a plan that would end up restricting the 
use of some U.S.-based aircraft to cut down on air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. planes under question either have new engines installed  
or are fitted with ``hushkits,'' devices similar to mufflers, Rep. 
Bud Shuster, R-Pa., said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's supporters said the European plan could cost American  
businesses more than $1 billion in sales of spare parts and 
engines, reduce the resale value of more than 1,600 U.S. aircraft 
and cause severe losses to manufacturers of hushkits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The European restriction would apply only to U.S. aircraft  
even though, in some cases, they are quieter than their European 
counterparts that would not be restricted under the regulations,'' 
the House Republican Conference said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	During floor debate, members of the House called the proposed  
regulations a discriminatory, anti-American trade action thinly 
disguised as environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is the European Community taking anti-competitive action  
as they have done with their proposal to eliminate some 1,600 U.S. 
aircraft from the European air system?'' said Rep. James Oberstar, 
D-Minn., who introduced the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure now goes to the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	Shuster said he hoped the threat of legislation alone would  
persuade the Europeans to table their plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our hope that we don't need to proceed further in the  
Senate and have this signed into law,'' he said. ``This is blatant, 
outrageous discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	'' None of us relishes taking this type of retaliatory measure,  
but fair is fair,'' said Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y. ``This sends 
a simple message to our friends across the pond that we will 
respond in kind when they take this type of action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, supporters said, the Concorde has been exempt from  
U.S. noise standards for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to a preliminary analysis from the Federal Aviation  
Administration, a ban on Concorde flights will reduce the noise 
footprint around New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport 
by at least 20 percent,'' the House Republican Conference said. 
</P>
<P>
	The needle-nosed plane, famous for rocketing through the sky at  
more than twice the speed of sound, made its first flight March 2, 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 661.

<HEADLINE> Strip Club Owner, Feds Make Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A strip club owner has agreed to cooperate with  
federal authorities investigating reputed Russian crime figures in 
south Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The Feb. 19 deal means Ludwig Fainberg, 41, will receive  
protection and a possible lighter sentence for his part in a drug 
conspiracy and racketeering case, The Miami Herald reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities are expected to confiscate Fainberg's club,  
Porky's, as part of the deal. The club has been a hangout for 
suspected Russian mobsters and the focus of a three-year federal 
operation that involved 11,000 taped conversations, undercover 
agents and informants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fainberg is not the bad guy here,'' said Porky's Inc. attorney  
Louis J. Terminello. ``He's just got a big mouth he uses to try to 
impress people, and now look where it's gotten him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While federal investigators listened, Fainberg and other  
Russians reportedly discussed the attempted transfer of a Cold 
War-era Russian nuclear attack submarine to Colombian drug lords, 
as well as prostitution, extortion, drug trafficking, 
counterfeiting and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Fainberg was charged with plotting to help cocaine  
suppliers negotiate with former Soviet military officials to buy 
submarines, planes and helicopters, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fainberg, who emigrated from the Soviet Union in the 1980s,  
faces up to 8 1/2 years in prison. Federal authorities have offered 
him and his 6-year-old daughter a place in the Federal Witness 
Protection Program and a special visa to prevent his deportation.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Pastor Accused in Church Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The former pastor who said he cried  
when his tiny church burned to the ground has been charged with 
setting the 1996 fire, one in a series of church blazes across the 
South. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 37, who now lives in Marlow, Okla., was charged  
with one count of arson Wednesday. He faces up to 20 years in 
prison and a fine of up to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Johnson said Harris had not been  
arrested, and refused to answer questions about a possible motive. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris could not be reached for comment in Marlow.  
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky Missionary Baptist Church near Benton burned on  
Aug. 24, 1996, amid a series of fires in both predominantly black 
and white churches. Kentucky Missionary's 45-member congregation is 
white. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after the fire, Harris said in an interview: ``We were  
out here shedding tears and helping each other get through this. 
It's like watching your home burn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that a passing motorist noticed the fire and contacted  
him. The fire happened on his 35th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rev. Dennis McClintic, who replaced Harris as pastor about two  
years ago, said the congregation is heartbroken and somewhat 
stunned by the news of Harris' indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to pray for his family. We are going to pray for  
him. The members here are not ones to hold a grudge,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1997, Gov. Mike Huckabee traveled to the site of the  
Kentucky Missionary Baptist fire to sign an act making church arson 
a felony under state law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill shows that we honor and respect the institutions of  
family and government,'' Huckabee said then. ``When we lose them, 
we lose the essence of what we are.''

<HEADLINE> Denver Family: Valve Caused Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) -- John Denver's family believes a faulty  
fuel selector valve in his experimental plane caused the crash that 
killed the singer in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's plane lost power after the valve got stuck, said Bill  
Wimsatt, a Los Angeles lawyer representing the singer's children 
and mother in a lawsuit against several companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got a situation where a fellow is trying to do nothing  
more than switch tanks on his aircraft, it results in a loss of 
power and a loss of control, with nothing, likely, that the pilot 
could have done to prevent it,'' Wimsatt said in today's Monterey 
County Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which was filed in October, names as defendants  
Imperial Eastman Corp., Mark IV Industries and Dayco Eastman, along 
with others. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver died Oct. 12, 1997, off the coast of Pacific Grove,  
Calif., when his home-built Long E-Z airplane ran out of fuel and 
fell into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board concluded Denver took  
off with too little fuel in one tank, had trouble switching to his 
backup tank and inadvertently put his plane into a roll while his 
attention was diverted. 
</P>
<P>
	Wimsatt, a licensed pilot, said the valve was working before  
Denver took off. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark IV lawyer Ed Green recently received a photograph of the  
valve and said he was still trying to identify whether it was 
manufactured by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was, then we'll inspect the valve to see if anything is  
wrong with it,'' Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's children, Zachary and Anna Kate Deutschendorf and Jesse  
Belle Denver, and Denver's mother, Erma Deutschendorf, are seeking 
compensatory damages. Denver's real name was Henry John 
Deutschendorf Jr.

<HEADLINE> Auditors: Clinton Plan Breaks Caps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress' chief fiscal analyst said today that  
President Clinton's budget would bust spending caps for next year 
by $30 billion. Republicans immediately used the report to 
criticize the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In the $1.77 trillion budget for fiscal 2000 that he proposed  
last month, Clinton proposed billions in extra spending for 
schools, health and other areas. He would keep the added spending 
within budgetary limits by paying for them with higher cigarette 
taxes and other revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	But in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, Dan  
Crippen, new director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget 
Office, said Clinton's proposed savings would not keep spending 
within limits because under budget law, those revenues ``do not 
count as offsets'' against such spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending caps, enacted two years ago in the budget-balancing  
pact between Clinton and Congress, were designed to bring 
expenditures under control. Fiscal 2000 begins on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In his prepared remarks, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete  
Domenici, R-N.M., said Clinton's budget continues ``a troubling 
pattern'' from the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Clinton has repeatedly used budget devices ``to make  
promises for new or increased spending in his budget, claim that it 
is paid for no matter how unlikely the offsets, and then throw the 
whole muddle into the lap of the Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CBO study also said Clinton's budget would produce surpluses  
totaling $73 billion less than he claims over the next five years, 
discounting the president's plans for using anticipated federal 
surpluses for shoring up Social Security, Medicare, and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	If Clinton's Social Security plan is factored in, the surpluses  
would be $436 billion smaller through 2004 than he says, CBO said. 
</P>
<P>
	The analysis came as GOP congressional leaders decided to try to  
quickly push a plan through Congress allowing Social Security funds 
to be used only for shoring up the massive pension system or 
shrinking the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	By rushing the measure to Clinton before turning to tax cuts and  
other priorities, Republicans hope to buffer themselves against 
politically potent Democratic accusations that the GOP is plotting 
to divert needed Social Security funds for tax reductions for the 
wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	As the year's budget fight begins, the CBO report is certain to  
be used by Republicans to accuse Clinton of spending more and doing 
less to protect federal surpluses than he claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending limit in question -- $537 billion for fiscal 2000 --  
applies to so-called discretionary spending. This includes 
everything but automatically paid benefits such as Medicare, as 
well as payments to holders of federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman in the White House budget office,  
said Clinton's aides have not seen the CBO figures yet. But she 
added that the two agencies often use different assumptions on the 
pace of spending or collecting revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every element of the president's budget is fully paid for,''  
she said. ``The offsets exist. It is simply a matter of the CBO 
choosing to put our offsets in a different category than we have. 
This is a balanced budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Staying within the spending cap is proving a problem for  
Republicans as well. They are struggling to live within it while 
meeting bipartisan calls for extra spending for defense, schools 
and perhaps other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican lawmakers and aides have acknowledged that it is  
likely they will have to exceed the spending limit eventually. 
Publicly, however, many GOP lawmakers insist they hope to live 
within the cap. 
</P>
<P>
	In its study, the CBO was more optimistic than the White House  
when it came to predicting the size of federal surpluses over the 
next decade if no tax or spending changes were made. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for 2009, the CBO envisions a bigger surplus than Clinton  
did for every year, a total of nearly $200 billion more than he did 
over the decade. For the next five years alone, the CBO sees 
surpluses totaling $953 billion, some $125 billion more than the 
White House projected. 
</P>
<P>
	Without any action, the CBO envisions a 1999 surplus of $111  
billion, growing to $133 billion next year and hitting $383 billion 
by 2009. The White House projected a $79 billion surplus this year, 
$117 billion next year and $393 billion in 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget would leave the 2000 surplus at $113 billion  
without his Social Security plan and $80 billion with it, the CBO 
said.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Pacific Seeks Pay Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Cathay Pacific Airways and its pilots could be  
heading toward turbulent times, after the company said Wednesday it 
wants to cut senior cabin crew's pay by an average of 8 percent in 
exchange for stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay, which is trying to slash costs and return to  
profitability, said in a statement that some pilots enjoy pay 
``significantly above the market level'' but added it had no plans 
``for less senior crew to take any form of salary concession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A union leader attacked Cathay's ``deplorable'' labor relations  
and questioned management's motives, asking whether Cathay is using 
Asia's economic troubles as an excuse to slash salaries just so it 
can maximize profits when business takes off again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot analyze whether there really is a need for our  
members to make concessions,'' said John Findlay, general secretary 
of the Air Crew Officers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay has told its 1,300 pilots it needs to cut costs to  
weather the regional troubles that have pushed the airline into the 
red. But the company has made no detailed proposals and has refused 
to provide pilots with any projections about whether business will 
bounce back along with Asia's economies, Findlay said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the company wants to take advantage of the current economic  
difficulties, that's greedy,'' Findlay told a reporter. ``If the 
company is in a serious financial problem and can demonstrate it, 
of course we will sit down and talk about it. Thousands of jobs 
depend on Cathay Pacific.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any showdown with pilots would come close behind the company's  
dispute with flight attendants that left much ill feeling among the 
staff. Cathay demanded that flight attendants work more hours in 
exchange for a pay raise, then told 4,200 members of the cabin crew 
union that the union had no right to serve as their collective 
bargaining agent in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants caved in, though their union vaguely vowed  
to fight on. Findlay said pilots would deliver ``a much different 
response,'' declining to rule out industrial action. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay bosses said Wednesday evening they have been unable to  
have a substantive dialogue with the pilots union for months -- 
although group public affairs general manager Andrew Herdman would 
not specify why. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to send its proposals directly to pilots  
instead of the union -- which it says it must do under Hong Kong 
labor law in a case where workers are being asked to make 
concessions, Herdman said. The move does not preclude talks with 
the union, Herdman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The South China Morning Post said some pilots would face salary  
cuts of up to 27 percent. Cathay would not comment on the figure, 
though it said some pilots based overseas on Hong Kong expatriate 
pay packages would suffer the biggest cuts because they get 
salaries that are up to twice what their local counterparts make. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post said Cathay was seeking annual savings of 500 million  
Hong Kong dollars ($64 million) from the pilots, but the company 
would not confirm or deny that figure. 
</P>
<P>
	The union accused Cathay of trying to negotiate through the news  
media in an absence of any formal talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Negotiations should be taking place between the parties  
involved,'' Findlay said. ``Their management style is, quite 
frankly, deplorable.''

<HEADLINE> Soccer Star Admits His Dive on Foul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	National Sportsmanship Day came and went in these United States  
without creating much of a stir. 
</P>
<P>
	A curious thing happened in Europe, though, where Argentine  
soccer star Diego Simeone finally owned up to taking a dive on the 
foul that got Englishman David Beckham ejected from last summer's 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a brave man (or a foolish one) to do what Simeone did --  
which was not so much apologize as say, ``Better luck next time, 
suckers!'' Especially since was quoted as saying such on Tuesday, 
one day before his Italian club team, Internazionale of Milan, 
wound up in England playing Beckham's Manchester United side in a 
European Champions Cup quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
	As sportsmanship goes, this episode did not have a promising  
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously I was clever by letting myself fall ... and the  
referee fell into the trap ... showing the red card,'' Simeone said 
in the Italian sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport. ``You can say 
that my falling turned a yellow card into a red card.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watching the foul on replay now, the impressive thing is that  
Simeone was able to make such a meal out of it. The sequence begins 
late in the first half as Beckham, dribbling with the ball, is 
tackled to the ground. He and Simeone get tangled up and the 
whistle blows. As they begin untangling, Beckham, still face down, 
kicks back with his right foot -- a nudge, almost -- and grazes the 
Argentine captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``In reality,'' Simeone said, ``it was not a violent blow. It  
was just a kick with no force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But forceful enough, apparently, to convince referee Kim Neilsen  
to eject Beckham, one of his England brightest young talents. The 
10 countrymen he left behind held on to tie 2-2 in regulation 
before losing on penalty kicks. Naturally, Beckham caught most of 
the blame. 
</P>
<P>
	As passionate as Americans are about their games, nothing lights  
us up the way soccer does the rest of the world, and so nothing 
that happens here rivals the way England unloaded on its suddenly 
flawed hero. If the entire nation had shunned Roberto Alomar for 
weeks after he spit on umpire John Hirschbeck, then decided to get 
nasty and personal and threatening as he made the round of 
ballparks the next season, you'd have some idea of the gantlet 
Beckham had to run. 
</P>
<P>
	But either he was brought up right -- or he learned something  
along the way. On the eve of Wednesday's game, Beckham's father 
said his son was prepared to shake hands with Simeone before the 
kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``David hasn't forgotten it, but he has put it behind him,'' Ted  
Beckham said. ``It's all history now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simeone had told the Italian press he doesn't shake hands with  
opponents as a matter of principle. But Wednesday he changed his 
mind. Just before the game, as players from both teams shook hands 
on either side of them, Simeone and Beckham did the same. That 
small bit of civility was only a temporary peace, but it was peace 
nonetheless. Even small victories feel good when you're losing the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes at the highest levels are taught, pushed and more than  
ever, praised for exploiting every advantage. To build bulk and 
minimize wear and tear on his body, slugger Mark McGwire uses a 
muscle-building supplement he'd have a hard time recommending to 
his son. Dennis Rodman's off-the-court behavior is drawing raves in 
his latest NBA reincarnation. But watch his behavior on the court 
if you want to see him flout rules. Dick Butkus was as tough as 
anybody who ever played football. He also hit, bit, gouged and 
stomped people when he got the chance, and somehow it came out as 
charming. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he was a cab driver and he had Ray Charles in the back  
seat,'' former NFL kicker Benny Ricardo once joked, ``he'd rev up 
the engine for 50 minutes and charge him full fare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a good line, but a costly laugh. We celebrate cunning and  
guile in our sports, then pretend to be surprised when kids do, 
too. The people who run the National Federation of High Schools, a 
clearinghouse for prep sports information, don't keep numbers on 
unsportsmanlike episodes each year. But they will say anecdotal 
evidence suggests high school games are more intense than they used 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last few years, one high school football player  
cold-cocked a referee by slamming into him from behind, after a 
30-yard run-up, and another was caught wearing steel buckles on his 
helmet sharpened to a razor's edge. The sad thing? The kid's 
father, a pediatric dentist, did the handiwork.. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports used to be where the world went to check its attitude, to  
sit down and watch somebody else play hard but clean for something 
that mattered. It was located somewhere above petty jealousy and 
priced below a week's groceries for a family of four. The stakes 
eventually got so high that winning seems to be all that matters. 
But the more it means, the better it pays, the farther we can 
expect sportsmanship to be nudged out towards the end of that 
ledge.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smoking Pill Said To Top Patch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Trying to kick the smoking habit? Maybe you should add the pill  
to the patch. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first head-to-head comparison, the anti-smoking drug  
Zyban proved twice as good as the nicotine patch in helping people 
quit smoking -- and used together were even more effective. 
</P>
<P>
	Used together, they helped more than 35 percent of smokers stay  
off cigarettes for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The patch had disappointing results, working no better than a  
dummy pill or patch. But the researchers themselves disagreed over 
whether the findings were a fluke, since other studies have shown 
the patch works. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, led by Dr. Douglas Jorenby of the University of  
Wisconsin Medical School's Center for Tobacco Research and 
Intervention, was reported in today's New England Journal of 
Medicine. It was paid for by the maker of Zyban. 
</P>
<P>
	Using both methods at the same time was especially effective in  
helping people prevent weight gain during the first seven weeks. 
Those using both the patch and Zyban put on about 2.4 pounds, 
compared with 3.6 for either method alone and 4.6 on placebos, or 
dummy treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people say the fear of gaining weight stops them from  
even trying to quit smoking or can sabotage them early in the 
process,'' Jorenby said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 46 million Americans smoke, and it will eventually kill  
half of them, at a rate of about 400,000 a year. Three-quarters of 
smokers want to quit, but at most 5 percent manage to do so on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyban is the brand name for the antidepressant bupropion. Since  
Zyban was approved in 1997 as the first non-nicotine product to 
help smokers quit, doctors have written 4 million prescriptions for 
it, according to Glaxo Wellcome Inc., the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very high success rate with bupropion is extremely  
encouraging,'' said Dr. Alan Leshner, director of the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse. Adding behavioral treatment to the mix 
should bring even more success, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaxo Wellcome paid for the study. Jorenby has organized  
presentations for Glaxo Wellcome. Seven of the 11 other researchers 
also have worked for Glaxo Wellcome, Novartis -- which made the 
patches studied -- or a competitor in the quit-smoking business. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a habit of at least 15 cigarettes a day to qualify for  
the study. Smokers who were depressed were turned down. All 893 
participants got patches to stick on and pills to take, but some of 
the patches and pills were dummies. 
</P>
<P>
	After four weeks, the patch had significantly better results  
than the placebo. Buproprion alone was more effective than the 
patch, and both treatments were better yet. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year, more than 35 percent of the people getting both  
treatments were still not smoking, compared with about 30 percent 
of those on bupropion alone. But only 16.4 percent of those on the 
patch were smoke-free, compared with 15.6 percent of those whose 
used placebo patches and pills. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorenby said the finding was a fluke. Other studies have shown  
about a 30 percent success rate for the patch, according to Dr. 
Neal Benowitz of the University of California at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who failed on nicotine once don't do very well if you  
re-treat with nicotine. My guess is that a fair number of people 
had tried a nicotine patch or nicotine gum before,'' Benowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did include people who had used patches before, but  
there wasn't any significant difference in their quit rates, said 
another of the researchers, Dr. Michael Fiore, director of the 
tobacco research center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the difference between bupropion and the patch is a  
real one,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leads Agenda Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton stood with congressional  
Democrats today and declared ``we are united'' behind an ambitious 
legislative agenda, looking to gain a tactical advantage over 
Republican lawmakers still wrestling with their plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton met with House and Senate Democrats to roll out their  
1999 ``Families First'' agenda, a four-page political wish list 
topped by a bid to set aside 77 percent of projected federal budget 
surpluses for Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The president boasted that the nation has enjoyed its longest  
peacetime economic expansion, with low unemployment and low 
inflation, during his six years in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we had before that was more than a decade in which the  
leaders of the other party talked tough, but took the easy way 
out,'' Clinton said. ``We were unashamed about being compassionate, 
unashamed that we cared about those that needed a hand up in 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He commended Republicans for agreeing to reserve billions of  
dollars for fixing Social Security but said they have not signed on 
to his proposals for salvaging Medicare. ``There are still strong 
differences in our approach and we must resolve them in a way that 
benefits the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., urged Republicans to  
work with Democrats on health care reforms and legislation that 
benefits working Americans. ``We want to make progress now. This 
month. This year. This session. We can't afford to waste another 
year or two mired in partisan wrangling and gridlock,'' Gephardt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said, ``Democrats  
are determined and we are unified.'' Picking up that theme, Clinton 
said, ``We stand today unified. We stand today well aware of the 
challenges before us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's bring a new energy to this session of Congress,''  
Clinton declared. ``When we get really frustrated about what seems 
to be excessive partisanship ... let's keep our optimism, our good 
cheer, our resolve and our unity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., replied: ``It's nice to see that three months after 
the Republicans announced their agenda, the Democrats are getting 
around to doing the same. We have already made significant progress 
on our agenda, which emphasized education, strengthening national 
security, among others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' agenda closely tracks the priorities Clinton  
articulated in his State of the Union address in January: 
modernizing schools and improving accountability of local school 
systems, approving a ``patients' bill of rights'' on health care, 
expanding pension benefits, increasing the minimum wage, 
dispatching more police officers to fight crime and offering 
several small, targeted tax reductions for purposes such as caring 
for a child or an elderly relative. 
</P>
<P>
	The gathering comes as congressional Republicans try to glue  
together their legislative priorities. So far, they have identified 
goals such as a tax cut, a military pay raise and reforms to Social 
Security and education but have reached no consensus on how to go 
about reaching them. 
</P>
<P>
	Several agree, however, that the Democratic plan is flawed. Sen.  
Larry Craig, R-Idaho, called it last week ``a getting-nothing-done 
agenda,'' as in, ``saying the Republican Congress couldn't get 
anything done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, Democrats are pressing GOP leaders to take up  
their agenda right away. But that is unlikely, for large fights 
loom over the proposals on Social Security, Medicare and education. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday, Republican leaders agreed on a push to allow Social  
Security funds to be used only to shore up the pension system or 
bring down the national debt. In a closed meeting, Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill., instructed budget writers to agree on a workable proposal 
to be announced this week -- and to be on Clinton's desk in a few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his fiscal 2000 budget plan, Clinton has proposed  
setting aside 62 percent -- or $2.8 trillion -- of the expected $4.9 
trillion in budget surpluses over the next 15 years to shore up 
Social Security so it can bear the massive waves of expected 
baby-boomer retirements. He also wants Medicare to get 15 percent, 
or $686 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans agree with the notion of preserving 62 percent of  
surpluses for Social Security, but they want to set aside $200 
billion more than Clinton has proposed for that purpose over the 
next decade.

<HEADLINE> Court: Feds Must Bargain With Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agencies can be required to bargain  
with unions representing their employees over subjects the unions 
raise during the life of a contract agreement, the Supreme Court 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-4 ruling said the decision on whether to require such  
bargaining is up to the Federal Labor Relations Authority, which 
oversees labor disputes between federal agencies and their 
unionized workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress delegated to the authority the power to determine --  
within appropriate legal bounds ... -- whether, when, where and what 
sort of midterm bargaining is required,'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The FLRA has said agencies are required to conduct such  
mid-contract bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The FLRA is similar to the National Labor Relations Board, which  
governs labor disputes in private industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Treasury Employees Union called the ruling a major  
victory for federal employees and their unions, saying it means 
federal agencies will have to bargain over issues such as safety 
problems that arise during a contract. The NTEU's lawyer argued 
today's case on behalf of another federal workers' union. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's ruling set aside a lower court decision that said the  
Interior Department's U.S. Geological Survey was not legally bound 
to bargain over a proposal raised by the union representing its 
employees in Reston, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	While negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with the  
Geological Survey, Local 1309 of the National Federation of Federal 
Employees sought a contractual right to have the agency negotiate 
``matters not covered by the provisions of this agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency refused to negotiate the proposal, prompting the  
union to file an unfair labor practice complaint with the FLRA. 
</P>
<P>
	The authority ruled against the Geological Survey. On appeal the  
4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the FLRA's decision, 
saying federal law does not require mid-term bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The FLRA had decided in 1985 the law did not require federal  
agencies to bargain mid-term. But after the U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in 1987 that federal law 
required such bargaining, the FLRA reversed its stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Breyer noted the FLRA ``says that it has determined, as a matter  
of its own judgment, that the parties must bargain over such a 
provision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said, because that judgment followed the District of  
Columbia court's ruling, ``we believe the authority should have the 
opportunity to consider these questions aware that the statute 
permits, but does not compel, the conclusions it reached.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Anthony M.  
Kennedy, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices  
Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Writing 
for the four, O'Connor said the law ``plainly does not impose a 
general duty on agencies to bargain mid-term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are National Federation of Federal Employees vs.  
Department of Interior, 97-1184, and FLRA vs. Department of 
Interior, 97-1243.

<HEADLINE> CBS Renews 12 Shows for Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS is so anxious to prove its stability to  
television viewers that it has already promised to bring back 12 of 
its prime-time series in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's entire Monday night schedule of comedies and its three  
newsmagazines were included in Tuesday's announcement. Networks 
usually announce their fall schedules in May, touching off a 
scramble by advertisers to place orders for millions of dollars 
worth of commercial time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like we are sort of laying down the gauntlet that we  
will be stable,'' said Leslie Moonves, president and chief 
executive of CBS Television. ``It will say to our affiliates and 
advertisers that we're ready for next season. Why wait until May 
when we know where we are going?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shows that will return are ``Cosby,'' ``King of Queens,''  
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``Becker,'' ``JAG,'' ``60 Minutes,'' 
``60 Minutes II,'' ``Touched By an Angel,'' ``Kids Say the Darndest 
Things,'' ``Nash Bridges,'' ``48 Hours'' and ``Candid Camera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others shows will probably join them on the renewal list, but  
CBS can't announce them yet for contractual reasons, Moonves said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, NBC has said that seven of its shows will definitely  
return next fall: ``ER,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Friends,'' ``Dateline 
NBC,'' ``Just Shoot Me, ``Law and Order'' and ``3rd Rock From the 
Sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox has already renewed ``The PJ's,'' ``That '70s Show'' and  
``Beverly Hills 90210.'' ABC, the WB and UPN have not announced any 
series renewals for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Moonves said he expects advertisers to jump at the chance to  
place advertising orders for CBS's hottest shows. 
</P>
<P>
	But NBC Entertainment President Scott Sassa questioned the  
strategy, saying it would limit a network's chances to sell ad 
packages. Networks sometimes require advertisers to buy ads on new 
or lower-rated shows if they want to get a slot on a hit show like 
``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would seem short-sighted to sell their shows alone without  
using them as bait to get people to your new shows,'' Sassa said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's announcement is another indication that the traditional  
calendar for television seasons is slowly breaking down. Networks 
are more frequently premiering new programs outside of September, 
when the fall season usually starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Moonves said CBS is likely to have the fewest number of new  
shows next fall than it has had in years. He said he was startled 
to see the number of pilots in development set in high schools or 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be such an obsession with teen-agers and  
animation that we're not going to go there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Seeks To Fix Indian Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, cited for  
contempt of court over his handling of $3 billion in Indian trust 
funds, promised lawmakers Wednesday he would ``do my best'' to 
resolve the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Key Senate Republicans were skeptical and said they did not  
believe the Interior Department properly could manage the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt is the latest in a series of Interior secretaries to  
struggle with reconciling the funds, which were mismanaged for 
decades by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be an institutional rot that does not go  
away,'' said Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, chairman of the Senate 
Indian Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a federal judge found Babbitt and Treasury Secretary  
Robert Rubin in contempt of court over their delay in producing 
documents sought by Indian account holders suing the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am ready to accept responsibility for what's happened in the  
past,'' Babbitt said at a joint hearing of Campbell's committee and 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Cleaning up the 
funds would be his ``highest priority,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 300,000 accounts held by individual Indians and 1,500  
more tribal accounts worth $2.5 billion. The money includes lease 
revenue, royalties and court settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of records are missing; others were stored in a  
warehouse that was allegedly infected for a time with a deadly 
rodent-borne virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has been unable to document $2.4 billion in  
transactions involving the tribal accounts over a 20-year period. 
Taxpayers likely are to be asked to fund an eventual settlement 
with the account holders. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt has asked Congress for $100 million next year to work on  
the funds, a 150 percent increase from this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department has straightened out about two-thirds of  
the accounts held by individuals, and a new accounting system will 
be in place by the end of the year, Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Campbell, R-Colo., said he may introduce legislation to take  
the funds out of Babbitt's control. Sen. Frank Murkowski, chairman 
of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said he would 
fight Babbitt's budget request because he no longer trusts the 
department to manage the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't want to give them 10 cents. You might get seven  
back,'' said Murkowski, R-Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt has resisted proposals to give the money to a new  
government agency, and the idea also is controversial among tribal 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the department's difficulty in managing the accounts  
stems from the way Indian lands and mineral rights are divided into 
progressively smaller pieces with each generation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Gover, assistant secretary for Indian affairs, receives 7  
cents a year on a mineral interest that once belonged to his 
great-grandfather, a Pawnee Indian. The department says it costs 
$35 a year to handle such an account. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress twice has passed laws to consolidate such small  
interests in the hands of tribes, but the Supreme Court struck down 
both laws as unconstitutional. Babbitt pressed the senators to pass 
another law to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Three tribes, including the Navajo Nation, simply have withdrawn  
their money from their government. 
</P>
<P>
	Others have declined to do so for various reasons. For one  
thing, the department does not necessarily know how much the tribes 
are due, said Edward Thomas, president of the Tlingit and Haida 
tribes in Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Off 21.73 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A late rally in technology shares saved the  
stock market from another down day Wednesday, although the picture 
was mixed at the close. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more strong economic reports heightened fears that the  
Federal Reserve might raise interest rates as a hedge against 
inflation, pulling the market lower for most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips finished on the down side, but tech shares bounced  
higher in the last hour thanks to some bargain hunters. They pulled 
some broader indexes slightly higher at the close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.73 at 9,275.88. The  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended up 6.17 at 2,265.20, 
while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained 2.20 to 1,227.70. The 
market has been generally weak since last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips were responding Wednesday to a slump in the bond  
market, where the 30-year Treasury bond lost $11.56 per $1,000 
valuation. The long bond's yield, which moves opposite the price, 
rose to 5.69 percent, a seven-month high and up from 5.61 percent 
late Tuesday. The yield hasn't been that high since hitting 5.71 
percent last July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``The specific problem, short-term, is the bond market and  
rising yields,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential 
Securities. With stock prices so high, ``it's very hard to justify 
these valuations when interest rates are rising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices sank after the National Association of Purchasing  
Management said its index of non-manufacturing activity rose to 57 
in February, from January's reading of 54. Analysts said the 
increase was a sign that inflation could soon be on the rise, even 
though the same group's index of non-manufacturing prices eased to 
46.5 from 47. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer stocks dropped initially after 3Com Corp., which sells  
Internet equipment, said late Tuesday that third-quarter operating 
earnings will be far below analysts' expectations because of an 
unexpected slowdown in sales in the United States and Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	3Com's statement followed similar warnings of soft computer  
sales from Compaq Computer and Micron Electronics, a unit of Micron 
Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	3Com stock fell 2 7/16 to 24 9/16 in market-leading Nasdaq  
volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were lower through most of the session but  
inched higher at the end as investors perceived there were bargains 
to be had. Intel ended 4 7/8 higher at 114 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan helped pressure the  
market downward early in the day when he restated his reservations 
about President Clinton's proposal to invest a significant portion 
of the nation's Social Security Trust Fund in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing a Congressional subcommittee, Greenspan again said  
such a plan could encourage investments for political reasons in 
companies that aren't well run, or discourage investments in 
companies that are. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues led advancers  
by 13 to 9. Volume was moderately heavy at 894.2 million shares, 
about even with Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.39 to 582.55, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.76 to 694.45. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.48 to 391.95. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign stock markets, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo climbed  
1.79 percent. In Europe, The DAX index in Frankfurt dropped 2.21 
percent, the FT-SE 100 index in London eased 0.21 percent, and the 
CAC in Paris gave up 1.10 percent.

<HEADLINE> MLB Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Pete Rose Jr. was a hit, Garth Brooks was a miss.  
</P>
<P>
	While the New York Mets were beating St. John's University 12-3  
Tuesday in this spring's first exhibition, several other teams were 
playing intrasquad games. 
</P>
<P>
	With his father sitting in the stands, Rose got a hit in the Los  
Angeles Dodgers' game at Vero Beach, Fla. Brooks, however, struck 
out in his only at-bat in the San Diego Padres' game at Peoria, 
Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	After being reminded by manager Bruce Bochy to put on his  
batting helmet, the country music star managed to foul off two 
pitches before chasing a neck-high fastball from non-roster righty 
Salvador Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was cool. I guess four out of the five pitches I was proud  
of. The last one I wasn't. That's the one I'll remember,'' Brooks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was there. That's why I was apologizing to my teammates. I  
was there,'' he said. ``The guy on first has to be moved over and 
it was my job to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks did fine in left field, cleanly handling a single by Gary  
Matthews Jr. in his only chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose Sr., baseball's career hits leader, watched his 29-year-old  
son swing away at Dodgertown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll let you know if he's my son after he hits,'' Rose said to  
a fan. ``If he gets a hit, he's my son. If he doesn't, he's your 
son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose Jr. is just hoping for a chance with the Dodgers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've got what it takes,'' he said Tuesday. ``I plan on  
making the team. I don't plan on playing in (Triple-A) 
Albuquerque.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bust my tail,'' Pete Jr. said. ``I'm going to be in LA at  
some time. I'm a guy who's got some pop. Left-handed pop looks to 
be a little scarce around here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Brown, who signed a $105 million, seven-year contract with  
the Dodgers, pitched two innings in a simulated game. He threw 16 
pitches in the first inning and 23 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of getting started back up, getting cranked up  
again,'' Brown said. ``I survived, didn't get hit in the face or 
anything, so there's a moral victory there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the session, Brown gave up a couple of shots that  
most likely would have been hits in a game, to Jose Vizcaino, Gary 
Sheffield and Raul Mondesi. He ended the session by striking out 
Eric Karros. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 1,431 at Port St. Lucie, Fla., watched the Mets  
defeat St. John's. Matt Franco homered during a seven-run burst in 
the third inning, and Melvin Mora and Mike Kinkade also connected 
for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Mets pitchers combined on a five-hitter. Mets closer John  
Franco, a St. John's alumnus, did not pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Left-hander David Wells, meanwhile, had back spasms and was in  
Toronto's training room in Dunedin, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wells has some lower right back inflammation,'' Blue Jays  
trainer Tommy Craig said. ``We're treating him now, and he seems to 
be responding to the treatment and exercises. We don't anticipate 
it being a long and drawn-out thing. We're just going to take it 
day to day right now, then ease him back up to the on-the-field 
stuff.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Levies Sanctions in Trade Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bitter trade battle between the United  
States and Europe over bananas turned even nastier Wednesday as the 
United States began notifying importers that they now are liable 
for hefty penalty tariffs on $520 million worth of European goods. 
</P>
<P>
	If allowed to stand, the tariffs of 100 percent on items such as  
German coffee makers and French handbags effectively would double 
their price, putting them out of reach for most U.S. consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is seeking to penalize European producers by  
an amount equal to the damages U.S.-based banana companies say they 
are suffering in lost sales because of unfair European trade 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. action, which caught European officials by surprise,  
was immediately denounced by the 15-nation European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came only a day after the World Trade Organization  
asked for more information before ruling on the legality of the 
U.S. trade sanctions. The WTO had requested both sides to provide 
that information by March 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States decided to defy the WTO system by  
introducing a form of sanctions which has no WTO authorization 
whatsoever,'' Sir Leon Brittan, EU's trade minister, said in a 
statement issued in Brussels. ``What the United States has done is 
therefore unacceptable and unlawful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States said it would not collect any punitive tariffs  
until the WTO rules on the appropriate size of the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	But starting Wednesday, importers of those products must post  
bonds and assume liability for paying the higher tariffs if the WTO 
rules in America's favor. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States contends that American banana companies are  
losing $520 million annually in lost sales to Europe because of 
illegal trade barriers that favor bananas imported from former 
European colonies in the Caribbean and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiquita Brands International Inc. and Dole Food Co., the major  
American companies involved, grow their bananas on plantations in 
South America. 
</P>
<P>
	While the United States won a WTO case on this issue, the EU  
argued that the matter needed further review because it has changed 
some banana import rules. The U.S. side says the changes do not 
satisfy American objections. 
</P>
<P>
	The banana fight, which has dragged on for six years, has  
captured attention at the highest levels of government. It was on 
the agenda when French President Jacques Chirac met recently with 
President Clinton. Clinton told reporters the United States 
believed it was crucial for the world trading system that losing 
countries in WTO disputes abide by the decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Europeans contend politics is driving the United States to the  
brink of a trade war with its biggest trading partner. Carl 
Lindner, the head of Chiquita, is a major campaign contributor to 
both Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Special U.S. Trade Negotiator Peter Scher told reporters at a  
news conference the penalty tariffs were effective Wednesday. The 
United States decided against holding off possible sanctions 
because it could have encouraged delaying tactics by countries 
losing WTO cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The target list includes Louis Vitton handbags from France,  
sweet biscuits from Britain, Parma ham and pecorino cheese from 
Italy, German coffee makers and a host of less fancy imports 
ranging from plastic packing material to batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Scher said if the WTO does not allow the full $520 million in  
penalties, the administration will adjust its list to ensure 
compliance with the WTO ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Requiring bonds until collecting sanctions has not been used in  
a WTO case although the administration did employ a similar 
procedure in a 1995 fight with Japan involving auto trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Those tariffs never went into effect because the administration  
was able to negotiate an agreement to expand sales opportunities 
for American car companies in Japan.

<HEADLINE>  Expos, Quebec in Money Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUEBEC (AP) -- The Expos' future in Montreal grew more uncertain  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Quebec government held to its refusal to use tax money to  
build a new downtown ballpark, and managing partner Claude Brochu 
said the team can survive only with government help. 
</P>
<P>
	Quebec finance minister Bernard Landry said province's stand had  
not changed: no tax money for professional sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who earn $50,000 a year don't want to see their taxes  
used to make life easier for people who earn millions of dollars a 
month,'' Landry said. ``There are economic spinoffs (to baseball), 
but that isn't the determining factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't like increasing Quebec's industrial base with  
aluminum plants. There can't be a solution that is hard on 
taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Landry said the government is confident it had public backing  
for its refusal to get involved financially in the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not news Brochu wanted to hear.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a really tough situation, make no mistake about it,''  
he said at the club's training camp in Jupiter, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu said government money is essential.  
</P>
<P>
	``To be able to compete with American cities, where on average  
public support for stadia is in the area of 80 percent, you can't 
ask Canadian teams to build their own buildings, worry about 
foreign exchange, worry about municipal taxes, worry about sales 
taxes, worry about any number of any other things and be 
competitive,'' Brochu said. ``It's impossible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Lucien Bouchard and Prime Minister Jean Chretien have  
said they can't help sports teams, although the federal government 
reportedly is willing to turn over the proposed downtown stadium 
site for $1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos were told by major league baseball to have a new  
ownership group and stadium financing in place by March 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials said that after that date, Brochu has the  
right to move the Expos out of Montreal ``in the best interests of 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what will happen after the deadline, Brochu said it was up  
to major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said the Expos definitely will be in Montreal this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu said that he needs a two-thirds vote of the partnership  
to sell the club. But a two-thirds vote doesn't force him as 
general partner to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos' attendance reached a high of 2,208,175 in 1980. Last  
season, attendance as 914,717.

<HEADLINE> The Artists: Matisse's Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When the pile of papers on your desk includes  
hand-crayoned Christmas cards from the surrealist Joan Miro and 
your file cabinets are stuffed with Alexander Calder's penciled 
sketches of his famous mobiles, maybe it pays to be a pack rat. 
</P>
<P>
	In six decades as a New York art dealer, Pierre Matisse, the son  
of French painter Henri Matisse, showed work by Miro, Calder, 
Alberto Giacometti, Jean Dubuffet and Marc Chagall, and filed away 
their letters, sketches, catalogues and press clippings. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked tirelessly to introduce these and other masters of  
modern art, most of them European, to an often reluctant American 
public. His persistence and their talent helped reshape the 
nation's artistic landscape in the years after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pierpont Morgan Library opened 219 boxes filled with the  
papers from Pierre Matisse's Manhattan gallery to researchers last 
month and plans to show them in occasional public exhibits. The 
Pierre Matisse Foundation, started by the dealer's family after he 
died in 1989 at the age of 89, gave the archive to the library last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pierre Matisse was the most important art dealer in New York  
from 1930 on,'' said Charles Pierce Jr., the library's director. 
``He almost single-handedly introduced America to some of the great 
early modernist painters and ... sculptors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dealer forged friendships with many of his artists and was  
particularly close to Miro. The archive is filled with gems like an 
abstract Christmas greeting Miro crayoned in blue, black, red and 
green on plain white paper, with loops and lines similar to those 
in his paintings. ``Merry Christmas. Happy New Year 1961. Joan,'' 
he wrote in French. 
</P>
<P>
	Calder sent Pierre Matisse reams of penciled diagrams of his  
mobiles and sculptures to guide workers as they assembled the 
pieces for a 1964 show at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. 
``Please be sure to get the colors right,'' the artist scrawled on 
one sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	As the son of one of the most important French painters of the  
20th century, Pierre Matisse grew up surrounded by art. 
</P>
<P>
	``The family was completely wrapped up in Henri Matisse's  
continuous artwork,'' said Pierre Matisse's son, Paul, a 
66-year-old sculptor living in Groton, Mass. ``This was his gift, 
that faith in the importance of the artistic effort, that came from 
living with his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre Matisse moved to New York in 1924, and opened the Pierre  
Matisse Gallery in the Fuller Building on East 57th Street in 1931. 
He carefully chose his artists and was fiercely devoted to them, 
mounting shows and promoting their efforts despite widespread 
skepticism about modern art. 
</P>
<P>
	``People didn't understand it, people thought it looked weird,''  
said Jack Flam, a City University of New York art historian who is 
an expert on Henri Matisse and who knew the son. ``It's almost like 
the kind of publisher who's publishing poetry and you can't really 
make money on it, but you keep publishing the books anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre Matisse stuck by his artists, many of whom were already  
well-known in Europe, and he grew wealthy as they slowly gained 
prominence in the United States, Flam said. His efforts helped 
convince reluctant curators of modern art's importance, and many 
works that passed through his gallery now hang in the Museum of 
Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other major museums. 
</P>
<P>
	In one letter, translated from French in a catalog that  
accompanied an exhibit of his work, Giacometti recalled a time 
early in his career when he found it difficult to sculpt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was lost, everything escaped me,'' he wrote. ``The head of  
the model before me became like a cloud, vague, unlimited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giacometti's mood soon improved, and a few pages later,  
apparently writing from a cafe, he signed off: ``And now I stop, 
besides they are closing, I must pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A reserved, often formal man, Pierre Matisse believed in art's  
dignity and ran a quietly elegant gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more like a church than a lively place,'' Paul Matisse  
recalled. ``It was like walking into a beautifully run small 
museum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre Matisse occasionally exhibited his father's paintings,  
but those who knew him said he was determined to succeed on his own 
and didn't like relying on his famous last name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because he had the name Matisse, it gave him a kind of moral  
authority, or clout ... that other dealers didn't have,'' Flam 
said. ``But at the same time he was a very decent guy and didn't 
want to overuse it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The papers at the Morgan include 833 letters between Henri and  
Pierre, which are sealed at the family's request until 2008 at the 
latest, but will probably be made public ``sooner rather than 
later,'' Pierce said. Henri died in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a beautiful record of an extraordinary relationship,''  
said Paul Matisse,. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many scholars believed the men were cool to one  
another, the correspondence shows ``an astonishing amount of love 
that flowed between the two of them,'' said Flam, who read the 
letters before they were sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like a lot of artists, (Henri Matisse) probably had ambivalent  
feelings about art dealers, saw them as sort of a necessary evil. 
... But at the same time he had a tremendous regard for Pierre 
personally. ... He saw his son as being on the right side for 
modern art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henri Matisse's devotion to his work taught Pierre the  
importance of standing behind talented artists, although modern 
painting and sculpture were a tough sell during his gallery's early 
years, Paul Matisse said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what he believed in,'' the son recalled. ``He believed  
... that their art was important and that they were important, and 
just as we need them to make the work, they needed him to present 
it.''

</P>
<P>
	Heerma took over the CDA leadership during its first spell in

	LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- John Lusk, a major developer of  
Southern California housing, offices and commercial malls, died 
Sunday at age 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Lusk built 40,000 homes after leaving the banking business in  
1946. Forbes magazine listed him among the nation's richest people

</P>
<P>
	He was also a philanthropist, contributing millions of dollars  
to education, medical and social programs in southern California 
and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Lusk's company built high-end housing in Beverly Hills,  
Brentwood and Bel Air. He later turned to affordable tract housing 
in the southern suburbs of Los Angeles and Orange County. By the 
1960s, he added office buildings and shopping malls to his 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	His fortunes rose steadily until the late '80s when he began a  
huge project near Lake Elsinore, the 1,977-acre planned community

Ordained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mossman stopped making guitars when he suffered severe headaches

	LONDON (AP) -- Singer Dusty Springfield, whose husky voice fueled  
such 1960s hits as ``Son of a Preacher Man'' and ``Wishin' and 
Hopin','' has died after a long battle with breast cancer. She was 
59. 
</P>
<P>
	Springfield died Tuesday night at her home in Henley-on-Thames,  
about 30 miles west of London, said her agent, Paul Fenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was one of the icons of the music industry,'' Fenn said.  
``She was one of the most talented female singers of this 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springfield's first hit was 1964's ``I Only Want To Be With  
You,'' followed by a string of smashes, including ``I Just Don't 
Know What To Do With Myself'' and ``You Don't Have to Say You Love 
Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1990s, she resurfaced with another hit, teaming up with  
the Pet Shop Boys for the single ``What Have I Done to Deserve 
This.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springfield's breast cancer was diagnosed in 1994 shortly after  
she recorded her most recent album, ``A Very Fine Love.''

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Moves To Buy Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- He knew how to get a puck past Andy Moog, but  
can he assemble a multimillion-dollar business deal? 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Lemieux, who led the Pittsburgh Penguins to two Stanley  
Cup championships, wants to rescue the team from bankruptcy, keep 
it in Pittsburgh and collect the $31.4 million he said he is owed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux is seeking investors to raise $40 million to $50 million  
and said he wants to assume more than $60 million in the team's 
bank loans to buy the Penguins and ensure they don't move to 
another city. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has filed papers indicating he is owed $31.4 million in  
deferred compensation, which makes him the club's largest unsecured 
creditor. He said he is willing to exchange some of those millions 
for equity in the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``My objective is to, obviously, get paid and keep the team here  
in Pittsburgh where it belongs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins are about $125 million in debt, or more than the  
franchise's total value. The team filed for bankruptcy protection 
in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux said he expects to submit a plan to buy the team to U.S.  
Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz at a March 19 hearing in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz last week threatened to place the team into  
receivership unless he saw a finance reorganization plan soon. The 
judge said if he converted the Penguins' bankruptcy into a Chapter 
7 liquidation, he would appoint a trustee to run the club until a 
buyer is found. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Marino, current co-owner of the franchise, also plans to  
submit a reorganization plan to Markovitz, even though he has lost 
nearly $40 million operating the club the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Baldwin, the Penguins' primary owner from 1991-97 and  
still a co-owner, also is looking at trying to reorganize the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux offered Marino, a Boston multimillionaire, little  
sympathy for his financial losses. He said Marino isn't a creditor, 
and he made a bad investment. Lemieux is chairman of the committee 
representing the team's unsecured creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino had hoped that Lemieux would join him in rescuing the  
club, which declared bankruptcy in October. But Lemieux, who has

<HEADLINE> Michigan State Is Hoops Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- While the rest of the Big Ten was scrapping and  
scraping, beating each other up in close games and staging more 
drama than a soap opera, Michigan State was rolling through its 
conference schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen straight victories and only one loss -- and that was way  
back in January. Only five games decided by five points or less. 
The No. 2 ranking in the country, its highest since Magic Johnson 
was a Spartan. A second-straight Big Ten title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans (26-4, 15-1 Big Ten) are just better than everyone  
else, the rest of the Big Ten coaches say. And that's probably not 
going to change when the Big Ten tournament starts Thursday at the 
United Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've ever seen a time when there have been so  
many teams that are capable of beating one another in any given 
game. Except Michigan State,'' said Indiana coach Bob Knight. 
``Michigan State has been, throughout the course of the season, 
definitely the very best team in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament begins Thursday with Northwestern (14-12, 6-10)  
facing Penn State (13-13, 5-11); Purdue (19-11, 7-9) playing 
Michigan (11-18, 5-11); and Minnesota (17-9, 8-8) meeting Illinois 
(11-17, 3-13). 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin (21-8, 9-7) will play Iowa (18-8, 9-7) in the first  
quarterfinal Friday. The Hawkeyes are on a mission for coach Tom 
Davis, who is coaching his last season after being forced out by 
the school administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The three top seeds -- Michigan State, Ohio State (22-7, 12-4)  
and Indiana (22-9, 9-7) -- all have byes until the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Ten is hoping for seven bids to the NCAA tournament.  
Michigan State, Ohio State, Indiana, Wisconsin and Iowa are already 
in, but Minnesota and Purdue might have to win a few games this 
week to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	Being the top seed is nothing new for the Spartans. They shared  
the regular-season conference championship with Illinois last year 
and were favored in the inaugural Big Ten tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But they lost to Minnesota in the quarterfinals and were on  
their way back to East Lansing after just one game. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we're trying to do is find a way to win one game in the  
Big Ten tournament, something we couldn't do last year,'' coach Tom 
Izzo said. ``It seems like so few league champs win its conference 
tournament. One thing this team has adjusted to, we've had pressure 
on us all year and we've found a way to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team has different goals than last year,'' he added.  
``Last year, I think we were just happy to get into the tournament 
and I think that hurt us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That and Mateen Cleaves' horrid shooting. There's something  
about the United Center that just doesn't agree with Cleaves, the 
Big Ten player of the year for a second straight season. Maybe it's 
the tight rims. Maybe it's the stiff breeze that occasionally blows 
on the floor. Maybe it's nerves. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reason, the United Center is Cleaves' personal  
demon. He was 2-of-18 in the loss to Minnesota last year. When the 
Spartans lost to Duke in the Great Eight last December, he was 
3-of-17. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cleaves has improved since then, Izzo said. So have the  
Spartans. Though they followed up the loss to Duke with a defeat at 
Connecticut, their only loss since was the conference opener to 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a remarkable accomplishment,'' Wisconsin coach  
Dick Bennett said. ``Every single team, no matter how good you are, 
has a little bit of a slump at some point and time. If one were to 
define what happened to them as a slump, it might have come a 
little earlier and then they got it together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Say what you will, but there aren't many teams in the country  
playing more solidly than Michigan State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there are plenty of reasons, starting with Cleaves. There's  
also Morris Peterson, who leads the Spartans in scoring and was on 
the All-Big Ten first team despite playing off the bench. There's 
also Michigan State's defense and rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	Most importantly, Izzo said the team just plays well together.  
</P>
<P>
	``What has made this team so special for two years is the  
chemistry. Why is it that good? If I had the answer,'' he said, 
``I'd probably be a lot wealthier than I am.''

<HEADLINE> Oasis Settles With Former Drummer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A British judge approved an $880,000 payment  
Wednesday to former Oasis drummer Tony McCarroll to settle a 
lawsuit he brought against the band after he was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarroll, 27, was sacked in 1996 after a fight with singer Liam  
Gallagher in a Paris bar. Oasis members also claimed McCarroll, who 
was replaced by Alan White, took no interest in improving his 
``poor'' drumming. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarroll sued the band for being ``unlawfully expelled from the  
partnership,'' seeking 20 percent of Oasis's annual earnings, 
estimated at $29 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, reached minutes after the case began Tuesday in  
the High Court, was made public after the judge approved it 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarroll played on the band's 1995 debut album, ``Definitely  
Maybe,'' and on the single ``Some Might Say,'' from its second 
album, ``(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from Oasis's attorneys said the band's members were  
pleased with the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their position has always been that Tony should receive fair  
payment for the recordings made while he was in the group, but no 
more,'' the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Molly Ringwald: Doing It Her Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- If there's one thing you can count  
on from former teen star Molly Ringwald, it's to do the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	After a string of hit films (``Pretty in Pink,'' ``Sixteen  
Candles''), she left Hollywood to spend four years in France, 
shooting films and falling in love. 
</P>
<P>
	Since returning to America three years ago, she's chosen many of  
her roles by quality rather than size. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, in the capital of filmdom, she's performing not in front of  
the camera but in a Pulitzer Prize-winning play, ``How I Learned to 
Drive'' by Paula Vogel, co-starring with Brian Kerwin through April 
4 at the Mark Taper Forum of the Los Angeles Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not that many plays come along of this quality for a woman.  
It's a great love story, complete with all of the tragedy,'' the 
31-year-old actress said over breakfast at the tiny Heights Cafe in 
West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	She wore her hair tucked beneath a French-style maroon beret, a  
reminder of her love affair with that country. She plans to return 
to Paris this summer for a long vacation and to visit her boyfriend 
of seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really do feel like, when I'm in France with my boyfriend  
and his family, it's so grounding, it puts everything in 
perspective,'' Ringwald said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be here and get so obsessed with something having to do  
with my career, and then I get there for a week and I can't imagine 
why that was so important,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Paris, she moved to New York. That was where she first  
performed in ``How I Learned to Drive'' for six months 
off-Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was worried when I said I would go back and do it (in Los  
Angeles),'' she said. ``What if it's not fresh and new any more? I 
had to be connected to it to do a good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, she said she's having no trouble. ``There are things  
that come to me during the rehearsal period that I can't believe I 
didn't think of in New York. Also I'm working with somebody 
different, Brian Kerwin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The play cuts back and forth in time as it tells the sometimes  
funny, sometimes painful story of a young woman whose uncle makes 
sexual advances while giving her driving lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	``My character ... feels out of place,'' said Ringwald. ``I  
relate to it so much. I'm not referring directly to the incest, I'm 
referring to the vulnerability, the feeling a little out of 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It (the play) doesn't really have a message but it's great to  
see this character come through fire relatively unscathed. It's a 
very positive, very funny show, believe it or not,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her upcoming movies include ``Killing Mrs. Tingle,'' a  
Miramax-Dimension film with Helen Mirren. She has also filmed 
``Hearts and Bones'' with Keifer Sutherland and Daryl Hannah, as 
well as ``Kimberly,'' with Gabrielle Anwar and Sean Astin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really look more at the project (than the size of the  
role),'' Ringwald said. ``If it's a good project, I don't care if I 
have two lines, I want to be involved. If I'm not sure but the 
character's fantastic, I'll look at it, but it's really hard to be 
good in a bad movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I love film,'' she said. ``It's hard to say I love it more  
(than theater). There's certain things you can do on stage that 
appeal to me as an actor. But if I were to direct, which I hope to 
do someday, it would be film. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's also something nice about directing, that it's not  
based on your personal appearance,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to eat what I like to eat, and I like to drink red  
wine. I want to be healthy, but I don't care about all the vanity 
issues. I want to have a woman's body, not a boy's body, an 
anorexic body. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not overweight but if I starved myself, I couldn't have a  
boy's body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the future, ``Writing and directing are the main things,  
(and) having a family. ... I imagine when I start directing, it 
would be something that I've written, but I want to wait until I'm 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the short-lived series ``Townies,'' her most recent  
television appearance was in the Lifetime TV-movie ``Twice Upon a 
Time,'' in which she sang a duet with her father, a musician. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to sing with his band,'' the actress explained. ``My  
first performance was in front of the state fair in California when 
I was 3 1/2. I had no doubt I was going to be a jazz singer when I 
grew up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was 8 or 9, my family got involved with community  
theater in Sacramento, my brother and sister and I. Then I became 
focused on acting,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After making her professional stage debut in the musical  
``Annie,'' Ringwald played her first film role at 13, in Paul 
Mazursky's ``Tempest.'' She received a Golden Globe nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she steers her career by instinct. ``I really don't  
think it pays to have a grand plan. You have to do what makes you 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Hollywood legend holds that youthful stars have a hard  
time when they grow up, she's made a relatively smooth transition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a period in everyone's life when they struggle  
in their career no matter what their age is, and I'm no 
different,'' the actress said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you don't stay 15, 16 years old forever.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I got through it very well. I've always had a good  
survival instinct. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have been very fortunate,'' she added. ``I can't  
stand it when I read articles about people who moan about their 
lives, and I look at other people around the world, and I just 
having nothing to complain about.''

<HEADLINE> Nancy Reagan Reminisces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ronald Reagan's famous ``Where's the rest of  
me?'' scene in the 1942 classic ``Kings Row'' was playing on a 
television while Nancy Reagan reminisced about better days in the 
presidential suite at the Century Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The memory that comes first to mind is my husband standing on  
the balcony and throwing those paper planes,'' laughed the former 
first lady on a tour of the 8,000-square-foot suite. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure enough, on one of the many walls, there's a framed  
photograph of the Gipper dispatching a paper plane over the side of 
the suite's balcony. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotel recently refurbished the presidential quarters where  
Reagan stayed when visiting Los Angeles in the 1980s, now calling 
it the Ronald Reagan Suite. Also a favorite of other celebrities, 
the suite is now available to anyone -- for $5,400 a night. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan didn't attend the suite's dedication. Alzheimer's disease  
has silenced the Great Communicator, who turned 88 on Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	It took two years to redecorate the Reagan rooms, down to  
details including bottles of Mrs. Reagan's Tubereuse perfume and 
her husband's favorite Atkins Royal Briar aftershave. The Reagans 
were the first to stay in the suite when it opened in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Reagan paused at the 47 photographs chronicling the  
couple's lives during the White House years. One showed them 
floating in their canoe Tru Luv at their Santa Barbara, Calif., 
ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm old-fashioned, I know, but I thought it would be so  
romantic if he was playing a ukulele,'' Mrs. Reagan said, recalling 
the photo taken on their 25th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a ukulele,'' Reagan told her that day.  
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `That's OK, you can hum,''' she laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	The Reagan suite, which takes up the entire 30th floor of the  
hotel's tower, is surrounded by an outdoor terrace and 
floor-to-ceiling windows with panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean, 
Beverly Hills, Hollywood and downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The tower was built with security in mind, including reinforced  
concrete walls, bulletproof glass, a private elevator and secured 
stairwell. It also has a private kitchen and personal butler 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett Hall Images created the theme for the redecorated suite  
with the help of Reagan's office, which happens to be across the 
street, and the staff at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The suite is stocked with Reagan books on night stands in the  
two bedrooms. There are presidential coffee mugs, a bowl of jelly 
beans and even a Gideon Bible inside the armoire in the master 
bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also 15 videos of Reagan movies, including ``Knute  
Rockne, All American,'' ``Bedtime for Bonzo'' and ``Hellcats of the 
Navy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Reagan fondly recalled the day the suite's security  
features helped her put one over on the presidential press corps. 
</P>
<P>
	She had found a post-presidency home in nearby Bel-Air and  
wanted the president to see it. What she didn't want was the media 
to follow them up there. 
</P>
<P>
	So just before a Century Plaza speech, she told the president

<HEADLINE> Tupperware Stretches Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Until Pam Parish attended a Tupperware  
party last year, she hadn't been able to find the plastic utensils 
and food storage products in ages. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Mrs. Parish, a 35-year-old teacher's aide and mother  
of two children, has been rapidly filling her kitchen with 
containers, bowls and modular mates. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time you didn't hear about anybody having a  
Tupperware party,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tupperware has taken Ms. Parish's predicament to heart.  
</P>
<P>
	For many, Tupperware demonstrations are a throwback to an  
earlier generation when TV's Donna Reed was the standard-bearer of 
domestic rectitude. But the changing customer base of working 
mothers with limited time, as well as economic turmoil in 
international markets and a lack of confidence by investors, has 
resulted in declining sales and a plummeting stock price over the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	So the company that popularized at-home sales demonstrations in  
the 1940s has gone beyond its decades-old tradition of selling its 
wares only at Tupperware parties. Tupperware products are moving 
into shopping mall kiosks, onto the Internet and into television 
infomercials in order to make them more accessible to people who 
want them, but can't find them. 
</P>
<P>
	The products also have been modernized with bright colors and  
new features, including characters from Disney movies under a 
two-year-old partnership with the entertainment company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company is saying 'Look, it's 1999. We have to figure out  
how to reach more people. We have to get it in their hands,''' Lisa 
Humphreys, a Tupperware sales manager, said after a recent 
demonstration at Ms. Parish's home in Leesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	The company began allowing sales representatives to sell  
Tupperware products at kiosks in a handful of Orlando shopping 
malls last Christmas and plans to expand to other markets this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	It also began airing infomercials for the first time last year  
and promises that customers will be able to buy Tupperware products 
over the Internet by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tupperware's problems, however, run deeper than not being able  
to get their products into potential customers' hands. 
</P>
<P>
	With 85 percent of its sales coming from outside the United  
States, Tupperware has been buffeted by the economic crises in Asia 
and Latin America. The company, which had $1.08 billion in sales 
last year, has seen revenue slip by more than 10 percent during 
each of the past two years, in part because of currency 
devaluations and the weakened purchasing power of non-U.S. 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Conceding that Tupperware has historically been slow to change,  
chairman and chief executive Rick Goings said the new measures will 
supplement, not replace, the direct sales made at Tupperware 
parties by a million-person sales force in more than 100 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``This enhances attendance at our parties. It helps our core  
direct-selling business,'' Goings said at Tupperware's sprawling, 
100-acre headquarters in Kissimmee. ``We've been fighting stranded 
customers. There is a pent-up demand for the product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tupperware is coming to the changes with a great deal of  
reluctance because the company doesn't want to offend its sales 
force, said Budd Bugatch, an analyst who follows Tupperware for 
Raymond James in St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Tupperware officials don't want to do anything ``that could be  
perceived or used against them as denigrating or slapping their 
existing distributorship in the face,'' Bugatch said. ``But they 
need a higher level of sales, particularly in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall sales slipped by almost 12 percent to $1.08 billion in  
1998. Only the United States, its smallest market, posted a gain (6 
percent) from the previous year. Sales in Asia and Latin America 
decreased by 24 percent and sales in Europe decreased by slightly 
more than 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While the company is still profitable, its income in 1998  
dwindled to $69.1 million, a 39 percent decrease from the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have also lost confidence in the company since it went  
public in 1996 as a spin-off of Premark International Inc. 
Tupperware stock has fallen from a high of $55.50 in December 1996 
to a low of around $11 last year. It is currently selling for 
around $18. 
</P>
<P>
	Goings attributed the volatility to the hype surrounding the  
initial public offering. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Tupperware is moving into shopping mall kiosks, don't  
expect any full-fledged Tupperware stores anytime soon. Over the 
decades, Bugatch said, the company has learned that its products 
don't do well at retailers because it's pricier than the 
competition and management believes the products need to be 
demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
	But the demonstrations fulfill a greater need than just sales,  
Goings said. Most women of an earlier generation learned their 
homemaking skills from watching mothers or grandmothers. In today's 
mobile society where parents and grandparents live across country 
from their children and grandchildren, women are looking to people 
like Martha Stewart for those skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``The role of a local Tupperware woman is being a local Martha  
Stewart,'' Goings said. 
</P>
<P>
	To a certain extent, Mrs. Humphreys, the 33-year-old sales  
manager, feels she is fulfilling that role as she talks about 
recipes, offers health tips and shows off the latest microwaveable 
casserole dish in Mrs. Parish's living room. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-hour demonstration is interspersed with Mrs. Humphreys  
asking trivia questions about food and cooking. The women who 
answer correctly get fake $100 bills they can use to buy Tupperware 
goods during an auction after the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tupperware is a relationship business,'' Mrs. Humphreys said.  
``The kiosks are for people who don't know where to get it from.''

<HEADLINE> USOC Responds to Salt Lake Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Olympics and their scandals are in the  
spotlight in the nation's capital, and a potentially earthshaking 
encore could be in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee planned to respond today to a  
scathing ethics panel report on management of the games and the 
corruption it has fostered, with recommendations expected on how to 
make sure the bribery case of Salt Lake City's 2002 Winter Olympics 
never recurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Stricter rules for American cities bidding for the Olympics and  
tighter reins on USOC programs could be among the items discussed 
by committee president Bill Hybl at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate Commerce Committee announced an April 14  
hearing into the ``scandals plaguing the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ted Stevens, a committee member and the author of the  
federal law governing the Olympics in the United States, is 
considering a bill that would hit the International Olympic 
Committee right in the wallet. 
</P>
<P>
	It would strip the IOC of its tax-exempt status, limit tax  
deductions for IOC sponsorship and move control of billion-dollar 
U.S. television rights fees from the IOC to the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Committee chairman Sen. John McCain said witnesses for  
the hearing would be announced later closer to the April date. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl discussed possible changes with the USOC executive  
committee in a conference call Tuesday night, and it was uncertain 
what specific programs he might announce. 
</P>
<P>
	But sources familiar with the committee said that Hybl would  
recommend far-reaching reforms that would clamp down on the type of 
actions that led to the million-dollar vote-buying scheme in Salt 
Lake's victorious quest for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	More open meetings, internal policy changes on bid-city  
policies, tighter oversight of foreign athlete training programs 
and more athlete involvement in USOC decisions were among the 
topics that Hybl might include in his program, according to the 
sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the changes could be accomplished by executive order,  
but others could require changes to the USOC Constitution, which 
could not be done until an October board meeting, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC board meetings already are open, and committee staff and  
officials must abide by an 11-page ethics code instituted at the 
start of Hybl's term in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl's conference also was expected to address the ethics  
committee report on Salt Lake presented Monday by former Senate 
Majority Leader George Mitchell, which said the Salt Lake scandal 
grew from a ``culture of improper gift giving'' in the Olympic 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	While it criticized the USOC and Salt Lake Olympic officials, it  
saved its harshest words for the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the conduct ``tolerated by the IOC is potentially  
illegal and inevitably corruptive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC should no sooner tolerate improper gifts by candidate  
cities to its members than it would tolerate such gifts by athletes 
to judges,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said the USOC should open an independent office  
to oversee American bid committees; bar bid and candidate cities 
from international assistance programs and strictly follow 
guidelines for USOC-run programs; and strengthen guidelines and 
contracts for U.S. cities seeking the games.

<HEADLINE> Feds Tackle Major Antitrust Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- During the 1980s, a declawed Federal Trade  
Commission would have been unlikely to take on a high-profile 
antitrust case against one of the world's biggest technology 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But in just a week, the commission will face off against Intel  
Corp. in the other major computer-courtroom drama unfolding in 
Washington -- bringing it out from behind the shadow of its sister 
federal antitrust agency, the Justice Department, and its case 
against Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-stakes Intel case is indicative of the changing tide at  
the commission, which almost doubled its antitrust enforcement 
actions from 1997 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	With an aggressive leadership and buoyed by some large  
victories, the commission in recent years has vigorously exercised 
the authority given it by the 1976 Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust 
Improvements Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``The principal reason is not our doing but the world's doing,''  
said Robert Pitofsky, the commission's chairman. ``The behavior by 
some firms really raises antitrust questions more frequently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, a wave of mergers has swept the nation in the past few  
years. More than $1 trillion in mergers occurred in fiscal year 
1998, and nearly 4,800 requests were filed by companies to have 
merger proposals reviewed by antitrust agencies as required by law. 
That is a 28 percent increase from previous years' filings. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, many believe the FTC has been newly aggressive in  
using its antitrust power and in grabbing headlines from Justice, 
harkening back to the 1960s, when it argued many antitrust cases 
before the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Intel case was probably filed in part to say, `Hey, look  
at us! We're here, too, and we can enforce the same laws,''' said 
Bill Shughart, a University of Mississippi economics professor. 
Shughart, who worked at the FTC in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
said he couldn't imagine the commission at that time bringing a 
similar complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission alleges that Intel illegally withheld from three  
companies technical information about its new generation of 
computer chips to ``extort'' valuable technology that the companies 
developed independently. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., makes 
chips that run 80 percent of world's computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts attribute a good part of the agency's new gusto to  
Pitofsky, a lawyer sworn in as commissioner in 1995. In 1994, 
Pitofsky chaired a Pentagon advisory panel to address whether the 
defense industry should be granted antitrust exemptions as it 
downsized in the post-Cold War era. The task force recommended 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman is the first to admit that mergers are not  
intrinsically harmful but rather the inevitable consequence of 
economic globalization, deregulation and an increase in the 
importance of high-tech industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's probably a sensible response to some changes that  
are going on,'' Pitofsky said. ``But independent deals can be very 
much of a threat to consumer welfare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the FTC and Justice both embroiled in big computer cases,  
the fine line that distinguishes the two agencies seems a bit 
blurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally there has been a gentleman's agreement between the  
two agencies not to compete to file lawsuits against the same firms 
at the same time,'' said Shughart. An agency might opt for a case 
based on workload or prior expertise: Airline mergers tend to end 
up at Justice, gasoline companies at the FTC. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies with mergers of a certain size must inform both  
agencies. Historically, the assistant attorney general of the 
antitrust division -- currently Joel Klein -- and the FTC chairman 
chat by phone to determine jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has handled probably two-thirds of all mergers, because  
it has broader jurisdiction on civil matters, said Robert Burka, a 
private antitrust expert. In contrast, Justice can bring criminal 
cases and the FTC can't. 
</P>
<P>
	After its period of vigilant regulation in the 1960s, the FTC in  
the late 1970s moved away from traditional antitrust cases and 
focused instead on trying to stop states from using legislation to 
create monopolies, said Don Boudreaux, president of the Foundation 
for Economic Education in Irvington, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the early 1990s, the commission started to accelerate its  
activity in mergers and predatory pricing, producing a string of 
successes: 
</P>
<P>
	--Staples and Office Depot in July of 1997 called off their $3.5  
billion merger after the commission got a court injunction arguing 
the deal would reduce competition and lead to higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rite Aid Corp. dropped a $1.8 billion deal with Revco in 1996  
after the FTC said Rite Aid would gain too much of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitofsky concedes some deals can create efficiencies that could  
benefit consumers. He cites the alliance between Chrysler Corp. and 
Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, approved in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``We became fairly persuaded there were true efficiencies in  
putting together the two companies,'' Pitofsky said.

<HEADLINE> Hale's Whitewater Trial To Go On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Whitewater figure David Hale lost  
another attempt Wednesday to avoid trial on a charge he misled 
state regulators about the financial health of a burial insurance 
company he owned. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge James Moody ruled that the March 23 trial  
would not constitute double jeopardy, agreeing with a decision 
issued last month by the Arkansas Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale originally was to be tried last April, but a mistrial was  
declared after he checked into a hospital with heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale claimed the mistrial was called because a prosecution  
witness left the country. But Moody agreed with the state Supreme 
Court that the mistrial was due to Hale's uncertain health. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against Hale originated in March 1993 when Hale's  
National Savings Life Insurance Co. was instructed by the Arkansas 
Insurance Commission to correct a $38,757 shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale is accused of moving cash into a company account to create  
the illusion of financial health and then moving the money out. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale made national news when he claimed President Clinton  
pressured him into loaning money for a land deal.

<HEADLINE> Springer Defends Show at Oxford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Jerry Springer evoked the memory of a princess in  
defending his TV talk show, which often erupts into a slugfest 
between guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Princess Diana talked publicly about the same topics featured on  
``The Jerry Springer Show,'' he said Tuesday during a debate at the 
Oxford Union, Oxford University's debating society. 
</P>
<P>
	``She talked about not being faithful in her marriage, she  
talked about bulimia and she talked about even contemplating 
suicide,'' Springer said in an apparent reference to her tell-all 
interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana died in a 1997 car crash with her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed.  
</P>
<P>
	Springer said there is ``a lot of elitism'' in the criticism of  
his show and its guests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because they don't speak the queen's English, because they're  
not rich or powerful or famous and they didn't go to Oxford or our 
Harvard, we seem to call them trash,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not trash, they're human beings,'' said Springer, in  
Britain for a promotional tour.

<HEADLINE> Mont. Court Rules Snake Is a Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- A poisonous snake is a weapon as far as the  
Montana Supreme Court is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	The court on Tuesday upheld the assault conviction and 30-day  
sentence of Michael Roullier, who wielded his pet rhinoceros viper 
at two police officers trying to arrest him in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	When police were called to a disturbance at the apartment where  
Roullier and his girlfriend lived, he grabbed the poisonous African 
snake from a cage, held its head and told the officers to get out 
of his way so he could leave. 
</P>
<P>
	When they refused, he said, ``If this snake bites you, you're  
dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One officer tried to hit the snake with her baton, but Roullier  
shielded it close to his body. When the other officer threatened to 
use pepper spray, Roullier threatened suicide by turning the snake 
on himself. 
</P>
<P>
	After repeated requests, Roullier eventually threw the snake  
behind him and was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	On appeal, Roullier claimed prosecutors proved only that he had  
possession of the snake, not that he used it as a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court disagreed. ``Roullier's manipulation of the snake  
amounted to much more than mere possession,'' Justice Terry 
Trieweiler wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Roullier has already served his sentence.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar soared against the yen Thursday morning  
as falling interest rates battered the Japanese currency. Tokyo 
share prices edged slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.31 yen in morning trading, up 1.13 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its level of 121.77 yen 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 32.88 points, or 0.23 percent, to  
close the morning session at 14,203.24 points. On Wednesday, the 
average closed up 249.30 points, or 1.79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar jumped against the yen for a  
second day after Japan's central bank moved to lower short-term 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Bank of Japan flooded the interbank loan  
market with cash by purchasing short-term government bonds. The 
action drove the call rate, which is used by major banks when they 
make overnight loans to each other, to a record-low 0.02 percent 
from 0.07 percent the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has been buying (dollars) today. The market is  
focusing very much on financial issues,'' said Hajime Sato, 
assistant general manager of the treasury department at Daiwa 
International Trust Bank. ``There are still lots of yen-negative 
factors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is struggling to recover from its worst recession in  
decades. Lowering interest rates reduces borrowing costs for 
companies and could spur investment and spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But declining rates also lower the return to investors on  
everything from bank deposits to government bonds. A country's 
currency often falls when interest rates do on the theory that some 
investors will pull their money out to seek higher returns 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 133.00 yen, up from  
132.25 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, optimism over the lower interest rates and  
stronger dollar helped share prices. Exporters rose on optimism the 
dollar's gain will help them earn more on their overseas sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 6.59 points, or 0.60 percent, to 1,106.40 
points. The TOPIX closed up 7.73 points, or 0.71 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond  
sank to 1.555 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.670 percent, 
driving its price up to 101.98 yen from 101.04 yen.

<HEADLINE> Bush Forms Presidential Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Republican Gov. George W. Bush says the  
formation of an exploratory committee -- to raise money and measure 
voter support for the 2000 presidential campaign -- won't distract 
him from his day job. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving to disarm potential critics, Bush said Tuesday that he  
plans to keep working in Texas until the Legislature ends its 
session on Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've told you all numerous times that I'm going to stay home,  
fight for the tax cuts, fight for a bill to ... end social 
promotion (of students) and do my job as governor,'' he said. 
``Then I will begin to travel around the nation and to listen to 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who made his announcement the same day Republican Pat  
Buchanan declared himself a presidential candidate, declined to 
comment on President Clinton but did say he would set a different 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll let the historians judge President Clinton. ... I intend  
to conduct myself in office the way I have here in the state of 
Texas, to bring dignity and honor to the office,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee announcement surprised no one. Advisers had been  
putting out the word for more than a week, but it was the first 
public step Bush has taken toward a White House race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a formal date in mind yet,'' Bush said of a final  
decision to run. ``I do know that, first things first, I'm going to 
start raising money to determine whether or not there is an 
interest beyond just people coming to Austin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raising money has not been a problem for the man polls rank  
among the front-runners for the Republican nomination. Records show 
he received about $16 million in his 1994 challenge of Democratic 
Gov. Ann Richards, and $17.7 million for last year's re-election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats quickly questioned the sincerity of Bush's pledge to  
focus on business at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``As he has an exploratory committee, there will be more and  
more people coming in to visit,'' said Molly Beth Malcolm, chair of 
the state Democratic Party. ``He has a day job that right now is 
the most critical thing -- looking out for the citizens of this 
state who elected him as governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 52, sounded the ``compassionate conservatism'' themes that  
have become his trademark. Alternating between English and Spanish, 
he said his national vision would echo his Texas record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll have a plan to encourage prosperity. But I want to make  
sure prosperity is for everybody, not a handful,'' he said. ``I 
don't want anybody left behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush often has cited his worries about the impact of a national  
campaign on his wife, Laura, and their twin 17-year-old daughters.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Convicted in Pedophile Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A university professor faces up to 100 years in  
prison after a federal jury convicted him of smuggling a Honduran 
boy into the United States to serve as his personal prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Hersh, a computer sciences professor at Florida Atlantic  
University in Boca Raton, was convicted Tuesday on 10 counts of 
alien smuggling, passport fraud and child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor John McMillan said it was the first federal case  
involving charges of bringing a juvenile into the country for the 
purpose of sex. 
</P>
<P>
	The bespectacled, balding 59-year-old showed no emotion when the  
jury's verdict was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was disappointed, very disappointed'' said defense attorney  
David Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing was set for July 9.  
</P>
<P>
	Hersh's defense claimed the boy was a son born to him out of a  
liaison with a Honduran woman and that his interest was purely 
parental. Tucker argued the Honduran family was bribed into 
testifying against Hersh in return for promises of housing and U.S. 
visas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker said after the verdict the jury likely was influenced by  
sexually explicit images of youngsters that were introduced as 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very difficult thing to do,'' Tucker said. ``When you  
are looking at a photograph like that it's very difficult 
emotionally to separate yourself from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claimed Hersh preyed on the Honduran family, trading  
toys, clothing and money for sex and eventually a chance to bring 
one son, then 15, into this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Letters found on the Hersh's computer detailed how he hoped to  
pass the boy off as his own son and how ``homeless, poor street 
children'' were available for exploitation in developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker said he is considering filing a request for a new trial.

<HEADLINE> Battelle, Roark Head American Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- A year ago, three-time Olympic  
moguls skier Ann Battelle was toying with retirement and Michelle 
Roark was a college student waiting for a chance to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they're World Cup moguls champions and hope to do well in  
the World Championships in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Battelle, 31, who lives in Steamboat Springs, clinched her  
individual moguls title by winning the last event of the season 
Feb. 21 in Madarao, Japan. Roark, 24, a Denver resident, is the new 
title-holder in dual moguls, in which skiers compete side by side 
on a snowy bumps run. 
</P>
<P>
	They left Wednesday along with several teammates after a week or  
so at home. They relaxed, looked for a place to keep the crystal 
globes which go to World Cup champs, made a couple of promotional 
appearances and tried to shoehorn some light training into a busy 
schedule before heading to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always more hectic in Steamboat than when I'm in  
Boulder'' with her boyfriend, Battelle said. ``This was a little 
frantic, but we got everything done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The championships open Sunday in Meiringen, Switzerland and run  
through March 14. Battelle has been fourth in moguls in each of the 
last two World Championships and would like to move up a notch or 
two next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the idea,'' she said before heading to the airport.  
``We'll see what happens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a strange year but, yeah, I'm glad I came back,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Battelle, 31, worked last summer as an intern at the Boulder  
office of Charles Schwab and Co., a major sponsor of the U.S. Ski 
Team. As she worked, Battelle decided she'd return but on a reduced 
competition plan; as it developed, the World Cup schedule unraveled 
and it was a short season, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Roark, the 1998 Nor Am moguls champion while studying petroleum  
refining and environmental science at Colorado School of Mines, won 
the first two World Cups of her brief career over Super Bowl 
weekend and also clinched her title in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Roark trained at Winter Park Resort while Battelle spent a  
couple of easy days running moguls at Steamboat. They also mixed in 
a few promotional appearances with local media. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I got some new skis from Volkl,'' Battelle said. ``I have  
to get used to them, but I think we'll be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Williston, Vt., Battelle never skied moguls until  
she graduated from Middlebury College in 1989 and moved to 
Steamboat Springs. She learned in a hurry, though, thanks to former 
U.S. coach Park Smalley, and by 1992 she made the first of three 
Olympic teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Roark was a figure skater as a youngster but when the financial  
strain became too heavy, she moved to skiing. A former junior 
national champion, she had two knee injuries, which slowed her 
advancement. At 4-11 and just over 100 pounds, she looks like she 
still could compete at the junior level, but after winning the 
NorAm moguls title in '98, she made a big breakthrough this season. 
</P>
<P>
	She won an individual moguls event on Super Bowl Saturday at  
Blackcomb, British Columbia and a dual moguls event the next day to 
give her a springboard to the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect to be going to worlds,'' Roark said, ``so I  
don't have a lot of pressure. I'll try to do my best, which is 
really all I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She enjoyed the chance to be home, she added. ``I'm starting to  
get wrinkles, I've been smiling so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, as she knows, things could be a lot worse. ``Parts of this  
year have been almost like a fairy tale,'' she said, smiling.

riotously colorful and sufficiently, well, animated to be a 
reasonable facsimile of cartoons as you'd view them on your TV set. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, these ``Web Premiere Toons'' come with a  
computer-centric twist: interactivity. Mouse ready? You can choose 
how Pink Donkey might reach the apple dangling from a distant 
branch. You can decide if B. Happy, a ``bluebird of happiness'' 
with a nasty streak, should succeed in his mission to keep the 
bully cat from gobbling Pity Kitty's fish. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just scratching the surface of interactivity in these  
first ones, but our goal is to make good interactive 
entertainment,'' said Sam Register, creative director of Cartoon 
Network Online. ``If you want to just watch a cartoon, shut your 
computer off and turn on the TV and have a cartoon pushed at you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Point taken. Still, when push comes to shove for the toon  
impresarios, it all comes down to pretty much the same thing: 
Create program content that adapts to every media platform, 
broadcast and Internet alike. 
</P>
<P>
	Can WhirlGirl rise to this challenge? A bodacious super-heroine  
who should dress more warmly, she arrived last Friday on Showtime 
in its first original Web series -- with the prospect, of course, of 
a ``WhirlGirl'' spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some months down the road we'll take a look at whether we want  
to develop it as a television project on our (cable) network -- 
either animated or live action,'' said Jeff Morris, Showtime's 
senior vice president for new media. 
</P>
<P>
	The campy ``WhirlGirl,'' a hybrid of ``Wonder Woman'' and ``Max  
Headroom,'' pits its raven-haired, spandex-clad champion against 
the world's vilest media megalomaniac. Morris said the network, 
which acquired the two-year-old online comic strip, has ordered 28 
animated episodes. A five-minute chapter will be posted each Friday 
(www.showtimeonline.com) to accompany that evening's sci-fi block 
of Showtime cable fare. 
</P>
<P>
	But even before Cartoon Network and Showtime took the plunge,  
dozens of Web sites were embracing animation, and no wonder. 
Animation can look good, even great, on the Web. Simple shapes, fat 
lines, bold colors and limited motion can comfortably conform to 
the Web's current technical limitations. By contrast, live-action 
``streaming video'' available on many Web sites looks as fuzzy and 
jumpy as your Aunt Harriet's 8mm home movies. 
</P>
<P>
	What kind of toons wait out there in cyberspace? One site, the  
ambitious Hotwired Animation Express (www.hotwired.com/animation), 
boasts a ``most innovative, surprising and witty'' collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, promising ``a new production every Tuesday,'' the  
Surrey Stick Figure Theatre of Death 
(www.c-cat.demon.co.uk/theatre) ``stages'' drama at its most daftly 
concise. For instance, catch a performance of ``Julius Caesar'' or 
``Don Giovanni'' boiled down to 10 silent seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	As it has for other mavericks, the Web has enabled inventive  
animators to bypass Big Media and take their work straight to the 
Internet's global audience. 
</P>
<P>
	But no less resourcefully, a media juggernaut like Cartoon  
Network is employing the Internet to hold TV tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides ``Pink Donkey and the Fly'' (which proposes that a fly  
can fall in unrequited love with a donkey) and ``B. Happy'' (think: 
a demented ``Touched by an Angel''), Cartoon Network plans to 
introduce three more toon titles, each with two to six episodes. 
New installments will be added each Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, every day, we're thinking about how cartoons will  
be pre-purposed for a converged environment,'' Register said. 
</P>
<P>
	Translated: Hoof-loose and fancy-free, Pink Donkey is a pioneer  
in bringing together TV and the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	YESTERDAY ON `TODAY': NBC rolls out two former ``Today'' show  
hosts later this week and next to fill in for Matt Lauer on 
vacation. On Thursday and Friday, Jane Pauley will be paired for 
the first time with Katie Couric, and Tom Brokaw will join Couric 
on Monday and Tuesday, March 8 and 9. Pauley was co-host of 
``Today'' from 1976 to 1989, and is now co-anchor of ``Dateline

from 1976 to 1981.

<HEADLINE> Fedorov Suspended 5 Games for Slash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Detroit Red Wings forward Sergei Fedorov has  
been suspended for five games without pay for slashing the New York 
Islanders' Zdeno Chara during Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Fedorov will lose $386,178 in pay and will be eligible to return  
March 17 against Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The slash occurred with six minutes left in the Wings' 3-1 loss  
in New York. After Fedorov swung his stick with his right hand and 
struck Chara on the neck, Chara collapsed to the ice and remained 
there for several minutes. Fedorov was assessed a match penalty for 
deliberately injuring an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fedorov has been classified as a repeat offender, given that he  
was suspended for two games on March 26, 1998, for a hit from 
behind on Jason Marshall of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``While Mr. Fedorov acknowledges and regrets the severity of his  
action, the league has made clear this season there is no 
acceptable explanation for administering blows to the head,'' said 
Colin Campbell, the league's senior vice-president and director of 
hockey operations, after Wednesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This suspension also reaffirms the league's position that  
every player is accountable for his stick and that reckless, 
dangerous use of the stick will be met with severe consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fedorov said it was accidental.  
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to get up and the stick just got him,'' Fedorov said  
after the game. ``I was on my back, and I thought the puck was 
under me, so I tried to get up quickly and recover my position. I 
didn't mean to injure him.''

<HEADLINE> Bennett Agues Against Counsel Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The independent counsel law should be allowed  
to expire because it has evolved into ``a monster'' that strips 
public officials of some constitutional rights, one of President 
Clinton's personal attorneys told a Senate committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can this statute be saved? I have come to the view that it  
cannot, and should not be re-enacted,'' Robert Bennett, who 
represented the president in the Paula Jones case, told the Senate 
Governmental Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett told the panel he was not speaking for the president,  
but he appealed for the preservation of constitutional rights of 
public officials investigated under the 1978 law. The statute, he 
said, reverses the rights to be presumed innocent until proved 
guilty and the right to remain silent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ask our public officials to make numerous sacrifices in  
order to enjoy the privilege of public office,'' Bennett said. 
``But sacrificing basic constitutional protections is, I 
respectfully submit, too high a price to ask of anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We created this monster,'' he said later.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked later by reporters how much input Clinton had in his  
testimony, Bennett replied, ``Zero, absolutely zero.'' But he 
acknowledged telling White House Counsel Charles Ruff, ``as a 
courtesy,'' of his intent to testify and of his position. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in as many days that Clinton allies  
attacked the law before a Congress already hostile to its renewal 
without a major overhaul. But without a consensus on how to fix the 
statute, momentum is building to let it expire. In that case, 
investigations of presidents and other high-ranking officials would 
revert to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some senators and House members are considering ways to  
fix the statute. 
</P>
<P>
	Making a case for the law's survival Wednesday was Nathan Lewin,  
who represented Attorney General Edwin Meese during the second 
independent counsel investigation brought under the 1978 law. 
</P>
<P>
	An independent counsel law ``is essential for public confidence  
in government,'' Lewin told the Senate panel. He said he believes 
its major flaws can be fixed by June 30. ``Some law, even if 
imperfect, is better than none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early to start preparing eulogies,'' said Sen. Joseph  
Lieberman of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Watergate-inspired law provides for an independent counsel  
selected by three judges to investigate allegations against 
specified administration officials. Attorney General Janet Reno has 
appointed seven independent counsels during Clinton's six years in 
office, more than any of her predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Reno successfully lobbied for the law's renewal five  
years ago. But with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
investigation and the ensuing impeachment trial, Clinton's allies 
plan a sustained attack against the statute. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's testimony echoed Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder's  
remarks on Tuesday before a House subcommittee. White House 
spokesman Barry Toiv told reporters the president supports Holder's 
call for the law's expiration. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno is scheduled to testify before the Senate panel, led by  
Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said his opinion was shaped mostly by Independent  
Counsel Lawrence Walsh's Iran-Contra investigation, during which 
Bennett represented former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't so much Starr; it was really the Weinberger and the  
Walsh investigation that turned me against it,'' Bennett told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said the law cannot be fixed because, in part, it leaves  
open too many opportunities for abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beware of a lawyer with one case who has an endlessly deep  
pocket to finance it and no time limit in which to get the job 
done,'' Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law also withholds basic constitutional rights from those  
being investigated, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, when the attorney general is conducting a  
preliminary review of the case, the law gives the public official 
``no choice but to forgo his constitutional right to remain 
silent,'' Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the subject refuses to be interviewed by Justice Department  
investigators, the attorney general is forced to conclude that 
further investigation is warranted. But if the subject does 
cooperate, his statements can be used against him if an independent 
counsel is appointed, Bennett said.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Decries Ginsburg's Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- William Ginsburg, a once-obscure malpractice  
lawyer who talked his way to stardom in the Monica Lewinsky case, 
is portrayed as a villain in the new book about the former White 
House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Hired by Ms. Lewinsky's father to represent his daughter,  
Ginsburg is described in ``Monica's Story'' as a relentless 
self-promoter, a meddler in the Lewinsky family's private affairs, 
a purveyor of crude comments and a man who shaded the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg denied the allegations when portions of the book were  
read to him. ``Her need to blame me is understandable,'' he said. 
``She can't blame her parents. They're part of her support tree. So 
I'm a very good person to take shots at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the months after Ms. Lewinsky's name burst into public view  
in January 1998, the Los Angeles attorney was a frequent guest on 
television talk shows and was quoted regularly in newspapers. 
``Suddenly, the media had a new superstar,'' the book said. ``He 
enjoyed his stardom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while Ginsburg was serving publicly as Ms. Lewinsky's  
lawyer, spokesman and bodyguard, he generated increasing friction 
in the Lewinsky family and eventually was replaced by two veteran 
Washington attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg acted as a surrogate father when he accompanied Ms.  
Lewinsky around Washington in the early months of the scandal, 
telling reporters how he knew her when she was an infant. 
</P>
<P>
	``He maintained that he had kissed her inner thighs when she was  
just six days old -- even though in reality he did not meet her 
until she was in her early twenties,'' the book by Andrew Morton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not true,'' Ginsburg said. ``I knew her when she was  
very young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A chapter on Ginsburg begins with his telling Ms. Lewinsky that  
at a dinner in March 1998, President Clinton told the lawyer to 
wish his client ``all the best.'' Ms. Lewinsky was elated that 
``the man she had striven so valiantly to protect still cared ... 
It was only about a month later that she discovered that Ginsburg 
had been pulling her leg,'' the book said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no memory of that,'' Ginsburg replied.  
</P>
<P>
	In the moments when Ms. Lewinsky craved privacy, the book said,  
Ginsburg would tip off the media on her whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1998, he invited Ms. Lewinsky to accompany him to  
Philadelphia for an American Bar Association speaking engagement, 
so she could escape her Washington apartment. Ginsburg told her 
they would visit the Liberty Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Believing they would arrive incognito, Ms. Lewinsky was ``taken  
aback'' to find camera crews, still photographers and reporters 
massed outside their hotel, the book said. One journalist walked up 
and asked when they would be visiting the Liberty Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg said he didn't tip off the media, but speculated that  
the bar association did so. 
</P>
<P>
	The book said Ginsburg told Ms. Lewinsky's father, Bernard, that  
he was trying ``to wean her off the limos'' to move around 
Washington -- when, in fact, she usually walked or took a cab when 
she covertly left her apartment in the Watergate complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth emerged only when she noticed her father signing yet  
another large check to Ginsburg, to pay a bill which included 
$5,000 for limos for 'Monica's security,''' the book related. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg said he did order cars with drivers for Ms. Lewinsky's  
safety because ``hordes of reporters were surrounding us,'' along 
with ``paparazzi'' on motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
	One particular action by Ginsburg led to his firing by the  
Lewinsky family. In ``An Open Letter to Kenneth Starr'' that 
appeared in ``California Lawyer'' magazine, Ginsburg virtually 
admitted that Ms. Lewinsky and the president had sexual relations -- 
although at the time she was standing by her affidavit in the Paula 
Jones case denying an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The article was designed in part to ``bring the president to  
reality,'' the lawyer said.

<HEADLINE> Molly Ringwald: Doing It Her Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- If there's one thing you can count  
on from former teen star Molly Ringwald, it's to do the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	After a string of hit films (``Pretty in Pink,'' ``Sixteen  
Candles''), she left Hollywood to spend four years in France, 
shooting films and falling in love. 
</P>
<P>
	Since returning to America three years ago, she's chosen many of  
her roles by quality rather than size. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, in the capital of filmdom, she's performing not in front of  
the camera but in a Pulitzer Prize-winning play, ``How I Learned to 
Drive'' by Paula Vogel, co-starring with Brian Kerwin through April 
4 at the Mark Taper Forum of the Los Angeles Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not that many plays come along of this quality for a woman.  
It's a great love story, complete with all of the tragedy,'' the 
31-year-old actress said over breakfast at the tiny Heights Cafe in 
West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	She wore her hair tucked beneath a French-style maroon beret, a  
reminder of her love affair with that country. She plans to return 
to Paris this summer for a long vacation and to visit her boyfriend 
of seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really do feel like, when I'm in France with my boyfriend  
and his family, it's so grounding, it puts everything in 
perspective,'' Ringwald said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be here and get so obsessed with something having to do  
with my career, and then I get there for a week and I can't imagine 
why that was so important,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Paris, she moved to New York. That was where she first  
performed in ``How I Learned to Drive'' for six months 
off-Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was worried when I said I would go back and do it (in Los  
Angeles),'' she said. ``What if it's not fresh and new any more? I 
had to be connected to it to do a good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, she said she's having no trouble. ``There are things  
that come to me during the rehearsal period that I can't believe I 
didn't think of in New York. Also I'm working with somebody 
different, Brian Kerwin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The play cuts back and forth in time as it tells the sometimes  
funny, sometimes painful story of a young woman whose uncle makes 
sexual advances while giving her driving lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	``My character ... feels out of place,'' said Ringwald. ``I  
relate to it so much. I'm not referring directly to the incest, I'm 
referring to the vulnerability, the feeling a little out of 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It (the play) doesn't really have a message but it's great to  
see this character come through fire relatively unscathed. It's a 
very positive, very funny show, believe it or not,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her upcoming movies include ``Killing Mrs. Tingle,'' a  
Miramax-Dimension film with Helen Mirren. She has also filmed 
``Hearts and Bones'' with Keifer Sutherland and Daryl Hannah, as 
well as ``Kimberly,'' with Gabrielle Anwar and Sean Astin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really look more at the project (than the size of the  
role),'' Ringwald said. ``If it's a good project, I don't care if I 
have two lines, I want to be involved. If I'm not sure but the 
character's fantastic, I'll look at it, but it's really hard to be 
good in a bad movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I love film,'' she said. ``It's hard to say I love it more  
(than theater). There's certain things you can do on stage that 
appeal to me as an actor. But if I were to direct, which I hope to 
do someday, it would be film. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's also something nice about directing, that it's not  
based on your personal appearance,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to eat what I like to eat, and I like to drink red  
wine. I want to be healthy, but I don't care about all the vanity 
issues. I want to have a woman's body, not a boy's body, an 
anorexic body. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not overweight but if I starved myself, I couldn't have a  
boy's body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the future, ``Writing and directing are the main things,  
(and) having a family. ... I imagine when I start directing, it 
would be something that I've written, but I want to wait until I'm 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the short-lived series ``Townies,'' her most recent  
television appearance was in the Lifetime TV-movie ``Twice Upon a 
Time,'' in which she sang a duet with her father, a musician. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to sing with his band,'' the actress explained. ``My  
first performance was in front of the state fair in California when 
I was 3 1/2. I had no doubt I was going to be a jazz singer when I 
grew up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was 8 or 9, my family got involved with community  
theater in Sacramento, my brother and sister and I. Then I became 
focused on acting,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After making her professional stage debut in the musical  
``Annie,'' Ringwald played her first film role at 13, in Paul 
Mazursky's ``Tempest.'' She received a Golden Globe nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she steers her career by instinct. ``I really don't  
think it pays to have a grand plan. You have to do what makes you 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Hollywood legend holds that youthful stars have a hard  
time when they grow up, she's made a relatively smooth transition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a period in everyone's life when they struggle  
in their career no matter what their age is, and I'm no 
different,'' the actress said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you don't stay 15, 16 years old forever.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I got through it very well. I've always had a good  
survival instinct. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have been very fortunate,'' she added. ``I can't  
stand it when I read articles about people who moan about their 
lives, and I look at other people around the world, and I just 
having nothing to complain about.''
