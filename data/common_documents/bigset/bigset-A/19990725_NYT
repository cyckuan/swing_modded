FRAZIER STILL LEADING THE AY AT PAN AM GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Repubic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba _ At the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, he was
the first of four runners in a United States relay that won a gold
medal. At 20, he led the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a kid,'' Herman Frazier said.
</P>
<P>
   He's not quite a kid anymore. The gray in his close-cropped hair
isn't evident in the long, '70s-style fashion that Frazier wears in
the photos of himself and his 4x400 teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But Frazier is still leading. And still running. He's always
running.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two weeks, Frazier, 43, will be running from
ceremonial functions, to news conferences, to racquetball, to
meetings, to the track, the field and field hockey in his role as
the mission chief of the U.S. delegation at the Pan American Games.
</P>
<P>
   It's more than a single job. A lot more.
</P>
<P>
   Does the table tennis team need a pep talk? Call the mission
chief. Did a weightlifter flunk a drug test? Get a ruling and a
statement from the mission chief. Did a boxer spar a few rounds out
on the street instead of in the ring? Ask the mission chief to
issue an apology and decide on the discipline.
</P>
<P>
   It's a job for a judge, warrior, diplomat and cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   At one time or another, Frazier has fulfilled all of those roles
in a diverse career that has taken him from the Olympic medal stand
to jobs as an associate athletic director at Arizona State,
president of the last Fiesta Bowl and chairman of the Maricopa
County Sports Commission.
</P>
<P>
   With his many hats, Frazier, also a United States Olympic
Committee vice president, has juggled the various responsibilities
from day to day. Now, for the first time, all the duties will be
rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, success will be marked by a huge haul of medals for
U.S. athletes and anonymity for Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   The less heard from Frazier, the better. Silence would mean a
smooth run for a U.S. delegation that is bigger than an infantry
battalion. In all, there are 1,169 _ 750 athletes and 419 coaches,
managers, trainers and physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Almost anything can happen. Almost always, something does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go into it always anticipating a problem,'' Frazier said 10
days ago in an ASU office that overlooks Sun Devil Stadium and is
decorated with photos of the day he won Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier's official title is Chef de Mission. It's French, and it
comes with an image that includes reception lines, toasts,
gift-giving and protocol. But those are the niceties. Frazier's
real job is readiness for any of the unpredictable twists and turns
inherent in international sport.
</P>
<P>
   The 1980 gold medal by the U.S. ice hockey team is famous.
Broken chairs and busted fire extinguishers at 1998 Winter Games
are infamous. For every Miracle On Ice, there are Knuckleheads In
Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any issue, you have to be ready,'' Frazier said. ``If we get
through this with no problems, I would say it would be one of the
greatest things we've ever been able to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give the athletes all the information that you can. You
brief them. You go over all the rules. You have the athletes sign a
code of conduct. We do everything possible. We even have a security
staff. We have a crisis management team. An emergency team.''
</P>
<P>
   If all of this planning sounds more like an invasion than Games,
Frazier is quick to point out problems that have preceded these Pan
Ams, a warm-up for next summer's Olympics at Sydney. In 1996 at
Atlanta, there was the still-unsolved bombing at Olympic Park.
Frazier was an assistant mission chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single U.S. athlete had a beeper,'' Frazier said. ``We
were able to send out a message, through team leaders, to each and
every one of our them. Four hours after the bombing, we knew where
all of our athletes were.''
</P>
<P>
   Beepers have been issued, again. For Frazier, they are a clear
and certain signal that he intends to leave only the competition
subject to chance.
</P>
<P>
   For his career, his role at these Games sends another message.
The job as Pan Am mission chief is something of a steppingstone
within the USOC hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 at Mar del Plata, Argentina, Sandra Baldwin, also of
Phoenix, had the job. Baldwin, also a USOC vice president, will
serve as the U.S. mission chief at Sydney. Then, there is talk that
she will be elected USOC president.
</P>
<P>
   That's a job Frazier says he also would like to have one day.
The next election is scheduled for October, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't run for the next quad (2001 through 2004),'' said
Frazier, who credits his experience and fellow administrators at
ASU with helping him in his Olympic role, an unpaid position.
``There's some talk about by-laws being changed. And there's talk
of Sandra running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not run then. But I would think that if I continue to
run on my volunteer path within the USOC, that one day I could see
myself as president.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, that also might mean Frazier will have to make a
decision. Olympics or college athletics?
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, he was in the hunt for a job as athletic
director at several schools. He was interviewed by Missouri,
California, Oregon and San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   Would he still be interested?
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four years ago, I would have jumped up and told you
`yes,' '' Frazier said. ``Collegiate athletics changes a lot. I've
been exposed to some other things. I'm not sure I can answer that
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some races are won by not answering.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier has a history of being at his best while leading a team.
It's no coincidence, perhaps, that the most prominent photos in his
office are those of him and teammates on that gold medal-winning
relay. His bronze medal in men's individual 400 meters at Montreal
is almost forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three years later, he is running a different race the
same way.
</P>
<P>
   In the lead. &QL;

RYAN FINALLY HAS TO TALK ABOUT HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time I visited the Texas Rangers clubhouse, on the day
of a game, a copy of the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum yearbook
occupied each player's chair.
</P>
<P>
   With the book was a message:
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can depend on your continued assistance in our
effort to maintain our attraction as the ultimate experience for
baseball fans.'' Signed Edward Stack, president, Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan picked up the gift. Read the note. ``Sure Ed,'' his
faint smile said, ``I'll do whatever I can.'' As if the future Hall
of Famer, then in his 24th major league season, hadn't done enough
already.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has spent time in his company has an impression of
the man who today will put on a necktie and have to stand up and
talk about himself at the induction ceremony at Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan doesn't profess to be a public speaker. He never has
been much for speech-making although he gave a pretty good one a
few years ago at the Texas Farm Bureau convention in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   But the topic of his talk wasn't himself or his place in
baseball history. Delegates in the audience (many hoped Nolan would
run as a Republican for state agriculture commissioner; he didn't)
were farmers, and cattle ranchers. Hard-working folks, stewards of
the land. Weathered faces. Callused hands.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan never seemed comfortable talking about being a legend.
Excited about strikeout No. 5,000? How about 300 wins?
</P>
<P>
   How many no-hitters now _ ``seven''?``''
</P>
<P>
   Lounging at his locker, or pedaling a stationary bike, Ryan
would look at you and blink his soft brown eyes. He appeared so
unaffected by all the fuss you wondered if he had been around his
cows too long.
</P>
<P>
   Given his modesty, it will be interesting to hear what he says
about his life and times in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   For years, many discounted Ryan by labeling him as a strikeout
king, even though he was that, the greatest of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Critics pointed out that the righthander lost almost as many
games as he won. Never mind that only a handful of pitchers in
history won 20 games with a last-place team. Ryan spent much of his
career in the wrong place at the wrong time with the right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   His greatness is no longer open to argument, if it ever was.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan won 324 games. That number speaks for itself. It says it
all.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets made a mistake. They traded him and three others for
Jim Fregosi, who hit .265 lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, which is 20/20, the Angels look even more foolish.
Buzzie Bavasi allowed Ryan to leave the club in 1979 after a 16-14
season. Bavasi said he could replace Ryan's fastball with two 8-7
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dunno if he ever found his 8-7 pitchers,'' the Alvin, Texas,
farm boy said, coming as close as he ever would to taking a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astros treated Ryan as if he were an antique car.
General Manager Dick Wagner, fearing Nolan's arm might fall off,
put a limit on his pitches. More than once Ryan would be working on
a one- or two-hitter in the fifth inning when he reached his quota.
That was it. Ryan came out.
</P>
<P>
   If Bavasi looked stupid, Houston owner John McMullen looked
worse. He looked cheap when he didn't re-sign Ryan after the 1988
season. The snub ranks as one of baseball's worst financial and
public-relations decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan wasn't a showman but he possessed a star quality all his
own. He had clean-cut looks and an All-America label. His career
spanned the administration of six U.S. presidents. He could throw a
baseball 95 mph. When he was 45 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Now, elected to the Hall of Fame in his first year of
eligibility, Ryan will stand behind a microphone and thank baseball
for giving him the opportunity to play a game he loves, for more
years than he ever thought possible.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think for a minute he isn't thrilled, even if he speaks in
the plain-talking tone of a fellow on radio delivering the
farm-and-ranch report. &QL;

CARDINALS TURNING THE PAGE  
 TOBIN SAYS THIS GROUP WILL BE BETTER THAN '98 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Their off-season didn't go as planned. Not even
close.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals knew they wouldn't be able to re-sign all of their
unrestricted free agents, but they didn't expect to lose their best
offensive lineman, all-time leading receiver and top tackler of a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Cardinals open training camp on Friday minus
offensive tackle Lomas Brown, fullback Larry Centers and linebacker
Jamir Miller, they also will be fighting a perception that they are
a worse team than the one that reached the second round of the NFC
playoffs last January.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin understands why some think the Cardinals,
coming off their first playoff victory in 51 years, have dropped a
notch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we are as good today as we were,'' he said.
``But I think that with our free-agent (signees), our draft picks,
some of our young guys . . . by the time we start the regular
season in Philadelphia, we will be better than we were a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say right now we're better, you can't, because of the
losses we've had. But I feel we will be better. We've gotten better
athletically, and now it has come to a point that some of our young
people have to step up and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals already were one of the league's youngest teams
before Brown, a 15-year pro, and Centers, a 10-year pro, exited.
With them gone, wide receiver Rob Moore, 30, is the only player on
offense 30 years or older. All-Pro cornerback Aeneas Williams, 31,
is the only starter on defense in his 30s.
</P>
<P>
   A youth movement is fine, but with Brown, Centers and Miller
gone, who are going to be the leaders?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have guys who will step up, not only on the field
but off the field,'' Tobin said. ``I think we still have solid
leaders on the football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``On defense, Aeneas has been one of the (best) leaders. Not
only does he lead by example on the field, but also by his work
ethic, his manner in the huddle. Ronnie McKinnon, by the nature of
his position at middle linebacker, showed a lot of leadership last
year and will take on even more this year. I think Andre Wadsworth,
a guy coming into his second year, needs to become a leader on the
defensive line. Safeties Tommy Bennett and Kwamie Lassiter are more
confident of their positions on the team and will assert more
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, more will fall on (quarterback Jake Plummer). . .
. Sometimes you can have too much talk in the huddle, and you have
only one general. Jake is our general.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the team, position by position, heading into
camp: &QL; 
Quarterback &QL; 
Plummer is one the few offensive stars the team has had in its 11
years in the Valley. He was given an NFL-record $15 million signing
bonus, but he's far from a finished product. He can't have another
season in which he throws 20 interceptions. Still, few are better
in the clutch. He kept finding ways to pull games out last season.
Dave Brown, former New York Giants first-round pick, is a capable
backup who seldom had to play a year ago. Rookies Chris Greisen and
Graham Leigh, the Mesa Dobson product, will have to show in
training camp that they are capable of being the No. 3 guy. &QL; 
Running back &QL; 
Tobin gushes when he talks about starter Adrian Murrell, who has
had three consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. ``He had his two best
games of the year in the playoffs and played better than anyone on
our football team in the (playoff) game against Minnesota,'' Tobin
said. Murrell will get the bulk of the carries, but the coaches
expect Mario Bates, who became a short-yardage specialist, and
second-year pro Michael Pittman to push for playing time. Pittman
is expected to take over Centers' pass-catching responsibilities. &QL; 
Fullback &QL; 
For years, Cardinals coaches have been trying to find a blocking
fullback. They hope they have one in fourth-round draft pick Joel
Makovicka of Nebraska. Rookie Dennis McKinley and veteran Rod Brown
also will get a chance here. If all else fails, Pittman could be
used in some situations. &QL; 
Wide receiver &QL; 
As long as the Cardinals don't have any trouble re-signing Moore,
this should be the strongest position on the team. He and Frank
Sanders are among the best one-two combinations in the league. Top
draft pick David Boston, also unsigned, is expected to give the
team a deep threat. The big battle here will be for the fourth and
fifth receiver positions. Those competing are Andy McCullough, the
most valuable player of the NFL Europe World Bowl; Chad Carpenter,
Ronnie Anderson and Kevin Drake. &QL; 
Tight end &QL; 
This was a position of strength until Chris Gedney (colon surgery)
was lost for the year. Now, Johnny McWilliams is the only
experienced tight end back from last season. The coaches are very
high on second-year pro Terry Hardy, but he played sparingly as a
rookie. Veteran Derek Brown, former Giants No. 1 pick, has been
added to replace Gedney. ``We're really going to miss Chris,''
Tobin said. ``He's a hard-working guy. He's a smart guy. He is a
very calming guy on the field.'' &QL; 
Offensive line &QL; 
A year ago, the much-maligned line made big improvement. They gave
up 28 fewer sacks than the previous season. All of the line except
Brown return but finding a starting left tackle will be one of the
biggest projects in camp. Veteran Matt Joyce, who has spent most of
his Cardinals career as a backup, will get the first crack at the
job. But Anthony Clement, a second-round pick a year ago, and
unsigned rookie L.J. Shelton of Eastern Michigan also will have an
opportunity to start. ``I wouldn't feel uncomfortable with a rookie
left tackle,'' Tobin said. ``A lot of guys have done it and played
very well. What we've got to do is find out who our left tackle is.
Once we determine (the starter), we may move one of the guys to
another position.'' &QL; 
Defensive line &QL; 
``As a coach, you don't like to have unknowns,'' Tobin said. ``This
is the one area with more uncertainty than any position on the
team.'' That's because tackles Eric Swann and Mark Smith likely
won't be available when camp opens. Swann still is rehabilitating
his knee and Smith is a holdout. Big things are expected from ends
Simeon Rice, who is in the last year of his contract, and
Wadsworth, last year's first-round pick who missed all of training
camp because of a holdout. There is a lot of depth on the line.
Rashod Swinger and Brad Ottis, who missed last season with a foot
injury, could start for many teams. Veterans Bernard Wilson and
Carl Simpson are former starters who filled in admirably last
year. &QL; 
Linebacker &QL; 
Tobin scoffs at those who think linebacker is the weakest position
on the team. ``Rob Fredrickson has proven he can play and start in
this league,'' Tobin said of Miller's replacement. ``Rob's
strengths are different than Jamir's. He's an excellent pass
defender who can cover people out of the backfield and tight ends.
He's not as good a run defender as Jamir, but we've been very
impressed with him. Fredrickson, a former first-round pick of the
Oakland Raiders, will start at left outside linebacker, with
McKinnon in the middle and underrated Patrick Sapp and Tony McCombs
battling for the other outside spot. &QL; 
Defensive back &QL; 
After being moved to cornerback from safety, Corey Chavous was so
good the last month of the season, he will open camp ahead of Tom
Knight at the right cornerback spot. There are few NFL cornerbacks
better than Williams. Bennett, the starting strong safety, and free
safety Lassiter were great down the stretch last season. Bennett
returned an interception for a touchdown in a December victory over
Philadelphia and sealed the Dallas playoff win with a 42-yard
interception return. Lassiter had four interceptions in the
playoff-clinching victory over San Diego and wound up leading the
NFC in interceptions with eight. &QL; 
Special teams &QL; 
Place-kickers Joe Nedney and Chris Jacke each won three games with
late field goals. So, as a result, they will get an equal chance in
camp to win the starting job. Scott Player wasn't one of the NFC's
top-10 punters last season, but it was his first year. The return
specialist jobs are wide open. Boston will get a chance to win the
punt return job. Bates, Pittman and Arizona State product Terry
Battle will get a shot to be the kick returner. &QL;

YOUNT BELONGS IN COOPERSTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. - The overwhelming consensus is that Robin
Yount embodies everything a Hall of Famer should be. So it's only
fitting he is a rare first-ballot inductee, set for enshrinement
today.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what typifies a Hall of Famer? It's a question that has
been debated for decades. Is it all about statistics? What about
what a player brings or means to his club?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, talent is the top criteria for induction. But there
have been many talented players who never reached Cooperstown's
hallowed halls.
</P>
<P>
   To understand Yount and what he brought to the Milwaukee
Brewers, here's an anecdote that typifies what he meant to his
franchise, but more important, to his teammates:
</P>
<P>
   Late in Yount's career, the 18th season of 20, there were two
weeks remaining in the 1991 season and the Brewers were, as was
usually the case during Yount's tenure, flailing away near the
bottom of the American League East standings.
</P>
<P>
   Yount sat on a training table in decrepit Milwaukee County
Stadium with a needle in his right knee. Ounces of fluid were being
drained from the knee, and Yount was in obvious pain.
</P>
<P>
   With nothing left to prove personally and the Brewers going
absolutely nowhere, Yount was back in center field two days later,
ready to play out the remaining dozen or so games. Even though not
a single person would have objected, Yount gave no thought to
punching his timecard and calling it a season a little early.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see someone do that, you appreciate what being a
major leaguer is all about,'' said then-young and impressionable
teammate Darryl Hamilton, now with Colorado. ``I wish every young
player in the game today had a Robin Yount to learn from. Without
him as my role model, I'm not sure where I'd be right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me and all the Brewers how to hustle, the right
attitude and how to play when you're hurt. I have more respect for
Robin Yount than anyone I've ever come in contact with in this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount only knew one speed during his career: all-out fast
forward. Whether he was on a baseball field or riding an off-road
motorcycle _ his passion away from the diamond _ Yount only knew
how to let the throttle go all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Running out a routine grounder to second base meant a sprint to
first base. The same went for a shot to the gap in right-center
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's how I learned to play the game,'' said Yount, who lives
in Paradise Valley and has become an entrepreneur with several
Valley businesses to his credit, including the Leinenkugel's
Brewery next to Bank One Ballpark. ``For me, there was no other way
to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``One goal I always had, and it was my only goal, was to play
every pitch like it was my last one.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount, a shortstop for the first 11 years of his career, landed
on the disabled list just three times but had the misfortune of a
deteriorating shoulder. No problem, he told the Brewers. From that
point on, he was a center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Yount joined Hank Greenberg and Stan Musial as the only players
ever to be named Most Valuable Player at two different positions.
</P>
<P>
   Yount learned big-league life at the tender age of 18 when the
Brewers decided to give the ``Kid,'' still his nickname, the
everyday job in 1974. After some natural anxiety and bouts with
insecurity, Yount settled in for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   He was a reluctant leader who chose his words carefully. But
make no mistake, his words carried the weight of the franchise
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember clear as day during my rookie year, we were in
Cleveland and we were losing by four in the ninth,'' Hamilton said.
``I was leading off the inning and swung at the first pitch,
grounding out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went three-up, three-down in the ninth and lost. He stopped
me in the tunnel to the clubhouse and said, `Don't you ever swing
at the first pitch when we're down in the ninth.' It was all he
said. To this day, I have never, ever swung at the first pitch when
we're down.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also the time when Yount pulled aside a young
outfielder late one season, asking him if he had any incentives in
his contract. The young player, making the then-big-league minimum
of $68,000, said he had one if he played in eight more games.
</P>
<P>
   The two never talked about it again, but the young outfielder
found himself in the lineup for eight more games and received his
additional $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about Robin, the team always came first,'' said Paul
Molitor, a teammate of Yount's for 15 years. ``It's the way we all
learned how to play the game in those days. I'm not certain that
same feeling is still in the game these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the franchise is ready to celebrate the first true
Brewers enshrinement into Cooperstown, it should be a glorious time
in southeastern Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   However, the deaths of three iron workers at the construction
site of the club's crown jewel, Miller Park, have dampened spirits
throughout the organization. Once again, though, Yount is coming to
the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community has grieved together and hopefully we can
celebrate together,'' Brewers President Wendy Selig-Prieb said.
``This is a time for everyone to band together. This is a special
time for Robin and for baseball in Wisconsin. If anyone personifies
the spirit of of the Milwaukee Brewers, it's Robin Yount.'' &QL;

COUNTDOWN TO COOPERSTOWN ENDS FOR GEORGE BRETT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY FLANAGAN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ The countdown is over. Today is finally the
day for George Brett, and the biggest mystery remaining isn't what
he'll say in his speech at the Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   It's how soon into that 10-minute speech the tears will begin to
flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the odds I'll make it through the whole thing?''
Brett asked with a hearty laugh Saturday. ``Not good, I'm sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an emotional guy, and this is an emotional event. I just
hope I get through most of it before the waterworks start.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett isn't alone in that regard. Leslie, his wife, is crossing
her fingers as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he makes it through, because the minute he loses it and
starts (crying), I'm going to lose it, and so will everyone else,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brett certainly will have plenty of time to compose himself
before it's time to speak at today's ceremony. His close friend and
fellow inductee, Robin Yount, asked and was allowed to go first.
</P>
<P>
   Brett found out Saturday that he would speak last. The
ceremonies start at noon Central time. The Royals, who play Oakland
at 12:05 p.m. at Kauffman Stadium, wanted Brett to speak last so
they could simulcast the ceremony on the JumboTron.
</P>
<P>
   Brett also learned that he would not be allowed to have his
brother Ken introduce him at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought you could have someone do that for you,''
Brett said. ``I guess they don't do that anymore. Oh, well.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't mind going last. It's probably best going last.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, Brett's nerves have calmed regarding
his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been great about that,'' his wife said. ``He doesn't seem
overly worried about it. He worked on it when we drove here from
Albany (N.Y.), and I've tried to help a little. It'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett also received a sentimental boost from the son of the late
Charley Lau, who was Brett's batting mentor and close friend.
Charley Lau Jr. is here and presented Brett with a 1981 World
Series ring that belonged to his father, then a coach with the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's special,'' Brett said, showing off the ring. ``But he
didn't give it to me. It's just for the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Brett's many thank-yous planned for today, special
acknowledgment will be given to Lau.
</P>
<P>
   ``That definitely will be the toughest part to get through,''
Brett said. ``That and the part about my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett's father, Jack, died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   At least Brett found some time to laugh and enjoy the moment
Saturday. He started the day by participating in a golf tournament
with a shotgun start _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   One of the tournament's assistants brought a real shotgun to the
hole where Brett started. Brett grabbed the gun and playfully
warned photographers, ``You might want to back up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, just before Brett fired a shot into the air, he quipped,
``Boys, there's a new sheriff in town.''
</P>
<P>
   After the tournament concluded, Brett grabbed some lunch and was
whisked away to a news conference near the hall. Brett, Yount and
inductee Orlando Cepeda spent nearly an hour talking about their
election into the hall and their places in baseball history. The
other inductee, Nolan Ryan, addressed the media earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Brett's next stop was a 1 1/2-hour autograph session
for children 12 and under. He signed hundreds of autographs,
prompting one boy to ask, ``Doesn't your hand ever get tired?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, does it ever,'' Brett said, feigning exhaustion.
``Especially with this big Yankees ring on this finger. That's a
heavy ring. That's real gold, you know, not that fool's gold the
Royals used.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett finally was able to have some time to unwind in the early
evening, though the anticipation of today's ceremony and the week's
frantic pace clearly had caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, I'm gassed,'' he said. ``I'm beat. Everyone told
me this would be the most stressful weekend I'd have. And it's
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot like getting married, because no one actually
enjoys their wedding. It's too much stress. You just want to kiss
the bride and get on with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think what will really be neat is coming back here next
year when I really have the time to relax and enjoy it. That's
going to be great.''

THERE'S LIFE IN THE GEORGE BRETT STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POSNANSKI  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Across America these days, newspapers print
stark little boxes to summarize George Brett. That's what
newspapers do. Space is precious. We must boil down entire
lifetimes into short, flat, unromantic bursts of words.
Michelangelo: Painted ceiling. Gandhi: Preached nonviolence. Attila
the Hun: Pillaged.
</P>
<P>
   Now those absolute words are for George Brett. Today, in
Cooperstown, he becomes the first Kansas City Royals player to be
inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, the most hallowed
cathedral of American sports. Brett goes in with a regal class, a
seven-man group that includes Nolan Ryan, who struck out more
batters than any pitcher, and Robin Yount, who played baseball with
such passion and love that Brett himself named his son Robin. More
than 40,000 people will flood Cooperstown, the largest crowd ever.
</P>
<P>
   Now, TV stations all over America condense Brett into 30-second
sound bites that fit neatly between the baseball scores and the
weather. Newspapers sum up Brett with tiny charts and bloodless
numbers. Here, for instance, is the substance of the chart that
appeared in a Cincinnati paper:
</P>
<P>
   George Brett:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ranks 13th on baseball's career hit list (3,154 hits).
</P>
<P>
   _ A 13-time all-star.
</P>
<P>
   _ First player to win batting titles in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   _ Won Most Valuable Player award in 1980, batting .390.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hit famous ``pine tar'' home run in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   _ Won one Gold Glove.
</P>
<P>
   That's all. Look at that. That seems so tame, doesn't it? That
feels so lifeless.
</P>
<P>
   George Brett played 21 years of big, beautiful, breakneck
baseball. He knocked over second basemen and bashed baseballs off
walls and dived into dugouts, and, all along, he carried Kansas
City along in his back pocket with a can of Skoal.
</P>
<P>
   Today, George Brett goes into the Hall of Fame, and the charts
that appear in every town remind people that he was once a fine
baseball player who had 3,154 hits and once hit the famous ``pine
tar'' home run.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the story, though. The story is about how George
Brett, this California kid with the sweet batting swing, left his
cleat marks all over our hearts. Few, if any, of George Brett's
fans can explain exactly why he got inside us. Chantal Mahler lives
on the north side of Chicago, and when she was young she decided to
love the Royals for elusive reasons that only children can
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, it began her 20-year love affair with Brett, a
fascination that led her to construct scrapbooks and collect more
than 200 Brett baseball cards and travel hundreds of miles just to
see him play. She cried the day Brett retired.
</P>
<P>
   Why though? Surely, it has something to do with the way he
played, how he wore the black paint under his eyes and ripped his
pants when he slid and never lallygagged his way down the
first-base line.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was the player we all wanted to be,'' Buck O'Neil says.
``Yes. In our hearts, when we thought about playing baseball, we
thought about playing baseball like George Brett.''
</P>
<P>
   He lived hard. He played hard. But other players did, too. There
was something more. Something about connecting with people. Bev
Strahm fell for Brett in 1971, when her family caught a glimpse of
him in a minor-league game in Billings, Mont. Nearly 27 years
later, Strahm waited in line for two hours with her grandchildren
so they could get his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Some years after Matt Stumm was paralyzed in a car accident, he
found true love. He invited his hero, George Brett, to the wedding,
though he did not really know Brett. They had just brushed
shoulders once, after a party.
</P>
<P>
   Brett dropped a note saying he could not attend, but he offered
congratulations and some inspiration, and he promised to get
together someday for a beer. Stumm was so overwhelmed that even now
he tries to convince his wife, Susan, that their first child should
be named George Brett or Georgetta Bretta.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Brett never let me down,'' writes Andy Kerscher, of
Akron, Ohio, whose love of Brett began with a simple choice. His
father brought home two baseball bats _ a Mickey Mantle bat and a
George Brett bat. His father was surprised and no doubt
disappointed when Andy went for the Brett bat. Fathers have their
heroes. Sons have their own.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, it has something to do with the way Brett played. Surely
it has something to do with his good looks and his easy smile and
the way he endured pain. But, finally, there was something dazzling
about Brett, something that made him different than any player of
his time: He played best under the most intense pressure, under the
brightest lights.
</P>
<P>
   He hit his best in the World Series and playoff games. There was
the day he almost single-handedly beat Toronto in a playoff game
with two homers and a breathtaking defensive play. He hit three
home runs off Catfish Hunter in a playoff game at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Rios watched that game in a West Side bar, with so many of
the hard-working friends who loved baseball. Rios still remembers
the smell of the beer and the smoke and the sound of the place,
especially when someone yelled, ``Drinks on the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett always delivered in the biggest moments. That's what the
famous ``pine tar'' home run was all about. Beyond the craziness,
it was a game-winning home run off Goose Gossage, who, as Dan
Quisenberry wrote, threw harder than God.
</P>
<P>
   Brett had hit an even bigger home run off Gossage earlier, the
one that sent the Royals to the World Series. ``That,'' Tom Watson
says, ``is when I knew there was something special about George
Brett.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, it seems, fans remember Aug. 17, 1980, when George Brett
hit a double that pushed his average beyond .400. A million people
claim to be among the 40,000 in the stadium that Sunday afternoon,
in the heat and haze, when Brett tipped his cap while standing on
second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me who won the game, I couldn't tell you,'' says
Mark Payne, who now works for the Armed Forces Network in Italy.
``But I can tell you that I have never, ever felt that sheer,
collective excitement again.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Kost remembers it differently. He was scrambling with a
radio in Colorado, desperately trying to pick up the Royals game.
At the very last second, his radio clicked with a station in
Scottsbluff, Neb. Kost heard Fred White and Denny Matthews call
Brett's glorious double.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the odds?'' Kost asks, and his love of Brett was
forever sealed.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many more stories, so many more memories. Every fan
who watches George Brett give his acceptance speech today will be
thinking of something different. Something personal. That's what
George Brett was. He was your own, personal ballplayer.

RED SOX, NIXON PLAY HOME RUN DERBY

<P>
   DETROIT _ For 20 minutes before Saturday's game, Red Sox hitting
coach Jim Rice worked with rookie Trot Nixon. ``Ground balls,
ground balls, he had to stop hitting those ground balls,'' said
Rice.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nixon, Rice's advice was basic. ``Stop rolling my
top wrist over,'' Nixon said, and many of those frustrating 4-3
ground outs might be eliminated. ``When I roll my top wrist over,
you get those grounders.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed was dramatic as Nixon matched his home run output
for the season, hitting three round-trippers to lead the Red Sox to
an 11-4 pelting of the Tigers as Boston hit seven homers, one shy
of the team record. Not since Fred Lynn's three-homer, 10-RBI game
here in 1975 has a Red Sox rookie hit the trifecta. The win,
coupled with Toronto's 6-5 loss to the White Sox, again puts the
Red Sox atop the wild-card hunt, .001 ahead of the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never hit three homers in a game,'' said Nixon. ``Never .
. . not in the minors . . . never.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox were slip-sliding into oblivion prior to Saturday's
game, having won only three of their last 11, and more bad news
came with the disabling of ace Pedro Martinez prior to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the bad things,'' said starter and winner Mark
Portugal (6-7), ``veterans know it's the time to step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidentally rookies do, too. Nixon hit rock bottom April 23,
with a batting average of .061, and finished the opening month of
the season at .105. As late as June 16, the right fielder was at
.224. But in the five weeks since, Nixon is hitting a robust .382,
putting him at .279 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a foxhole guy,'' said manager Jimy Williams, praising the
25-year-old's courage and perseverance. The fact that Williams
stuck by him through April and May, said Nixon, ``meant everything
to me. I can't tell you how much Jimy and the coaching staff and
the other players have done for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The home runs, though, were another matter. Nobody, least of all
Nixon, was expecting them. The Tigers were leading, 1-0, courtesy
of a home run by light-hitting Luis Polonia to lead off the game
(``You never like to do that,'' said Portugal, ``but it was only
one run.'') and Boston's prospects for the game (and season) seemed
as dark as the thunderclouds rolling in from left field.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox tied the score in the second on a throwing error
by Detroit third baseman Frank Catalanotto, filling in for the
injured Dean Palmer (back), and then Nixon stepped to the plate
with two on. A near gale was blowing in from left field when Nixon
recalled Rice's advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best (of the home runs),'' said Nixon of his
three-run shot, ``because it was right into the teeth of the wind
and I hit it hard. And it put us ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding a 4-1 lead, the Red Sox' dark fortunes of late seemed to
continue. The well-advertised thunderstorm finally struck at the
end of the second inning, forcing a 54-minute delay and raising the
question of whether Portugal (back) would be able to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny thing,'' said Portugal, ``but when I went down to the
bullpen to warm up for the second time, I had better stuff in the
bullpen then. The delay didn't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   So Portugal was able to pitch a strong five innings (7 hits, 3
runs, 1 walk, 5 strikeouts) for the bedraggled pitching staff.
Derek Lowe, who grew up minutes away in Dearborn, pleased a large
group of family and friends with four innings of relief, picking up
his fifth save.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox hitters, meanwhile, followed Nixon's lead and sent the
pitches of Detroit starter Jeff Weaver (6-6), here, there, and
everywhere. Nomar Garciaparra homered to left on a 1-0 count in the
third and Boston exploded with three homers in the fourth, Nixon
with his second, a blast to left-center, and back-to-back homers by
Brian Daubach, a two-run job, and Garciaparra's second of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The five homers allowed by Weaver tied Don Mossi's Tigers
record, set in 1961 against Cleveland. Weaver has now allowed 14
homers this season, but nine have come against the Red Sox. Nixon's
third home run, in the eighth, this one to right field, and Troy
O'Leary's blast to right-center in the ninth, upped the Red Sox'
homer total to seven.

MARTINEZ PLACED ON DISABLED LIST 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MARTINEZ-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Pedro Martinez pointed to his right armpit and said,
``Way inside my shoulder, down in here. I had never felt that
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Martinez, who Saturday was placed on the 15-day disabled
list with swelling in two muscles behind his rotator cuff, reached
for the top of his pitching shoulder with his left hand and said,
``Also back here, where the tendons hold the bone to the shoulder,
those are the areas that are inflammated, the ones where I was
pushing a little too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who had a magnetic resonance imaging Friday that
revealed the swelling, already had missed the first start of his
career on this trip to Detroit and now was headed for the DL, also
for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The move was made retroactive to last Monday, the day after
Martinez's worst start of the season, against Florida: 3 2/3 IP, 12
H, 9 R, 8 ER, 3 K, 0 BB. Martinez will be eligible to come off the
DL Aug. 3, when the Red Sox host the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez underwent the MRI at the University of Massachusetts
Medical Center in Worcester, even though he felt it was
unnecessary. ``I thought I was going to be pitching in Detroit,''
he said. ``I felt good after throwing (Thursday) and I felt I could
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox' decision to allow him time to heal prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, to me, it was a little bit refreshing to see the
MRI,'' said Martinez. ``But just knowing that you'll have to sit
one more start was not good news to me. I'm a stubborn person, very
greedy. I don't like to give up my start like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was alternately hopeful and concerned about his
condition. In one breath, the ace said, ``Hopefully, I'll go out
there and be better the next time.'' Then, he said, ``They told me
the inflammation could keep growing and anything could happen from
there on. And that's what I didn't want to go through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been seven years now that I went out there and I never
left the field. I will sit with this for 15 days and I hope have
another (seven years).''
</P>
<P>
   He had pitched ``so many innings in the last five, six years,
that it's almost impossible to understand this is the first time
I've had something wrong with my shoulder. Just pitching . . .
pitching time . . . I'm getting older.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he ``can't guarantee'' that he will return the
same pitcher that dominated in the first half of the season, ``but
I know I'm going to try. I'm optimistic, I'm 100 percent that I'm
going to be healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was aware that he could further damage his arm by
pitching, ``and that's why we decided to do this right now. I was
concerned about (further damage) but I had to be realistic and
understand I might risk my career by being out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he talked with his brother Ramon, who has been
plagued by arm troubles, and Ramon's pain was ``in a different
spot; mine is in an internal part of my arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramon told me to play it smart and if I feel something, the
smallest thing, just to let it go,'' said Pedro. ``Let it go one
start, two starts, or three. He told me to be careful with it even
though it wasn't in the same spot as his.''
</P>
<P>
   All the advice to be cautious runs counter to Pedro's
competitive spirit. More than anything, he said, he wants to be on
the mound to help his struggling team.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Red Sox approached him Thursday night about the
MRI, ``that was a big issue with me and I tried to talk them out of
it,'' he said. ``I felt so good that I wanted to go out and pitch.
They said, `We want to make sure you're OK, and you're not going to
tear anything there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, ``I've had the MRI and I know it's inflammated and
it'll come down in the next 10 days and I should be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez repeated that he had been experiencing varying degrees
of soreness for a month. The ace disputed rumors that he hurt his
arm by turning his velocity up a notch in the All-Star Game July
13, when he was named MVP after striking out five National Leaguers
in two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan had suggested last week that
with the extra adrenaline flowing in the All-Star Game, Martinez
may have overdone it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' said Martinez. ``I know my body. I know myself.
I know I was a little pumped up and I felt great.'' If anything,
Martinez said the extra time between his last start at Tampa Bay
and the All-Star Game ``gave me extra strength. People say I was
throwing the ball harder? I was throwing the ball the same way I
was throwing in Tampa. I guarantee you, the velocity might have
been the same. And I was feeling a little sore, too, in the
All-Star Game before I went to warm up.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month ago I felt something, but you can pitch with that.
You're a professional . . . you just don't sit down. And I love the
game, and I love the fact that I can be out there competing.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he is taking anti-inflammatory medicine ``and also
I'm doing some exercises which work on the attack area where I have
to throw. The exercises are feeling very good. I'm feeling
stronger.''

JOHNSON KEEPS EYE ON HITTERS  
 STAYS FOCUSED IN RE MATCH WITH BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's baseball's marquee pitching matchup _
Diamondbacks' left-hander Randy Johnson versus Los Angeles Dodgers'
right-hander Kevin Brown. Snarl city. Nasty stuff.
Ultracompetitive. Big-game pitchers with big pay days.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will pack Bank One Ballpark today to see The Duel II, a
matchup between the game's richest pitchers and perhaps most
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   They met on Opening Day in Los Angeles, where neither pitcher
figured in the decision and were gone, before the Diamondbacks
walked off an 8-6 loser in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson left in that game in the eight with a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson isn't looking at the matchup. He's looking at the
Dodgers' hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes for a very attractive game for the fans to watch and
come to,'' Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Attractive indeed, but Johnson will be the last to get worked up
over the matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's something for you guys to write about and make a
big deal about,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson tries to stay on the same emotional level for each
start. In his last six, it's been at a very high level. Although he
is 10-7, Johnson could easily be 14-3, losing four games in a row
in which the Diamondbacks hardly any offensive support. He snapped
a five-game losing streak in Seattle by striking out 10 and
scattering eight hits in a 6-0 win.
</P>
<P>
   What concerns Johnson more is who he is facing in the batter's
box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was extremely focuses in Texas, because I realized their
lineup,'' he said. ``I was extremely focused in Seattle, because I
realized their lineup. I'll be extremely focused against LA. There
are no holes in any lineup, even when you face the pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has had a better season than Brown, who has given up 15
home runs, nearly twice as many already than the eight he gave up
all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (10-6, 3.79), who snapped a two-game losing streak and
picked up his first victory in five starts in his last outing, an
8-4 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday, stayed quiet.
He said he makes it a policy not to talk to reporters the day
before the game's he pitches.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth time that the two pitchers have opposed each
other in the regular season. Johnson has a victory and three
no-decisions in the previous four showdowns. Brown has a two
no-decisions and two losses.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who leads the National League in strikeouts (229) and
ERA (2.65), can relate to Brown's competitive nature, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I appreciate and respect in his game is that he
goes about his business much like I do,'' Johnson said. ``Maybe
it's not the best way, but it's the best way for us. I think people
just want the end result. That's all I want.'' &QL;

NBA WANTS TO GO WITH FLOW 
</HEADLINE>
 RULES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ Faced with an obvious and immediate need to do
something about their increasingly stagnant game, the movers and
shakers of the NBA solicited ideas and information from several
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton was not on their list.
</P>
<P>
   The man nicknamed ``The Glove'' and a regular on the
all-defensive first team thinks the proposed changes and
alterations now being used in various summer leagues are either
going to slow the game because of incessant fouling or turn it into
a dunk-o-rama track meet. Neither is appealing to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you change on us, it's going to take us another
year until we can change,'' Payton said. ``You're going to get a
lot of fouls. That'll slow the game down. Or it's going to be like
a running match, with people scoring 150, 160 points. So, they want
to play that way? If you want to see that crazy stuff, that's the
way it's going to want to be. The refs ain't gonna know what they
want to do. We ain't gonna know what we want to do. Y'all ain't
gonna like this game. It's going to be a long year.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is not going to be the same next season, that much is
certain. After meetings and discussions about opening up the game _
nothing, apparently, was done to muzzle coaches _ the league
announced several rules changes.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of scoring _ poor shooting and overall offensive
stagnation _ finally prompted the NBA to act. Although this past
season was an aberration because of the lockout, scoring has been
on the decline every year since 1988-89. This past season, for
instance, only one team, the Sacramento Kings, averaged more than
100 points a game. Field-goal percentage slipped for the fourth
consecutive season. It wasn't that long ago _ 1994-95 _ when the
average output was 101.4 points and teams shot 46.6 percent. (In
1991-92, teams averaged 105.3 points a game.)
</P>
<P>
   So the NBA formed a small committee to find ways to restore
scoring. This week at the Boston summer league, the new rules will
be in use. They've already been tried, with mixed results, in
summer leagues in Atlanta, Salt Lake City, and Long Beach, Calif.
Any kind of gratuitous contact will result in a whistle. The
forearm has gone the way of the hand check, except in the key.
Players making cuts to the basket no longer will have to think
they're crossing a minefield.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, of course, it sounds terrific. But the ones who make
the rules aren't the ones who have to play the game. Many players
here at the Tournament of the Americas pre-Olympic qualifier are
skeptical, wondering if the league is overreacting or adopting the
wrong solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nash, for one, thinks the NBA is missing the point. He
doesn't believe the problem is contact on defense or lack of
offense. He thinks the players are responsible, but in a different
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are so much bigger, longer, stronger, faster, and
quicker that the court has become smaller,'' said Nash, who plays
for the Dallas Mavericks and Team Canada. ``We can make a lot of
excuses about why the scoring has gone down, but the court is
smaller. Yeah, sure, the skills may have dropped a little, but it's
because there is such a premium now on strength and power. I think
it's fine to experiment, but the smaller court and the premium on
strength are the main problems and those are going to be hard to
overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The only one who was unabashedly supportive was United States,
and Philadelphia 76ers, coach Larry Brown, who happens to coach the
one individual _ Allen Iverson _ who stands to benefit most from
the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have young guys who have great ability and to be in a
situation where you can go up and down the floor and be allowed to
show your skills, it'd be a wonderful thing to see,'' said Brown,
who has tried to have the pre-Olympic team play that way _ with
lukewarm results. ``But as much as they want to do it, they've been
so used to playing an isolation, halfcourt game that it's going to
take some time. The league is making such an effort that it will
eventually come to pass. And the fact that our younger players have
unbelievable gifts, their will is going to make it happen as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes are certain to help Iverson and the other younger,
more athletic, dynamic players _ unless the NBA ever decides to do
something about palming. Players like Kobe Bryant, Stephon Marbury,
and Vince Carter should flourish in an up-tempo game. Players like
Charles Oakley, meanwhile, have to wonder where they're going to
fit. Dennis Rodman can forget about playing again.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who takes pride in stopping players, simply shrugged
when asked how he was supposed to defend quick opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to be able to play nobody now,'' he said.
``You can't touch 'em, unless they're in the paint. Then, you gotta
play hard and tough defense, but you don't know what they're going
to let you do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iversons and Bryants are going to be uncheckable,'' said
Vin Baker. ``For the most part, I don't think guys want to play
that way. I think guys felt really limited before with the hand
checking and the forearm. So I think they're going to feel really
limited now as far as defending guys. I don't think guys feel
comfortable with it. You got to have a feel for a guy a little bit.
Now, it's going to help guys get to the rim with no problems. It'll
bring back the days of (Michael) Jordan and Dominique (Wilkins)
getting to the rim untouched, where they'll either score a bunch of
points or be fouled.''
</P>
<P>
   In its first-round games in this tournament, the United States
was the personification of the free-flow basketball the NBA wants
to see. That the Americans also were vastly superior in talent
seemed beside the point. They passed. They defended. They ran. They
averaged more than 100 points a game (and the games are 40
minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Then came Round 2. Teams were fighting for survival and the US
got caught up in a slow, physical style. International rules
apparently allow high crimes and misdemeanors off the ball. (If
there is a violation for a moving pick, we've yet to see it.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in the United States, the Celtics were averaging
almost 32 fouls and more than 37 free throws in summer league play
in Southern California. (Last season, the Celtics averaged 24 fouls
and 21 free throws.) In a game against Milwaukee, Robert Traylor
was called for nine personal fouls. (You don't foul out in summer
leagues.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of fouls in Long Beach,'' said Rod Thorn, the
NBA's director of operations. ``It got a little better in the
second week. But we are going to make changes. We're looking at
them and there may be some fine tuning, but we are going to make
them.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. The players can gripe all they want, but
they're going to have to get used to it. The coaches are going to
have to get used to it. The fans are going to have to get used to
it. Only time will tell if the game is cleaner, more fluid, or if
each NBA game lasts longer than the director's cut of ``Dances With
Wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to have to adjust,'' Payton said, speaking on
behalf of Everyman. ``It's not going to be an easy adjustment.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ Is anyone out there who's actually paying attention
surprised by any of this?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the good people of San Juan sent a message to the
international basketball community Saturday by avoiding the 88-59
Olympic berth-clinching win by the United States over Argentina.
Only 1,500 attended, and that may have been a generous count. Then
again, the fans have avoided the United States for the last two
weeks, except for the one game against the beloved home team.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they know something we all should recognize: as long as
the field is tilted the way it is, we're going to see a one-sided
victory in what should, theoretically, be a competitive situation:
a semifinal game in a qualifying tournament with an Olympic spot at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's game, TNT's Craig Sager asked Julio Lamas, the
coach of Argentina, what he felt his chances were against the
Yanks. ``It is impossible to win,'' Lamas said. Sager then said,
``Well, fine, coach, but what did you tell your team?'' He said he
told them, ``It is impossible to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Score one for honesty.
</P>
<P>
   The real folly, of course, was the United States' presence here
in the first place. Because the US had to play here, one other team
is not going to Sydney, and that's too bad. What was FIBA thinking
to force the United States to come here and qualify for a berth
when they were the defending Olympic champions? Yes, there are
qualifying rules, but there also should have been some special
dispensation to recognize that last year's World Championships were
flawed because the US sent a team of hastily assembled scrubs.
</P>
<P>
   Do you really think Tim Duncan wanted to come down here,
Caribbean man that he is, to play eight games in eight days against
competition he hasn't seen since the cream-puff schedule days at
Wake Forest? Do you think Allan Houston wanted to come down here
after what he and the Knicks went through in the last two months?
Nervous Nellie Larry Brown said before the game Saturday that he
had the same feeling when his wife was pregnant. (He could have
said that he felt the same way his wife did, but that might have
been a stretch.) His lament was that he didn't get on the golf
course enough.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA doesn't need this aggravation, and neither does USA
Basketball. The two bodies ought to insist that a defending Olympic
champion be exempt from qualifying for the next Olympiad, and if
FIBA doesn't buy it, well, then get ready for college kids and CBA
lifers. It's bad enough that the US administers these spankings
once every four years. Why add to the pain?
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's only hopes Saturday were that the US bus would
careen off Rte. 26 or get stuck in traffic or that the casino at
the Westin Rio-Mar would magically remain open for 24 hours. The
Argentines were probably the second-best team here - and they were
without three of their better players - and still lost twice to the
United States by margins of 31 and 29 points.
</P>
<P>
   They had a `freeze-the-moment' lead early Saturday (it crested
at 17-10) before the US got serious. ``Nobody was worried. We
weren't worried,'' said Steve Smith. Why should they be?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a novel spin, courtesy of Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good for us to be down,'' he said. ``If coach wants to
spot a team seven points to get us going . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   The issue isn't a return to the old ways. FIBA likes NBA players
to show up at their events; they've caught on to this marketing
thing quite nicely. The other countries want to play against the
best - and then pose for pictures and get autographs afterwards.
The `beat me, whip me, take my picture' syndrome is still very much
in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, there may indeed be a player out there in Uruguay or
Brazil who will be an NBA All-Star one day and will be able to say
he started playing basketball after watching his countrymen play
the United States. That's fine. The issue isn't leaving the NBA
stars at home. They're here to stay for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   The issues here over the last fortnight were equity, fairness,
and the inherent value of having NBA players and not overdoing it.
This was overkill, pure and simple. Even when Brown emptied his
bench, he still had Smith, Tim Hardaway, and Baker on the court.
And this wasn't against Olympic competition. This was against eight
teams who weren't good enough to send a team to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has now played 39 games in international
competition with NBA players and has won all of them. The
Argentines can take some comfort in knowing that they did what only
10 others did before them - keep the margin of victory under 30
points. This collection of NBA players scored fewer points than any
of its predecessors (five games under 100 points with Sunday
night's gold medal game to come) and still was never threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Let the rest of the world play catch-up if it can. Until then,
keep the floggings to a minimum, and recognize that it doesn't
serve anyone's interest to needlessly inflict the NBA on the rest
of the basketball universe.
</P>
<P>
   Going global is fine. Anything more than that is unnecessary. We
saw that, first-hand, here.

WRIST PAIN KEEPS DELLUCCI OUT OF LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's been hard for Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter
to keep outfielder David Dellucci's hot bat out of the lineup. It's
even harder on Showalter now that he has no choice in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to the doctors. And, right now, Dellucci isn't even able
to take batting practice, because of the pain in his left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said that the injury is a result of wear and tear and
that the wrist has progressively gotten sorer the more Dellucci has
played.
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci started eight of 10 games, before sitting out Friday,
because it was too painful to take batting practice. During those
eight starts, Dellucci hit .516 (16 for 31) with six multiple-hit
games. In 17 starts, he has hit .485 with 23 runs scored, five
doubles, a triple and a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci had an MRI on his hand Saturday and he met with team
physician David Zeman, Manager Buck Showalter and Managing General
Partner Jerry Colangelo before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said he is hoping it is not a situation where Dellucci
will have to go on the disabled list. &QL; 
Being cautious &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Jay Bell was out of the lineup Saturday with a
tight hamstring. Bell didn't start in the two-game Houston series,
but doubled, singled and walked, before getting lifted for a pinch
runner Friday against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said he wants to be cautious with Bell, so the injury
doesn't worsen and Bell doesn't end up on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has strength there,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter is hoping it is nothing more than a strain.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who is 1 for 13 lifetime against Dodgers right-hander
Darren Dreifort, who started Saturday, is expected to start today
against Kevin Brown, against whom he's had better success. &QL; 
In the pen &QL; 
The Dodgers aren't too happy these days. Friday, after the
Diamondbacks scored five runs in the fourth inning, during which
Raul Mondesi was charged with a throwing error, the right fielder
went to the bullpen, instead of the dugout, while the Dodgers
batted the next half of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi didn't want to discuss what ticked him off.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson shook up the team a little bit Saturday by
taking left-hander Carlos Perez out of the rotation and into the
pen. It came a day late. Perez, who is 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA, was
hammered for 11 hits and 10 runs in six innings in Friday's 10-1
loss to the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Eric Young, one of the National League's top
base-stealing threats, will be out of the lineup for perhaps a week
to rest his legs. He's had hamstring, ankle and Achilles' tendon
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Counsell and Jose Vizcaino will platoon at second, Johnson
said. &QL;

TRADE WINDS BLOWING  
 MOST DEALS LIKELY TO BE MADE THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it's nearing the end of July, then the summer trade winds
must be blowing directly over Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most previous seasons, though, the trading deadline deals
might be on the light side in 1999. Then again, who knows? The Mets
and A's kicked off the season when Kenny Rogers was sent to Queens
for a pair of minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night at 9 (Arizona time) the non-waiver trading deadline
expires. After that, clubs can still make deals, but other clubs
can basically block those deals by putting in claims on any given
player. For that reason, if trades are going to be made, this will
be the time.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, though, when  &UR; Randy Johnson and  &UR; Mike Piazza
were clearly available, there aren't quite the same caliber of
players on the block.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of baseball junkies and gossip mongers
everywhere, we will offer up the hottest rumors of players
available and where they might wind up. Remember, most of the deals
at this time of the season consist primarily with pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Players definitely available (by position):
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers: Kansas City's  &UR; Kevin Appier; Cincinnati's  &UR; Steve Avery
and
 &UR; Brett Tomko; James Baldwin and  &UR; Jaime Navarro of the White Sox;
Baltimore's  &UR; Scott Erickson, Juan Guzman, Jesse Orosco and  &UR; Arthur
 &UR; Rhodes; Seattle's  &UR; Jeff Fassero; Anaheim's  &UR; Chuck Finley and  &UR; Omar
 &UR; Olivares; Florida's  &UR; Alex Fernandez and  &UR; Dennis Springer;
Colorado's
 &UR; Darryl Kile; St. Louis'  &UR; Darren Oliver; Steve Trachsel of the Cubs;
Minnesota's  &UR; Mike Trombley; and Oakland's  &UR; Tim Worrell.
</P>
<P>
   Infielders: Baltimore's  &UR; Mike Bordick; Mark Grace and  &UR; Jose
Hernandez of the Cubs; San Diego's  &UR; Chris Gomez; Pittsburgh's  &UR; Ed
Sprague; and Milwaukee's  &UR; Fernando Vina.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielders: Colorado's  &UR; Darryl Hamilton; Detroit's  &UR; Tony Clark
and
 &UR; Bobby Higginson; Glenallen Hill of the Cubs; Milwaukee's  &UR; Marquis
 &UR; Grissom; Cleveland's  &UR; David Justice; Oakland's  &UR; Tim Raines; San
Diego's
 &UR; Reggie Sanders; Cincinnati's &UR; Greg Vaughn; Montreal's  &UR; Rondell
White; and any of Los Angeles' three outfielders,  &UR; Raul Mondesi,
Gary
 &UR; Sheffield and  &UR; Devon White.
</P>
<P>
   Catchers: Cleveland's  &UR; Pat Borders; Philadelphia's  &UR; Bobby
Estalella; Toronto's  &UR; Darrin Fletcher; Detroit's  &UR; Bill Haselman;
Los Angeles'  &UR; Todd
 &UR; Hundley; San Diego's  &UR; Greg Myers; and Baltimore's  &UR; Lenny Webster.
</P>
<P>
   Players who could be pried away with the right offer:
</P>
<P>
   Seattle LHP  &UR; Ryan Anderson; Tampa Bay RHP  &UR; Rolando Arrojo and
RHP
 &UR; Roberto Hernandez; Houston OF  &UR; Derek Bell; Colorado IF  &UR; Vinny
Castilla; RHP  &UR; Octavio Dotel of the Mets; Montreal RHP  &UR; Dustin
Hermanson; Atlanta IF  &UR; Chipper Jones; Los Angeles IF  &UR; Eric Karros
and  &UR; Eric Young; Arizona IF  &UR; Travis Lee; Milwaukee RHP  &UR; Hideo Nomo
and  &UR; Bob Wickman; LHP  &UR; Andy
 &UR; Pettitte of the Yankees; Minnesota RHP  &UR; Brad Radke; IF  &UR; Frank
Thomas of the White Sox; Detroit LHP  &UR; Justin Thompson; Montreal RHP
 &UR; Ugueth
 &UR; Urbina, Toronto LHP  &UR; David Wells; and Cincinnati RHP  &UR; Scott
Williamson and OF  &UR; Michael Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Players available (but who would want them?):
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore OF  &UR; Albert Belle, Colorado OF  &UR; Dante Bichette, San
Francisco IF  &UR; Charlie Hayes, Florida C  &UR; Jorge Fabregas; and IF
 &UR; Gary
 &UR; Gaetti of the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Not available, no matter what you've heard:
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco RHP  &UR; Joe Nathan; Anaheim RHP  &UR; Troy Percival;
Seattle IF
 &UR; Alex Rodriguez; and Philadelphia RHP  &UR; Curt Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   What clubs are searching for:
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta _ A first baseman (Grace?) and a backup catcher;
Baltimore _ Tranquility; Boston _ Power-hitting outfielder (Hill?);
Cleveland _ Kile; Kansas City _ Any first baseman; NY Mets _
Relievers (even the best bullpen in the NL is seeking more help);
Arizona _ Shortstop and relief help; Tampa Bay _ Victories and
stability; and Toronto _ A right-handed hitter, preferably one with
power (Hill or Bell?).
</P>
<P>
   Clubs searching for starting pitching were left off the list
because it would basically entail putting down every one of the 30
big-league clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Rodriguez, a free agent after next season, is at the
top of the Mets' wish list. Putting him in New York, across from
Yankees shortstop  &UR; Derek Jeter, would make Gotham the cradle of
shortstops (sorry Nomar, but it would be true).
</P>
<P>
   But Seattle, still feeling the ill effects of letting Johnson go
last summer, is deftly afraid of the public relations backlash of
such a move. For that reason, Rodriguez is going nowhere. This
season.
</P>
<P>
   The free-falling Cubs, who expected so much from this season,
are in a mode to trade just about anyone not named  &UR; Sammy Sosa.
Grace, a Cubs favorite and free agent after this season, is
concerned about his future with the only club he has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd certainly listen (to a possible trade), I would have to
give them that much respect,'' said Grace, who has the option of
vetoing any deal. ``But by the same token, it's kind of something
sentimental, that I would like to get my 2,000th hit (he needed 17
entering Friday) in this uniform. And I don't think I'll get it
before (July 31).
</P>
<P>
   Several clubs are in dire need of a starting pitcher if they are
to get over the hump and earn a playoff berth this season. One club
that is not in such straits but appears hellbent on acquiring a
front-line starter is Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who have the largest lead of any division leader,
have been scouting Colorado's Kile, who, after more than 1{ years
with the Rockies, seems to have come to the realization that he
made a mistake and cannot pitch in Denver's high altitude.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians are extremely interested in acquiring Kile but will
probably have competition from his former club, Houston, and from
Texas, whose primary mission is to advance past the first round of
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Belle, who signed a five-year, $65 million contract
during the winter that included a no-trade clause during the first
three seasons, has apparently waived that stipulation from his
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for his giving up the no-trade clause stems
from Orioles owner  &UR; Peter Angelos actually taking depositions from
several fans who accused Belle of making lewd gestures and comments
to them.
</P>
<P>
   Angelos, an accomplished lawyer, is exploring the possibility of
voiding the remainder of Belle's contract. Belle, whose twin
brother
 &UR; Terry recently made a lewd gesture to several reporters, is
probably posturing in order to keep his contract intact.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle facing the Orioles is finding someone,
anyone, willing to take on the enigmatic Belle, whose actions have
become more disturbing over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for a possible flurry of deals. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
 &UR; Luis Gonzalez's 30-game hitting streak this season gave him two
such streaks of at least 20 games (he had a 23-game hitting streak
for Houston in 1997). What is the record for most 20-game hitting
streaks? &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
 &UR; Wee Willie Keeler had eight such streaks during his Hall of Fame
career, including six before the turn of the century. The post-1900
record is seven, shared by  &UR; Pete Rose and  &UR; Ty Cobb, who rank 1 and
2 on the all-time hits chart. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; If it's the food you're worried about, they have McDonald's: St.
Louis first baseman  &UR; Mark McGwire is as adamant as ever about not
wanting to start the season with a pair of games in Japan next
year. ``If I didn't want to go, what kind of wrench would that
throw into it?'' he wondered.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; There's not gold in them thar hills, at least not
 &UR; for you: The Colorado Rockies and the state of California have not
been a good mix this season. The Rockies finished their regular
season schedule in California Thursday with a 4-18 record in the
Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Joey Belle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Exactly for whom does this Belle toll?: Speaking of the player
formerly known as  &UR; Joey Belle, Baltimore outfielder  &UR; Albert
 &UR; Belle last week issued a plea of sorts for the Baltimore media to
show him some love. As our parents always told us, love is a
two-way street.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Home was not where the heart was for these two days: The
Chicago Cubs (who else?) had five base runners thrown out at the
plate during a two-game stretch Tuesday and Wednesday. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
The whispers have been confirmed. Cincinnati pitcher  &UR; Pete &UR; Harnisch
has a frayed rotator cuff and loose impediments in his pitching
shoulder. Surgery is inevitable, but Harnisch, showing what
leadership is all about, plans to remain in the rotation the rest
of the season. He is 4-0 in his last six starts.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco first baseman  &UR; J.T. Snow insists he's no fan of
interleague play, preferring for each league to remain separate
until the World Series. But Snow's numbers indicate he may want to
rethink his position: In 44 career interleague games, Snow is
batting .350 with 17 home runs and 54 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's  &UR; Lenny Harris achieved the 104th pinch-hit of his
career last week, tying him with San Diego's  &UR; John Vader Wal for
11th on the all-time list. Former Los Angeles great and current
Dodgers coach  &UR; Manny Mota holds the all-time record with 150
pinch-hits.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia has five players ( &UR; Bobby Abreu,  &UR; Rico
 &UR; Brogna,  &UR; Ron Gant,  &UR; Mike Lieberthal and  &UR; Scott Rolen) with a
realistic chance of each reaching 20 home runs. The Phillies
franchise record is four, set in 1962 when  &UR; Johnny Calison,  &UR; Don
Demeter,  &UR; Tony Gonzalez and
 &UR; Roy Sievers accomplished the feat.
</P>
<P>
   The last time someone other than knuckleballer
 &UR; Dennis Springer threw a complete game shutout for Florida was Aug.
23, 1997 when  &UR; Kevin Brown did it against St. Louis. In the Marlins
next 310 games (which includes the '97 post-season), Springer has
two complete game shutouts, each this season. No one else has any.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Manager  &UR; Tom Kelly won his first game ever at Busch
Stadium last week. His Twins club failed to win one of three World
Series games in St. Louis in 1987 and was swept in a three-game
series at Busch in 1996 before breaking through last week. ``I'm
going to have to go get some champagne tonight,'' Kelly said. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
New baseball historian  &UR; Jerome Holtzman is scheduled to turn in his
new findings on the  &UR; ``Shoeless'' Joe Jackson case to
Commissioner &UR; Bud Selig within a few weeks. For anyone awaiting
Jackson's induction into the Hall of Fame, don't hold your breath.
It probably won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs Manager  &UR; Jim Riggleman is seriously thinking of moving
reliever  &UR; Scott Sanders into the rotation, a move that could mean
either  &UR; Dan Serafini or  &UR; Terry Mulholland could be placed in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing sense that Dodgers President  &UR; Bob Graziano
may not be in his current position beyond this season.  &UR; Rick Welts,
brought over from the NBA office, has been evaluating the Dodgers
front office. ``Everybody is disappointed. . . . Nobody
second-guesses what has happened so far,'' he said. So far?
</P>
<P>
   The poor Milwaukee Brewers just can't seem to catch a break.
Miller Park, which is supposed to ensure that the Brew Crew turns
its fortunes around, will apparently fall so far behind schedule
because of the recent accident that cost three iron workers their
lives, that it's doubtful it will open on time for opening day next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit reserve outfielder  &UR; Karim Garcia, one of the original
Diamondbacks expansion draft picks, may be on his way out of
Motown. Garcia is batting just .217 with four home runs and 11 RBI
in 129 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   There is growing sentiment within the organization that the
Colorado Rockies will attempt to retool their entire club for the
2000 season and beyond. The belief is that the Rockies lack the
ability to produce runs. If they don't hit a home run, they
basically cannot score. Look for Colorado to add speed. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. NY YankeesAfter routing Cleveland, maybe Boss &UR; George
Steinbrenner will stop talking deal.  &QL; 
2. ClevelandPlaying under .500 in its past 30 games, yet increased
its AL Central lead.  &QL; 
3. HoustonForget  &UR; Billy Wagner's blown save last week; this may be
the best in the NL.  &QL; 
4. CincinnatiRookie &UR; Scott Williamson has blown four of his last
five save chances.  &QL; 
5. AtlantaDon't look now, but those are the Mets and Phillies on
your tail.  &QL; 
6. NY Mets &UR; Octavio Dotel _ can he be the answer for the No. 5
rotation spot?  &QL; 
7. BostonInjury throws  &UR; Pedro Martinez's chase for 30 wins out the
window.  &QL; 
8. TexasThe Rangers are no longer a club that relies just on the
long ball.  &QL; 
9. PhiladelphiaIt's just about when the Phillies fell apart in '98,
finishing 20-57. &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. MontrealWith little help, the Expos are perfectly undermanned.
 &QL; 
29. FloridaThe temperature's dropping in hell: The scrappy Marlins
escape the cellar.  &QL; 
28. DetroitIt's too late, but finally showing ability to come back
from deficits.  &QL; 
27. MinnesotaPlaying respectable ball during the past month; still
a long way off.  &QL; 
26. Kansas CityThe focus this week is on the glorious past
(i.e. &UR; George Brett).  &QL; 
25. BaltimoreExactly how many in-house problems can one club have?
 &QL; 
24. ColoradoThis is what happens with the worst pitching staff in
the majors?  &QL; 
23. Tampa BayOh where is  &UR; Jose Canseco? Come back soon before we
die of boredom.  &QL; 
22. AnaheimDissention in the clubhouse is a sure sign of
deep-rooted problems. ON THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; Toronto Blue Jays: Since being nine games under .500 on June 12,
the Blue Jays have been one of the best clubs in baseball, posting
a 25-9 record entering their weekend series. Toronto is right on
Boston's heels for the American League wild-card spot and is
showing an amazing ability to win in its last at-bat, doing so nine
times in the past three weeks. If not for a 1-12 record against
Boston and the Yankees, the Blue Jays might be leading the AL East.
``Right now we can beat anybody in the game, no question,''
outfielder  &UR; Shawn
 &UR; Green said. ``We're cockier, and we play like we've got a bit of
swagger. We've got a confidence level higher than we've ever
had.'' &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; San Francisco Giants: After losing five of their last six
interleague games, the Giants found themselves barely atop the NL
West standings. Their inability to put together a decent start
after the All-Star break has hit them again. ``We've got to get
back in our league and regroup,'' Manager  &UR; Dusty Baker said before
Wednesday's pounding over division rival San Diego. Through their
recent stretch of treading water, the Giants failed to capitalize
on a similarly poor stretch by second-place Arizona, whom San
Francisco could have buried deeper in the standings. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
Seattle's perennial All-Star shortstop  &UR; Alex Rodriguez after the
standing ovation former Mariners and current Diamondbacks ace
 &UR; Randy &UR; Johnson received at Safeco Field last week in his first game
against his former club: ``Anything less would have been
uncivilized. He was standing on the mound he built.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
He's not a newcomer to this corner, but he is as a White Sox
player. Valley product  &UR; Paul Konerko seems finally to be showing
signs of living up to the hype that followed him after being the
named the minor league Player of the Year in 1997. Konerko has hit
11 home runs in his last 53 games and has raised his average over
.290 entering the weekend series. ``He's finally becoming
comfortable in the major leagues after getting a big buildup with
the Dodgers,'' White Sox Manager  &UR; Jerry Manuel said. ``I don't like
to put numbers on a guy, but I see him hitting some home runs for
us in the second half.'' &QL;

ATHLETICISM, NOT TALK, MAKES ROOKIE STAND OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In Shawn Marion's mind, it's never been about talk.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask syndicated sports radio host Jim Rome, whose recent
interview with the Suns' ninth-round draft pick was so one-sided
that listeners are still chastising Marion, and alma mater UNLV,
for the ``Huh?'' and ``What?'' replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was practically asleep when he was talking to me,'' said
Marion, who is participating in the Suns' three-day rookie and
free-agent camp. ``I had been out celebrating with friends the
night before. Plus, it was done on the phone, and I could hardly
hear his questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care (about the criticism). I don't know him like
that, he doesn't know me like that. I respect him so he should
respect me.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Marion is not the person that came across. He will
never seek out a microphone, but he is accommodating and thoughtful
in his answers. In 1998, he was the National Junior College Male
Student-Athlete of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Next time, he may just schedule his radio interviews more
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   But then, it's never been about talk.
</P>
<P>
   His athleticism was the buzz of the NBA draft, but his shot,
which isn't mechanically perfect, raised some questions.
</P>
<P>
   Just words, Marion says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask Coach (Danny Ainge),'' he said. ``Coach knows I can shoot
the ball. I don't think about that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Much ado about nothing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, absolutely,'' Ainge said. ``My main concern is him
knowing the offense. When he gets shots, he's going to make them.''
</P>
<P>
   That was apparent during Saturday's scrimmage. Marion sank
several, including an off-balance fadeaway that caught Ainge's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his ability to create shots, from different points on
the floor and with different obstacles around him, could mean
significant minutes. His speed and explosiveness could translate
into some dynamic basketball if the swingman ends up sharing the
backcourt with Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   He's daydreamed about that scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 400 players dreaming of that,'' Ainge said,
laughing. ``But, yeah, playing with Jason Kidd, he would fit in
very nicely. He can really run, and next to Jason, he's already our
fastest player. That should be a big advantage for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds good, but then, it's never been about talk. It's about
commitment, which UNLV Coach Bill Bayno said had been one of the
keys to Marion's success in Las Vegas, where he averaged 18.7
points and 9.3 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bayno said Marion ``gave a lot to UNLV,'' even though he played
there just one season after two at Vincennes University in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   He always will have a reason to return to Las Vegas. He is
building his mother, Elaine, a house there, something he's dreamed
about doing since his early days of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been with me through thick and thin, been behind me
whatever I wanted to do,'' he said. ``So when I had the
opportunity, I asked her what she wanted, and she told me she
wanted a house. I've got to take care of her first. I don't even
have a house yet, but she comes first.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's worked two jobs most of her life. I don't want her to
have to do that anymore. Somehow, she always managed to come up
with money for me to go out of town on all the basketball trips and
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Marion and the Suns haven't agreed on a contract yet,
General Manager Bryan Colangelo said they were close.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NBA's collective bargaining agreement, the team can
offer him a three-year deal with an option for a fourth. Teams are
permitted to offer between 80 percent and 120 percent of a set
figure, and Colangelo said the Suns have offered 120 percent. That
would make Marion's contract slightly more than the $4.73 million,
three-year deal signed recently by former Arizona guard Jason
Terry, who was picked 10th by the Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a growing process,'' Ainge said. ``It's great
that we get him this summer, because he has a chance to learn all
this stuff, learn our offense and learn where his shots might come.
Going into training camp he'll have a head start.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Marion, ``I just want to show them what I can do.''.
</P>
<P>
   It's never been about talk. &QL;

GARRITY HOPES RUMORS OF TRADES FADE AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Pat Garrity ran the floor Saturday with a group of Suns
wannabes, a label that probably could fit him as well.
</P>
<P>
   After workouts during the team's three-day rookie and free-agent
camp at America West Arena, Garrity acknowledged he's well aware of
the trades rumors that keep popping up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's about you, it tends to get back to you,'' the Suns
forward said. ``I understand there's nothing really I can do about
it, except keep a good attitude and work hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to stay with the Suns. I love it here, I love the
coaches, the style of play, my teammates. There's no other place
I'd rather be.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrity is one of several names that have been mentioned in
trade speculation involving Orlando's  &UR; Penny Hardaway. Although he
knows trades are part of the business, Garrity would like to
continue his career with the Suns, especially after finishing last
season on a high note.
</P>
<P>
   Garrity's minutes increased significantly late in the season
after a knee injury to forward  &UR; Tom Gugliotta made Garrity a
starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, (to improve), it really takes a lucky thing or a
guy getting hurt, and it's terrible because you don't want to see
that happening to guys,'' he said. ``But that's what it took for
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was playing four minutes at a time, I wasn't really
getting into the flow. When I was starting, even if I was making a
mistake, I could play through it. My confidence was high.'' &QL; 
Scouting talent &QL; 
Suns Coach  &UR; Danny Ainge wouldn't single out any of the 20 players
at the camp, but he did spot a common thread among their
performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, rookies come in and try to do a little bit too
much,'' he said. ``They wonder, `Where are my shots going to come
from? How will I fit in?' They go from being the star in college
and having the green light to learning to fit in with other
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, when  &UR; Jason Kidd shows up, and  &UR; Tom Gugliotta
and
 &UR; Danny Manning, they seem to play a little bit better under those
situations. They're more willing to accept a complementary role to
those guys. At the same time, the special ones come in knowing that
they're special, too, and not intimidated by the circumstances.'' &QL;

MILLER SET TO SIGN CONTRACT EXTENSION  
 TO STAY AS COACH/GM 3 MORE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Cheryl Miller, in a virtual dead heat with two others
for the second-best coaching record in the WNBA, is expected to
sign an agreement next week to remain with the Mercury for three
more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Team Vice President Seth Sulka said Saturday that Miller, 35,
has agreed to remain as coach/general manager through 2002 and that
she will be paid in the upper half of the league-wide range.
</P>
<P>
   That would put her annual salary between $225,000 and $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has a career regular-season record of 42-34 just past the
halfway point of her third season. Others in the same ballpark are
Nancy Darsch (Washington/New York) at 41-36 and Linda
Hill-MacDonald (Cleveland) at 40-39.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Van Chancellor, the two-time WNBA Coach of the Year,
is 60-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you evaluate everything to this point as a package and
you look at the 16-12 first-year record and 19-11 second-year
record and the two years of playoffs and the development of some of
our players during that time, I think she's been tremendous to this
organization,'' Sulka said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's gotten this organization off to a great start
when we started a league from nothing. She's been a part of it
basketball-wise and she's been a part of it marketing-wise. I think
we've been very successful, and she's a big part of it. In that
respect, I think it was an easy decision to want to have her around
and have that continuity with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller has been under scrutiny of late for her ejections from
three games and league record $5,000 fine for criticism of
officiating.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury, expected to contend for a return to the WNBA
Finals, started 3-10 and despite winning four of its past five
games remains 5{ games out of a playoff berth with 14 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a decision basically before the season that it was our
goal to try to do this,'' Sulka said. ``The timing didn't work out.
I talked to Bryan (Colangelo) recently and said if we want to do
this, let's do it now instead of waiting until after the season so
it doesn't have to be another wait and another distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller and team President Colangelo came to a verbal agreement
in a brief conversation Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sulka said he is comfortable with Miller joining training camp
after her NBA broadcasting obligations with Turner Sports as has
happened this season and before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention is to move forward under the same guidelines,''
he said. ``We understand she has a business relationship with
Turner, and we're prepared knowing that to make the contract
extension and work with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 season is expected to start 1-2 weeks earlier to
accommodate players joining their national teams for the Sydney
Olympics, Sept. 15-Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Sulka said most importantly the Mercury will have all of its
players for a full training camp next season for the first time
since 1997. &QL;

HULBIG HAPPY TO BE BACK IN TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The writing on the wall became obvious midway through
last season when Joe Hulbig wasn't getting much of a chance to
play. Sure, he was in the Hamilton Bulldogs' lineup, but he wasn't
seeing the kind of ice time a key player would nor was he being
used in crucial situations. The Edmonton organization, Hulbig's
employer for the three years he's been a professional, knew he
would be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season. He
hadn't played in the required number of NHL games by age 25 for the
Oilers to retain his rights, so it appeared Edmonton _ via Hamilton
_ was cutting its losses.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario was quite different than the one that accompanied
Hulbig, a Wrentham native and former St. Sebastian's standout, back
in 1992 when he was Edmonton's first pick _ No. 13 overall _ in the
entry draft.
</P>
<P>
   Hulbig is a hulking 6-foor-3-inch, 215-pound winger, and the
Oilers were hoping he would emerge into an effective power forward
after his four years at Providence College. It didn't happen with
them, but it's possible a second chance is exactly what Hulbig
needs. He talked to several clubs before signing a one-year deal
with the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Hulbig said he is hoping to put the past two years' struggle,
which he said tested him sorely, behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My second year, I was up for the first half of the season but
the team was struggling,'' said Hulbig. ``I was on the third or
fourth line and they had to make some changes. A few of us were on
two-way contracts and we were the easiest guys to make an example
of, so we were the ones who were sent down. This last year, my
third year, it seemed like Edmonton had moved on to their younger
players and it just seemed like I moved down their totem pole as
far as people they were going to give a shot to. Then I just found
myself in Hamilton. For the first time in my career, I was, not
confused, but I was showing up to the rink and not having that same
fire that I had in the past couple of years. I found it really
tough this year. I kind of knew my time was done with that
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Hulbig said it never came down to losing his passion for the
game. It was a matter of being in the wrong place, knowing that his
future was destined to be somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved going to the rink, I kept working hard all season
long, but for some reason, I'd get on the ice and I wasn't as
comfortable,'' he said. ``Maybe my head was thinking about too many
things. I don't know if I had too many things going on in my head.
I tried to do as much mentally to get myself prepared for games. I
don't know if I got confused with the type of role I was supposed
to be playing or I thought, `How much more do I have to do to
impress people?' or something like that. I still felt I could get a
shot there, but as the season goes along, you see your opportunity
winding down with that organization. I was given a great
opportunity to make the team there. I don't know if I missed it or
if it was just bad timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hulbig's agent, Paul Krepelka of Woolf Associates, said part of
Hulbig's problems in Edmonton stemmed from untimely injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did make the club out of camp his second year and played 17
games, but then he got sent down and ran into knee problems,'' said
Krepelka. ``He took a severe stick to the face and broke 12 teeth
and had a whole rash of injuries when he got sent down, and he
never recovered. By the end of the season, he pretty much shut it
down. This year, he made the team and then suffered (a hand) injury
and when he got sent down it was a disappointment and he kind of
got lost in the shuffle a little bit. It was a combination of his
not playing as well as he could've as well as not seeing light at
the end of the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Hulbig needs to play 50 NHL games this year to become a
restricted free agent (Group 2). If he plays fewer than 50, he
becomes unrestricted again.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's excited to get a fresh start and the fact that it's
Boston is just gravy, especially since he didn't expect the Bruins
to be all that interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about Boston talking about me throughout the year, but
when the time came I didn't think they'd be that crazy about
signing me after their farm team just won the Calder Cup
playoffs,'' said Hulbig. ``They've got a young team. I wasn't sure
what the opportunity was going to be. I met with (assistant general
manager Mike O'Connell) once, and he said if I come into camp and
do the things I have to do there will definitely be a great
opportunity to play in Boston. Those were some of the things that
helped me make the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will usher in a new era out West Oct. 20 (7:30 p.m.)
when they play the Los Angeles Kings in the first pro sporting
event at the new Staples Center. If you are interested in finding
out more about the new rink, you can access it on the web at
www.staplescenterla.com . . . It appears that rumors out in
Edmonton that goalie Bill Ranford would be brought back to the
Oilers might have been a tad exaggerated. Word out of that city is
that Ranford, who was bought out by the Red Wings after the season,
won't be re-signed by the club he led to the Stanley Cup in 1990.
Instead, the Oilers appear to be setting their sights on
unrestricted free agent Corey Hirsch as backup to Tommy Salo.
Hirsch was with the Vancouver Canucks last year and made just
$250,000 . . . He may have been named coach of the year but Ottawa
bench boss Jacques Martin is feeling a little insecure about the
defections going on within the Senators' ranks. Martin lost GM
Pierre Gauthier to Anaheim a year ago, GM Rick Dudley to Tampa Bay
this year, and most recently, assistant coach Mike Murphy resigned
to accept a position with the league. ``Am I that tough to work
with?'' joked Martin. ``I can't keep an assistant coach . . . the
GM goes running. I'm surprised my wife has stayed with me as long
as she has.'' Murphy, a native of the Toronto area, will become
assistant director of hockey operations and will be based out of
the Air Canada Centre, reporting to director of hockey operations
Colin Campbell on matters of league discipline, the application of
rules and scouting, and he will be a liaison with the minor leagues
. . . Center Andrew Cassels was reunited with GM Brian Burke when
Cassels signed a free agent contract with the Canucks. Cassels
played for Burke when Burke was the GM in Hartford in 1992-93. The
Canucks see Cassels as a probable No. 2 slot man behind Mark
Messier . . . Burke is no shrinking violet when it comes to
opinions. All the team executives across the league have no doubt
been watching with great interest the many expensive moves the
Rangers have made. Whether they will be enough for the Rangers to
be any good remains to be seen. ``It's certainly not conventional
wisdom on building a team but we'll see what happens,'' said Burke.
``I know what the GMs around the league would like to see happen .
. . with the Rangers' performance this year.'' When asked what that
was, Burke said: ``You guys figure it out.'' . . . Quick, name the
six NHL clubs that Ulf Dahlen has been a member of. Too tough?
Understandable considering the 32-year-old right wing has spent the
last two years playing in his native Sweden. But he will be back in
the NHL come fall. Dahlen signed with the Washington Capitals last
week. His other clubs? The Rangers, Minnesota, Dallas, San Jose,
and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some interesting quirks in the NHL schedule. Remember Brett
Hull's controversial goal that decided the Stanley Cup in Dallas's
favor? Well, so do the Sabres. The league's tradition of having the
finalists meet in the first game of the new season was quashed by
Buffalo. That club has no interest in watching the Stars hoist the
Stanley Cup banner. Instead, the teams play in Dallas Nov. 3, and
the Stars won't play in Buffalo due to the league's unbalanced
schedule, so Sabres fans will have to boo and curse the Stars on TV
rather than in person . . . Belmont native Paul Mara, who turns 20
Sept. 7, has a strong chance to make the Tampa Bay Lightning under
Dudley's new administration. The defenseman, who was taken No. 7
overall in the 1997 entry draft (one pick before Sergei Samsonov),
tallied 13 goals and 41 assists in 52 games for Plymouth of the
Ontario League and believes he can make the jump to the big club
next year. ``He's been working out at Harvard with a personal
trainer,'' said Jay Fee, Mara's agent. ``Rick Dudley thinks highly
of him as a prospect. Paul has a real good shot at making the team
as one of the top six defensemen. I think he's got to bear down and
prove to (new coach Steve Ludzig) that he can play. I think he'll
handle that pressure effectively. I think there's an additional
burden when you're the No. 1 pick of a prior administration, but
that kid handles pressure pretty well. He is going to be quite a
player.'' . . . The Hurricanes will switch from Greensboro to their
new arena in Raleigh, but they'll have to wait a while to open
there. Reportedly, the league was nervous about the rink not being
ready at the start of the schedule so the 'Canes will play away
from home until Oct. 28. The Carolina players, who were punished
enough by having to spend two years commuting between Greensboro
and Raleigh, will be punished one final time by a nine-game road
trip to open the year with stops in Boston, Philadelphia, New York,
Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Toronto, Buffalo, and Pittsburgh . .
. I know the salary market has gone completely insane, but $1.32
million for Chris Simon? Please. The guy has played just 93 of a
possible 246 games the last three seasons with the Capitals. He
totaled 49 points, an average of 16.3 points per year. Yes, he's an
enforcer, not a goal scorer, which makes his payday that much more
ludicrous . . . Old friend Steve Staios has come to terms on a deal
with his new team. The versatile right wing/defenseman, who turns
26 Wednesday, was taken by the Atlanta Thrashers in the expansion
draft from Vancouver. Staios, who played in Boston during parts of
the 1995-96 and 1996-97 seasons before being grabbed off waivers by
the Canucks on March 18, 1997, played 57 games for Vancouver last
year and had two assists . . . 41 days to training camp. If the
negotiations with Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe stall, don't be
surprised to see coach Pat Burns jump into the fray. Burns lobbied
hard on behalf of getting center Jason Allison signed last fall
when those talks dragged on. If Dafoe isn't close to a deal by
camp, Burns will require some strong blood pressure medication and
more than a little Prozac.

WINNING IS EVERYTHING  
 HOLDSCLAW WANTS TEAM IN PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - This is how Chamique Holdsclaw enumerates her agenda:
</P>
<P>
   One, for the Washington Mystics to win more games than in their
inaugural season; two, for the Mystics to make the WNBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about Chamique,'' she said at the All-Star Game on
July 14. ``It's bigger than that. I focus my attention on
Washington, trying to turn this thing around. It's like, how can
you be an MVP without being on a winning team?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's the enduring lesson from Tennessee Year 4, when,
for the first time since Holdsclaw was in middle school, her
basketball season did not end with a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Being all-everything, as the 6-foot-2 forward was despite the
three-time defending champion Volunteers not returning to the NCAA
Final Four, is ultimately hollow and worth trading for a title.
</P>
<P>
   At Christ the King High School in Queens, N.Y., she was a
three-time ``USA Today'' All-American while playing on teams that
won four state championships.
</P>
<P>
   At Tennessee, it was four Kodak All-America and two national
Player of the Year awards and a Sullivan Award to go with three
NCAA titles, the last culminating an undefeated season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not used to losing,'' a matter-of-fact Holdsclaw said.
``That's been the biggest (pro) disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Mystics (6-13) are already twice as successful
as last season (3-27) going into a game tonight against the
Mercury, Holdsclaw is not satisfied with only one of her two goals
being met.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is she satisfied being fifth in the league in scoring (18.3
ppg) and third in rebounding (8.4 rpg), having received the most
All-Star votes from fans of all Eastern Conference players.
</P>
<P>
   Even her contract with Nike, reported to be worth
$300,000-$500,000 a year through 2003 to supplement another
$300,000 or so in base pay and a personal services contract with
the WNBA, isn't enough for Holdsclaw.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line for Holdsclaw is that the Mystics make up the 2{
games on third place in the East and claw into the playoffs,
because only then is something larger possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a struggle for her at times, but I think she's
handling all the pressure and all the attention and the
expectations very well,'' Washington Coach Nancy Darsch said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last week has been difficult because of a broken finger at
the All-Star Game and just coming back fatigued from all the hype
and the appearances and everything, then having to miss a game plus
losing four games.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident in the first three minutes of the All-Star Game
that left Holdsclaw with a chip fracture of her left index finger
occured on a steal attempt by the Mercury's Michele Timms.
</P>
<P>
   The deflected ball caught her on the tip of the finger, limiting
her to just five points in 11 minutes for an East team that
desperately needed her scoring. Initially, doctors said Holdsclaw
could be out for up to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   She was back, playing 24 minutes, three days later. Timms,
coincidentally, has played just eight minutes in four games since
the All-Star break due to the flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's (Holdsclaw) sucking it up, and also the swelling went
down pretty quickly,'' Darsch said. ``Even though the bone is still
broken, she splints it and wraps it and sucks it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw appeared down and out again Friday when midway through
the second half at Minnesota she crossed elbows with teammate
Andrea Nagy. Holdsclaw lost feeling in her left hand until icing
brought it back.
</P>
<P>
   By crunch time, Holdsclaw had returned, snaring an important
rebound of a missed free throw and returning it for a layup. That
score put the Mystics up for good in a 60-55 win to break a
four-game losing streak and launch a six-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night having that competitiveness and that attitude,''
has been the greatest pro lesson to learn, said the league's No. 1
draft pick. ``I have to motivate myself. I can't wait for Coach
Darsch or any of my teammates to do it. When I step out on that
court, I have to make sure my mindset is correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the killer instinct was missing June 22 when Holdsclaw
was silent offensively for almost 12 minutes of the second half as
the Mercury pulled out of a 19-point first-half hole to get even at
61.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Holdsclaw did look to score late, it was too little.
She finished with 14 points (six in the second half) in a 79-76
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times she doesn't get the ball enough,'' Darsch said. ``At
crunch time, whether that be with six minutes to go or two minutes
to go or 20 seconds, I think Chamique has to have the ball.
</P>
<P>
   When Holdsclaw is elevating and All-Star guard Nikki McCray is
penetrating, the Mystics can surprise.
</P>
<P>
   They have a pair of wins over New York, Darsch's former team,
which the Mercury hasn't beaten since 1997. And two over Charlotte
plus the victory against Minnesota, both winners over Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw is a ``really smart player,'' said Lisa Harrison, the
Tennessee product who will guard her fellow alum again tonight. ``I
think she knows the game, how to get open and how to get shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's kind of deceiving because it looks like she's just
flowing out there. She's a really nice player.'' &QL;

USA DELIVERS A BUNDLE OF JOY  
 EASILY QUALIFIES FOR OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ Perhaps to the rest of the world, a
berth for the USA Dream Team in the 2000 Olympic Games was a
foregone conclusion to the Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans would enjoy a couple of weeks on the beach, sweep
through the Uruguays and Cubas of the basketball world by 30 points
a game and head for home with an invitation to Sydney, Australia,
next September.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't that simple to USA Coach Larry Brown, who compared
the Dream Team's Olympics-clinching 88-59 victory against Argentina
in the semifinals Saturday to the birth of his child.
</P>
<P>
   Not because it meant that much, but because it was such a
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like my wife's pregnancy,'' Brown said, ``Waiting for
it to pop out, I felt the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown figured his trip to San Juan would be a relaxing
opportunity to help Houston Coach Rudy Tomjanovich, who was
selected to be the head coach, and work on his golf game in the
tropical climate.
</P>
<P>
   But Tomjanovich, who was so stressed out by a lockout-shortened
NBA season and then the emotional decision of whether to trade
Hakeem Olajuwon or keep him, ended up in a hospital because of
exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, coach of the Philadelphia 76ers, was called upon to fill
in as the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big relief, especially since I wasn't expecting to do
this,'' he said. ``I was just supposed to come here as an assistant
to Rudy, and I didn't want to mess it up. The thing is, these guys
did everything I asked of them, and I didn't want anything bad to
happen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't, although the Americans still must play in the
championship game tonight against Canada. Nothing is at stake but
pride, since both teams have qualified for the 2000 Games. Canada
defeated Puerto Rico, 83-71, in the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   After rolling through the first eight games unbeaten, the
Americans still had to win the semifinal against Argentina to
qualify. Had they lost, not only would Brown have been known as the
first coach of a Dream Team to lose a game, but the United States
would have failed to qualify for the Olympics in basketball for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea it was going to come down to a game like this,''
Brown said. ``I asked these guys to play hard, to play unselfish.
They've done that, and I was thinking, `What if they did that and
we lose?' That's a tough thing to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, he didn't have much to worry about, although
the Americans didn't help Brown's nerves by falling into an early
hole.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans trailed by as many as seven points in the first
five minutes of the game, but the outcome was determined in a
six-minute stretch in which Argentina made just one of 12 shots and
turned the ball over four times.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 23-2 U.S. run. Tim Hardaway and Kevin Garnett
scored seven points apiece in the burst. The Americans led, 43-25,
and Brown could have started passing out the cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Suns forward Tom Gugliotta played his best game of the
tournament, scoring 10 points and grabbing six rebounds. He said
the Dream Team had never lacked confidence that it would lock up a
spot in the Olympics, but the players had tried not to take
anything for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports can be a crazy thing,'' he said. ``If you don't respect
people you're playing against, bad things can happen to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expected to be in the Olympics, so there is more a sense
of relief than celebration. We're the best in the world, so we
can't have an off night and lose. That's the type of pressure we
have on us here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than just winning the gold medal. We're representing
our country and we're the best in the world, so we have to go out
and prove that every time we step on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The USA is now 39-0 in international competition with NBA
players on the national team's roster, and no team has ever come
closer than 15 points to beating them. But Brown said the best
thing about the current Dream Team was that players had been
selected not just because of their talent, but ``because they're
good guys, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the nine NBA players selected, including Jason Kidd and
Gugliotta of the Suns, along with three who will be added for next
summer, officially can say they are Olympians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the ambassadors of the game,'' said Miami's
Hardaway.``We're the best in the world. We have an extra
responsibility to go out and show them how to play, to show we do
have character.'' &QL;

JETS APPEAR FUELED FOR TAKEOFF 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Most NFL camps will open this week with each team
having some concern or pressing need. With the retirement of John
Elway _ which left two-time Super Bowl champion Denver with Bubby
Brister at the helm _ there isn't one team that is in a league of
its own. Here's how teams rate based on their current plights
entering the 1999 season:
</P>
<P>
   SUPER BOWL OR BUST LEAGUE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK JETS _ OK? Bill Parcells's offseason moves certainly
indicate that the Jets are going for it all. They've spent a lot of
money shoring up their defense to go along with a spectacular
offense. There's still a concern or two: Curtis Martin's 3.5
yards-per-carry average is disappointing for a player making $6
million a year, and who knows what the ramifications of the Jumbo
Elliott/Jason Fabini bar incident will be. All right?
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Time for the Jimmy Johnson mystique to take hold in
Miami. If he's that brilliant in drafting 93 running backs, we'll
see it this year. The Dolphins are very talented and they have
hustling, hard-working players who are well-coached. Some of their
smaller guys on defense are a concern in the long term, but the
time is now for Dan Marino, who is not far down the highway from
Elway.
</P>
<P>
   NEW ENGLAND _ The Patriots got to the Big Game three years ago,
but Pete Carroll needs to get there because, well, he needs to. A
very talented team when healthy, there are no more excuses left.
Terry Glenn has to be an impact player all year. Ditto Willie
McGinest. If not, the Patriots may be top candidates for the
dis-assembly line next offseason.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE _ Enough already about Tom Coughlin being a great
coach. We know that. Thirty-four victories in the last three years
(including three playoff wins) makes the Jags an elite team. Their
offense _ with Mark Brunell, great receivers, an All-Pro runner in
Fred Taylor, and a big rugged offensive line _ is a major reason
this team could get to the next level this year, especially with
Denver out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA _ You score 556 points, go 15-1, and you don't get to
the Super Bowl? Better do it this year. The Vikings have the
All-World offense, and went from 29th to 13th in total defense last
year. They must get over the losses of Jerry Ball in the middle of
the defensive line and Corey Fuller at corner. This will be the
year when Dennis Green's ability to be consistent will be measured.
</P>
<P>
   BEEN THERE, DONE THAT LEAGUE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   GREEN BAY _ Would it take much for these Packers (11-5 a year
ago) to regain their former prominence? Probably not. Much depends
on Ray Rhodes and Ron Wolf's choices in replacing defections the
past few years. The best players are still around. The hunger
factor is key here, particularly with new papa Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bill Walsh is running the show, but he's not
coaching, which is where he made his name. The 49ers are always
pretty good, and sometimes can be great. They can't be great if
they're 29th in pass defense with a weak cornerback crew. They need
a replacement for Garrison Hearst. Is Lawrence Phillips that guy?
Charlie Garner? The 49ers have won before without a big name
running back, and they may have to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Jerry Jones keeps throwing a lot of money at old
players. Leon Lett may be suspended for a while, which would be
hard on the defense, and Deion Sanders may or may not be ready for
the start of the season Sept. 12. The Cowboys also have a much
tougher schedule than last year, when they went 8-0 in the weak NFC
East. That means they won only two games outside their division.
This year they meet the AFC East, perhaps the toughest division in
football.
</P>
<P>
   DENVER _ With two straight Super Bowls under their belt, what's
left? A third under 37-year-old Brister would be interesting. But
what the Broncos have to be able to overcome is not so much the
talent Elway brought, but his spirit and toughness. He was a rare
player who made everyone else around him better. Even the defense.
</P>
<P>
   READY FOR PRIME-TIME LEAGUE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA _ Jake Plummer now has much-needed playoff experience.
The Cards have a lot of talent (Eric Swann, Andre Wadsworth, Simeon
Rice may be the best line in the game), but they also disturbed the
chemistry with the defections of Jamir Miller, Lomas Brown, and
Larry Centers. Vince Tobin is a good coach with a lousy contract
and Bill Bidwell needs to do something to put Tobin where he
belongs.
</P>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ With Doug Flutie, anything is possible. He's energized
every area of the team. He put a smile on Bruce Smith's face last
year, and really turned a .500 team into a good, solid playoff
team. The Bills had a good draft, but seem to be toying with their
chemistry a tad by going so hard after Phillips. They are down on
Antowain Smith, and if the Bills don't want him, I know a team in
their division that would love to take him off their hands.
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE _ They have been 24-24 the past three years under Jeff
Fisher, a good, young, hard-nosed coach who must now get talented
young veterans to take off.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Mike Holmgren was brought in to get the Seahawks out
of their .500 humdrum ways. Jon Kitna is the QB of the future, the
defense is intact, except for linebacker Anthony Simmons, who has
some criminal issues to take care of. With Paul Allen's deep
pockets, the Seahawks appear to be a team on the way up.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Super Bowl runner-up needs to figure out the Jamal
Anderson issue. Offering him in a trade to the Patriots and having
it come out publicly is the first sign of a crumbling organization.
Based on his numbers _ 1,834 yards _ Anderson is worthy of an $8
million signing bonus and at least an average salary of $6 million.
Martin got it from the Jets, and is nowhere near the player.
</P>
<P>
   STUCK IN THE MIDDLE LEAGUE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Free agent defections caught up with the Steelers
last year when they went 7-9, the first losing season under Bill
Cowher since 1992. Perhaps it's true that Kordell Stewart was
messed up when he was asked to be more of a pocket passer, taking
away his athleticism. But there's still concern that Stewart may
not be a top-level NFL quarterback, and that's what he'll have to
prove for the Steelers to regain their good times.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ They drafted Akili Smith, which is exciting, but
this team doesn't do enough year-to-year to move one way or the
other. If they lose Carl Pickens via trade or if he holds out, and
with the loss of Ashley Ambrose in the secondary, don't expect
much. There's hope Jeff Blake can regain his playmaking ways, but
the Bengals are young and they have little depth.
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINA _ With George Seifert, maybe the Panthers start getting
better. They went heavily into free agency by taking 11 players.
They had no run defense last year, even with a talented front of
Jason Peter, Sean Gilbert, and Tim Morabito. They're going to the
4-3 in hopes of rekindling something. The offensive line gave up 54
sacks last year, and it lost Blake Brockermeyer to free agency.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A.k.a. Last Chance Saloon. The Redskins' new owner,
Daniel Snyder, wants immediate return on his $800 million
investment. No 6-10 season here. Norv Turner gets one more shot at
pulling off a playoff team, and he must hope Champ Bailey, the best
athlete in the draft, can make an immediate impact and that either
Stephen Davis or Skip Hicks can take the running back spot to great
efficiency. The Redskins have a very fast, athletic team, but this
isn't track.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Barry Sanders has made Bobby Ross look like Betsy
Ross, showing the coach and the organization no respect during this
self-imposed ban of the Lions during the offseason. Sanders blew
off Ross's June 1 date for letting him know if he was returning to
the Lions. The Wayne Fontes era is looking better and better.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK GIANTS _ They finally have a quarterback who can throw
(Kerry Collins), but currently he's behind Kent Graham. The Giants
dropped to 8-8 last year. The reason why they haven't stepped up is
their offense, which was 28th last year. Over the last four years,
they've been 30th twice and 28th twice. Does anyone understand this
math?
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ The underappreciated Marty Schottenheimer is gone,
replaced by Gunther Cunningham, his former defensive coordinator.
This is a team that has talent, and also has players who either
can't be depended on or who make you crazy. Chester McGlockton and
Bam Morris come to mind. Elvis (Grbac) has left the building too
often in his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ They were 6-2 in the first half of last season, 2-6 in
the second half. Rich Gannon is supposed to bring stability to the
offense. Otherwise, there's just no telling whether the seesaw
effect continues.
</P>
<P>
   OVER THE RAINBOW LEAGUE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Mike Ditka, the Gambler, made things exciting at
draft time. He does have quite a back in Ricky Williams and by
signing center Wally Williams, he can be assured his team will be
able to run the ball. The Saints will play in Ditka's image _
hard-nosed and smashmouth. There's so much emphasis on the run that
Ditka is content with veteran Billy Joe Hobert running the offense.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY _ If any team is capable of moving forward, it's this
one. Tony Dungy's underachievers may finally get it at some point.
When and if their talent takes off, it could be scary for their
opponents. Quarterback Trent Dilfer doesn't inspire a lot of
confidence, but statistically he's a good quarterback who went to
the Pro Bowl two years ago. Warren Sapp has lost 40 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Has a coach with no NFL head coaching experience
ever received more buildup than Brian Billick? He has quite a
creative offensive mind, and he'll need that with Scott Mitchell as
his starting quarterback. The Ravens have genuinely tried to
improve despite Art Modell's financial problems, and the payoff
should be handsome. Anything less would be disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Rams have a chance to be decent with the
acquisitions of Marshall Faulk and quarterback Trent Green, and the
drafting of receiver Torry Holt and defensive back Dre' Bly.
Everyone loves Todd Collins and what he can bring to a defense.
</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ They have a jump start on the younger, rebuilding
teams because Peyton Manning had such a successful rookie season.
Now the Colts will try to break Edgerrin James into their offense.
The Colts did major reconstruction of their defense, adding Chad
Bratzke to the pass rush. Some think the Colts will be .500 or even
make the jump to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   THE EXPANSION LEAGUE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Browns will be competitive under Chris Palmer
and the former 49ers management team. It's their good fortune to be
able to start from scratch with a tremendous amount of money to
work with. They also had prime picks in the draft and had good
players available to them in the expansion draft. Some they took,
some they didn't. How well they did remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ New head coach Andy Reid, Favre's QB coach in
Green Bay, should bring juice to the offense. Reid may go with Doug
Pederson initially, but it's unlikely Syracuse stud Donovan McNabb
can be held back for too long. The Eagles brought in new receivers
and signed nine free agents. This is a team that's basically
starting over.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Hmmm. They let Erik Kramer go, but they signed Chris
Canty? Yikes. The Bears are banking on Dick Jauron being a genius,
Curtis Enis establishing himself as one of the best backs in the
league, and rookie QB Cade McNown being Steve Young reincarnated.
If those things happen, the Bears will reign again.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The first thing I'd do is move training camp to
Iceland. Overlooking the Pacific on the University of
California/San Diego campus can't be conducive to preparing for an
NFL season. The only team that pulled it off was the Barcelona
Dragons of NFL Europe, who made it to the championship game even
though their team stayed at a hotel across from a topless beach.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Jefferson and Willie Clay are two players very uneasy
about the next few days. Will they dodge salary cap bullets?
Patriots vice president Bobby Grier dodged the questioning when he
declined an interview. If the Patriots are thinking this way, it
would be an odd time to shuffle off players who play 16 games a
year (given the team's injury woes of last year) and players who
added some desperately needed veteran presence and leadership. But
the Patriots do need to make cap space. Free safety Tony George,
their third-round pick from Florida, has just about agreed to a
three-year, $1.09 million deal with a $340,000 signing bonus. The
hangup is incentives. The hangup also is not having enough cap room
. . . When Damien Woody first showed up at the Patriots camp for
workouts this spring he was 336 pounds. He is now at 308. As for
his contract, the Patriots have sent a five- and six-year proposal
to agent Ben Dogra and it will be countered early next week. Dogra
is looking for a cap number that would average about $1 million a
year, which is about what Matt Stinchcomb, who was taken a slot
below by the Raiders, got this week. The Patriots' other No. 1,
Andy Katzenmoyer, is insisting on a four-year deal in which the cap
number would be in the $860,000 range . . . Local sports agent Brad
Blank, who completed two years of negotiations with the Lions on
Herman Moore's huge deal, was heading to Hyannisport for the
Kennedy wedding when the tragedy struck. Blank attended Brown with
John F. Kennedy Jr. and was a friend of the family . . . There were
116 unrestricted free agents who changed teams, compared with 121
last year. Only two restricted free agents changed teams, down from
four in '98. The Cleveland Browns signed the most unrestricted free
agents, 14, while Carolina was second with 11 and the Eagles were
third with nine. Out of 469 players who became unrestricted free
agents, 315 have signed new deals . . . The 1999 draft class was
polled at their rookie symposium in Washington concerning their
choice as the greatest player in NFL history. The winner was Walter
Payton, who garnered 64 votes. Joe Montana finished second with 18,
followed by Jerry Rice (17), Lawrence Taylor (15), and Jim Brown
(13) . . . Why do reporters keep asking Keith Byars whether he's
retiring? Is he the second-coming of Barry Sanders? Byars, who has
played with the Patriots and Jets the past four seasons, has been a
good, veteran role player in recent years. If he plays, it will
only be with a contender. Fine . . . The Ravens are now trying to
obtain Carl Pickens from the Cincinnati Bengals. Pickens has vowed
to hold out and not play for the Bengals, despite being designated
a ``franchise'' player. He wants a new long-term deal at top dollar
and the Bengals won't do it . . . In need of defensive line help,
the Patriots are auditioning former Indianapolis Colt Kendel Shello
this week. Shello is 6 feet 3 inches, 301 pounds. He's been a spot
player for the Colts, who signed him as a free agent in '96 out of
Southern University . . . In the past, fans traveling to Patriots
camp at Bryant College in Smithfield, R.I., have been
inconvenienced by construction on Route 7 leading into the college.
That's over, but now there's construction inside the campus.
Patriots fans need to prepare for tighter quarters because of
expansion of the school's athletic fields. The Patriots will no
longer have a ``rain'' field available to them, which could cause a
problem or two. Team officials aren't happy . . . UNH's Jerry
Azumah, who is being used as a defensive back by the Bears, had the
lowest body fat on the team: 3 percent. The lowest on the Bills?
Flutie's 3.4 percent.

   POITIERS, France _ So what if the French press has called Lance
Armstrong superhuman? He sure looked that way Saturday, when he won
a 35-mile time trial in a blistering time of 1 hour 8 minutes 17
seconds. He was nine seconds ahead of Swiss rider Alex Zulle, who
moved into second place in the overall standings, 7:37 behind
Armstrong. Spaniard Fernando Escartin finished 22d Saturday and
dropped into third place.
</P>
<P>
   So unless there's a crash that waylays Armstrong for seven
minutes on the way to Paris or around the Champs Elysees, he will
be the owner of the leader's yellow jersey. It will go in a frame
in his house in Austin, Texas; the only other bike jersey he has on
display is the rainbow one he won as world champion in 1993. That
one's in his house in Nice, France.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who won three stages plus the Tour's prologue, should
join Miguel Indurain, Bernard Hinault, and Eddy Merckx as the only
riders to win both time trials and the prologue _ also a time trial
_ the year they won the Tour. Armstrong's time-trial win two weeks
ago put him in the yellow jersey, seemingly for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to ride a great race to demonstrate the valor of the
yellow jersey,'' said Armstrong. ``I think the Tour is finally
finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Riders took off one by one on the flat but curvy circle around
the Futuroscope area _ a high-tech theme park four hours south of
Paris _ and averaged a speed of 31 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Hamilton, of Brookline, Mass., had his own rooting section
that saw him finish third, despite a hairpin turn that almost
caused him to stop. He was 1:35 behind teammate Armstrong but moved
up to 13th in the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, coughing and dripping with sweat, crossed the finish
line to be greeted by his sister, Jennifer, with her husband,
Brian, and friend Stephanie, all wearing a copy of Hamilton's bib
number 184 on their shirts. Hamilton's wife, Haven, had followed
him on the course in a team car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're `Team Hamilton,' '' said Stephanie, a Marblehead, Mass.,
native, of the group that arrived Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, Armstrong was asked what his most special moment
in the Tour was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling I haven't felt it yet,'' he said. ``I think
that riding down on the Champs Elysees wearing the yellow jersey
will be a very special moment. I think I'll feel it then.''

Quaint little Cooperstown bustles for a weekend
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ With the last Hall of Fame class of the
1900s waiting to be inducted, this sleepy, scenic little village,
hard by the Susquehanna River, coped with a population explosion
Saturday. A waiter exploded while carrying a tray of steamed clams.
</P>
<P>
   Some 40,000 tourists swarmed into town, bringing joy and
distress and traffic congestion to the fewer than 3,000 permanent
residents. The line that formed outside the Baseball Hall of Fame
snaked along the sidewalk for half a mile, and the entire law
enforcement might of Cooperstown _ 11 cops _ had been called out to
keep the peace. They were reinforced by the county sheriff's office
and 50 state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   The duty was not all that hard. This was a large crowd, but good
and orderly, according to one trooper, the kind of crowd you would
be proud to take home to your mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a rock concert,'' he said. ``This is more
family-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   One's attention was distracted briefly by a fellow in an
off-the-shoulder, leopard-spotted dress. He was crossing the street
carrying a box that appeared to contain baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' the trooper said, ``that guy has been here the last
four years. Don't know what the deal is.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the annual invasion of strangers, you can understand the
natives might get restless. They had to bring in out-of-town
drivers to operate the buses that transported 800 members of the
media. As they boarded one vehicle for the ride to a round of news
conferences, one journalist said, ``Does this bus go to
Woodstock?''
</P>
<P>
   Without a trace of humor, the driver spread out a map and said,
``We'll be lucky if I can find the high school.''
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to the auditorium where the new Hall of Famers
were to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Taking directions from his passengers, the driver pulled into
the parking lot, past a long line of pickets holding signs that
read, ``Get Real. No Deal'' and ``Zero is a four-letter word.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that a discordant note had intruded upon the
serenity of a town founded by the family of the writer and
naturalist, James Fenimore Cooper. Were these some of the striking
umpires? Was the reference to ``zero'' a protest of Nolan Ryan's
seven no-hitters?
</P>
<P>
   Further investigation revealed the protesters belonged to the
public employees' union demonstrating against George Pataki, the
governor of New York, and his failure to deliver a state budget.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a local chapter of the Green Party had called a news
conference Sunday to debate the question, ``Is baseball tourism
ruining Cooperstown?''
</P>
<P>
   A one-page statement began: ``The Baseball Hall of Fame was
designed not as a tacky amusement park, but as a museum and shrine.
It was meant to honor the national pastime in a reverential,
bucolic setting symbolizing an earlier and purer America.''
</P>
<P>
   The document accused the Hall of becoming ``Disneyfied,''
betraying the ideal of a place that prided itself on being called
``America's Hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   To absorb the fun and majesty of a Hall of Fame weekend, it is
necessary to suspend any cynical instincts.
</P>
<P>
   You need to believe Abner Doubleday really did lay out the first
diamond here in 1839, on a pasture owned by a man named Eli
Phinney, even though most historians dispute this. Many historians
also doubt the story told by the dramatist, Bill Stern, that
Doubleday was at the bedside of Abe Lincoln, whose last words were,
``Don't let baseball die.''
</P>
<P>
   There is support for Alexander Cartwright as the game's
godfather. Cartwright is credited with writing the game's first set
of workable rules, even before Abner plowed the first field.
</P>
<P>
   But this timeline doesn't work for everybody. For example, if
you visit the Hall of Fame, you might learn baseball was mentioned
in a diary by one of George Washington's soldiers at Valley Forge
in 1778. Jane Austen included a reference to the sport in a novel
published in 1819, after her death. That happened to be the year
Doubleday was born, and whatever the evidence, Cooperstown honors
his memory.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not the time or location to leap into local
entanglements, or ancient ones. And with no disrespect to anyone's
beliefs, we doubt Ryan, George Brett, Robin Yount and Orlando
Cepeda have any complaints. Nor would Smokey Joe Williams, Nestor
Chylak and Frank Selee, who are no longer alive.
</P>
<P>
   These seven represent the class of '99, the largest group to be
inducted into the Hall of Fame since eight were admitted in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   On a day of occasional ill temper, Ryan was gently reminded of
one of the golden moments identified with his long and glorious
career. He was sharing the stage with the former co-owner of the
Rangers, now the governor of Texas, George W. Bush. The governor
was asked if he could describe the night Robin (Not the Body)
Ventura charged Nolan on the mound, and what that said for the
spirit of the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the Alamo,'' Bush quipped. ``That was a big moment.
I'll bet Ventura wishes he had never taken a step toward the mound.
I was sitting right there on the front row, and I had the view he
had. Nolan had turned around, and he looked like a bull. The guy
got there and it was a fantastic experience. It elevated the legend
of the Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   That night Nolan got Ventura in a headlock and gave him six or
more quick noogies before other players intervened. He could not
suppress his grin as Bush reminisced, but privately he wishes the
public would forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think of that moment as embarrassing and wished the
media hadn't made it such an issue,'' Ryan said. ``After a while, I
realized that a new generation saw it as an older-younger thing. I
didn't know I was such a relic while I was playing.''
</P>
<P>
   His fists had no influence on his election to the Hall of Fame,
of course. But his willingness to defend his ground reflected the
competitive fire that boiled inside Ryan. That quality had a good
deal to do with his being here on the eve of this holiest of
baseball Sundays.

US WINS DESPITE SO-SO EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
 ZEALAND-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUADALAJARA, Mexico _ Nobody ever said reconstruction would be
pretty. It would have been nice if the US men's soccer team had
beaten its overmatched friends from New Zealand by three or four
goals in their FIFA Confederations Cup opener here Saturday. ``We
were up 2-0,'' said striker Brian McBride, shaking his head. ``It
should have been at least that.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it should have, could have, probably would have been a
couple of years ago. But the Yanks are a hardhat zone now, mixing
and matching and fixing and patching. And if they're ahead at the
final whistle against anybody, they're happy to take their W and
get on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy with the three points, but I'm disappointed
with the result,'' said coach Bruce Arena after his squad beat the
Kiwis, 2-1, before 60,000 at Jalisco Stadium but gave up a goal on
a 93d-minute free kick. ``We had a chance to win the game going
away. It should have been three or four to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Americans put a 4-0 result in the bank, they might have
had the luxury of playing for a draw in Friday's group finale
against Germany, which was routed, 4-0, by Brazil here Saturday in
the worst defeat for the Mannschaft in 45 years. Now, the US will
at least have to play the Brazilians close here on Wednesday to
make sure it has the goal-differential edge on the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Even without top stars Ronaldo, Rivaldo, and Roberto Carlos, who
went back to their club teams after Brazil blitzed Uruguay on
Sunday to retain the Copa America, the Samba Kings ran all over the
Germans, scoring all of their goals, two by substitute Alex in a
two-minute span, in the final 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst beating the rebuilding Germans had taken since
the Hungarians beat them, 8-3, in the 1954 World Cup, and the
message wasn't lost on the Americans. ``We certainly have to
improve,'' said Arena. ``Brazil is the best team in the world right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   And the New Zealanders, who haven't played in a world-level
tournament since the 1982 World Cup, are barely on the radar
screen. They're here because they beat the Australians last fall
for the Oceania title for the first time since 1973. They were so
excited about qualifying that they used it as an excuse to have
something of a world tour _ Singapore, Malaysia, Oman, Thailand _
and arrived here two weeks ago to get used to the heat and the
mile-high air.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Kiwis walked out in front of a packed house that
was rooting for them (and whistling throughout the Star-Spangled
Banner), they suddenly felt legless. ``We were very nervous,''
conceded coach Ken Dugdale. ``The occasion, the crowd, the
atmosphere took its toll on the result.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Yanks had themselves no walkover. Except for a killer
header by McBride off a lovely Jovan Kirovski cross in the 25th
minute, they had shown nothing by intermission. And it took two
superb saves by keeper Kasey Keller _ one on a dead-on volley by
Kris Bouckenooghe, another on Chris Jackson's point-blank driller _
to keep the US in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Keller, who blanked Argentina last month with similar acrobatics
and did the same to Brazil in last year's CONCACAF Gold Cup,
shouldn't have been that busy. Not against a side whose members
play for semi-pro club teams back home or scatter to places like
Singapore and Iceland to find paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the difference in standards between the US and New
Zealand, I was very pleased with the players' performance,'' said
Dugdale. ``The difference in the main is that we're not used to
playing at this level. We're very pleased to have stayed in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kiwis hadn't figured to, not after Kirovski headed in a
Eddie Lewis corner from six yards out to put the US up, 2-0, after
58 minutes. Even in rebuilding mode, the Yanks had far better
players on the bench, like Joe-Max Moore and Frankie Hejduk, than
New Zealand had on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Once Moore and Hejduk came in, the US figured to add a couple of
more goals. They coulda-shoulda-woulda _ but never did. ``We had a
ton of chances to go up 3-0 or 4-0,'' said defender Jeff Agoos.
``We've got to do it if we ever want to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the Americans figured to keep New Zealand off
the board. Instead, as referee Ubaldo Aquino of Paraguay was
glancing at his watch in added time, they gave up a free kick from
35 yards out _ and watched in dismay as Kiwi captain Chris Zoricich
slammed the ball over their heads and into the back of their net.
By the time they returned to midfield, it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed that we let up that goal at the end,''
said Arena. ``That probably shows our inexperience. But we felt
coming into the Cup that getting three points in the first match
was essential, and we did that. If we can manage one or three more
points, that'll probably get us through.''

You want an MVP? Bagwell's your man
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell doesn't consider himself in the same class as Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do I. Bags is better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a home-run race kind of guy,'' Bagwell said. ``I don't
think I'm the kind of guy that can hit 50 or 60.''
</P>
<P>
   But look at the home-run race. Look who's standing in the
batter's box on pace for 50-plus home runs _ his feet spread wide
apart, the bat twirling in his left hand like a magical baton, his
forearms practically bursting out of his skin.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell also doesn't consider this phenomenal season anything
like the Most Valuable Player year he had in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even close,'' he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   But look who is putting up the best all-around numbers in
baseball, batting .321, slamming home runs at a McGwire-like pace,
getting on base more than Ken Griffey Jr., coming up with the big
hits, the doubles, the stolen bases, the walks, the everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last few years, I've thought Barry Bonds was the best
all-around player in the league,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said. ``But Jeff does more things than anyone now. I don't know if
he isn't the best player in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   I do. He is.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Bagwell call himself the biggest reason these
injury-riddled Astros are driving toward another division flag. He
points to the clutch pitching, the aggressive running, the
contributions of so many Tim Bogars and Richard Hidalgos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud as heck of this club this year,'' he said. ``We've
played a lot of games and we still don't know what kind of club we
are yet because we've had so many injuries. We don't know how great
we can be.''
</P>
<P>
   I do. This team can be great, better even than a season ago and
there's one reason. Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe nothing epitomized Bagwell's importance to the Astros in
this season of pulled muscles and torn ligaments more than
Saturday's 5-2 win over the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   There was snakebit Astros starter Chris Holt winning with an
impressive seven-inning outing. There was the promising Daryle Ward
coming through with a run-scoring single in the first. There was
Russ Johnson making a statement from the No. 2 hole with a double
and a home run. There was Jay Powell with a quality late-relief
appearance and Billy Wagner slamming the door in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   But there was Bagwell _ quiet, efficient, unstoppable. He
reached base in all four at-bats, finishing with two runs, an RBI,
a walk, two doubles and a single. Before his second double, Bagwell
hit what would have been his 33rd homer, launching it into Toy
Cannon territory in the upper deck, but it landed just foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGwire and Sosa always get the attention,'' infielder Bill
Spiers said. ``But somehow, Jeff gets it done quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe nothing better illustrated Bagwell's production than a
critical at-bat he had Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As Bagwell was stepping to the plate in the seventh inning, the
Fox network went to a split-screen ``Bonus Coverage'' graphic of
the Mets-Cubs game in New York. The Sosa watch was on. The network
all but ignored the best player in the game, pushing Bagwell into a
small corner of the screen. But it was Bagwell slamming a 400-foot
double to center field; Sosa popped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' Bagwell said of the flurry of attention given
Sosa and McGwire. ``What I've done this year it's been kind of an
aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to home runs, where Bagwell has 32 compared to
McGwire's 34 and Sosa's 36, perhaps it has. But it now is late July
and Bagwell remains in the midst of it all.
</P>
<P>
   He has added huge home-run production to his usual arsenal while
playing half his games in a park that spits back so many long
drives. Saturday, there was the long double off the wall. Two days
earlier, there was a nearly 400-foot drive that fell short of the
center-field flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hits 10 or 15 balls a year that should be out but aren't,''
Craig Biggio said.
</P>
<P>
   He has done it for a team that has been decimated by injuries.
He has done it despite getting little help out of the No. 2 hole.
He has done it while carrying a load he should have shared with the
injured Moises Alou and Ken Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine what his numbers would be if everyone was
healthy and this park was better for him,'' outfielder Carl Everett
said. ``McGwire is a one-dimensional player _ it's all or nothing
with him. If I had to pick one player to start a team with, it
would be Jeff.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the MVP trophy were voted on by fans or the networks, it
likely would go to Sosa or McGwire. Fans want to see McGwire flex.
They want to see Sosa salute his fans. It's all nice. But if it's
an MVP you want to see, then it's Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give him the MVP,'' Everett said.
</P>
<P>
   I would.

BAKER NOT SECURE IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ The president and general manager of the Seattle
SuperSonics made a brief appearance here this week at the
Tournament of the Americas. It was well timed. Wally Walker got to
see one of his players, Gary Payton, one of his free agents, Vin
Baker, and also saw Aaron Goodwin, who represents both players.
</P>
<P>
   But he was back in Seattle at week's end with as full a plate as
any NBA executive _ and the Aug. 1 land rush is only seven days
away. It is a balancing act for certain.
</P>
<P>
   Already we are seeing signs that some teams that played well
last season and had pretty good records are thinking about blowing
it all up. (They could also hire Don Nelson to do it for them, but
he's taken.) Orlando is rebuilding. Atlanta appears to be
rebuilding (Steve Smith is rumored to be headed to Portland and
Mookie Blaylock already is gone.) Seattle didn't play well last
season and, as the English might say, is between sixes and sevens.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has a team both young and old. As presently constituted,
it's not nearly good enough. But it's a team that recently has been
very good. Walker is trying to reload (the Horace Grant trade) and
rebuild simultaneously and that's a tough act. His big star,
Payton, wants it now. His second big star, Baker, isn't sure what
he's going to do. Another star, Detlef Schrempf, is a free agent
and all but gone. Olden Polynice is a free agent, not to mention
certifiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Grant trade, we sent a message, loud and clear, to
our players and our fans that we're serious right now,'' Walker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Payton has been all over the map down here discussing the
situation back home. He wants veterans; Mitch Richmond's name has
come up, at least in his mind. He wants the kids to grow up. He has
issued a challenge to coach Paul Westphal. He issued a challenge to
the team's young players. He issued a challenge to Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get meaner guys. We can't keep going with young
guys. We've got enough young guys,'' Payton said. ``We drafted
three young guys last year and that didn't work. We didn't have no
veterans (uh, Gary, you had plenty; you just didn't win.) We can't
start over. I can't. I can't start over with young guys. We need to
get back on top of the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't happen again,'' he said, referring to last season's
lottery finish. ``We're going to make changes and do the right
thing. I like the Horace trade as long as Horace comes in and plays
like he can play. It's good for Vin, too. That makes me a happy
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker is not in an enviable position. Just looking at Baker
these last 10 days drives home his dilemma. On one hand, you have a
player who was an All-Star, but never won anything. That may have
simply been a misfortune of playing for a bad team. Then, last
year, Baker was awful. He still looks overweight and, although he
insists otherwise, there's no guarantee he will return to previous
form. And there's $70 million at stake.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the Celtics are interested in him. Rick Pitino
relishes the prospect of rejuvenating careers and Baker is prime
rejuvenation material. Baker also has been around, which makes him
valuable on a young team. The deal would be for Antoine Walker but
would have to include a third team, probably Chicago. The Bulls
would want their pound of flesh, but only in picks and/or players
in the last year of their contracts; Pervis Ellison (see below)
would be a perfect fit here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have great interest in Vin Baker,'' Pitino said this
week on ESPN's Up Close. ``If Vin would like to play for us, we
hope it comes true.''
</P>
<P>
   Wally Walker said he has not heard from the Celtics about Baker
_ it would have to be a sign-and-trade deal. He said he is
convinced that he will re-sign Baker and that Baker wants to stay
in Seattle. ``Vin has told me consistently that he wants to be in
Seattle,'' Walker said. ``He feels he has got a lot to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker does have a lot to prove. Baker and Payton are good
friends, they have the same agent, and, as Payton said, ``I don't
think we traded Shawn Kemp to have Vin Baker for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Stranger things have happened.
</P>
<P>

   The Celtics' summer league opens Monday at UMass-Boston and the
Nets are in a tizzy. ``Did Rick not schedule us because he was
afraid of Don Casey's juggernaut?'' cracked Nets general manager
John Nash. Well, we can't say. But the Celtics play every team but
New Jersey over the six days, including the German Select Team. The
new rules will be in effect, which means there will be a lot of
fouls, free throws, and delayed starts. There are six NBA teams
competing, seven if you insist on counting the Wizards: Boston, New
Jersey, Indiana, Philadelphia, Seattle, New York, and Washington.
Rosters were sketchy heading into the weekend, but Celtics GM Chris
Wallace said that Ellison, who was in Boston working out this
weekend, will play. You draw your own conclusions. If he's going to
be included in any deal, the receiving team has to know if he can
play. If he's going to stick around, the Celtics would like to know
if he can play. This is the last year of Ellison's six-year,
thank-you-ML deal. He's not too old to keep going, but he simply
has been unable to stay healthy. The Bulls could throw him out
there for a year if they are indeed midwiving the three-team Baker
deal. Chicago wants to be well under the cap next summer as well
(things didn't exactly turn out as the Bulls hoped this summer).
Among players who could be free agents next summer are Grant Hill
and Tim Duncan . . . The Celtics are coming off an 8-0 run in the
Fila Summer Pro League in Long Beach, Calif. _ and they may not be
invited back for using too many ringers. While most teams opted to
play rookies, free agents, and scrubs, the Celtics used rookies,
free agents, scrubs, and starters. Paul Pierce played in five games
and was a man among boys. Vitaly Potapenko played in all eight
games and was among men. Tony Battie played in all eight games
(hint: he played well, now's the time to deal him). When Pierce
left, Walter McCarty showed up for the last three games. Wayne
Turner also played in all eight games and, according to Wallace,
fared well. Another solid performer was CBA MVP Adrian Griffin, who
is making a strong run to crack an NBA roster . . . After his first
year in San Antonio, Larry Brown had the third pick in the 1989 NBA
draft. He used it to take Sean Elliott. Brown said it was known
that Elliott had a kidney condition, but that it wasn't expected to
interfere with his playing career. ``I made inquiries about Sean
when I got to Philly,'' Brown said. ``We knew about the situation.
It was just something that we thought might happen down the road.
That's why winning the championship was such a great thing for him,
for David (Robinson) and for Avery (Johnson).'' You have to wonder
what's going on in Duncan's mind as this all unfolds. ``To know
that he was playing with this makes what he did and what we did
last season so much more incredible,'' Duncan said of Elliott. As
for his status, Duncan has said he will not sign an extension prior
to this, his third season. Elliott may never play again. Robinson
turns 34 in two weeks and how many more years does he have? But
Duncan likes it in San Antonio and if the city comes through with a
new arena he said he will stick around. ``If the team's going to
move, I'm not going to move. If they stay and want me around, I'll
stay.'' Gee, Tim, do you think that's an issue? Duncan should be
reason enough to approve the new building. He also would be a great
lure for other good players to come to Texas . . . The Minnesota
Timberwolves and Terrell Brandon had an extended meeting last week
to see if they could agree on a new deal. Brandon was there along
with his parents and agent Bill Duffy. The Wolves had Kevin McHale,
coach Flip Saunders, and owner Glen Taylor. The issue is money, of
course. While Brandon is eligible for an extension starting at $11
million, neither side expects that to be the kickoff point. McHale
isn't coming off the best of years; he rejected a deal for Tom
Gugliotta that would have included Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones
because he didn't like Campbell in general and worried about
Jones's poor playoff record. He settled instead for Joe Smith and
then he was unable to keep Stephon Marbury. ``Each year, I lose a
little,'' Kevin Garnett lamented. ``It's hard. You can't make
plans. If someone tells me that we're going to have the same team,
I'm just going to laugh. But what can you do? You have to go with
the flow.'' . . . A Greek team in Athens is prepared to offer Scott
Burrell roughly $2 million, which he ought to take because the Nets
are offering about half that much. Chris Morris, meanwhile, also
has signed to play overseas for about $1.5 million. No one in
Phoenix is weeping over the loss . . . More from Pitino on Up
Close: Regarding Walker and Ron Mercer, he said, ``We don't have
any problems, we have differences in philosophy. I'm more from the
Bill Russell philosophy in terms of team and discipline. They're
just young. They have to learn.'' He also said that if the two
think he is too hard on them, ``what I'd like to do is send them
down for two weeks in Miami. They'd come back with a different
attitude.''

US PAN AM CONTINGENT HARDLY THE FIRST TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Though the United States has sent its usual 700-member
battalion of athletes to the quadrennial Pan American Games in
Winnipeg, roughly half of them are B-teamers who probably won't
make it to next summer's Olympics in Sydney. Most of the A-teamers
in the marquee sports have better options coming up next month _
the track-and-field types have world championships in Seville, the
boxers have world championships in Houston, the swimmers have the
Pan Pacific meet in Sydney, and the rowers have their global
regatta in Ontario. Most of the sports that did send the varsity
are teams like baseball, softball, field hockey, handball, and
men's water polo that need to win or place well at the Pan- Ams to
qualify for Olympus. Except for softball, it won't be easy for any
of them.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball team, which is sending minor leaguers (like
pitchers Mark Mulder and Bobby Seay) for the first time, has to
finish no worse than second to qualify. After the Yanks were banged
around twice by the Dominican Republic in tuneups, that's no longer
given. Though the US can use anyone not on a 40-man roster, not
everybody wanted to (or was allowed to) spend three weeks in
Manitoba. Some invitees, such as Red Sox farmhand Adam Everett,
opted to stay with their clubs. Others were kept home by their
front offices. Most notable detainee was Yankee farmhand Nick
Johnson, whom owner George Steinbrenner (a former USOC vice
president) kept with his Double A team in Norwich.

   After a sluggish start _ only a third of the targeted 600,000
tickets were sold by late May _ Manitobans began snapping up Pan Am
Games seats last week, buying 22,000 in five days. By Friday's
opening day, sales had surpassed 313,000, and 23 event finals had
been sold out . . . Less lavish opening and closing ceremonies. No
street banners. No information booths for visitors. Black-and-white
photocopies instead of slick color brochures. That's part of the
new chop list for the Salt Lake City organizers, who want to reduce
their $300 million gap to $187 million on a $1.34 billion budget.
``Simplify, simplify, simplify,'' says Fraser Bullock, Mitt
Romney's new chief operating officer. The guideline: If they don't
need it to stage ``great Games,'' cut it . . . No more Whatizits.
The Salt Lake mascot trio (snowshoe hare, coyote, black bear) will
have simple names tied to Utah nature themes, and the public (that
means you, too) gets to choose them. The options are: (1) Powder,
Copper, and Coal; (2) Sky, Cliff, and Shadow; and (3) Arrow, Bolt,
and Rocky. Vote by calling 1-877-3MASCOTS toll-free or going online
at www.slc2002.org. Deadline is Saturday.

   As the Salt Lake payoff scandal recedes and the Sydney Games
draw closer, Americans' usual enthusiasm for the Olympics seems to
be returning. Eighty-five percent of those polled recently by the
US Olympic Committee say they'll watch the Games, 80 percent say
they have positive feelings about the Olympics, and 71 percent say
they're positive about the US team . . . As expected, the US topped
the medal table at the biennial World University Games in Palma de
Mallorca for the fifth straight time, winning 52 medals (and 23
golds) to Russia's 36 (and 13). Biggest haul came from the
track-and-field types, who won 25 medals. The next WUGs will be in
Beijing . . . It took a nasty letter threatening subpoenas, but the
Atlanta organizers have promised ``unfettered access'' to eight
sensitive boxes of records for the House Commerce Committee, which
is investigating whether Atlanta paid off International Olympic
Committee members the way Salt Lake did. Though the ACOG admits it
gave the Lords numerous gifts over the $200 limit, the committee
swears it bribed nobody. Meanwhile, the other 6,000 boxes of
records have already been made public. You're free to rummage
about, for the price of an access-and-retrieval fee.

   Belated _ and unexpected _ world medal for Westport horsewoman
Kerry Millikin, who picked up a team bronze from last year's global
eventing championships after the British had theirs taken away for
using a doped horse . . . The Lords of the Rings may be feeling the
heat from Swiss politicians and media types for picking Turin over
favored Sion as 2006 Winter Games host, but that doesn't mean the
IOC is looking to move its headquarters to a friendlier haven after
85 years. ``If Switzerland and Lausanne don't chase us out,'' says
president Juan Antonio Samaranch, ``we'll stay here with
pleasure.'' . . . Lots of familiar faces missing from the US boxing
team for the biennial world championships next month. Five national
champions (flyweight Roberto Benitez, lightweight Jacob Hudson,
light middleweight Darnell Wilson, middleweight Arthur Palac, and
heavyweight Malik Scott) all were beaten in the boxoffs. Biggest
surprise was Wilson, who hadn't lost to a countryman since David
Reid beat him in the 1996 Olympic boxoffs. He lost to Anthony
Hanshaw, whom he'd hammered, 27-8, at nationals . . . Modest
results for the US fighters at the world taekwondo championships.
Bronze medals for bantamweight Mark Lopez and welterweight Joshua
Coleman and nothing for the women. As expected the Koreans, who
invented the martial art, won both the men's and women's overall
title and grabbed nine of 16 golds and should dominate the podium
in Sydney.

   Volleyball purists may consider the beach version a bastard
child, but that's where the US federation is putting its incentive
cash from the USOC for Sydney. The barefeet, who have much better
medal chances, are getting more than $160,000. And if the
equestrian types had any doubts about who matters, their federation
will spend its $150,000 grant sending three horses to Sydney in
September to see how they handle jet lag . . . Naomi Nari Nam may
not be old enough for the senior skating circuit (she's just turned
14), but she's already landed an endorsement. LG Electronics, a
Korean consumer electronics company, has made Nam its global
spokesperson and goodwill ambassador . . . Turns out that the
marching bands at the Olympic opening ceremonies will be formed by
homegrown Aussies after all. The ceremonies director had recruited
Americans and Japanese because he said that Aussies were too
militaristic and took kangaroo-sized steps. After that touched off
a patriotic furor Down Under, the organizers backed off and have
reassigned the foreign bands to other venues during the Games.

   SAN JUAN _ The gold medal is still at large, but the Olympic
berth is a sure thing. The United States basketball team spotted
Argentina an early 7-point lead and then rolled to an 88-59 victory
Saturday in the Tournament of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The win accomplished the trip's purpose by assuring the US a
spot in next year's Olympics in Sydney. The US improved to 9-0 in
the tournament and will play the other Olympic qualifier, Canada,
Sunday night for the gold medal. Argentina and Puerto Rico will
play for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   The US started out slowly Saturday and at one point trailed,
17-10, its largest deficit of the tournament. ``I think we were a
little tight,'' said Tim Hardaway, who led the US with 17 points.
``Then we got it going.''
</P>
<P>
   The crushing stretch came with Argentina nursing a 23-20 lead
and dreaming of the impossible. A 3-point play by Kevin Garnett
kicked off a 23-2 run that, in effect, ended competition for the
day. The US led by 14 at the half and extended that lead in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett (11), Gary Payton (15), and Tom Gugliotta (10) also
scored in double figures for the Yanks. Payton also had seven
assists and four steals and played 34 minutes, including the entire
first half, in the 40-minute game. The US had a 40-26 rebounding
edge.

GHO CONNECTICUT'S RITE OF SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ To those who grew up in Connecticut as a caddie or
junior golfer, the most exciting ritual of summer was the trip to
the Insurance City Open at Wethersfield Country Club outside
Hartford. It was special. Winners of the event included Sam Snead
and Bob Toski, and it yielded Arnold Palmer's first professional
victory on US soil after he'd won the Canadian Open in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe the tournament, now called the Greater
Hartford Open, will turn 50 in two years at the new venue at River
Highlands. The litany of winners at Wethersfield included Palmer a
second time, Billy Casper on four occasions, Charlie Sifford, and
Curtis Strange. Sammy Davis Jr., as sponsor, put his name on the
tournament for 16 years, even after it outgrew Wethersfield and
moved to the Tournament Players Club in Cromwell with its stadium
concept that now attracts crowds among the largest on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The total purse, which was $15,000 in 1952, had risen to
$300,000 when the tourney left Wethersfield in 1984. A contract
with Canon USA now guarantees a $2.5 million purse, which will grow
over the term of the deal that expires in 2002. Ed May, general
chairman of the first ICO, said on the eve of the last tournament
at Wethersfield that the move was ``a little like the Brooklyn
Dodgers moving to LA.''
</P>
<P>
   The event, which begins Thursday, has always been run by the
Greater Hartford Jaycees, and the idea of a professional golf
attraction was raised in 1951, when the group considered inviting
Ben Hogan to play in a fund-raising exhibition. Hogan declined.
``So we said, `Why not go all the way?' '' said May in that
interview 16 years ago. ``Why not ask the PGA if we could get on
the Tour? We asked for one in 1952, and we got it. We little
realized golf was on the verge of taking off.'' May cited factors
such as President Eisenhower's love of the game, the eventual
emergence of Palmer, and the expansion of television to explain the
sport's sudden popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The field for the GHO, which ranks behind Los Angeles, the
Western, the Byron Nelson, Houston, Colonial, and Greensboro in
terms of longevity, will include Davis Love, David Duval, Jeff
Maggert, Tom Lehman, Justin Leonard, Stewart Cink, David Frost,
Fuzzy Zoeller, Paul Azinger, and Billy Andrade. Brad Faxon, who has
been idled by a wrist injury from a fall at his home in Barrington,
R.I., May 23, will make his return.
</P>
<P>
   The Open became the PGA Tour's only stop of the year in New
England after the one at Pleasant Valley was discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 128th British Open championship passed into history last
Sunday, leaving enough conversational pieces to last at least until
the Ryder Cup at The Country Club in September. We saw Paul Lawrie,
a player from neighboring Aberdeenranked 159th in the world, come
from 10 shots behind to win in a playoff. We saw France's Jean Van
de Velde suffer a triple-bogey 7 on the 72d hole when a 6 would
have won it. We saw Leonard go into the Barry Burn twice on the
18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrie now has the Claret Jug and has gained a place on the
Ryder Cup team that will defend against the US in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   There was astonishment when Van de Velde didn't simply play it
out to a bogey or double bogey instead of flirting with the
incredible rough and watery grave. ``Biggest blunder since Roberto
de Vicenzo signed the (incorrect) scorecard (1968) and gave Bob
Goalby the Masters,'' offered one observer.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia, the wunderkind out of Spain who had won the Irish
Open and was joint second in Loch Lomond, shot 89-83_172 to miss
the cut and finish last.
</P>
<P>
   He's just 19, but he was critical of Carnoustie and offered
that, for the first time in 10 years, he wouldn't watch the final
two rounds on television. ``It didn't deserve it,'' read one
published report. It is uncertain whether the course, on which
hometown hero Tommy Armour won in 1931 in Carnoustie's first
British Open, will return to the rotation. It's not scheduled, but
one source said 2007 might be a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   After a sleepless night when he placed the Claret Jug in the
middle of the living room and watched a video of the championship
recorded by his wife, Marian (who wasn't on hand because she had to
mind the two young kids), Lawrie explained why he will always
remain a child of Aberdeen. ``It is home,'' he said, ``and we will
always live here. But I will buy myself a Ferrari and maybe a
Porsche as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The championship will be remembered as the one in which Van de
Velde lost his cool on the 72d hole. On the eve of the
championship, tournament chairman Hugh Campbell said, ``I think our
strategy is to present Carnoustie with the same degree of
difficulty as it was for previous Open championships _ certainly in
my time, which goes back to Ben Hogan.'' Wonder what Hogan would
have thought?
</P>
<P>
   The footnote is the Ryder Cup. The Europeans weren't expected to
contend, but Jose Maria Olazabal won the Masters, and now the
unheralded Lawrie has won the British Open. Colin Montgomerie, the
hero of the European victory at Valderrama, won Loch Lomond on the
way to Carnoustie. Lee Westwood is one of the European's top young
players. Of the top 10 on the US list, just Payne Stewart (US Open)
and Tiger Woods (Western) have won since the Masters. Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   Peter Mele, who grew up in the golf surroundings of Strange,
Lanny Wadkins, and Jay Haas and ran the PGA Senior Tour event at
Nashawtuc CC for the past 11 years, has recently completed his
first year as executive director of the Buick PGA Tournament in
Westchester, N.Y. ``We changed a lot,'' Mele said recently.
``They'd been doing things the same way for a lot of years. They
had the main entrance run by the clubhouse and the first tee, and
the 18th green were there. It created a lot of congestion, so we
moved the entrance. The parking lot was expanded, and it would shut
down their driving range for the week to create a bigger lot. We
changed that.'' The toughest part of the transition, according to
Mele, ``was not knowing what had happened previously at that event.
I went from an event of which I knew everything to an event of
which I knew nothing. It's been great. Working for the PGA Tour has
been great. I'm delighted with the move.'' . . . Charley Volpone,
who was head pro at Nashawtuc for 13 years before becoming
reinstated as an amateur, returned to the professional ranks two
years ago and will try to qualify for the BankBoston Classic (Aug.
20-22 at Nashawtuc). He'll get his chance Aug. 16 at New England
CC, and he'd dearly love to get a sponsor's exemption as a former
head pro, member of the club, and a player who won the New England
PGA Championship twice, the Massachusetts Open twice, and the Skip
Wogan Award as the New England section's player six times between
1970 and 1976 . . . Golf World picked up the quote of the British
Open. Craig Parry turned to playing partner Van de Velde, who was
immersed in the Barry Burn, and advised, ``Wait a little longer.
The tide's going out in a couple of minutes.''

PIXAR NOT RESTING ON LAURELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The hottest companies in Hollywood sit 400 miles
to the north of Los Angeles in a pair of small towns connected by
the San Rafael Bridge over the San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The city of San Rafael has received worldwide notoriety as
headquarters for the ``Star Wars'' empire operated by George Lucas.
But the other town, Port Richmond, has remained largely under the
Hollywood radar.
</P>
<P>
   That will change soon. All indications point toward computer
industry legend Steve Jobs and Pixar Animation letting loose their
third blockbuster movie in three tries with ``Toy Story 2,'' due
out Nov. 24.
</P>
<P>
   If the sequel performs as expected, it will be truly an
astounding achievement in an industry where perhaps one in 10
movies ever becomes a hit. In short, Pixar has become a nearly sure
thing in one of the world's most volatile businesses, where tastes
and trends can be impossible to predict from one season to the
next.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lucas and ``Star Wars,'' Pixar has also re-energized and
revolutionized the movie business by showing that the public has a
massive appetite for three-dimensional, computer-generated
animation. 1995's ``Toy Story'' and 1998's ``A Bug's Life''
generated combined domestic ticket sales of over $350million and
rank as the 29th- and 54th-highest grossers of all time,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's conclusion: Pixar is no longer a fluke. It
actually has lived up to the hype of being able to mix staggeringly
powerful computer technology with commercially viable stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Pixar has done is break new ground in the convergence of
entertainment and technology,'' said Kevin B. Skislock of Laguna
Research Partners. ``To find a company that merges both is
extremely rare.''
</P>
<P>
   The power of Pixar has become evident a full four months before
the opening of ``Toy Story 2,'' co-produced by Pixar and The Walt
Disney Co. Much like the situation with ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _
The Phantom Menace'' in May, other studios have moved out of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no other animated films scheduled to be released
during the holiday 1999 season, something we think could bode
extremely well for `Toy Story 2' box office revenues,'' said
Katherine Styponias, an analyst with Prudential Securities, noting
the ``A Bug's Life'' generated outstanding numbers despite going up
against three strong animated movies _ ``Antz,'' ``Prince of
Egypt'' and ``Rugrats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pixar has become the best way to play what is the single-most
attractive segment of the film industry,'' said analyst Andrew
Slaban of Merrill Lynch, who has a ``buy'' rating on Pixar stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pixar and `Toy Story' was such a winning combination that we
believe `Toy Story 2' will be the year's top family film with a
domestic gross in the $175 million range,'' said Robert Bucksbaum,
president of the Reel Source forecasting service. ``Everything
Pixar has done so far is golden.''
</P>
<P>
   Pixar was originally created by George Lucas as part of his
special-effects operations. Jobs bought Pixar in 1986 from Lucas
for $10 million and still owns more than two-thirds of the company.
His full-time job remains the turnaround of Apple Computer, a
company he founded and that he leads as its interim chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   As with the revival of Apple, Jobs' touch with Pixar and its 450
employees has been magical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Steve has been the critical factor by giving Pixar
them foresight and leadership,'' Skislock said. ``One of the things
that impresses me is the discipline Steve has used in growing this
company. Wall Street used to feel that Pixar was not growing fast
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Slaban said Jobs is adept at retaining gifted artists such as
John Lasseter, a Pixar vice president who directed both ``Toy
Story'' movies and co-directed ``A Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jobs is known as someone who can get things done,'' Slaban
said. ``I also think it's the culture of backing creative talent
like John Lasseter. When you're on the company campus, it really is
a completely different feeling from what I'm used to in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' is a landmark for Burbank-based Disney, too. It
had originally been planned as a direct-to-video release, but
Disney decided early last year to break its long-standing policy
that prevented animated sequels from being released theatrically.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's shift in strategy looks like it will pay off big at a
time when the company has been losing favor on Wall Street. Initial
reaction to the ``Toy Story 2'' trailer, which began playing a
month ago, has been strong and Internet buzz on the movie is
positive.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Woody will be stolen by a collector while his
owner Andy is off at camp, then rescued by the other toys. At one
point, the toys cause chaos when they hide under orange traffic
cones as they move across a road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are madly working hard, getting the last pieces done,''
said Ed Catmull, chief technology officer at Pixar, who admits
there are definite differences between ``Toy Story'' and ``Toy
Story 2.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``You might say the characters are richer but you probably won't
think about it and that's the way we want it to be,'' Catmull said.
``We really don't want people to be aware of the technology; we
just want them to believe that the characters are alive. And even
though we're technical people, we all believe story is the most
important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Disney, the 1997 partnership deal with Pixar appears to be a
massive success. The agreement calls for four more films with split
costs and profits and will help keep the entertainment giant at the
forefront of its most prized and basic business _ creating animated
films with memorable characters.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of new product, expected to be one film per year
starting in 2001, will keep Disney as the dominant player even
though rivals have managed to broaden the audience for animation
through the successes of ``Beavis and Butthead,'' ``South Park,''
``Rugrats,'' ``Antz'' and ``Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney and Pixar announced this spring that their next film will
be ``Monsters Inc.,'' with a tentative release date of mid-2001.
``A comedy set in the realm if things that go bump in the night,
where chaos breaks loose after a hapless monster accidentally lets
a human child into the secret world,'' is all that's been disclosed
so far.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street already believes Disney and Pixar will continue to
generate hits, citing the combination of Pixar's creative talent
and Disney's marketing muscle. ``Our scenarios are based on
achieving box office receipts similar to that of Disney's more
successful films and/or `Toy Story,' '' Styponias said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that Pixar-Disney films do well at the box office.
``They also have a big afterlife with merchandise and home video,''
Slaban said. ``It's what makes animated films the best segment of
the movie business, which is pretty lousy these days with margins
in the single digits. The merchandise profits are an aspect you
don't have from live action.''
</P>
<P>
   Pixar's success has inspired Hollywood; there are nine major
animated projects set to be released in the Year 2000 _ ``Fantasia
2000,'' ``Dinosaurs,'' ``Kingdom of the Sun'' from Disney; ``The
Road to El Dorado,'' ``Chicken Run'' and ``Shrek'' from DreamWorks;
``Titan A.E.'' from 20th Century Fox; and ``Osmosis Jones'' from
Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   Will Pixar be able to stay at the front of the pack? Absolutely,
Skislock predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what I think Steve Jobs understands _ when Wall Street
wanted instant gratification, he stuck to his guns and did it
right,'' he said. ``I'm convinced he'll never rush anything out so
Pixar will release a film only when it's ready from a story and
technology standpoint. They're well-positioned to be where the
technology is headed because this is not a speed game; it's a
quality game.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors have never been united about Pixar. It went public in
late 1995 amid a frenzy over ``Toy Story'' with shares jumping from
$17 to $39 on the first day, then fell as low as $12 during 1996.
The stock got a bump in 1997 after Jobs negotiated the five-picture
deal with Disney and during the past year, Pixar has traded between
$27.50 and $66. It has been just under $50 in recent weeks; and
several analysts have price targets of $60.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pixar is hardly a juggernaut. First-quarter earnings
amounted to only $900,000, or 2 cents a share, enough to beat Wall
Street's consensus estimate. Revenue fell to $3.4 million from $5
million. Second-quarter earnings are due out Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Pixar keeps its image low-key and won't discuss what
films it will do after ``Monsters Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now in a new area of using technology to make films,
trying to invent better ways of doing that,'' Catmull said. ``What
matters most is how our people feel about a project. That's not a
side issue _ it's fundamental. It needs to feel good to us.''

MALONE: SOME DODGERS ARE SELFISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A day after a despicable Dodgers loss to Arizona,
general manager Kevin Malone said a big part of the problem is some
players care more about their statistics than whether they win or
lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems to be that some players don't care as much as others,''
Malone said Saturday before the last-place Dodgers played the
Diamondbacks. ``It seems to be some players have different
priorities, seems to be some players that their ultimate priority
is not winning games, who have other agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get all 25 players on the same page with the same
agendas and same priorities. There's a lot of guys who really want
to win, who really care. We have to get that to be everyone and not
just the majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone's comment reflect what some players privately think in
the clubhouse, but few are willing to state it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Gary Sheffield said during the Dodgers' last road
trip in Pittsburgh that the Dodgers began playing better because
they stopped playing selfish baseball. They were in the midst of a
stretch of winning eight times in 10 games, their best streak of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   However, after making a quasi-push to rejoin the division race,
which included jumping out of last place for a few days, the
Dodgers were swept three games at home by Colorado and lost the
opener of a three-games series with Arizona in terrible fashion
10-1 Friday. They also Saturday night to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves the $80 million Dodgers 11 games under .500 at 43-54,
and in need of change. Before Saturday's game, Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said Carlos Perez was yanked from the rotation and
Eric Young was no longer the starting second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we've been trying to do all year, find out whose
priority and whose focus is on winning,'' Malone said. ``I think we
have to do what we're doing now. Try different strategies,
different approaches, use our whole team and try to find a winning
combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure all 25 players are on the same page and
point in the same direction. I think we'll continue to look for
players that will put us in the most dependable position to win.'' &QL;

MCGINNIS LOOKING FORWARD; BEARS LOOKING RIDICULOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals defensive coordinator  &UR; Dave McGinnis must be the
luckiest pro football coach in America.
</P>
<P>
   He's not the boss of the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   It was just last winter that McGinnis walked out on the Bears,
who had announced his hiring as head coach before he had agreed to
terms. The whole thing was botched so badly _ he heard he had
accepted the job on the car radio _ team president  &UR; Michael
McCaskey was fired by his mother,  &UR; Virginia Halas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Bears have done it again, announcing their starting
quarterback, rookie  &UR; Cade McNown, before they even have him signed.
They did that by cutting starter  &UR; Erik  &UR; Kramer last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear where we are going, where our future is,''
first-year Coach  &UR; Dick Jauron said. ``Cade is our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer was shocked by the move. After all, Jauron, hired on the
phone after McGinnis withdrew his name from consideration, had
proclaimed Kramer No. 1 earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go from No. 1 to No. 5 in a day,'' Kramer said. ``Get
real.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears were roasted in the Chicago press. Nobody cuts his
starting quarterback two days before training camp, especially
after encouraging him to get his sore shoulder rehabilitated at a
monthlong special workout program in the Valley of the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago Tribune'' columnist  &UR; Bernie Lincicome wrote that ``any
doubts that new bunch running the Bears is ruthless enough, weasely
enough or deceitful enough to compete in the National Football
League are now laid to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote that anyone who sits down with  &UR; Mark Hatley,
Bears' vice president for personnel, should ``feel for his wallet
before leaving,'' and he called Jauron a liar.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer couldn't understand why the Bears never leveled with him,
including videotaping his workout a week ago. They did that to
prove Kramer was healthy, just in case he tried to claim they had
waived him injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I wasn't treated honestly,'' said Kramer, who first
hurt his shoulder in an Oct. 11 game against the Cardinals at Sun
Devil Stadium. ``They just told me they've been thinking about this
since back in June, that it had become a possibility after the last
team get-together in June. If that was the case, if they were being
honest, they would've said, `Hey, Erik, this is a possibility.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bears President  &UR; Ted Phillips said he didn't think the team had
done anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two years, we were a 4-12 team, and Erik was our
quarterback,'' Phillips said. ``There was no lying to Erik Kramer.
I want to make that clear. You don't tell a player you're thinking
about releasing him.''
</P>
<P>
   With McNown being promoted to first team, even before he has
signed, teams on the Bears' schedule can't wait to play them. After
all, the Cowboys went 1-15 in quarterback  &UR; Troy Aikman's rookie
year, and he didn't even get the victory. The Cardinals'  &UR; Jake
Plummer won only two games in a 4-12 rookie season.  &UR; Peyton Manning
broke most rookie passing records a year ago, but the Colts
finished 3-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your 14-year-old comes home with straight A's, you don't give
him the keys to the car,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   You do if you're the Bears, who now must get McNown signed. It
might not be easy. His agent,  &UR; Tom  &UR; Condon, also is Kramer's.
</P>
<P>
   So until McNown comes to camp, the Bears are left with this
motley crew of quarterbacks _  &UR; Shane Matthews,  &UR; Jim Miller and
 &UR; Moses
 &UR; Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   Their top running back,  &UR; Curtis  &UR; Enis, is trying to come back
from knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Enis didn't make a quiet entrance to camp. He was asked by
reporters if he still considered himself a Christian, being that he
dumped his last agent, who was affiliated with Champions for
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Enis, ever perceptive, realized that the reporter asking the
question was Jewish. He then went on to make an offensive remark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I have no problem being Jewish,'' Enis said. ``I like to
get money and make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jauron had no response.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did McGinnis, who was busy trying to get ready for the
Cardinals' opening day of camp. &QL; 
Revisionist history
</P>
<P>
   The spin out of the nation's capital is that new Redskins owner
 &UR; Daniel Snyder had to fire General Manager  &UR; Charley Casserly on
Friday because Casserly and Coach  &UR; Norv  &UR; Turner couldn't even be in
the same room together. Their relationship had deteriorated that
much.
</P>
<P>
   One reason they stopped speaking was because Turner has Snyder
convinced that most of the Redskins' mistakes the past five years
were Casserly's fault, which is not true.
</P>
<P>
   Turner was the one who picked Tennessee quarterback  &UR; Heath
Shuler and Colorado wide receiver  &UR; Michael  &UR; Westbrook in the top
five of back-to-back drafts. The coach had all the power back then.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly, who had been with the Redskins since 1977, didn't stay
around that long because he was incompetent. Just last April, he
found a way to wheel and deal in the 1999 draft to get the player
he wanted, Georgia cornerback  &UR; Champ Bailey, and still come out of
it with three first-round picks next year.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, who at 34 is the NFL's youngest owner, replaced Casserly
with former 49ers player personnel boss  &UR; Vinny Cerrato, who hasn't
lived down being part of the 49ers' decision to bypass Plummer for
Virginia Tech quarterback  &UR; Jim Druckenmiller. &QL; 
Changing his stripes
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lawrence Phillips' handlers want you to think he has changed.
They say he has found religion, quit drinking and become a
vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Dolphins, Phillips' last NFL team, want to know if he
still has that tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cartoon image of a time bomb, lit fuse and all.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, who appear to have won a bidding war with the Bills
for Phillips, had better hope he has changed. They have come under
severe criticism for trying to sign a player who struck a woman in
a Florida nightclub and dragged a former girlfriend down a flight a
stairs by her hair at Nebraska. &QL; 
Trial balloon
</P>
<P>
   Maybe NFL Commissioner  &UR; Paul  &UR; Tagliabue was just trying to gauge
public reaction when reports surfaced last week that he would
suspend troubled Cowboys defensive tackle  &UR; Leon Lett for just four
games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Lett already had served a one-year suspension for
substance-abuse violations before he was suspended indefinitely in
June for again violating the league's drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys think a four-game slap is fair punishment because
there is precedent. Former Cowboys defensive back  &UR; Clayton Holmes,
once suspended for a year, was banned for four games the next time
he tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about precedents. It's a joke the league is considering
allowing Lett back at all.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been suspended for a year and then are reinstated, and
you slip up again, you should be banned for life. The NFL doesn't
need Lett to become pro football's version of  &UR; Steve  &UR; Howe, who
kept getting chance after chance in baseball. &QL; 
Short shots
</P>
<P>
   Even before second-year quarterback  &UR; Ryan Leaf was lost for the
season with a shoulder injury, the Chargers had demoted him to
third team behind  &UR; Jim Harbaugh and Kramer, who signed with San
Diego after his release from the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Former Arizona State quarterback  &UR; Paul Justin turned down a
one-year, $400,000 offer from the Rams and remains out of the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Running back  &UR; Robert Holcombe, the Mesa High School product, has
been moved to fullback by the Rams and was listed first on the
depth chart as training camp opened. Holcombe, the Rams'
second-round pick a year ago, has increased his weight to 226
pounds but has never played fullback.

FISHING LOSES ALLURE DURING DARK OF NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   These dog days of summer make fishing during the middle of the
day almost impossible. It's hot, humid and no fish is worth the
pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   That's just as well. The fish don't bite that well during the
midday stretch. But who cares? Most of us aren't going out there
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   At most lakes, the majority of anglers look to early-morning or
early-evening fishing. Then there are those hardy souls who fish at
night. I try to avoid that like the plague. It's difficult to
navigate because of the darkness, and I always can hear monsters
tromping along the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so bad if you can anchor in one spot and catch white
bass or crappie under floating lights. The lights attract shad and
the shad game fish. You don't have to run around in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The most amusing night trip I ever had was with bass pro Larry
Mantle of Glendale and Gary Williams, who owns Tempe Marine in
Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   We were on Roosevelt Lake, and Mantle had no black lights so we
could see where we were going. We moved along the shoreline casting
to the bank. Williams and I suddenly began getting hung up on
almost every cast. It was a rocky shoreline but not that bad.
</P>
<P>
   We began complaining a bunch and demanded that Mantle turn on a
spotlight to see where we were. He did, and we learned that we were
only about 10 feet from the shoreline. Williams and I had been
casting into desert vegetation. No wonder we got hung up. &QL; 
Daybreak fishing good &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We attempted to humble Mantle with no success whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   But fishing isn't nearly so difficult at daybreak or in early
evening. There's a good top-water bite at most desert lakes. Bass
are herding shad and attacking them on the surface. This produces
excellent top-water fishing, which probably is the most exciting
kind.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Pleasant has been particularly good in early morning. But
you'd better get there early, because top-water fishing usually
ends by 8:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Top-water lures, soft jerkbaits and _ if there's a chop on the
water _ buzzbaits all seem to work. The Zara Puppy and Zara Spook
seem to be the hottest top-water lures now.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a way to catch fish in the afternoon without
collapsing from heat exhaustion. But it requires fishing on a Salt
River lake, where the dams are used for power generation.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, say 4 p.m. or earlier, people begin
arriving home from work. They crank up the air conditioning, do a
load of wash, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for power begins rising. Releases of water to power
the turbines increase. The current in the river below the dam
increases drastically. In the lake, the water temperature in the
lake may be in the 80s. Just below the dam, it may be in the low
70s _ a drastic temperature difference.
</P>
<P>
   Bass become more active in the cooler water. And being in the
colder water makes fishing more comfortable _ especially if there's
any breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Vander Kooi of Mesa, a bass pro, takes advantage of the
situation, usually at Saguaro Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the shad really vulnerable,'' he said. ``The current
pushes them around, and it gives bass a great opportunity.'' &QL; 
Outsmarting bass &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bass will chase shad into shallow areas where they can
attack or herd the shad into coves. Then they can lie in wait on
the outside edges of the cove. When the shad try to leave the cove,
they're dead meat, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Zara Spooks, Rat-L-Traps and shad-colored spinnerbaits are the
prime lures when bass begin boiling to the surface and chasing the
shad.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with a strong current like that, you need heavy line,''
Vander Kooi said. ``I use 20-pound-test line. I've been catching a
lot of five-pound and better bass.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, he quickly hooked a bass that appeared to be
about five pounds. Once the fish ran downstream, the rod and line
were really tested. In this case, the fish got off.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt River chain of lakes are pump-back lakes. During the
day, when power rates are expensive, the dams generate power. At
night, when the rates drop, water is pumped back into the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current then moves toward the dam rather than away,''
Vander Kooi said. ``Fishing can really be good in that current,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem with that for me. Navigating a river at
night through canyons and sometimes shallow water concerns me. I'll
stick to the daylight. &QL;

PEREZ TO BULLPEN, YOUNG TO BENCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Finally, enough is enough for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson sent Carlos Perez to the bullpen
and has decided to go with the duo of switch-hitter Jose Vizcaino
and left-handed hitting Craig Counsell at second base.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said part of the reason behind the Young move is the
32-year-old's health. Young has been bothered by ankle and
hamstring injuries for the last two months, which has affected his
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stay off him and see, maybe the first of next week,
how he's feeling,'' Johnson said. ``Your legs are everything....
I'll see how it feels. Maybe I'll use him in a more limited role
(once he returns) where he isn't pounding it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   When healthy, Young has been the Dodgers' starting second
baseman and leadoff hitter since being acquired in a trade from
Colorado on Aug. 18, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But last season he played in only 117 games because of injury
and this year bumps and bruises have cost games, particularly after
a torrid April in which Young hit .322 and stole 27 bases. But he
hit .209 in May with just nine stolen bases. His season average is
.263 and his on-base percentage is .350.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my legs are not healthy, then I'm not capable of doing what
I can do,'' Young said. ``Compare when I was healthy through the
first month to how I've been since.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez was pulled from the rotation after giving up a career-high
10 runs in Friday's loss. It dropped Perez to 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked what he was working on with (pitching coach Claude)
Osteen, but he's got to be able to bring it to the game,'' Johnson
said. ``I can't keep going through that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who signed a three-year, $15.5 million contract in the
offseason, will try to work out his problems in the bullpen. ``I've
never had this kind of year, in the minor leagues or the major
leagues,'' Perez, 27, said. ``I've never had this kind of ERA, I've
never had this kind of record. I'm not the only one to pitch bad,
but there's nothing I can do. It's not my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he's not sure who will start in Perez's place
Wednesday against Cincinnati. The options are relievers Jamie
Arnold and Onan Masaoka or a trio of minor-leaguers: Triple-A
Albuquerque's Mike Judd (8-6, 6.73) or Robinson Checo (3-6, 4.36)
or Double-A San Antonio's Eric Gagne (10-3, 2.73). Johnson said the
decision will be made today and will hinge on whether management
decides to give Arnold, who gave up seven runs in a Thursday start,
another chance. Judd and Gagne each pitched July 20 and Checo, who
arrived in the Dave Mlicki deal, last pitched July 10 before
attending the birth of his child.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's moment: Johnson and general manager Kevin Malone both
said they were unaware of Raul Mondesi's decision to spend the top
of the fifth inning of Friday's 10-1 loss in the Dodgers bullpen
instead of on the bench until after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wasn't very concerned, but Malone was unquestionably
upset with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me tremendously,'' Malone said. ``He's a position
player. A position player is on the bench when the offense is
batting. Maybe there was something going on. It bothers me that he
wasn't where he was supposed to be. Until I hear something that
makes sense, sure I'm disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Davey's going to talk to him, say `What are you
thinking?' Maybe it's just an oversight. We'll take care of it. I
don't think it'll ever happen again. Maybe there's a valid
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he would talk to Mondesi before the game, but
disciplinary action seems unlikely. Mondesi said he can't figure
out what all the fuss is about. He said it's not the first time
he's done it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it in San Diego, (Colorado's) Larry Walker does it a
lot,'' Mondesi said. ``Why do people want to make a big deal of it?
Because we are losing? I was there because I was the (second out)
last inning. What's the problem with that?''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Catcher Todd Hundley returned from his three-game
suspension and batted eighth.... The revamped top of the order had
Mark Grudzielanek batting first and Jose Vizcaino hitting second.

DODGERS LOSE FIFTH STRAIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Dodgers brass is supposed to wait until late next
week to decide whether to retool for next season or add a player to
make a playoff push.
</P>
<P>
   But before Saturday's game, general manager Kevin Malone
questioned whether some of the Dodgers wanted impressive stats more
than they wanted to win.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers might have proved his point with another lackluster,
downtrodden effort.
</P>
<P>
   With the rest of the NL West losing and the opportunity to show
some type of pulse, the Dodgers were shut down again by Arizona
pitching and lost 3-0 Saturday at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   A day after scoring one run on two hits, the Dodgers managed
five hits in eight innings against Arizona's Brian Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Not even changes in the lineup and a reshuffling of the pitching
staff could save the last-place Dodgers (43-54) from their fifth
straight loss. The second-year Arizona Diamondbacks (54-45) moved
into first place ahead of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In today's series finale, the Dodgers face the globe's best
pitcher in Randy Johnson, whose 6-foot-10 frame intimidates
opponents before he even whizzes his 100 mph fastball toward the
plate. Tonight's game will conclude a stretch of six straight games
against left-handers. The Dodgers have lost the first five.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson (3-2) came in with a 7.03 ERA and was brought into the
rotation when Todd Stottlemyre went down with an injury earlier in
the season. Things got so bad for Anderson that opponents were
hitting .339 against him and his place in the rotation was in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   In his last two starts, Anderson allowed 18 hits and 11 runs and
lasted 91/3 innings. Against the Dodgers, he tied a career high
with eight strikeouts and didn't allow a runner past second base
after the first inning. The Dodgers had one hit after the fourth
inning off him and didn't walk.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona closer Matt Mantei allowed a Gary Sheffield single and
walked Eric Karros to lead off the ninth, but he struck out Devon
White, Raul Mondesi and Adrian Beltre for his fifth save since
being traded to the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, manager Davey Johnson announced lefty Carlos
Perez was being dropped from the rotation for a pitcher to be
determined and that Eric Young was taking a hiatus from his
second-base position to rest his ailing legs. It would also give
the Dodgers improved defense, which showed itself in the fifth
inning, but by then the Dodgers trailed 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Dreifort (8-9) allowed three runs on six hits in six
innings. He walked three and struck out six, but his undoing was
the long ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks took a 2-0 lead in the fourth inning when Chuck
Finley hit a two-run homer with one out. Finley's line drive over
the right-field wall was his 19th of the season. Two batters later
Bernard Gilkey made it 3-0 with a long, towering homer to left
field. Dreifort's allowed 14 homers, which is still low among
starters.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers could have fallen behind by more in the fifth if not
for a very good stop by Young's replacement, Jose Vizcaino. Johnson
said Vizcaino and Craig Counsell would platoon at second, with
Vizcaino starting against left-handers, and it paid off
defensively.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and two on, Vizcaino made a sliding stop behind
second and flipped to shortstop Mark Grudzielanek for a fielder's
choice. Matt Williams then grounded back to Dreifort, who threw to
second to begin an inning-ending double play.

DODGERS HIT HARD ON EVERY FRONT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ One thing never to be questioned is Kevin Malone's
will to win, but the Dodgers general manager is wondering if all 25
players share his passion.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers gave another listless effort against an also-ran
pitcher and lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks 3-0 Saturday night at
Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   But before the Dodgers lost for the fifth straight time, Malone
said he thought some of the players thought about themselves more
than the team and cared about personal statistics more than wins.
He also criticized Raul Mondesi for spending the top of the fifth
of Friday's loss in the Dodgers bullpen instead of the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   With that as a backdrop, the Dodgers managed five hits in eight
innings against Cy Young impersonator-of-the-day Brian Anderson. It
came after the Dodgers scored one run on two hits in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is easily as tough as ballclub I've been on,'' Dodgers
first baseman Eric Karros said, ``and I think most guys in here
would tell you the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks took their 3-0 lead in the fourth inning when
Steve Finley hit a two-run homer off Darren Dreifort (8-9) and
Bernard Gilkey added a solo shot. That's all Anderson needed.
</P>
<P>
   Not even changes in the starting lineup and a reshuffling of the
pitching staff could spark the last-place Dodgers (43-54). In
another barb into how disgusting of a turn things have taken, the
second-year Arizona Diamondbacks (54-45) moved into first place
ahead San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And to think, the Dodgers face the globe's best pitcher in Randy
Johnson today in the series finale, which doesn't bode well on a
few fronts. About the only good news is the Dodgers pitch Kevin
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   First, it's Johnson, whose 6-foot-10 frame intimidates opponents
before he even whizzes his 100-mph fastball toward the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Johnson's a lefty, which will conclude a stretch of six
straight games against left-handers. The Dodgers have lost the
first five.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson (3-2) came in with a 7.03 ERA and was brought into the
rotation when Todd Stottlemyre went down with an injury earlier in
the season. Things were so bad for Anderson that opponents were
hitting .339 against him and his place in the rotation was in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   In his last two starts, Anderson allowed 18 hits and 11 runs and
lasted 91/3 innings. Against the Dodgers, he tied a career high
with eight strikeouts and didn't allow a runner past second base
after the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all in a tough situation right now and everyone's trying
to find reasons as to where we're at,'' Karros said. ``We're where
were at because we haven't played good baseball. Everyone wants to
say is it the pitching, is it the hitting, is it the chemistry, is
it the (lack of a) left-handed batter? It's a collective effort of
bad baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing seems to be able to spark the Dodgers these days.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, manager Davey Johnson announced lefty Carlos
Perez was being dropped from the rotation for a pitcher to be
determined and that Eric Young was taking a hiatus from his
second-base position to rest his ailing legs. Jose Vizcaino and
Craig Counsell will platoon at second base, but the Dodgers'
situation is far from what Counsell thought when he arrived in L.A.
via a trade with Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we would be right in the thick of things, but it's
just not going that way and I don't think anyone knows why,''
Counsell said. ``I don't think this situation is comparable to
(Florida). No one can argue that we don't have the talent to win
here. We have expectations here. That's what is different about
here and Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort allowed three runs on six hits in six innings. He
walked three and struck out six, but his undoing was the long ball.

A FAVORED SON'S TEARS FLOOD CITY WITH PRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POSNANSKI  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Everyone had come to see George Brett cry.
It was Brettstock Sunday in Cooperstown, a festival of George, an
open field crowded with Royals caps and powder blue jerseys and
Brett streamers and Gates T-shirts and Buck O'Neil. The weather was
Midwestern humid. The sun burned. It was a beautiful day to see
George Brett cry.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, we knew he would cry. We all knew. This is a love affair,
this crazy connection between Kansas City and George Brett. He
knows Kansas City, its rhythms, its quirks, its wonders, its
insecurities. ``It's the place where I met my wife and our three
children were born,'' he would say on Sunday. ``And to this day I'm
so proud to call Kansas City home.''
</P>
<P>
   And, just as surely, everyone in Kansas City knows him. Seven
persons were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on Sunday, and
each one had his own splendid history, his own fans, his own
family, his own cheering section.
</P>
<P>
   Only George Brett heard an entire city cheering, though. Kansas
City people wandered everywhere in Cooperstown through the weekend,
a barrage of friendly folks wandering the city streets,
window-shopping, asking in those wonderful Missouri flat tones,
``OK, how much for the Baseball Beanie Baby?''
</P>
<P>
   It was eerie. Going to Cooperstown always feels a bit like going
back in time anyway. The houses are quaint, the soda shop packed,
the traffic dull; this place is a ``Happy Days'' rerun. This
weekend, though, there were all these Royals fans wandering about,
wearing old George Brett jerseys, talking about Goose Gossage and
the World Series and such things, and it felt like 1980 in Kansas
City, that hot summer when Royals Stadium overflowed, and the
Royals went to the World Series, and Brett hit like no baseball
player had for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all the Royals fans,'' Jamie Quirk, Brett's old
teammate and best friend, said Sunday. ``It's unbelievable. It's
like going back in a time machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett had to wait two and a half hours before giving his speech.
He had dreaded giving the speech anyway, but the wait was almost
more than he could handle. The sweaty afternoon had been filled
with rich moments and bizarre ones. Robin Yount spoke sweetly about
living in a dream. Texas Gov. George W. Bush twice was asked to
stand up and take a bow. Nolan Ryan's speech sounded like a laundry
list of ``thank-yous.'' Orlando Cepeda spoke tenderly about Puerto
Rico. A man dressed in an old-time baseball uniform performed
``Casey at the Bat,'' with a little too much gusto.
</P>
<P>
   And all along, Brett fidgeted, he crossed and uncrossed his
legs, he fanned himself, he whispered to the person next to him.
``It was unbearable up there,'' he would say, and in the open
field, far from the stage, thousands of Kansas City fans baked in
the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Then, finally, George Brett walked to the lectern. And everybody
stood. And everybody cheered wildly. George Brett looked relieved.
None of the other inductees had cried. He started to speak.
</P>
<P>
   And right away, you could see it was different. You could hear
it was different. The others had spoken prepared words, they said
things they had practiced over and over a hundred times. Brett
spoke fresh words. He spoke heartfelt words. He talked about how he
despised the New York Yankees and how his old manager Whitey Herzog
made him eat at least one home-cooked meal a summer. He talked
about how Charley Lau made him a great hitter.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about friends and loved ones and the players he faced
and the teammates he admired and, oh yeah, three minutes into the
thing you knew it was only a matter of time before he broke up.
</P>
<P>
   He did. He looked at Jamie Quirk. Their eyes did not meet,
because Quirk was wearing sunglasses _ ``I didn't want him to see
me crying,'' Quirk would say _ but it did not matter. Brett had to
stop. He had to cry. A moment later, he talked about his brothers,
looked at all three of them _ John, Ken, Bobby _ and that sent him
sobbing. He heaved and pushed through the rest of the speech, warm
words about his mother and father and the town he adores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of you made this trip, and I really appreciate that,'' he
said. ``I know Cooperstown is a long way from Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Not too far.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, George Brett was exhausted. He stopped. The speech was
not exactly over. He left four cards of his speech up there on the
lectern. But he could not go on. The Kansas City people roared, and
Brett waved, and they waved back, and he waved again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' Brett would say as he wandered off. ``It's time
to party.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime later, a huge rain dumped on Cooperstown, and people in
Kansas City hats and Royals shirts gathered under awnings and
ducked into stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how it rains in Kansas City,'' one of them said, and
he held out his hand to feel it pour down. ``Yep, exactly like
Kansas City.''

   PULITZER-PRODUCER-PROFILE (New York) _ A lot of theater
producers say they gravitate to revivals because it is hard to find
good new plays these days. If Daryl Roth is any measure, that
simply is not true. This past season Ms. Roth produced her third
Pulitzer Prize-winning play in five years, ``Wit,'' by Margaret
Edson, following Paula Vogel's ``How I Learned to Drive,'' which
won last year, and Edward Albee's ``Three Tall Women,'' in 1994.
``My criteria is to do things that instinctively say something to
me,'' Ms. Roth said over lunch recently. By Robin Pogrebin.

beginning of Aix-en-Provence's annual opera festival last year,
Stephane Lissner, the festival's ever ambitious director set out to
position this medieval city alongside Salzburg and Bayreuth as a
summer must for European opera lovers. This year, by expanding the
festival to include an 18th-century chateau set among woods and
fields six miles from Aix, he seems to have

accomplished composers and three somewhat more famous playwrights.
The project was jointly commissioned by Glimmerglass, the New York

 VOTERS PUSH POWER TOWARD VENEZUELA'S LEADER  (lb)

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ In a vote that President Hugo Chavez called
``the most important of the past 100 years'' for Venezuela, his
followers have won an overwhelming majority of seats in a national
Assembly that will write the new constitution he says he needs to
carry out a sweeping ``social revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than four-fifths of the vote counted Sunday night,
candidates from Chavez's populist Patriotic Pole coalition had won
three-quarters of the seats for which official results were
available.
</P>
<P>
   In a victory speech from the balcony of the presidential palace
on Sunday night, a jubilant Chavez predicted that the final count
would end up giving his alliance more than 120 of the 131 seats
that were at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victory of the patriots has been pulverizing,'' he said,
with his wife, Marisabel _ who was one of the most successful of
the candidates _ at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a home run with the bases loaded,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The results promise immediately to usher in a period of conflict
and uncertainty for Venezuela, which has become the largest source
of imported oil for the United States in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Since being sworn into office in February, Chavez, a former army
colonel who led a failed coup attempt in 1992, has repeatedly
maintained that the constituent Assembly will have the power to
dissolve Congress and courts and should do so, a position he
mentioned again Sunday night in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has already ruled that Chavez's argument is
legally faulty. But in a speech delivered Saturday night to
commemorate the 216th anniversary of the birth of Simon Bolivar,
the founding father of this South American nation of 23 million
people, Chavez reiterated his position, saying that the Assembly
will have absolute authority during the six months of its
existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to be very clear, because this is a process with no
turning back,'' he said emphatically. ``Neither the president nor
Congress nor the Supreme Court, which are the maximum
representatives of the constituted powers, can contrive to place
themselves above, or put into a subordinate position, a sovereign
elected Assembly.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, though, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Cecilia
Sosa Gomez, once again rejected the president's interpretation.
While stressing to the reporters who crowded around her as she
waited to cast her vote that ``we do not want to get into a debate
of a political nature,'' she said that, ``The court has already
given answers to all pending questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly's responsibility, she said, is to draw up a new
constitution, not to supplant existing institutions or to govern
the country. Until the new charter has been written and approved by
voters, she added, ``the Supreme Court will carry out its duties in
accordance with the constitution of 1961.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said he intends to place his own job as president ``at
the disposition of this most sovereign Assembly'' and will resign
if that is what the 131-member assembly wants. The offer is purely
symbolic, since the Assembly will be dominated by his own
followers, but it will increase the pressure on the other two
branches of government not to challenge the deliberations of the
Assembly, scheduled to begin work early next month.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a presidential candidate last year, Chavez made a new
constitution the focal point of his campaign, saying he needed it
to end corruption and assure social justice for the poor. Other
changes he has said he wants would give him the right to succeed
himself in office and would vastly expand his power at the expense
of the legislative and judiciary branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   The constituent Assembly vote, the fourth election in less than
a year here, has dominated news coverage for weeks, with many of
the more than 1,000 candidates organizing forums to discuss the
issues and distributing posters, T-shirts and baseball caps
emblazoned with their images.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intense coverage and generally favorable weather,
though, it is estimated that fewer than half of the 11 million
eligible voters cast ballots Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the political climate here is increasingly polarized,
Sunday's vote took place without incident. An observer mission from
the Organization of American States reported no irregularities of
any significance. And the minister of the interior, Ignacio Luis
Arcaya, described the elections as being accompanied by an
atmosphere of ``tranquillity and happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I cast all of my votes for the Chavez slate, which is the only
one that I trust to fight for the change we need so badly in this
country,'' Darwin Gomez Uribe, an unemployed mechanic, said as he
emerged from a polling place here. ``I want the president to have a
free hand to throw out the old system and replace it with one that
will create jobs and end this dictatorship of corrupt political
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   In his final speech before voting began, Chavez sought to frame
the choice facing Venezuelans in the starkest terms possible. ``You
are either with God or the devil,'' he said. ``There are only two
positions here in Venezuela: those of us who want profound
transformation and those who refuse to lose their privileges.''
</P>
<P>
   Some voters, however, said they found the president's pugnacious
tone troublesome. Chavez's opponents say that he wants to replace
an imperfect democracy with a one-man dictatorship, and they
contend that the Assembly is the country's last chance to avoid
authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that the country needs to be transformed, but I do not
like the way the president is trying to do it,'' said Gloria
Mercado Chacon, a bookkeeper, as she waited in line to cast her
ballot for a mixture of pro- and anti-Chavez candidates Sunday
morning. ``Our new system must be built on the basis of concord and
cooperation, not confrontation and conflict.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the grand aspects of the Merce Cunningham
Dance Company's performances at Lincoln Center Festival '99 has
been a focus on Cunningham's collaboration with major contemporary
painters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pond Way,'' a stunningly beautiful piece that had its New York
premiere on Friday night at the New York State Theater, uses a
backdrop based on ``Landscape With Boat,'' a 1996 painting by Roy
Lichtenstein. Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, who both served
as the company's artistic advisers, have also been represented in
the festival's tribute, which ended Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   To remember the pop-art label originally affixed to these three
painters is to help define them, but it does not necessarily
explain how their aesthetics translate in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pond Way,'' which had its premiere in Paris last year, is not
a strict collaboration: Lichtenstein died after he had agreed to
work with Cunningham, and Dorothy Lichtenstein, the painter's
widow, allowed Cunningham to select an existing painting.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the process, ``Pond Way'' is one of Cunningham's most
inventively poetic works: The kinetic and the painterly fuse into
images of unabashed visual impact. The watery atmosphere, evoked in
both the backdrop and Brian Eno's mellow sounds in his ``New
Ikebukuro,'' a score played on three compact discs, suggest
strongly that this is one of Cunningham's nature pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the curtain goes up and the 13 dancers are seen already
moving in billowing harem-style outfits by Suzanne Gallo, they
could just as well bring to mind a romp in a seraglio.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham invites the viewer to appreciate the choreography for
its own sake, and he does not burden us with hidden meaning. Yet
there is always the feeling of an organizing principle at the core
of each dance. To seek it in a title is a risk, but a pond is full
of activity, and so is ``Pond Way.'' The diamond-shaped jumps of
the dancers can recall the spring of frog leaps and the occasional
stillness of the performers can be likened to that of lilies in a
pond.
</P>
<P>
   But literalism has its dangers in any Cunningham piece, and the
Lichtenstein painting is more obvious about the pitfalls of
interpretation. Black dots of different sizes cover an expanse that
shades into an abstraction of what could be a coastline. (A French
critic saw the mass as an oil spill.)
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, water and sky are elemental here. The painting
becomes a tribute, several generations removed, not so much to the
French impressionists but to one of their own inspirations: the
Japanese print. The print style is echoed in the lower left-hand
corner of ``Landscape With Boat'' by the image of a small Japanese
boatman in his craft.
</P>
<P>
   The orientalisms in Ms. Gallo's beautiful white costumes are of
another order. Their Persian look is modernized by the open seams
on the billowing pants and sleeves that expose leg, arm and
movement. David Covey's lighting is outstanding, bathing the white
forms in a a golden glow.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gull-like sounds and buoys evoked by the gongs and
bells of Eno's meditative music, ``Pond Way'' is too lively to be
called serene. Lisa Boudreau, Thomas Caley, Holley Farmer, Maydelle
Fason, Jean Freebury, Matthew Mohr, Banu Ogan, Glen Rumsey, Daniel
Squire, Jeannie Steele, Derry Swan, Robert Swinston and Cheryl
Therrien are lively from the start, facing different directions
while doing the same movement at different times.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography is full of stretched limbs, but also occasional
hiccups of the torso and jumps with knee raised. Among dancers come
to rest, some arched on the floor, Caley, noticeable this season
for his breathtaking clarity, has a brief solo that leads into the
diamond jump, later picked up by the others.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble's return suggests encounters: Ms. Ogan,
eye-catching in her projection, is pursued by men who touch her
foot and there is an admirable intensity to Squire's dancing.
</P>
<P>
   There is an atmospheric coherence to the piece but combinations
of movement can startle (fists to the chest in a jete). The
changing space is symbolic with the center cleared of dancers, who
stand on the periphery at one point. After the last dancer has
leaped into the wings, ``Pond Way'' has cleared the mind and the
eye.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The program, the second in the company's run, included
Cunningham's 1959 ``Rune,'' last given in 1995 with earth-tone
costumes by Mark Lancaster, another former artistic adviser to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The changing spatial design makes for an exercise in perception.
But for all its purity and final quickening with activity at
different stage areas, the movement here looked academically
presented. Floor work from mainstream modern dance and the use of
ballet line were uneasily combined.
</P>
<P>
   Caley, Ms. Farmer, Ms. Fason. Ms. Ogan, Rumsey and Ms. Steele
cannot be faulted for their precise performance. One can only
recall that earlier Cunningham dancers had idiosyncrasies that
would have contributed to the dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Wolff's score ``Or Four People,'' with its mix of the
occasional foghorn and the occasional violin, was played by Stuart
Dempster, Takehisa Kosugi, Jim O'Rourke and Wolff.
</P>
<P>
   The evening included a repeat of ``Occasion Piece'' with
Cunningham and Mikhail Baryshnikov as guest, and a vibrant
performance of ``Ground Level Overlay,'' with its resonant
recordings of Dempster's score for trombones in a former water
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo Drew's set might or might not suggest hanging
carcasses, but the dancing, experimenting with acceleration, ends
with an exuberant waltz for wiggling couples.
