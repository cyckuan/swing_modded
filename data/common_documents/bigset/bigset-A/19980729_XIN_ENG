<HEADLINE> Pakistan Apex Court Restores Fundamental rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 28 (Xinhua)--The Supreme Court of Pakistan
Tuesday revived the fundamental rights suspended by the
government, but upheld the presidential proclamation of emergency
imposed after the May 28 nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice ajmal Mian said in a short order that the court
unanimously declared presidential order of May 29 and July 13
suspending the fundamental rights as ultravires and without lawful
 authority.
</P>
<P>
The Apex court, however, upheld imposition of emergency by the
President, Rafiq Tarar, under the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The challenge to the imposition of emergency has come from
petitioners like former president Farooq Leghari, former chief
minister of Punjab province Manzoor Watto.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme court said that in view of the material provided to
 the court, it is evident that the presidential proclamation to
impose emergency in the country was under the law and constitution
of Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> EU Fishing Catch in NW Atlantic Drops Drastically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's fishing
catch in the northwest Atlantic has fallen to 2.5 percent of their
1968 peak, Eurostat reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of European communities
said that the EU catch of Atlantic cod decreased to 2,000 tons in
1996 from 1.03 million tons in 1968.
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic cod, once over 80 percent of the EU catch, has
dwindled to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The northwest Atlantic Ocean has been the traditional hunting
ground for Europe's distant water fishing fleets.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat attributed the sharp decrease in the EU catch in the
northwest Atlantic to the generally poor state of fish stocks, the
closure of the extended economic zones of coastal states to EU
vessels after 1977, and the recent greatly-reduced catch quota
allocations.
</P>
<P>
The EU northwest Atlantic catch rose rapidly from 374,000 tons
in 1950 to 1.24 million tons in 1968.
</P>
<P>
From 1950 to 1968, the countries now forming the European Union
netted about a third of the world catch of the northwest Atlantic
fish. They now catch a mere 3 percent of the world total.
</P>
<P>
Major species caught in the northwest Atlantic now are the
Greenland halibut that accounts for 35 percent of the catch while
skates and rays account for 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Spain is the major EU fishing country with 65 percent of the EU
total, while Portugal is next.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Yangtze Flood Becomes National Concern (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The embankments and dikes that
protect a third of China's 1.2 billion people from floods on the
Yangtze River have become a battle zone, where tens of thousands
of civilians and soldiers are fighting day and night against the
worst flooding since 1954.
</P>
<P>
A third flood crest is passing the city of Wuhan in Hubei
Province today, and water levels on the lower reaches after Hankou
are still rising at alarming rates.
</P>
<P>
Although flood-control efforts have been successful so far,
local governments need to remain on high alert for several more
days, warns Guo Zhizhen, of the Water Resources Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Central Meteorology Station reports that the Chinese will
not be able to rest for at least another week. Although rainfall
along the Yangtze will ease up in the next few days and the
possibility of storms is gone, heavy rains may still be expected
in some areas before August 2, according to Tang Huifang, deputy
director of the Central Meteorology Station.
</P>
<P>
Even light rains can not be ignored since the Yangtze is
already seriously flooded, Tang says, pointing out that
unpredicatable climate changes could take place along the Yangtze
so they will continue to monitor the changes.

<TEXT>
<P>
The flooding has caused concern in the central government, and
President Jiang Zemin has ordered areas along the Yangtze to
fortify dikes and drain off water that has leaked through
dikes. Premier Zhu Rongji visited flooded parts of Jiangxi, Hubei
and Hunan provinces in early July.
</P>
<P>
Large amounts of materials and funds have been appropriated for
emergency relief work and millions of officials and police and
tens of millions of local people have been mobilized to defend
against the swollen waters of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation people say that the flood control work has
gone well this year because of water conservation efforts of the
past forty years, which can be seen from the relatively low death
toll by June 26. Floods claimed the lives of 2,500, but that is
compared with the 34,600 during the 1954 flooding.
</P>
<P>
The floods this year have been very serious, with all of the
Yangtze River Valley reporting torrential rainfall and Dongting
Lake and Boyang Lake on the middle reaches could hardly hold any
more water from the upper reaches, according to Hou Yingjie, head
of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the build-up of sediment in the river bed had
helped raised the water level, but dikes have remained basically
sound in spite of high water levels.
</P>
<P>
But, flood-control experts still say that dikes are still in
serious danger and need to be closely watched, and widespread
termite damage needs to be repaired to avoid potential dangers of
any kind.

WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Explosions shook a generating
plant in Hammond, Indiana, Tuesday morning, setting off a big
fireball and injuring at least four people.
</P>

Witnesses said they heard two large explosions just before 8

Thick, black smoke and flames billowed from the plant nearly an
hour later, news reports said.

Fire Inspector Jim Walsko of the Hammond Fire Department said
there were outside cleaning contractors at the plant when the
explosion happened. The cause of the blast was not immediately
known.

There were several reports of short power surges in Chicago
about the time of the explosion.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Black Body Opposes Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- the Affirmative Action Group
(AAG) Tuesday said mass job stayaways as organized by the
Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Union (ZCTU) will only worsen the
country's current economic problems.
</P>
<P>
in a statement, the AAG, Zimbabwe's black economic empowerment
lobby, said it supported the idea of constant dialog between the
ZCTU leadership and the government as it is opposed to mass job
stayaways which would worsen the economic problems facing the
country.
</P>
<P>
''Stayaways are counter-productive because business grinds to
a halt, property is destroyed and there is looting. Tourism,
which is the country's number two sector in terms of foreign
currency earnings, suffers and this discourages further
investment as investors become concerned about the security of
their investment,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
It said the environment was conducive to continued dialog
between the ZCTU and the government since the latter had shown
its commitment to resolving the plight of the workers.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU last week said it would request for another meeting
with President Robert Mugabe before a decision is made on whether
or not to call a second mass job stayaway over the government's
failure to immediately scrap the 2.5 percent increase in sales
tax imposed last December, one of the key ZCTU demands.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU organized a mass national strike in January, this
year which crippled the country's economy, resulting in the loss
of business worth over million Dollars in two days.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Greece has urged Yugoslavia to
begin immediately political talks with ethnic Albanians to find a
peaceful solution to the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
In a letter by Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday, Greece stressed the need
of bringing an end to hostilities in Kosovo, saying that military
forces must be withdrawn, observers sent to Kosovo and political
talks begun immediately, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Simitis' letter is seen as a follow-up to an initiative
launched during a recent visit to Albania by Greek Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos.
</P>
<P>
During Pangalos' visit, Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo
asked Pangalos to use Greece's influence in Yugoslavia to help
find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crises. Pangalos promised
to do that and also met with Kosovo Albanian representatives in
Tirana.
</P>
<P>
In Kosovo, ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of its nearly 2
million population and are fighting for independence. Greece,
which has maintained good relations with Belgrade because of their
common Orthodox traditions, has insisted that political dialogue
is the only way to solve the Kosovo issue.

<HEADLINE> EU, IMF Praise Egypt's Economic Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday praised Egypt for its
marked progress in fulfilling economic stabilization and carrying
out an integrated reform program.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission in Cairo, in a report highlighting Egypt's
strong financial situation, noted that Egypt's trade deficit has
dropped to 0.9 percent of the gross domestic product in the
1997-1998 fiscal year from 1.3 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's inflation rate remained at 4 percent until last November,
and the second phase of the tariff reform program has been launched
since July 1997, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started to implement an economic and social structural
reform program in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IMF office in Cairo issued a report on Egyptian
economy, hailing the success that Egypt has achieved in reducing
its inflation rate from an annual average of more than 20 percent
during the 1986-1992 period to only 6 percent in the 1996-1997
period.
</P>
<P>
This achievement shows "Egypt is approaching industrial country
rates," said the report, titled "Egypt, beyond stabilization,
toward a dynamic market economy."
</P>
<P>
It attributed the success of disinflation to the "bold
stabilization program undertaken by the Egyptian authorities" and
the improved fiscal state which has alleviated the pressure on
domestic liquidity growth.
</P>
<P>
"Looking ahead, both the ongoing trade liberalization and the
structural reforms should increase competition, thus reducing
pressure on prices from monopolistic practices," the report
added.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that this structural element was bound to
further contribute to disinflation.
</P>
<P>
"The benefit will be the achievement of price stability, which
could possibly induce further domestic and foreign investment in
the medium term and added credibility to monetary policy," the
IMF report said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World Bank Helps China Modernize Taxation System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank's technical
assistance for the Chinese Ministry of Finance (MOF) are being
implemented, with a contract signed today between the MOF and a
foreign accounting firm, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (DTT), to help
analyze China's taxation policies.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the contract, DTT will assign a team of
experts to analyze China's taxation policies. The analysis
consists of 10 parts and will last for two years.
</P>
<P>
The 10 parts include enterprise survey and system development,
household budget survey, value added tax, individual income tax,
social security tax, local tax, tax policy management,
environmental and resource tax, estimation of tax capacity and
enterprise income tax.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from the MOF said that the aims of the tax
policy program are to conduct feasibility studies for new
categories of tax and put forward a theoretical framework for a
future Chinese tax system drawing upon international experience.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of MOF Lou Jiwei said that the tax policy
analysis project is one of the important projects for China's
fiscal and taxation reform. The implementation of this project
will play a very important role in enhancing the level of tax
policy management of the MOF and its capability in revenue
forecasting.
</P>
<P>
"It can also improve the MOF's effectiveness in increasing
revenue by means of tax leverage, which in turn will strengthen
the abilities of the MOF in controlling and adjusting the
macro-economy of China," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the project's goal is to establish modern
international tax policy management practices which are suitable
for the Chinese market economy.
</P>
<P>
DTT is working closely with the MOF on several other important
projects. Since the early 1990s it has been assisting the MOF in
setting Chinese accounting standards and providing training for
the accounting profession.

<HEADLINE> Malawi Minister Calls for Management of Coastal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- African states have agreed to
improve and intensify cooperation among them in the
implementation of sustainable coastal management measures, a
minister said in Lilongwe, a report reaching here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Malawi's Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and Environmental
Affairs Mayinga Mkandawire said this to MANA on his return from
Maputo, Mozambique after attending a three-day Pan-African
Conference on Sustainable Integrated Coastal Management which
ended Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said coastal areas contain valuable ecosystems which could
contribute immensely to livelihood of coastal communities and
economies of the countries, hence the need to manage them
properly.
</P>
<P>
"But coastal areas are under constant threat of degradation
because of increases demographic pressure which has an
accelerated pollution, over fishing and erosion," he was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Malawi is a landlocked country, but it was involved in the
management of the coastal areas because, for instance, the Shire
river Joins the Zambezi in draining into the sea via Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"In this vein Malawi should control the water hyacinth in the
Shire river if it can best control it from spilling over into the
neighbors' rivers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, participants of the conference agreed to
strengthen the building capacities for sustainable integrated
coastal management at regional and national levels and step up
the collection and dissemination of relevant scientific
information for effective management of coastal areas.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Romania Urge Multinational Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Romania agreed here
Tuesday that a multinational peacekeeping force should be
established in the Balkans to protect security and stability in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached the agreement during the talks between
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and his Romanian counterpart
Emil Constantinescu, who arrived here Tuesday for an one-day
working visit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the joint press conference with Constantinescu,
Demirel said that defense ministers of the related countries in
the Balkans will meet in Skopje of Yugoslavia in the coming months
to discuss where the multinational peacekeeping force will be
deployed.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the proposed multinational peacekeeping force
in the Balkans had "no relation with the Kosovo issue".
</P>
<P>
For his part, Constantinescu said Romania "shared the same
point of view for the establishment of the multinational
peacekeeping force in the Balkans."
</P>
<P>
The idea for establishing a multinational peacekeeping force
was first proposed by Albania in October 1996 and was officially
introduced at the defense ministerial meeting of the southeastern
European countries in Sofia, capital of Bulgaria, in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu said that he and Demirel also exchanged views
on the conflict in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, where fighting
has erupted since February between the Serbian forces and ethnic
Albanians who demand independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Demirel sent letters to the Contact Group countries
and some Balkan nations to express deep concern over the Kosovo
crisis, which he described as "a serious threat to the stability
and security in southeastern Europe".
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to take urgent measures
to stop the bloodshed in the Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey was ready to take part in any initiative to solve
the problem, including a multinational peace force," Demirel
added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Talks Resume, Expectation Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators met Tuesday afternoon to continue their talks aimed at
reaching agreement over an American proposal on a 13 percent
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, Israeli Television reported.
</P>
<P>
Channel One TV said the negotiation teams were expected to
focus on a new Israeli proposal that Israel yield 10 percent and
make the other 3 percent - part of the Judean Desert near the Dead
Sea - a "nature reserve" under joint Israel-Palestinian security
control.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources, cited by Israel Radio, said Palestinians
might give answers at the talks to the Israeli proposal, which
also included Israel's suggestions on the revision of the
Palestinian Charter that calls for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was reportedly offered by Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai during a private meeting with
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Deputy Chairman Mahmoud Abbas
(Abu Mazen) last Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai told Abu Mazen that Israel would agree that the
envisioned nature reserve be contiguous land located in the
Judean Desert, and the Palestinian police would be in charge of
public order there, sources close to the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai also said there would be not much difficulty reaching
agreement on the issue of the Palestinian Charter. Israel has
demanded that the Palestinian National Council convene to
reaffirm the deletion of the anti-Israeli articles.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian officials had described the new Israeli
proposal as "unacceptable." Following a meeting of Palestinian
leaders in Gaza late Sunday night, they decided not to resume the
talks Monday as reportedly agreed upon by Mordechai and Abu Mazen.
</P>
<P>
But after a meeting between Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani and Abu Mazen Monday night in Jerusalem, which
mainly dealt with what was called "daily affairs" rather than the
redeployment, the two sides agreed to renew committee talks.
</P>
<P>
Observers, however, said that there would be little hope of a
breakthrough in the coming days. That PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat
is on a visit to Austria, France and Morocco this week is part of
the reason, they said.

<HEADLINE> Angola Mourns Victims in Bula Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Angola went into a one-day
national mourning at zero hour Tuesday for the victims killed in
the July 21 massacre at Bula in northeastern Lunda Norte
Province.
</P>
<P>
Flags were flown at half mast in the sites of local
governments across this southern African country, mourning for
those killed in the small town.
</P>
<P>
Some political parties condemned the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) for its military action against
the innocent citizens, demanding that the legitimacy of UNITA as
a lawful party should be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
On the evening of July 21, the armed fighters of the UNITA
reportedly shot at the defenseless citizens shopping in the
market at Bula, but UNITA denied involving in the matter.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Daily newspaper reported Tuesday that according to
the latest figure released by the Angolan government, the death
toll topped 250.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Defense Minister Pedro Sebastiao said in Luanda
Tuesday that the time has actually come for the Angolan armed
forces to take action.
</P>
<P>
He said the military is closely watching the movement and
operation of the UNITA troops around the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the defense minister said the Angolan government has
put solution through dialog before military action, although it
believes that immediate action should be taken if the dialog
fails to resolve the conflict.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that one military leader of the UNITA had been
caught by the Angolan national police when he was allegedly
spying in northern city of Negage.
</P>
<P>
The troops under the leader named Jacinto Matias have launched
several attacks against some towns and cities in north Angola,
causing at least 500 deaths, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Lost Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Scientists using ground-based radio
telescopes have been able to detect the wayward SOHO satellite,
which is found slowly rotating near its original position in
space.
</P>
<P>
It is a potentially important step toward possible recovery of
direct communications with the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
(SOHO) spacecraft, the European Space Agency (ESA) said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
Radio communication with SOHO, a joint mission of the ESA and
the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), was
lost on June 25. Scientists had thought that the chances of
regaining contact with the spacecraft were slim.
</P>
<P>
However, after sending out a burst of radio waves on July 23
towards SOHO's last know position from the world's largest radio
telescope on Arecibo, Puerto Rico, another radio telescope in
California, the US, successfully locating the spacecraft's echo
and tracking its position.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary analysis of the ongoing radar data indicates that
SOHO is still in its orbit and is turning slowly at a rate of
roughly one revolution per minute.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are continuing to analyze the radar data to extract
more precise information on SOHO's location and motion, which in
turn could help in future recovery efforts, as SOHO's solar panels
turn toward the Sun.
</P>
<P>
ESA and NASA engineers also are continuing their efforts to
re-establish radio data communication with SOHO, encouraged by the
radar measurement of a slow spin rate, which suggests minimal
structural damage has occurred.
</P>
<P>
Launched into space in December 1995, SOHO successfully
completed its nominal two-year mission in April 1998 to study the
Sun's atmosphere, surface and interior.
</P>
<P>
If SOHO does return to life, it will be a classic example of
space rescue. Scientists hope that the spacecraft, the mission of
which has been extended into 2003, will enable them to study solar
storms as the activity of the Sun rises towards its 11-year
maximum.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Asks U.S. Local Governments to Avert Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government has written to
leaders of all 50 U.S. states and 15 major cities urging them to
stop threatened sanctions against Swiss banks over claims to
Holocaust-era accounts.
</P>
<P>
In a letter made public Tuesday by the Swiss government's task
force on Holocaust issues, Switzerland urged the U.S. states and
cities to prevent a rolling series of sanctions proposed by five
among them, including New York and California.
</P>
<P>
"We understand the strong emotions raised by this issue,"
Holocaust task force leader Thomas Borer and Swiss ambassador to
the U.S. Alfred Defago wrote in the letter, addressed to governors
and finance officers of the 50 states and their counterparts in 15
large U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
"But we are also deeply concerned that sanctions imposed
against the Swiss economy could trigger a vicious circle of
threats and counter-measures that could endanger the
Swiss-American relationship, adversely affect open markets in
financial services, and ultimately derail a process that is
designed to achieve justice for the survivors of the Holocaust,"
they said.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 state and city finance officers have been asked
by colleagues from New York city and state, California, New Jersey
and Pennsylvania to join sanctions aimed at forcing Swiss banks to
raise an offer for a final settlement with U.S. Jewish groups and
lawyers for Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions drive by the city and state panel headed by New
York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi was launched after talks broke
down in June between Swiss banks and Jewish negotiators, who have
demanded 1.5 billion dollars, twice as much as the amount Swiss
banks have offered.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest intervention by the Swiss government after a
similar letter to President Bill Clinton last week urging his
administration to head off bank boycotts proposed to start on
September 1.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has said it opposes sanctions as
harmful for Holocaust survivors, U.S.-Swiss relations and American
financial markets.

"They are to do with both low-level and high-level corruption
allegations," Chiwaula said, adding that "out of those 40, we
reckon that over one third may end up in court of law."
</P>
<P>
He said his bureau will take its own cases to court, and for
this it has appointed its Deputy Director Alysocius Nampota, a
lawyer himself, to be its public prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
"We have been investigating, and conducting civic education
since February this year," said Chiwaula. "Warrants of arrest
have already been secured for some of the cases."
</P>
<P>
With this disclosure, the bureau would save its neck as it has
been heavily criticized by the public that it was being soft on
the allegedly corrupt government officials.
</P>
<P>
"Most people think we are not working as they have been asking
why we have not been taking ministers and government officials to
court. Now we want to show them that we are working," said Ms.
Charity Mphande, a bureau official.
</P>
<P>
Quashing the feeling by some people that many involve in
corruption because they are paid miserably by the government,
Mphande said: "While poverty could be the major cause of
corruption, some people are rich but surprisingly are still
corrupt."
</P>
<P>
"The major problem is also lack of morals and principles among
most such individuals," said the official.
</P>
<P>
She said ministries allegedly most hit by corrupt practices
include works, education, lands and valuation and the country's
road traffic commission.
</P>
<P>
In the ministry of education, Mphande said there have been
irregularities in the payment of teachers' salaries and the
employment of teachers, and in the awarding of road construction
contracts in the case of the ministry of works.

<HEADLINE> Russia Rejects Foreign Pressure over Missile Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Ambassador to Cyprus
Georgi Mouradov Tuesday called for an end to foreign pressure on
Cyprus and Russia to postpone or cancel the delivery of the S-300
surface-to-air missile system in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"This pressure should stop because it is in flagrant opposition
to the rules of international law and the spirit of the existing
cooperation between our country and western countries," Mouradov
said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark to the media after a meeting with Pantelis
Kouros, under-secretary to the Cypriot president Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and some other Western countries are stepping up
pressure on Russia and Cyprus over their 425-million-U.S.-dollar
deal, which could spark conflict between Greece and Greek Cypriots
on one side, and Turkey and Turkish Cypriots on the other.
</P>
<P>
The anti-aircraft missile system, to be delivered and deployed
late this year on the divided Mediterranean island, is regarded by
Turkey, and Turkish Cypriots on the norther part, as a security
danger.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to take "pre-emptive measures" to prevent
the deployment of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Mouradov called the pressure a violation of Cyprus' and
Russia's right to develop their cooperation in any field,
including military and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"In order to protect our sovereign rights we should not pay any
attention to moves by those who do not want us to develop our
cooperation with the Cyprus Republic in the military and technical
fields," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also reminded that Russian President Boris Yeltsin has
reassured Cypriot president that Moscow would fulfill its
obligations stemming from the S-300 missile deal.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has so far maintained a 35,000-strong force in northern
Cyprus, which was unilaterally declared in 1983 by Turkish
Cypriots a breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,"
recognized only by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Zambia Ties Enter New Era: Chiluba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said here Tuesday that the relations between China and
Zambia has entered a new era characterized by increasing
cooperation in economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
Ckhiluba made the remarks during talks with Sun Guangxiang,
Vice Minister of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, and Li Yanling, Chinese Vice Minister of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that it's a good form of cooperation for the
Chinese companies coming into Zambia to invest and establish
joint ventures with local businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president hoped that more and more Chinese
companies would come to Zambia to participate in the country's
process of on-going privatization, which will promote the
efficiency of local companies and create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba spoke highly of the traditional friendship between
China and Zambia, describing it as "strong and healthy." He
also expressed his hope that the two countries will increase
their friendly exchange of visits and enhance their bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Sun Guangxiang, who led a 19-member economic
and trade delegation on a three-day visit to Zambia, expressed
the gratitude of the Chinese government to Zambia for its
sticking to a one China policy and its support for China's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Zambia Wang Yunxiang and several Zambian
senior officials attended the meeting, after which Chiluba held
closed-door talks with the Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation arrived in Zambia Sunday and will leave
for Zimbabwe Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Waste Recycling Plant to Be Built in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Environmental Watch Africa (EWA),
a newly-formed non-governmental organization, has pledged to
spearhead the establishment of a recycling plant in Zambia to
curb environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Times of Zambia Monday in Ndola, 330
kilometers north of Lusaka, EWA Interim Chairman Khalid Sakala
said that his organization is concerned about deteriorating
environmental standards in Zambia and the African continent as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Tuesday quoted Sakala as saying there is need to
work hand in hand with the Zambian government and other investors
to ensure that a recycling plant in Zambia becomes a reality.
</P>
<P>
Sakala said that the establishment of such a recycling plant
in Zambia will create a lot of employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In a situation like the one in Zambia where there is an influx
of imported canned foodstuffs and drinks, more people could earn
a lot of money by providing materials for recycling purposes.
</P>
<P>
Sakala, whose team has just returned from a study tour of
South African recycling plants, said that the South African
people are already earning enough money for their living.
</P>
<P>
Statistics quoted by the paper show that South Africa is among
the top three countries in the world for the recovery of steel
beverage cans with a 51 percent recovery rate.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hopes India, Pakistan Will Resume Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan hopes that the leaders of India and Pakistan will lessen
tensions in South Asia through their talks during a regional
summit this week.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a statement through his spokesman here
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 10th Summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) is scheduled for July 29-31 in Colombo, Sri
Lanka where Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian
counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee are expected to meet on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first top level encounter after the nuclear
tests by the two countries in May, which triggered wide
international reaction.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the summit "provides an excellent opportunity" for a
meeting on the sidelines between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that the meeting will lessen tensions and resume a
political dialogue to address all differences between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He also hopes that both nations will find it possible to join
the overwhelming majority of the international community in the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and in future steps
towards nuclear disarmament and the prevention of nuclear
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
The Indo-Pak talks have been stalled twice since 1994 due to
the dispute over the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Before departing for Colombo Sharif said their talks will focus
on the resumption of dialogue and issues of peace and security
particularly in the background of nuclearization of South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vajpayee said in New Delhi that India will strive to
develop an understanding with Pakistan to live together by solving
all problems peacefully.

<HEADLINE> Freed French Men Arrive in Djibouti from Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Two French yachtsmen who had been
held as hostages in Somalia for nearly two months arrived in
Djibouti Tuesday, the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) Nairobi
office said.
</P>
<P>
UNDP spokeswoman Maria Frauenrath said that no ransom was paid
for their release on Monday from the northeastern town of
Bossaso. Gunmen holding them had demanded 75,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Their health is good. They were treated well and allowed by
their captors to swim," Frauenrath told reporters in the U.N.
Office in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The French yachtsmen, who arrived at Djibouti Airport at 16:40
local time, had been seized by the Somali Salvation Democratic
Front (SSDF) in early June when their yacht allegedly strayed
into Somali waters near the town of Alula, local press reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Office in Nairobi said in a statement that the men were
freed by the leadership of the Puntland Constitutional
Conference, a body that is initiating an administration for a
region in northeast Somalia called Puntland.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been without central government since 1991 and the
Horn of Africa state has fractured into clan-based fiefdoms.

LAGOS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has

But it did not say whether the new position meant an

<HEADLINE> Primary Responsibility for Implementing Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Primary responsibility
for implementing the programs of action of major United Nations
Conferences rested on national governments, several speakers
emphasized on Monday as the Economic and Social Council began
considering integrated and coordinated implementation of and
follow-up to those conferences and summits.
</P>
<P>
Representative from the United Nations Children's Fund Ado said
that the United Nations reform, particularly the development of
country-level common programming frameworks, added a new dimension
to the implementation of the goals of international conferences.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent work by the United Nations system had served
as strong reaffirmation that conference follow-up was a
country-based process.
</P>
<P>
Ado Vaher said its primary responsibility rested with national
governments, and in addition, implementation of goals and targets
should involve a broad range of parties, including governments,
local communities, civil society and donor agencies.
</P>
<P>
Representative from Austria Hans Deter Manz, speaking on behalf
of the European Union, said the Union attached great importance to
the need to improve the follow-up to major United Nations
conferences.
</P>
<P>
He said while the first responsibility for implementation lay
with governments, the United Nations system was an important
instrument in helping them meet that challenge.
</P>
<P>
The representative said the assistance could only be
effectively provided if the system could mobilized a coherent
response to the vast and overlapping plans of action that had
emerged from the conference.
</P>
<P>
Martinez Aguilar, representative from Mexico, said there was
still unfinished and common inter-sectoral issues that need to be
discussed more fully within the Council and the Council should
promote an authentic global perspective and avoid any overly
cerebral analyses of a few privileged themes.
</P>
<P>
He said it was especially important for national Governments to
direct projects of international concern, any attempt to convert
the role of the resident coordinator into one which influenced
national efforts would be inappropriate.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Raps U.S., Britain Attacked for Obstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Tuesday lashed out at the
United States and Britain of holding up contracts it has reached
with foreign companies under the oil-for-food program, the Iraqi
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A Trade Ministry official said that up to July 21, the two
countries have obstructed the United Nations Sanctions Committee
from approving 22 contracts for food and medicine sale to Iraq in
the fourth phase of the program starting June 3.
</P>
<P>
"Deliberately obstructing and delaying the implementation of
the contracts without justification" indicates the hostile policy
of the two countries, who "are maintaining their constant
approach" to prolong economic sanctions against Iraq, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed the trade embargo on Iraq,
banning export of oil, its main income earner, in 1990 after its
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal signed between Iraq and the U.N. in 1996
is an exception of the sanctions. The deal allows Iraq to sell a
limited amount of oil in every six months to buy humanitarian
goods.
</P>
<P>
The contracts that Iraq reaches with foreign firms according to
the deal must be approved by the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official said the contracts on hold, valued at 120
million dollars in total, are for the import of milk, rice, tea,
eggs, cooking oil, wheat, medicine, medical appliances and
tractors.
</P>
<P>
He called attention to the fact that the U.N. Sanctions
Committee has not approved any of the contracts for the supply of
spare parts to Iraq's oil sector.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has agreed to allocate 300 million
dollars from Iraq's oil proceeds for it to buy spare parts to
rehabilitate oil production and export capacity.
</P>
<P>
Iraq says that it is unable to pump more than 4 billion dollars
worth of oil in six months due to the severe lack of spare parts
and a low price of oil on the world market.
</P>
<P>
From the fourth phase of the oil-for-food deal, Iraq can sell
5.2 billion dollars worth of oil in six months.

<HEADLINE> Comoros Seeks African Support to Solve Anjouan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Salim Hadji Himidi, the
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Co-operation of Comoros, urged
African countries Tuesday to find new ways to deal with the
crisis of the Anjouan island.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Dar es Salaam, the Comorian
foreign minister who arrived in Tanzania Monday said the Anjouan
citizens have been experiencing unstable political situation for
more than a year.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has been catalyzed by external forces, especially
France, the former colonial ruler of Comoros, he noted.
</P>
<P>
During its 23 years of independence, Comoros has been
subjected to coups, assassinations and all sorts of disruptions
perpetuated by external forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister appreciated the way the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) has handled the matter through holding mediation
meetings, signing memorandum and sending special envoys, but the
efforts have some how proved futile, he observed.
</P>
<P>
Himidi expressed disappointment about the fact that the
agreements on resolving crisis were not
fulfilled as the warring parties in Anjouan kept abrogating them.
</P>
<P>
"Chaos and violence have become the order of the day,
therefore there is a need to find another option to force them to
come to the negotiation table," he said.
</P>
<P>
Several diplomatic missions to Anjouan have failed to address
the issue, the latest being the ministerial delegation under the
chairmanship of Tanzania's Minister of Foreign Affairs and
International Co-operation, Jakaya Kikwete, in March.
</P>
<P>
The OAU, in a meeting on July 24, acknowledged that the
situation in Anjouan is on the verge of a civil war, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Comorian foreign minister further said several friendly
countries have been asked to help mediate the Anjouan crisis,
and he is optimistic that they will assist as they have promised.
</P>
<P>
Crisis in Anjouan Island emerged in July last year after
separatists wanted to split the island from the Federal Islamic
Republic of Comoros.
</P>
<P>
Himidi will leave Tanzania for South Africa on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Promises to Resign in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz reaffirmed Tuesday that he would resign at the end of this
year after the Parliament decides on the date for new elections, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the parliamentary faction of his Motherland Party
(ANAP), Yilmaz said he would keep the promise made to the opposition
Republican People's Party (CHP) Chairman Deniz Baykal
on holding early elections.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Yilmaz should step down late this year and
early elections would be held in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Despite being in the opposition, the CHP supports the ANAP-led
coalition, which also includes the Democratic Left Party (DSP)
and the Democratic Turkey Party (DTP).
</P>
<P>
On July 25, Yilmaz and his coalition partners reached the
agreement on holding early elections after bridging their gaps
over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said his coalition had been working "harmoniously"
within the past 12 months and no one had the right to complain
about its performance.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would submit his resignation in December to
President Suleyman Demirel for approval, most probably after the
Parliament passes next year's budget and sets a date for the new
elections.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the new government should be up to the
president, Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
The current coalition was set up by the ANAP, DSP and DTP in
June 1997 after the pro-Islamic government led by former Welfare
Party Chairman Necmettin Erbakan was forced to step down by
Turkey's powerful generals who support secularism in the mostly
Islamic country.

<HEADLINE> Recession Fears in UK Lead to Building Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) - Fears of a recession and higher
interest rates in Britain have blackened the outlook for new
industrial building projects.
</P>
<P>
The result will be a sharper-than-expected slowdown in
construction, according to the latest forecasts by the National
Council of Building Material Producers (BMP).
</P>
<P>
The BMP said its downgraded forecasts confirm recent industry
surveys which have found a marked slowing in key construction
markets, like housing, since January.
</P>
<P>
BMP director Allan Wilen said industrial construction, which
had been expected to remain flat next year, is now forecast to
fall 5%. Predictions of slight private housing growth have been
reversed to a 4% fall over two years.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a harder landing than we thought. It is vital the
extra Government money for health and education comes through," he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, there will be an increase in work on social housing,
school and hospital projects through greater public sector
investment, the BMP said.

<HEADLINE> AL Urges Support for Egypt-France Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid Tuesday called for international
support to an Egyptian-French initiative to rescue the Mideast
peace process, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, the AL chief said his organization
welcomed the initiative that calls for holding an international
conference to revive the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations on all tracks have mostly been stalled since
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coming to power in
June 1996.
</P>
<P>
"This overture is regarded as an important factor for rescuing
the peace drive and it should be encouraged and supported by all
countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
With the U.S.-sponsored peace process deep in trouble, the
joint initiative made by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
French President Jacques Chirac in May is gaining support in the
Arab, European and international arena.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa is in Paris since Monday
for talks with his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine and other
officials to thrash out details of the Egyptian-French idea.
</P>
<P>
This proposal was also a topic of the lengthy talks between
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Syrian President Al-Assad in
Egypt's Mediterranean city of Alexandria on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid hailed the Egyptian-Syrian summit as a "positive
drive" of constant coordination between the two Arab states to
achieve peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He hoped this summit, which aimed to achieve the aspirations of
the Arab nation, would be a prelude to more Arab consultations.
But he stressed that good preparations should be made before any
meeting of Arab leaders can be convened.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries are yet to decide whether an Arab summit,
called for urgently by the Palestinians in order to counter
Israeli hardline policies, can be held in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators met last week for the first
time in months but were unable to reach agreement on outstanding
issues, including a U.S. proposal of a further Israeli withdrawal
from 13.1 percent of the West Bank in return for the Palestinian
security guarantee.

LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) - Mortgage lending by Britain's major
banks soared to more than 5 billion pounds (8 billion US dollars)
in June, according to the British Bankers' Association.
</P>
<P>
The 20 percent increase above May's figure is the highest
monthly figure since the converted building societies were
included in the figures from September.

Net lending - gross advances minus repayment - was 1.13 billion

Tim Sweeney, director-general of the British Bankers'

"To lend over 5 billion pounds to customers and approve a

month represents an impressive performance," he added.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian President Calls for Help for African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings
has called on West African First Ladies Peace Mission to help
"awaken the voices of our sisters" in the rural areas, who he
said were the silent majority and victims of all conflict
situations in the continent.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote address at the opening of the two-day Summit of
West African First Ladies on Peace, Rawlings said the rural women
needed to be empowered to enable them to join in the task of
bringing peace and development to Africa.
</P>
<P>
"They should not remain passive beneficiaries," he said,
quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They must also be proud participants and partners in the
on-going crusade for securing total peace and stability in the
continent, the president added.
</P>
<P>
"Traditional perceptions of justice to women and children must
give way to a recognition of the potentials of our women to
unlock a future of peace and prosperity," Rawlings told the
summit, which opened in the Ghanaian capital of Accra Monday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that peace thrives where development enables people
to have access to basic necessities of life, including food,
shelter, education, health facilities and employment.
</P>
<P>
Attending the summit are all the first ladies from the 16 west
African countries under he umbrella of the Economic Community of
West African States.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's first lady, Justice Fati Abubakar, was present for
her first official duty since her husband General Abdulsalam
Abubakar became head of state on June 9 this year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, convened by the Ghanaian first lady, Nana
Rawlings, was aimed to concretize efforts by women toward
securing total peace and stability in the sub-region and Africa
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The first summit of Africa's first ladies was held in the
Nigerian capital of Abuja in May last year.

<HEADLINE> Monica Lewinsky Gets Full Immunity from Prosecutors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Monica Lewinsky has been given
full immunity in exchange for testimony in Kenneth Starr's
six-month investigation of her relationship with President Bill
Clinton, Lewinsky's attorneys said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We, as counsel for Monica Lewinsky, have reached an agreement
today that for her full and truthful testimony she will receive
transactional immunity in this case," said Plato Cacheris, one of
her attorneys.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis, was granted the same level of
protection from prosecution, said her attorney, Billy Martin. The
mother had frequent telephone conversations with her daughter
about Lewinsky's relationship with Clinton, according to 20 hours
of tape recordings between Ms. Lewinsky and former friend Linda
Tripp.
</P>
<P>
After talking to prosecutors for five hours in New York on
Monday, Lewinsky has agreed to testify that she had a sexual
relationship with the president, The Associated Press quoted legal
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Her lawyer said that she's going to give complete and truthful
testimony, and if she does, that should present no problem to the
president, obviously," White House spokesman Mike McCurry said. "I
think he's pleased that things will work out for her." Clinton
talked with his lawyer, David Kendall, earlier Tuesday, McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
Transactional immunity means that Lewinsky will not be
prosecuted for any testimony that she gives to Starr's office
regarding matters under investigation. It is the most protective
type of immunity that can be granted to a witness.
</P>
<P>
The source said the earlier proffer contained "a fair amount of
information" dealing with Lewinsky's conversations with the
president and his confidants about how they would deal with Mrs.
Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton. The president
denied under oath in the Jones case that he'd had sexual relations
with Lewinsky and she filed an affidavit in the suit saying "I
have never had a sexual relationship with the president."

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Tuesday condemned remarks
by Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Panglos that Turkish Consulate
in the Greek city of Komotini is violating Greece's national
interests.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned by Mr. Panglos' remarks and we strongly
condemn them. Undoubtedly, if the Greek government tries to
obstruct the mission of the Turkish Consulate in Komotini on such
subjective grounds, it will be given an immediate and reciprocal
response," the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that the Turkish consulate was carrying
out its duties in line with the bilateral agreements and its
activities should be respected by the Greek government.
</P>
<P>
During his last Sunday's visit to Komotini, a city in Western
Thrace which is mainly populated by ethnic Turks, Panglos said the
Turkish consulate had to stay away from things incompatible with
their duties.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Greece of ill-treating ethnic Turks
living in the Western Thrace region.
</P>
<P>
"It (the Turkish consulate) had better stay within these
limits, otherwise, it will be given the necessary lesson," warned
Panglos.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have long been bitter rivals due to the
dispute over Cyprus, the Mediterranean island that has been
divided since 1974 after Turkish troops took over the northern
third of the island following a pro-Athens coup launched by the
Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is stationing 3,500 troops in the north with the claimed
aim of protecting the Turkish Cypriots, while Greece is the
closest ally of the Greek Cypriots living in the south.

Andrei Plesu will be in Tirana on July 31, as part of Romania's
intensified efforts to find a political solution to the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Andrei Plesu will be received by the President and Prime

<P>
The developments in Kosovo are a matter of high concern for
Romania. The Bucharest authorities are worried about the possible
extension of the conflict in the region and back the international
efforts to solve the conflict by political means.
</P>
<P>
"The territorial integrity of Yugoslavia must be observed, with
the sides reaching for a durable solution, based on a special

<P>
KHARTOUM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Sudan said it has repulsed a
joint offensive by the Eritrean forces and Sudanese rebels on four
positions along the Sudanese-Eritrean border.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant General Abdul-Rahman Serel-Khatm, spokesman of the
Sudanese Armed Forces, said the joint offensive started with
bombardment against the Sudanese towns of Hafrat, Awwadh, Alkah
and Kalsa with heavy artillery and rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
The shelling lasted three hours and was followed by attacks on
the four towns with infantry forces, supported by tanks and heavy
gunfire, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government forces managed to defeat the attacks on
all fronts except one, where fighting is going on, he added,
without detailing the hot spot, or the number of casualties.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sudanese forces, backed by civil defense forces and
volunteers, were ready to defend the religion and the homeland
against the enemies.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a military source said the Sudanese army had
detected Eritrean military build-up in the eastern border areas.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Eritrea cut off diplomatic relations in 1994 after
accusing each other of supporting opposition groups. There have
since been skirmishes in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sudanese rebel movements have set up bases in
Eritrea to launch cross-border attacks on targets inside Sudan,
since Eritrea declared in 1996 to back any Sudanese group that
sought to topple the Sudanese government.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The number of HIV carriers recently
have risen fast in Moscow city and Moscow region, the Interfax
news agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Vadim Pokrovsky, leader of the Russian Center of the
Prevention and Treatment of AIDS, said that 635 people were
registered as HIV-positive in Moscow city and 306 in Moscow region

</P>
<P>
The professor said Kaliningrad, Tver, Nizhny Novgorod and
Krasnodar -- the former leaders have started showing a decline in
new HIV cases.
</P>

In Moscow HIV is mainly being spread among drug addicts,
Pokrovsky said. In his opinion, women contract the virus from male
drug addicts through sexual contact. Some of those women pass HIV
on to their children during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
According to the Center of the Prevention and Treatment of
AIDS, 8,956 people have been registered in Russia as HIV-positive
since 1987.
</P>
<P>
The center said 4,399 of them contracted the virus in 1997. In
1998 there have been 1,932 new cases, including 36 children, most
of whom were infected either before they were born or through drug
abuse at ages of between 11 and 14.
</P>
<P>
A total of 320 people have been registered in Russia since 1987
as having full-blown AIDS, and 210 of them have died.

<P>
Indyk also expected deployment of long-range Shehab-4 in two to
five years away.

The Iranian government has said the test-launching of the
missile would not pose any threat to its neighbors, but the United

<HEADLINE> SADC Leaders Condemns Peace Violations in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Southern African Development
Community (SADC) leaders Tuesday expressed concern over the
continuing violations of peace accord in Angola.
</P>
<P>
After their meeting in Namibia's coastal town of Swakopmund,
leaders from 14 SADC member states condemned the resumption of
acts of hostility that amounted to a declaration of war by Jonas
Savimbi and his opposition National Union for Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA), South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
This could lead to a full-scale war and would derail the
Angolan peace process, they said in a communique.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that more than 200 people were killed by UNITA
armed personnel in the diamond mining town of Cafunfo in the
Lunda Norte Province, Angola last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But UNITA rejected the report by the Angolan government,
claiming that the killing was the result of tension between
Angolans and foreign diamond traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The communique urged UNITA to comply with the provisions of
the Lusaka Protocol on Angola and U.N. Security Council
resolutions in order to stop the suffering of the Angolan people.
</P>
<P>
The leaders reiterated support for the Angolan government and
called on the UNITA leaders to go to Luanda, the capital of
Angola, immediately and to play a constructive role in the
reconstruction and development of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The SADC leaders were also committed to doing what they could
to ensure that the Angolan peace process remained on the course,
and was speedily and successfully completed.
</P>
<P>
Countries bordering with Angola declared that they would work
together to ensure that their territories were not used as
springboards to undermine and destabilize Angola.
</P>
<P>
The communique called on the international community to help
ensure the speedy implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, and the
compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions on Angola.

LOS ANGELES, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the world's
largest chip maker, Monday cut prices on its Pentium II and
Celeron processors for desktop computers by as much as 31 percent,
according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clara, California-based Intel cut prices on its
300-MHz Celeron chip, which is designed for computers costing
about 1,000 U.S. dollars or less, by 30 percent, to 112 dollars
from 159 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The price for the 266-MHz Celeron chip was cut 19 percent to 86
dollars from 106 dollars, while a Pentium II running at 300-MHz
was cut about 31 percent to 209 dollars from 305 dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a rule, all prices are based on purchases in lots of 1,000
units. The new prices are effective from July 26.
</P>
<P>
Intel hopes to boost demand for personal computers, which has
been lackluster even in the wake of steep price cuts by PC makers
such as Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
PC shipments rose just 10 percent in the second quarter, less
than expected, though they are expected to be stronger in the
second half.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- British Financial Secretary to the
Treasury Dawn Primarolo said Tuesday that the government will
bring more customs officers to try to crack down on cross-Channel
tobacco and alcohol smugglers.
</P>
<P>
Primarolo said the government would recruit an extra 100
officers and spend 35 million pounds (57 million U.S. dollars)
over the next three years to tackle the growing smuggling problems
which cost taxpayers over 800 million pounds (1.3 billion dollars)
a year.
</P>
<P>
This was "an outrageous amount which takes much needed
resources away from our schools and hospitals," she said.
</P>
<P>
Under free market rules in the European Union, British
travelers are allowed to bring home almost unlimited amount of
alcohol and tobacco, providing it is for personal use.
</P>
<P>
But British industries have been complaining that their
businesses are being ruined both by legal imports and illegal
racketeers.
</P>
<P>
Extra staff will be positioned at the Channel ports -- the
entry point for much of the smuggling trade -- and electronic tags
will be used to keep track of goods on the move.
</P>
<P>
Others will work across the country to tackle the distribution
and sale networks for the illicit goods.
</P>
<P>
The government will also take tougher measures which will lead
to retailers and haulers who break the law risking the loss of
their licenses.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Governor Predicts One Percent Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- South African Reserve Bank
Governor Chris Stals Tuesday predicted a one percent growth rate for
the country's economy in 1998, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
It could be 1.5 percent "if we are lucky", he told parliament's
finance portfolio committee.
</P>
<P>
His statement followed last week's warning by Finance Minister
Trevor Manuel that the government would find it difficult to reach its
growth targets if exchange rate volatility and high interest rates
persisted.
</P>
<P>
In his March budget, Manuel projected growth of three percent in
the gross domestic product (GDP), rising to four percent and higher as
South Africa moved into the next century.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's GDP had grown by 0.5 percent in the first quarter of
this year compared to the last quarter of 1997, but by one percent
compared to the first quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Rand had depreciated by 21.6 percent between the
end of December and July 21, Stals said the bank hoped there would be
some movement back.
</P>
<P>
He rejected calls for the Reserve Bank to let the exchange rate
depreciate instead of raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
But he said higher interest rates and the changed situation in the
financial markets would certainly have a negative effect on growth in
the short term.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa had to analyse the weaknesses in its economy,
one of which was a low level of foreign reserves. The reserves, which
stand at 50 billion Rand (7.9 billion U.S. dollars), are by far the
lowest of emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
But he said producer and consumer inflation in the first quarter of
the year was very much in line with objectives set a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Stals dismissed concerns about South Africa's balance of payment,
saying that if the 8.6-billion-Rand (1.4-billion-dollar) deficit in
the current account for the first quarter stayed at that level for the
whole year, the deficit should not be more than 10 or 12 billion Rand
(1.6 or 1.9 billion dollars) for the year, which was manageable.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers, Public Pay Tribute to Fallen Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
congressional leaders paid tribute Tuesday in the stately Rotunda
at the caskets of the two Capitol Police officers slain defending
people in the historic building Friday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton praised the men's "quiet courage and uncommon bravery,"
saying, "Until crisis reveals their courage, we do not see how
truly special they are."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and Capitol Police Chief Gary L. Abrecht reverently laid
large floral wreaths at the flag-draped coffins of Jacob J.
Chestnut and John Gibson.
</P>
<P>
Since morning, thousands of hushed members of the public had
filed past the caskets, which lay side by side, a couple meters
apart, in the center of the hall beneath the Capitol's famous
dome.
</P>
<P>
"It's appropriate today that we honor these two men, who stood
the ground and defended freedom, this very room, and all of our
lives," said Lott.
</P>
<P>
The somber chamber was filled mostly with police officers,
lawmakers and their aides, nearly all of whom were standing.
</P>
<P>
At noon, hundreds of members of the House and Senate had their
turn, noiselessly standing eight deep around the plush red theater
ropes surrounding the caskets.
</P>
<P>
An honor guard of four Capitol Police colleagues, in deep blue
ceremonial uniforms and white gloves, surrounded the caskets
standing in an at-rest position, feet astride, hands folded in
front of them and faces blank of expression.
</P>
<P>
Chestnut and Gibson, shot last Friday by an intruder who was
himself wounded and captured, became only the 28th and 29th
national figures honored in the Rotunda in a tradition that began
in 1852 with Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
On Monday the House and Senate approved a resolution lauding
the two men "for the selfless acts of heroism they displayed on
July 24, 1998, in sacrificing their lives in the line of duty so
that others might live."
</P>
<P>
The resolution also provides funeral expenses plus a gift equal
to a year's salary to their wives and children, and authorizes a
plaque in the officers' honor to be placed in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
Both men will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
Chestnut is an Air Force veteran, and the Army approved Gibson's
interment there after it was requested by Gingrich, and House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
Weston's case was transferred to federal court, where U.S.
Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson said she will evaluate the case
daily until Weston has recovered sufficiently from gunshot wounds
to appear in court.
</P>
<P>
The gunman tore into the Capitol on Friday afternoon and almost
immediately shot Chestnut, who was guarding an entrance used by
visitors. He then dashed into a corridor used by DeLay and his
aides, where the intruder and Gibson fired at each other. A female
tourist also was wounded and was discharged from a hospital
Saturday after being treated.

UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. General Assembly
President Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine Tuesday urged all parties
concerned in conflict situations to respect the status of U.N.
staff and make every effort to ensure their safety.
</P>
<P>
Reports of attacks against U.N. aid workers have become almost
routine, but there should be nothing routine in the response of
the international community to these heinous crimes, he said in a
press statement.
</P>

Commenting on recent killings of U.N. staff in Burundi,
Tajikistan and Afghanistan, he said they should serve as tragic
reminders of the dangers facing U.N. staff who try to provide much
needed help to people caught in conflicts.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. data, more civilians than soldiers from the
U.N. staff have been killed this year, with 17 civilians losing
their lives in aid missions and 13 soldiers killed in military
peacekeeping operations.
</P>

In 1997, the toll stood at 44 on-duty soldiers and 17
civilians.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Parties Continue Discussions on Root of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Burundian parties,
which are having peace talks in the northern Tanzanian city of
Arusha, will end their discussions on "the root of Burundi
conflict" Wednesday, said Hashim Mbita, spokesman for Julius
Nyerere, the international peace facilitator.
</P>
<P>
The discussions on the root of conflict will end after the
armed rebel group National Council for the Defense of Democracy
(CNDD) and other parties make their statements on the issue,
Mbita told reporters Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday, 15 parties and groups have presented their
respective views on the root of the Burundi conflict, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in
bloody conflicts between the ethnic Hutu majority and the ruling
Tutsi minority since the assassination of Melchior Ndadaye, the
first president elected under a multi-party system in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Mbita said the next issue following the discussion of the root
of conflict will be the procedures of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that the second round of talks may end on Friday
after formation of five sub-committees to push forward the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, three parties-- the Party for the Liberation of
Hutu People (PALIPEHUTU), National Alliance for Rights and
Development (ANNADE) and the United Party for National Progress
(UPRONA) -- made statements in the plenary session chaired by
Nyerere, former president of Tanzania. It was also attended by
observers from the European Union, the United States, Canada,
Italy and the Organization of the African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
It took the pro-Tutsi party, UPRONA, major rival of the
pro-Hutu Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU), 135 minutes to
explain the root of crisis in war-torn Burundi. Bararunyereste
Libere, the head of UPRONA delegation, made an eight-point
explanation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Jean Baptiste Bagaza, the former president of
Burundi, and FRODEBU's exiled chief, Jean Minani, urged factions
at the conference to conduct a genuine dialog to end sufferings
of the Burundians as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
They shared a common view that the best possible way out for
Burundi conflict is through peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian factions signed a ceasefire agreement last month
in the first round of face-to-face talks in Arusha.

<HEADLINE> Low Oil Prices Drive Down Arco's Profit by 44 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Atlantic Richfield Co. (ARCO),
the seventh-largest U.S. oil company, announced Monday that its
second-quarter profit fell 44 percent, according to reports from
the company.
</P>
<P>
ARCO posted second-quarter profits of 220 million U.S. dollars,
down 44 percent from the year-ago results of 390 million dollars.
Revenues for the quarter fell 30 percent to 2.6 billion dollars
from 3.7 billion dollars during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based oil giant said that one of the main
reasons behind the drop is the lowest oil prices in 12 years on
the international oil market.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices hover near 12-year lows with oil and natural
gas profits having been hit hard by a 40 percent slide in the
world market since the beginning of this year. Slack Asian demand,
an unseasonably warm winter and overproduction have forced prices
lower.
</P>
<P>
Oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange averaged 14.67 dollars
a barrel in the second quarter, five dollars less than a year
earlier, and the lowest level since the third quarter of 1986.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata said on Tuesday
that the nature of displacement is undergoing significant changes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 1998 Substantive Session of the U.N. Economic and
Social Council, Ogata said in recent years, UNHCR has dealt with
different and increasingly complex groups of displaced people.
One remarkable feature is that, in addition to refugees, these
groups have increasingly included internally dispaced persons and
other victims of conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner said conflicts have been mostly of an
internal nature, involving deeply divided communities sometimes
at war with each other, which has caused outflows of population
in which people of concern to UNHCR are mixed with armed persons.
</P>
<P>
Ogata said it is clear that host governments bear primary
responsibility for the maintenance of law and order in and
around refugee camps, and everything possible must be done to
encourage and assist states to assume this responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Ogata said insecurity in the context of humanitarian
operations obviously has an impact on the safety of staff as
well, which should be addressed with vigor and determination,
with practical measures to improve staff security, not only
within UNHCR, but also in cooperation with the United Nations
Administrative Committee on Coordination.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner said another issue of current concern is
that the sustainability of refugee return, a problem which has
existed for a long time, but has recently been brought to the
fore in more dramatic fashion by massive repatriation movements
to countries where communities remain deeply divided after conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Ogata said it is important that comprehensive approaches be
developed in order to ensure the sustainability of their return,
and bridging the gap between humanitarian assistance and
longer-term development is essential not only to achieve proper
returnee reintegration, but also to help prevent causes for
further displacement.
</P>
<P>
She said such approaches should include the early involvement
of development actors to promote stability and to ensure that
the long-term needs of returnees can be addressed.
</P>
<P>
She said they also require that the immediate needs of
returnees be met satisfactorily, and that those elements among
returnees and their communities be given the opportunities to play
an active, conciliatory role in post-conflict societies.

<HEADLINE> Clubs Slammed over Disabled Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A Football Taskforce report slammed
three leading clubs in the United Kingdom for not providing
disabled access in their new stands.
</P>
<P>
Premiership champions Arsenal and runners-up Manchester United
were censured with Old Tradfford slammed for building a stand
without setting aside a single space for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
Other Premiership clubs singled out by the report for failing to
provide any wheelchair spaces in new stands include Liverpool and
Southampton.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Division One's Huddersfield Town and Division Two's
Northampton Town are held up as examples of good practice with some
of the best provision for disabled fans in all four English
divisions.
</P>
<P>
The report said:"They have built new grounds that set the
standard for the rest of the game to follow."
</P>
<P>
The Task Force, chaired by David Mellor, conducted its
investigation into the lot of disabled fans at the 92 English
league grounds as part of its remit to probe all issues affecting
supporters. It will then report back to government.
</P>
<P>
The report, launched by Sports Minister Tony Banks, identified a
number of major problems within the provision of disabled access at
football grounds.
</P>
<P>
Adam Brown, a member of the Task Force working party and
spokesman for the Football Supporters Association, said:"The
biggest problem was inconsistency, both in terms of provision and
ticketing, access to the ground and refreshment at half-time."
</P>
<P>
He said Leeds United was one example of such ignorance where
disable away fans were forced to sit in front of the home stand in
an intimidating atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The report recommended that while disabled fans are charged,
their helpers who accompany them should get free admission. All
clubs should designate an official to act as a contact for disabled
supporters and provide stewards for them.

BRUSSELS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission decided
on Wednesday to set up a financial expertise think tank to provide
technical assistance to Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The think tank, the European Financial Expertise Network, will
supply Asian countries with private and public sector financial
experts.
</P>
<P>
Requests can be made either directly or through international
financial institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The European experts will be available to advise their
counterparts in Asia on such topics as bank restructuring,
prudential supervision and risk management.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in Asia has shown, commission officials
said, that there is a real need for advice and expertise in all
areas of the financial sector to help re-establish financial
stability.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the European Financial Expertise Network is a
way of providing a coordinated response to the crisis, said the
officials.
</P>
<P>
The second Asia-Europe Summit in London on April 3-4 this year
welcomed the idea of a European financial experts network that
would enable the 15-nation European Union to tackle one of the
main causes of the recent turbulence on Asian financial markets.
</P>
<P>
European financial experts believe that unsound lending
policies by financial institutions and inadequate standards of
prudential supervision were the main causes of the turbulence.

<HEADLINE> PNG PM Introduces Reform to Help Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinean (PNG) Prime
Minister Bill Skate Wednesday announced new measures aimed at
restoring confidence in the PNG's ailing economy and government.
</P>
<P>
The measures include efforts to arrest the fall of the kina,
the national currency, a ministerial reshuffle, a public sector
recruitment freeze and incentives for log exporters, the
Australian Associated Press reported Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the comprehensive reform package that the
government has now introduced will instill confidence in the
economy and the way the government will function to deliver goods
and services to all Papua New Guineans," Skate said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said key elements of the reform package
include:
</P>
<P>
-- Establishing a new ministry of public enterprises and
communications;
</P>
<P>
-- Setting up an independent council to formulate and implement
the government's privatization program; and
</P>
<P>
-- Abolishing export taxes on logs for prices up to 130 kina
(104 U.S. dollars) per cubic meter.
</P>
<P>
Skate said the government would also take measures to ease the
downward pressure on the kina, including:
</P>
<P>
-- Requiring commercial banks in the nation to hold an
interest-free cash reserve of 10 percent with the Bank of Papua
New Guinea;
</P>
<P>
-- Increasing competition in the nation's foreign exchange
market by issuing 10 foreign exchange bureau licenses to
commercial houses, non-bank financial institutions and qualified
individuals;
</P>
<P>
-- Shortening the period that the nation's exporters can keep
their foreign currencies abroad before they are required to bring
them back, from three months to two months; and
</P>
<P>
-- Improving foreign exchange regulations and strengthening the
operations of the Bank of Papua New Guinea and the Department of
Treasury and Planning.
</P>
<P>
Skate also said he would chair a new central committee to
monitor the overall performance of government operations.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also appointed new ministers and "redefined
ministerial responsibilities," which included Rabbie Namaliu as
minister for Petroleum and Gas, Fabian Pok as minister for Public
Enterprise and Communications, Jimson Sauk as minister for Rural
Development, Thomas Pelika as minister for Police, Peter Arul as
minister for Housing and Urban Resettlement, Kala Swokin as
minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism, Mao Zeming as minister
for Forestry, Titus Philemon as minister for Women, Churches and
Non-government organizations, Yauwe Riyong as minister for works
and implementation.

PARIS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The riders of the Tour de France set
off again without their numbers on their backs 20 minutes after
they put their feet on the ground to protest the brutal police
treatment of their colleagues in the TMV team.
</P>
<P>
But the Spanish team ONCE and its leader Frenchman Laurent

France 2 television channel.
</P>

Marco Pantani, the maillot jaune, was the first to tear off his

The lack of number will make it impossible to establishment any

<HEADLINE> Another Missing Body Found in Mt. Meili </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUNMING, China, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Another body of the
missing climbers from the Sino-Japan joint expedition of 1991 was
found on Wednesday in the same place where the previous six bodies
were discovered.
</P>
<P>
Searchers from the Deqin County of Yunnan Province found the
body when they were in search of more remains of the other missing
members, according to the latest report from the local authority.
</P>
<P>
By now the Sino-Japan joint discovering team has found seven
missing bodies in this area, but the other 10 members of the
climbing team remain undiscovered.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Chinese Mountaineering Association (CMA),
Yunnan Physical Culture and Sports Bureau and bachelors from Kyoto
University of Japan have identified some of the missing members
from notebooks, climbing staffs and photographs of bodies
collected in the area.
</P>
<P>
The found bodies and remains are hard to be recognized. Some
of the so-called bodies are just bones, hairs and tags which have
been buried under ice for years.
</P>
<P>
A 17-member discovering team is to set off in search of more
evidences and clues for identification of the bodies on July 30.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were first discovered by local villagers on July 24
at the 4000-meter height of Mt. Meili, the CMA announced.
</P>
<P>
Specialists later recognized them as the Sino-Japan expedition
members who died from an accident on January 3, 1991.
</P>
<P>
The 17-member climbing team, including 11 Japanese and six
Chinese, made an attempt at the virgin Meili but missed in a heavy
snowfall in the Mountain.
</P>
<P>
They went missing at the 5,100 meter No.3 camp, but the rescue
team failed to reach the site due to bad weather and nasty
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The 6,740-meter Mt. Meili has yet to be conquered by any
mountaineering expedition. The Sino-Japan joint team tried three
times in 1989, 1991 and 1996, but without avail.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Weekly's Managing Director to Be Tried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian weekly's managing
director will be tried for allegedly publishing an insulting
letter, the official news agency IRNA reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad-Reza Zaeri of the Khaneh (House) weekly, who is in
custody, will be tried August 3 by a special court for cases
concerning government employees, IRNA quoted Tehran Justice
Department official Saeed Nobari as saying.
</P>
<P>
The trial will take place with a jury and open to the public,
Nobari said.
</P>
<P>
The weekly published on July 15 a letter from one of its
readers. The letter is regarded as being insulting the Islamic
sanctities, particularly the late supreme leader Ayatollah
Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the weekly's office in Tehran was attacked by two
unidentified men with a firebomb. Its publisher, the House of
Young Journalists, has been threatened more serious violence
unless the weekly changes its attitude and performance.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance immediately
deplored the attack, saying those against the weekly's articles
should pursue the matter through proper and legal channels and
refrain from taking individual actions.
</P>
<P>
The House of Young Journalists used to operate under the direct
supervision of the ministry. It became independent in October,
1997 following a change in the ministry's management.

<HEADLINE> HK Leading Air Cargo Operator to Fully Resume Inbound Cargo Handling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals
Ltd. (HACTL) announced here Wednesday that it would resume
handling all inbound cargo from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The air cargo operator, which handles 80 percent of Hong Kong's
total air cargo throughput, is implementing a four-phase recovery
plan to resume full operation of its new facility at Chek Lap Kok
-- SuperTerminal One, which broke down in early July when the new
airport was opened.
</P>
<P>
HACTL said Wednesday that all inbound cargo with the exception
of perishables, valuables, livestock and urgent materials would
continue to be processed at Terminal Two at the old Kai Tak
airport.
</P>
<P>
"We are entering into Phase Two of our recovery plan," said
Anthony Charter, managing director of HACTL. "With the full
resumption of our inbound services, we will now reach the target
of processing up to 75 percent of our customers projected demand,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, HACTL handled a daily average of 2,708 tons
of air cargo, and the managing director estimated that the tonnage
handled every day would keep going up.
</P>
<P>
HACTL now is making efforts to gradually expand its export
services. Anthony Charter anticipated that the company could
handle all projected volume of inbound and outbound cargo by
mid-August, and the SuperTerminal One would resume full operation
by the end of August.

<HEADLINE> China's Position Consistent On WTO, Foreign Trade Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Shi Guangsheng, China's minister
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), in a meeting
with France's Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Louis Le
Pensec here today, said that China takes a consistent position on
entering the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Shi thanked France and the European Union for support in the
matter and said that WTO needs China as much as China needs
WTO. China has made great effort in the last 12 years, but as a
developing country, it could only stick to a principle of balanced
rights and responsibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacle to China's entering WTO is certain member
countries demanding too high a price for China to pay in its
current economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
They should have a practical attitute and bring the price down
to a reasonable level, if they really want China in WTO, Shi said,
adding that he hopes France and the EU can play a more active role
in the matter.
</P>
<P>
Le Pensec said that France would be happy to see China in WTO
as early as possible. Enitem

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Ruling Party Celebrates Election Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Cambodian People's
Party (CPP), an apparent winner in Sunday's election, celebrated
its victory on Wednesday while other parties rejected the election
outcome.
</P>
<P>
The CPP said in a statement that it "views the victory as one
for all the Cambodians who exercised their democratic right in a
heroic spirit."
</P>
<P>
"The people have chosen the party and candidate they like," it
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of people from 14 opposition political
parties gathered in downtown Phnom Penh to protest against alleged
"irregularities" in the election process. A demonstration, due
outside the National Election Committee (NEC), was prevented by a
downpour.
</P>
<P>
The parties, including the FUNCINPEC of deposed First Premier
Prince Norodom Ranariddh and the opposition Sam Rainsy Party, said
they could not accept the election which they deemed as
"undemocratic, unfair and unjust."
</P>
<P>
The CPP statement lauded the International Joint Observer Group
(IJOG) and the NEC for ensuring the success of the "independent,
neutral and unbiased election."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the CPP welcomed the IJOG's "objective
assessment," which termed the election as "free and fair to an
extent that enables it to reflect, in a credible way, the will of
the Cambodian people."
</P>
<P>
The CPP called on all other parties and people to respect the
election outcome, a result of the Cambodians' self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The IJOG, facing criticism of its "incomplete and unjust"
assessment of the election, refused to change its judgement. It
said in a statement issued on Wednesday that "we find no reason to
change those conclusions after the debriefing of our observers."
</P>
<P>
Handling complaints about irregularities during the election
"is a task for the competent Cambodian Authorities and
Institutions", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the IJOG "is prepared to assist the competent Cambodian
authorities and institutions with all relevant information it may
have in relation to serious complaints."
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, incumbent Co-Premier and CPP Vice-President Hun
Sen said he was pleasantly surprised by the seats the CPP won in
the election, a much higher figure than he previously expected,
according to Hun Sen's Bayon Radio.
</P>
<P>
The CPP, which also took part in the vote counting, estimated
that it collected more than half of the seats in the National
Assembly, to be followed by Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC
and the opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP).
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said the CPP was willing to form a coalition with
FUNCINPEC, or the SRP but indicated that he would call for a
change in the constitution if the coalition attempt failed.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's Constitution requires a party to have two-thirds
majority, or 82 seats, in the National Assembly to form a
government. If no single party meet the quorum, a coalition
government will have to be formed, with the largest party naming
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The CPP has named Hun Sen to lead the next government.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Glenys Kinnock, EU special
representative monitoring Cambodia's elections, tried on Wednesday
to avoid using the phrase of "free and fair" to describe the
voting which seemed to be shrouded in controversy.
</P>
<P>
Kinnock carefully assessed the election as "credible and
acceptable by our EU observer teams," at a press conference given
before EU observers began to leave.
</P>
<P>
When asked about whether she considered the election "free and
fair," she said she never used these terms to describe elections
in Cambodia nor anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
"The international community should only state its final
position when the entire election process is completed," she said
in a statement issued at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Referring to accusations about the election, Kinnock said the
government "should ensure that the appropriate authorities
subsequently investigate all accusations of violence especially if
they appear to have been politically motivated."
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged: "Political activists have for instance,
experienced harassment and other pressures. This is completely
unacceptable in any democratic process. Part of our detailed and
stringent analysis should take this evidence very seriously
indeed."
</P>
<P>
Kinnock, however, said that despite problems here and there,
"the election process we have witnessed this week is unprecedented
in the history of Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
She added: "The reality is that the election campaign, and the
polling and counting processes have to be seen in their political
and long-term context."

<HEADLINE> 171 Killed in Flood in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 171 people have been killed in
flood in Bangladesh so far with 31 more deaths reported during the
last 24 hours, officials said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of people affected by flood has risen to about 17
million in 37 of the country's 64 districts as of Wednesday, with
179,000 houses and 259,000 acres of crops damaged, the officials
told a press briefing Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The overall flood situation is still serious in Bangladesh,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 37 affected districts, the situation is deteriorating in
14, has improved in 10, and remains unchanged in five districts.
The situation has become normal in the rest eight districts.
</P>
<P>

distributed 9.325 million taka in cash (about 198,000 U.S.
dollars) and 4912.75 tons of rice and wheat among the flood-hit
people.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Wins Symbolic Victory over Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel's opposition won the
preliminary approval Wednesday of a bill to dissolve the Knesset
(parliament), dealing a moral blow to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The bill was endorsed at its preliminary reading with a largest
majority of 60 to six by the lawmakers, one day before their
three-month summer recess.
</P>
<P>
The bill calls for dissolution of the parliament, thus helping
pave the way for early elections. It was jointly tabled by two
Knesset members from the Labor and Meretz.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary voting requires only a simple majority and does
not have any impact on the Netanyahu government. For it to become
legally binding, the bill should go through three more
parliamentary votes.
</P>
<P>
It's final approval would require an absolute majority of 61-59
in the 120-seat parliament, which is seen by many as impossible
because Netanyahu seems to have been gripping an iron-clad narrow
Knesset majority.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu survived three no-confidence motions put forward by
the opposition on Monday. Cornered by inside and outside pressure,
he appears to have weathered the storm and is in a safe position
at least in two months - before the parliament reconvenes in
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's large majority was certain even before the voting
began, because leaders of Netanyahu's coalition decided Tuesday
night decided to boycott the vote.
</P>
<P>
Several coalition members, however, did go to the Knesset and
voted in favor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Netanyahu dismissed the bill as "an empty ploy" and
said if passed it would be "no more than a propaganda achievement"
for the opposition and would not affect his government's stability.
</P>
<P>
"It's not very important,"he said, "for the first, second and
third reading, a majority of 61 MK (Members of the Knesset) will
be required."
</P>
<P>
"If the opposition had such a majority, it could topple the
Knesset every day. But it doesn't," he said.

<P>
Shi also said that market opening in international trade should
be two-way. When one nation asks others to open their markets, it
should open its own first.
</P>
<P>
France is an important member of the European Union, he said,
and an important trading partner of China's and China places great
importance on trade and economic cooperations with France in all
fields.
</P>
<P>
Commercial ties between China and France have grown in recent
years, he said, both in trade and investment. Trade volume with
the EU was worth 21.5 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of
this year, up 17.5 percent over the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
By the ended of June, there had been 8,806 projects with EU
investment in China, worth 34.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there are still some disagreements in
bilateral trade, mainly resulting from EU limits on imports from
China. The EU stopped imports of Chinese poultry meat and
shellfish, using quarantine laws as an excuse, and blamed China
for dumping goods.
</P>
<P>
These acts represent trade protectionism, which is against the
principle of open markets, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
The French minister expressed a willingness to increase trade
cooperation with China in agriculture and to contribute to
promoting economic ties between China and Europe.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India Agree to Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 29 (Xinhua) - Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif and his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee met here
Wednesday on the sidelines of a summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and they agreed to
resume dialogue between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee told a press conference later that he and Sharif had a
"good meeting" and had a wide-range discussion on many issues of
mutual interest. But he refused to give details.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement read at the press conference, Vajpayee
said they had instructed the two countries' foreign secretaries to
meet on Wednesday and Thursday to work out the modalities for the
resumption of the talks between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We recognized the importance of building mutual trust and
confidence and of establishing stable and friendly ties," he said.
 "There are vast opportunities of cooperation which would benefit
the peoples of both countries."
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and I have agreed that the
dialogue process should be resumed," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how was the atmosphere at their talks which
lasted more than one hour. But Vajpayee just answered a few
questions before he left.
</P>
<P>
Sharif told a separate press conference that they had "frank
and candid" talks. "We have decided to continue the dialogue at
the next available opportunity."
</P>
<P>
"Kashmir is the sole cause of tension and the core issue which
must be addressed meaningfully with a view to reaching a final
settlement," Sharif stressed.
</P>
<P>
It was the first face-to-face meeting between leaders of
Pakistan and India since the two countries conducted nuclear tests
in May this year.
</P>
<P>
India detonated five nuclear devices on May 11 and 13 and
Pakistan conducted six nuclear tests in a tit-for-tat manner on
may 28 and 30.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India last launched official talks at the foreign
secretary level in 1996 following a three-year freeze. The
negotiations collapsed in September last year, however, over
disagreements over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Kashmir, over which the two countries have fought
two of their three wars since independence from Britain in 1947,
has been the stumbling block in India-Pakistan relations.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif, in his speech at the opening session of the
summit earlier Wednesday, proposed to change the charter of SAARC
by establishing a mechanism to deal with bilateral and political
problems of member countries.
</P>
<P>
"The primary reason for the failure of SAARC to live up to its
promise lies in the fact it excludes the discussion of political
problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
The present SAARC charter does not allow the discussion of
bilateral problems and political issues.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif reiterated in the speech that Pakistan is ready
for the immediate resumption of bilateral talks at the foreign
secretary level on the basis of the understanding reached between
Pakistan and India on June 23, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee, however, played down the tune
of nuclear tests in his speech, describing the apprehensions as
"misplaced" that the nuclear tests could cause a set-back to the
SAARC process.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee reaffirmed that India continues to seek good relations
with all its neighbors, saying differences should be resolved in a
rational manner, peacefully and through bilateral negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We have consistently been in favor of a serious sustained
dialogue," he said.

TOKYO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan earned an Olympic
berth while Australia beat Atlanta Olympic champions the United

Earlier in the day, Atlanta Olympic silver medalists China

Australia, the bronze medallists at Atlanta Olympics, won from

Since the Australians are eligible for the Olympics as the
hosts and are in the medal position in the competition, the top
five finishers of the championships will be able to go to Sydney
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The United States, who have already secured a berth in the
Olympics when they defeated Japan 1-0 Tuesday, still have a chance
to retain the title if they can win their remaining two games in
the final-stage tournament.
</P>

In the day's last game in central Japan, the Japanese team
defeated China 3-0 to keep their medal hopes alive, forcing the
Chinese to settle for fourth place.

conditions on the middle and lower reaches of the river are very
important because the third flood peak is passing through these
areas and creating a very serious flood situation.
</P>
<P>
The government is also concerned about a tropical high pressure
front and is afraid that typhoons may hit China in the latter half
of the year. Jiang asked Wen to keep him informed about the
tropical high pressure system.
</P>
<P>
Wen said that there will be heavy rains in flooded areas in the
coming days, but that there will be fewer typhoons and they will
appear later than usual.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM to Complain About U.S. Farm Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Wednesday said he would complain about U.S. agriculture
subsidies when he meets U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
Thursday in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Albright is expected to arrive in Sydney late Wednesday for
Friday's annual Australia-United States ministerial talks between
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and Australian Minister for
Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer and Defense Minister Ian
McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he would not miss the opportunity to lodge a
protest about U.S. farm subsidies with Albright.
</P>
<P>
"You can speak plainly to your friends," Howard was quoted
Wednesday by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio.
</P>
<P>
"That gives us the right to speak bluntly and plainly when
Australian interests are being hurt."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the United States announced it would buy
2.5 million tons of surplus wheat from its farmers and donate the
wheat to needy countries including Indonesia and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The move was soon denounced by Australian farmers as a cynical
marketing exercise disguised as charity, which would force down
prices and hurt Australian markets.
</P>
<P>
Howard said Australian farmers were the most efficient
producers in the world with the lowest level of export subsidies.

<HEADLINE> Former Japanese PM Agrees to Fill Finance Minister's Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Japanese Prime Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa agreed Wednesday to accept the job as next finance
minister under a new cabinet formed by Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) President Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came during a meeting Wednesday with Obuchi, who
is expected to be installed by the Diet, the Japanese parliament,
as prime minister Thursday afternoon, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old LDP veteran, known for his expertise in
economics, has been reluctant to take the crucial job of tackling
the ailing economy on the grounds of his age.
</P>
<P>
But Obuchi, who was elected LDP leader last Friday, persuaded
Miyazawa that he is the only one who can demonstrate to the
international community the government's determination to lift
Japan, the world's second largest economy, out of the economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
If appointed, Miyazawa will be Japan's first ex-prime minister
to become finance minister since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, 61, is taking over as prime minister from Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who tendered his resignation following the LDP's major
setback in the July 12 House of Councillors election.
</P>
<P>
Stabilization of the country's financial system is widely
regarded as one of the primary tasks for the expected Obuchi
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Miyazawa recently played a major role in helping the government
and the LDP devise the bridge-bank program aimed at taking over
banks deemed too weak to survive.
</P>
<P>
Miyazawa was prime minister between November 1991 and August
1993. He also served in such key cabinet posts as international
trade and industry minister, foreign minister and finance
minister, as well as chief cabinet secretary and Economic Planning
Agency chief.

<HEADLINE> Supplementary Appropriation Bill Adopted in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Legislative
Council adopted the Supplementary Appropriation (1997-1998) Bill
1998 after the third reading at its plenary meeting here Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The bill seeks final legislative authority for the amount of
supplementary provision approved during the year in respect of
particular heads of expenditure by the Finance Committee or under
powers delegated by it.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure accounts for the financial year 1997-1998 have
been finalized by the Director of Accounting Services. The
expenditure charged to 40 heads out of a total of 90 heads is in
excess of the sum originally appropriated for those heads in the
Appropriation Ordinance 1997.
</P>
<P>
The total supplementary appropriation required in respect of
the 40 heads of expenditure is 10,731.9 million HK dollars
(1,375.88 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition, Legislative Council members also approved a motion
on the Import and Export (Registration) (Amendment) Regulation
1998 and a motion on the Appointment of Select Committee to
inquire into the circumstances leading to the problems surrounding
the commencement of the operation of the new Hong Kong
International Airport at Chek Lap Kok since July 6 this year.
</P>
<P>
Chau Tak Hay, secretary for Trade and Industry, said the
purpose of adopting the regulation "is to reduce declaration
charges for imports and domestic exports specified in the Import
and Export (Registration) Regulations under the Import and Export
Ordinance."
</P>
<P>
The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
announced on June 22 a package of measures to facilitate economic
adjustment of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures is to reduce trade declaration charges for
imports of non-food items from 0.035 percent to 0.025 percent of
value and that for domestic exports from 0.05 percent to 0.025
percent of value with effect from August 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The charge on food imports will continue to be kept at the flat
rate of 13 HK dollars (1.66 U.S. dollars) per declaration.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, about 20 questions raised by Legislative
Council members were answered by government officials in an oral or
a written form.
</P>
<P>
These questions cover a wide range of subjects such as lending
policies of banks, measures to prevent young people from browsing
pornographic webpages on the Internet and cross-boundary
infrastructure projects between Hong Kong and the Chinese
mainland.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Tracks Progress of Air Cargo Handling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's top leader Tung Chee
Hwa Wednesday inspected on site the progress made by the Hong Kong
Air Cargo Terminals LTD (HACTL) to fully resume its air cargo
handling capacity at the Chek Lap Kok new airport.
</P>
<P>
It was his second tour to Super Terminal One, Hong Kong's top
air cargo handling facility operated by HACTL, in less than ten
days.
</P>
<P>
Tung, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), Wednesday listened to a briefing by Anthony Charter,
managing director of the HACTL, on the latest situation at
SuperTerminal One, which now is able to handle 70 percent of its
projected tonnage.
</P>
<P>
SuperTerminal One, which handles 80 percent of the total air
cargo volume in Hong Kong, broke down when the new airport was
opened for commercial aviation in early July. The franchisee HACTL
has planned to gear up the throughput at the terminal step by step
till it runs in full strength in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Hong Kong can handle about 80 percent of the
normal daily average volume of air cargo. "We are improving
steadily," said Tung, who stressed that the efficient handling of
air cargo was vital to many small and medium-sized local
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Tung said: "I have confidence that with the joint efforts and
cooperation of the Government and the air cargo industry, we are
on the way to a full recovery of air cargo handling in the very
near future."
</P>
<P>
He pledged to render necessary assistance to the industry to
facilitate a smooth recovery.
</P>
<P>
Before making the inspection at SuperTerminal One, Tung visited
the Air Traffic Control Tower, which, among the busiest in the
region, directs the operation of 450 aircraft in and out of the
new Hong Kong International Airport every day.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive Wednesday also officiated at the opening
ceremony of the headquarters of the Government Flying Service at
the new airport.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Industries to Continue Slump Next Semester </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korean industries are expected
to experience another sales slump in the second half of this year
since markets show few signs of improving at home or abroad, the
Samsung Economic Research Institute said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report to forecast industrial sales for the second half of
1998, the institute said domestic consumer spending will shrink
further due to reduced household income and mounting concerns over
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
As a result, sluggish consumer demand is unlikely to change in
the near future though the government has taken measures to boost
the economy, including the reduction of the special excise tax on
durable goods and expanded investment in construction, it said.
</P>
<P>
Despite a reduction in chip production among major chipmakers,
the semiconductor industry is expected to continue suffering from
falling chip prices in the second six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
"The supply glut in the world's chip market is unlikely to ease
by the end of this year," the Samsung thinktank said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said exports will also suffer from a
setback due largely to weakened price competitiveness that has
arisen from the soaring Korean won and weak Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of expanding exports, industries will try to defend
their corporate profitability, which is also worsening quickly,"
the institute continued.
</P>
<P>
Hit hardest by the economic crisis will be the auto industry,
which sold 349,000 cars during the first half of the year, down 50
percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that a slump in domestic demand for
automobiles will go on in the coming months of the year because of
oil price hikes and drops in household earnings.
</P>
<P>
However, it predicted that auto exports will increase 8.7
percent based on automakers' aggressive export drive and the
launch of new models.
</P>
<P>
A continued slump is also expected in industries such as steel,
petrochemicals and textiles, said the institute.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Calls for Speeding Up Free Trade Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Wednesday called for efforts to speed up the process
of creating a free trade zone in South Asia by extending tariff
concessions and removing discriminatory practices and non-tariff
barriers.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the opening of a summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) here, she said the
grouping's goal of establishing such a free trade zone could not
be achieved on schedule unless real progress is made at a new
round of trade negotiations among member states.
</P>
<P>
She said that at the current summit, the leaders of the seven
member countries should make an assessment of what has been
achieved in the process of the SAARC Preferential Trading
Arrangement (SAPTA), created in 1995 as a first step towards
forming the projected free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
SAARC leaders have decided to create a South Asian Free Trade
Area (SAFTA) by the year 2001. Under SAPTA, member countries
exchange tariff concessions in more than 2,000 items.
</P>
<P>
Tariff concessions should be extended to products which are
actively traded, and discriminatory practices, structural
impediments and non-tariff barriers should be removed, Kumaratunga
said.
</P>
<P>
"The success of tariff negotiations depends very much on how
equitable this cooperative process can be made," she said. "A free
trade area would surely recede further into the future unless real
progress can be achieved in the next round of SAPTA negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said in his speech
to the opening of the summit that there should be no delays in the
SAARC process, including the goal of creating SAFTA by 2001.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that India had offered the maximum concessions in
the first two rounds of trade negotiations and also offered the
deepest tariff cuts with special concessions for the poorer SAARC
members.
</P>
<P>
The third round of SAPTA negotiations began in July last year
and has yet to be completed. India has promised to offer deep
tariff cuts at the talks.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee also announced that India will lift Quantitative
Restrictions on a preferential basis for member countries with
effect from August 1 this year. That would involve lifting
restrictions on more than 2,000 products and help promote access
for other SAARC members to Indian markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed that SAARC members begin immediate
negotiations on a separate SAFTA treaty which will spell out in
detail the schedules for freeing trade and should be in place by
2001.
</P>
<P>
"Our vision should be to look beyond SAFTA to the evolution of
a SAARC Economic Community early in the next century," he added.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in his
speech just touched upon the process of regional trade and
economic cooperation and dwelled on the worsening security
situation in the aftermath of nuclear test carried out by India
and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
India conducted nuclear tests in mid-May this year and Pakistan
carried out tit-for-tat ones late that month, prompting fears of a
nuclear arms race in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
World attention is being focused on a bilateral meeting between
the prime ministers of Pakistan and India scheduled for Wednesday
on the sidelines of the SAARC summit in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The leaders from the four other SAARC member countries who are
attending the three-day summit are Girija Prasad Koirala, Nepali
prime minister and minister of foreign and defense, Bangladeshi
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Maldivian President Maumoon Abdul
Gayoom, and Jigme Thinley, chairman of Bhutan's new council of
ministers and the head of government.
</P>
<P>
"It is equally vital that domestic content requirements under
rules of origin be substantially reduced to promote equitable
economic exchanges and productive joint ventures," Kumaratunga
said in her address.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan president urged member countries to show
flexibility so as to correct the imbalance in regional trade.
</P>
<P>
Trade restrictions can no longer protect domestic economies
from external competition, she said, adding that the SAPTA process
is not a one-way flow and concessions should be reciprocated.
</P>
<P>
She also called for negotiations on an "appropriate legal
instrument or treaty" for SAFTA "with a view to its signature and
ratification by the year 2001."
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga also drew attention to the impact of globalization
on SAARC, saying that economic liberalization, the free currency
movement, technological advances and other manifestations of
globalization provide both opportunities and obstacles to South
Asian development.
</P>
<P>
"The cautious, tentative attitude to external linkages which
characterized SAARC in its early years is neither necessary nor
viable," she said. SAARC was formed in 1985 with its main
objective being to accelerate economic growth and social
development in member states.
</P>
<P>
She said rapid collective responses from SAARC are needed to
tackle the full gamut of political, economic and social impacts in
the wake of the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
She also said regional cooperation does not preclude individual
SAARC member states from forging mutually beneficial relations
with other regional groupings.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Archaeologists Find Descendants Of Ancient Romans (1) by Yu Zheng and Song Zhenghou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists recently
came across some people they believe are descended from ancient
Romans in a desolate village in Gansu Province in the northwestern
part of China.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists were doing excavation work in the village of
Zhelaizhai and think they may have discovered defense works built
by the Roman army some 2,000 years ago. They also found people in
the village whose physical characteristics are similar to people
in Mediterranean countries.
</P>
<P>
Song Guorong, a 39-year-old villager, is 1.82 meters tall,
something that is not common in rural China, and says, "My father
told me that our ancestors migrated from the far West. He himself
had brown hair and blue eyes, just like the Europeans I've seen in
pictorials."
</P>
<P>
Anthropologists say that physical characteristics like these
could be kept for as long as 2,000 years, and that they could be
related to Europeans.
</P>
<P>
There are historical records of more than 45,000 Roman soldiers
engaged in a battle in Central Asia in 53 B.C. who were defeated
by Asians. But, about 6,000 soldiers who survived, went missing
after the fierce battle.
</P>
<P>
The Han Dynastic records tell of a military group defending the
frontiers that encountered a peculiar army that used Roman
military tactics. The alien soldiers surrendered to the Han
Dynasty and later settled in a village with the name of Liqian.

<P>
Zhong Sengzu, a cultural relics expert, says that one historian
found a cloth map made in 9 B.C. with the characters "liqian",
near today's Yongchang County, which is near the village of
Zhelaizhai. The archaeologists unearthed pottery and a skeleton
and a lock of brown hair that date back at least 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Villagers found a bronze medal with the characters "zhao'an",
indicating that the Chinese emperor had offered amnesty for
surrendering enemy soldiers. The bronze medal might have come from
a Roman soldier's helmet.
</P>
<P>
Song says that in the 1970s the wall around the village was
still 100 meters long and 3 stories high and very wide at the
top. Villagers had found a handcart with bronze coins in a
destroyed part of the wall.
</P>
<P>
Most villagers never left the tiny county, but have some
traditions shared with foreigners who live thousands of miles
away. Every spring, they make sacrificial offerings shaped like an
ox head. They also mimic oxen fighting with each other, a custom
that can clearly be traced back to the ancient Romans.
</P>
<P>
They also build special tombs for the dead that face west.
</P>
<P>
The county holds special appeal to many scholars, so local
authorities have built a hotel with certain Roman architectural
features, a Roman Shopping Mall and a giant stone sculpture
depicting the town's history.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Rated Most Popular Venue for Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has been rated as one
of the world's most popular cities to host international
meetings, the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) Wednesday
quoted a report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report, conducted by the International Congress and
Convention Association (ICCA), showed that in 1997, Hong Kong
ranked fifth in a list of metropolitans under the "number of
international meetings per city" category.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong also won the second place, after Sydney, in the
Asia-Pacific region in terms of "market share", taking 7.2 percent
of the total number of international meetings held in this part of
the world, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA said in a press release Wednesday: "More than 100
international conventions have been confirmed to take place in
Hong Kong from July 1998 and beyond, with an estimated attendance
of some 100,000 delegates."
</P>
<P>
The conference and incentive travel sector continues to play an
important role in Hong Kong's tourism industry. Figures from the
HKTA showed that visitors attending conferences tend to stay
longer and spend more than general visitors do.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Indian Prime Ministers Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colombo, July 29 (Xinhua) - Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif and his Indian counterpart Atal Behari Vajpayee met here
Wednesday on the sidelines of the 10th summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee told reporters that they had a "good" meeting and had
a wide-range discussion of mutual interest. But he refused to give
details.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan
will meet Wednesday or Thursday to work out the modalities for the
resumption of talks between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It is their first face-to-face meeting since the two countries
conducted nuclear tests in May this year.
</P>
<P>
India detonated five nuclear devices on May 11 and 13 and
Pakistan conducted six nuclear tests in a tit-for-tat manner on
may 28 and 30.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India last launched official talks at foreign
secretary level in 1996 following a three-year freeze. The
negotiations collapsed in September last year, however, over
disagreements over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The Kashmir problem, over which the two countries have fought
two of their three wars since independence from Britain in 1947,
has been the stumbling block in India-Pakistan relations.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif, in his speech at the opening session of the
summit earlier Wednesday, proposed to change the charter of SAARC
by establishing a mechanism to deal with bilateral and political
problems of member countries.
</P>
<P>
"The primary reason for the failure of SAARC to live up to its
promise lies in the fact it excludes the discussion of political
problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
The present SAARC charter does not allow the discussion of
bilateral problems and political issues.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif reiterated in the speech that Pakistan is ready
for the immediate resumption of bilateral talks at the foreign
secretary level on the basis of the understanding reached between
Pakistan and India on June 23, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee, however, played down the tune
of nuclear tests in his speech, describing the apprehensions as
"misplaced" that the nuclear tests could cause a set-back to the
SAARC process.

<HEADLINE> Premier League Ultimatum on "Super League" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Premier League has demanded
assurance from its leading clubs that they have no intention of
participating in a proposed European Super League.
</P>
<P>
Champions Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool are reported
to have been given a 5pm (4pm Greenwich Time) deadline to provide a
written undertaking that they will not take part in any breakaway
-- or face the consequences of possible legal action.
</P>
<P>
The three clubs are most likely to be approached by any new
European league but United last week denied any involvement. "We
are getting a little fed up with speculation linking us with a
Super League," United secretary Ken Ramsden said.
</P>
<P>
Although the Premier League has no immediate fears about an
exodus, it issued a statement on Wednesday clarifying its position.
</P>
<P>
"Our clubs have read a lot about the Super League, much of
which is speculation," the statement said. "While we believe the
present structure is working well, it is only sensible that we, as
other leagues and UEFA are doing, clarify what, if any, proposals
exist concerning a Super League."
</P>
<P>
Last week UEFA said it was aware of the Super League
discussions and that it was prepared to make more changes to its
competitions in order to satisfy the clubs and ensure the survival
of the Champions' League.
</P>
<P>
Leading Spanish and Italian clubs are believed to be at the
center of the breakaway talks but none have confirmed that they
have been involved in discussions.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the 14 Southern
African Development Community (SADC) states Wednesday ended a
three-day meeting on regenerating wealth for the region in
Swakopmund, Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Topics on the agenda of the second Southern African
International Dialog ranged from privatization and civil service
reform to globalization and business ethics, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma, in his parting words, said that
the meeting had presented an excellent and timely opportunity for
all to "sharpen our ideas of using smart partnerships to generate
wealth."
</P>
<P>
"During these dialogs and forums, we verified concrete
examples of smart partnerships, both within each country and
across countries as governments and business tackled the
challenges of liberalization and privatization sweeping across
the global markets," said Nujoma.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by, among others, Swaziland's King
Mswati III, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe,
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
Botswanan President Festus Mogae left the west coastal town of
Swakopmund for Namibia's capital, Windhoek, to begin a three-day
state visit there.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said that the issue of the disputed Kasikili Island
(also called Sedudu in Botswana) on the border with Namibia would
not be discussed with the Namibian government as the dispute was
now put before the international court in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
The case will be heard early next year.
</P>
<P>
The two countries were also locked in a dispute over the
ownership of Situngu, another island on the border river.

<HEADLINE> EU Chief Observer Cautious on Describing Cambodia's Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Glenys Kinnock, European Union
(EU) special representative monitoring Cambodia's election, is
trying to avoid using "free and fair" to describe the voting which
seems to be shrouded in a dispute.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference given Wednesday before the EU observers'
departure, Kinnock gave a carefully worded explanation of the
election as "credible and acceptable."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether she considered the election "free and fair,"
she said she has never used such terms to describe elections in
either Cambodia or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"The international community should only make its final
position known when the entire election process is completed," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of people from 14 political parties
gathered in downtown Phnom Penh to protest against alleged
"irregularities" during the election process.
</P>
<P>
A demonstration was said to be due later Wednesday outside the
headquarters of the National Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
The parties, including Funcinpec of deposed First Premier
Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy Party, said they could not accept
the election, which they deemed "undemocratic, unfair and unjust."
</P>
<P>
Partial results showed that incumbent Co-Premier Hun Sen, whose
ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) was leading in the polls,
appears set to be Cambodia's next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Referring to disclaimers about the election, Kinnock said the
government "should ensure that the appropriate authorities
subsequently investigate all accusations of violence, especially
if they appear to have been politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
"Political activists have, for instance, experienced harassment
and other pressures. This is completely unacceptable in any
democratic process. Part of our detailed and stringent analysis
should take this evidence very seriously indeed," she added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the Joint International Observer Group (JIOG)
said the election was "free and fair to an extent that enables it
to reflect, in a credible way, the will of the Cambodian people."
</P>
<P>
Despite problems here and there, "The election process we have
witnessed this week is unprecedented in the history of Cambodia,"
Kinnock said.
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that the election campaign, and the polling and
counting processes, have to be seen in their political and
long-term context," she stressed.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Punish Errant Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
Wednesday vowed to continue penalizing journalists for their
irresponsible behavior and for taking bribes from companies and
advertisers, a common practice that has been ignored.
</P>
<P>
Culture and Tourism Minister Shin Nak-yun said the ministry, in
cooperation with government prosecutors, has uncovered 70 cases of
illegal practices by journalists as of May.
</P>
<P>
"The abuse of journalistic power has had serious repercussions
in our society. The government will make all efforts to eliminate
such practices," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The investigation has resulted in the arrest of 43 journalists,
most of them working in provincial towns. They allegedly extorted
cash from companies and government agencies in return for
remaining silent on irregularities or abuses.
</P>
<P>
Apart from prosecution, the government has also decided to
revoke press licenses for journalists that do not meet a set
criteria.
</P>
<P>
Shin said the announcement on chastising journalists is not in
any way an attempt to gag the press the way South Korea's former
military governments did.

PARIS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The French government said on
Wednesday it wanted this year's Tour de France to continue to the
end despite an unprecedented doping scandal which has overshadowed
the event.
</P>
<P>
"The Tour must continue until the end (on Sunday) in the best

reporters and urged the public to place their trust in justice,
clearly replying to calls in some French newspapers for the Tour
to be called off as a result of the scandals.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, police raided the hotel of the Dutch TVM team in
Albertville and took away four riders and a team official for
questioning and medical checks, following a raid on their hotel
last week in which the director of the TVM outfit, Cees Priem and
team doctor, Alexandrei Mikhailov were placed under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, customs officers stopped a lorry belonging to the
Bi Mat Auber team near Albertville on Tuesday and seized what was
described by the town's deputy prosecutor as a "small quantity of
medication".
</P>
<P>
The director of the expelled Festina team, Bruno Roussel,
after confessing that team managers and medical staff made doping
substances available to riders, was released from jail on

CANBERRA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia announced here
Wednesday it would provide up to 11 million Australian dollars
(6.7 million U.S. dollars) to build a hospital and upgrade health
facilities on Fiji's Tavenui island.
</P>
<P>
Kathy Sullivan, parliamentary secretary to Australian Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer, said the project was designed both to
reduce the incidence and prevalence of diseases which contribute
to high rates of morbidity and mortality, and to improve the
self-reliance and social welfare of the community.
</P>
<P>
"As part of the project, Australia will construct and fit out a
new 22-bed hospital, convert the existing hospital into a public
health and outreach center, and upgrade rural nursing stations,
health centers and staff housing on the isolated island," Sullivan
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said although health standards in Fiji were good
compared to many other developing nations, isolated areas such as
Tavenui suffered from poor sanitation and inadequate water, power
and communications.
</P>
<P>
"On Tavenui, the population of approximately 14,000 is burdened
by communicable and non-communicable disease, and the average age
of death is 52," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Faced with such challenges, there is a clear need for the
development of health services in an integrated manner, combining
community health education and awareness with improved
infrastructure."

<HEADLINE> Former President: Iran's Missile Serves Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran's former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani said Wednesday that Iran's missile technology is solely
for defense purposes and independently developed by Iranian
experts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the official news agency IRNA, Rafsanjani said
that in practice, Iran has proved that its objectives are
peaceful and the missiles only serve defense purposes.
</P>
<P>
Iran's missile technology is developed by local experts and "at
present we feel no need to use expertise of others," the former
president said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said the repeated Iraqi missile attacks on Iranian
cities in 1980-1988 Iranian-Iraqi war promoted the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps to design the missiles.
</P>
<P>
The world should take Iran seriously when it comes to industry,
technology and designing of the missile, stressed Rafsanjani, who
is currently chairman of the State Expediency Council (SEC).
</P>
<P>
The SEC is a powerful body to arbitrate among the three
branches of the government and to offer advice on the country's
general policies to the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Iran successfully testfired a Shahab-3, or
Meteor-3 missile with a medium range of 1,300 kilometers, which
meant Iran can target Israel, Saudi Arabia, an ally of the U.S.,
and the U.S. forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
The missile test rekindled concerns of its neighbors and the
western countries about Tehran's ambitions and capability in
missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iran has long been considered by the U.S. a sponsor of world
terrorism, and Israel regards Tehran as its arch-enemy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has also been accusing Russia of helping Iran develop
missiles and warned to punish seven Russian companies for
allegedly transferring missile technology to Iran.

PARIS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch TVM cycling team will
continue race in the Tour de France though their cyclists are
exhausted both mentally and physically.
</P>
<P>
Cyclists will ride in Wednesday's 17th stage of the Tour to
start in Albertville, France.
</P>
<P>
The racers were tested for illegal substances on Tuesday and

morning, the day after the tour ends.
</P>
<P>
Two top team officials, sporting director Cees Priem and team
doctor Andrei Mikhailov, were under formal investigation for
allegedly systematic doping of EPO, a performance enhancing drug.
</P>
<P>
The doping issue firstly was exposed under the spotlight when
that EPO was found in the car of the one of their officials in
March.
</P>
<P>
Police then found evidence of used drugs in a suitcase and
trash can during a search of the team's hotel in Toulouse and

<HEADLINE> No Serious Epidemics Reported in Flooded Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- No serious epidemics have been
reported in flooded areas of central and east China, an official
with the Ministry of Health said here today.
</P>
<P>
"To control possible outbreaks of infectious diseases, about
100,000 doctors and experts have been sent to the flood-stricken
areas," said Li Jianguo, an official with the ministry's
Department of Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also allocated 7.5 million yuan (about 900,000
U.S. dollars) in special funds for disease prevention among flood
victims.
</P>
<P>
Li acknowledged that exceptionally serious flooding this year
has increased the risk of epidemics of cholera, malaria, diarrhea
and hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
An emergency circular was released by the Health Ministry today
calling on provincial health departments to prepare drugs and
medical facilities to combat possible outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
The circular also requires the strengthening of surveillance
and reporting of the medical situation, especially intestinal
infectious diseases. The inundated areas must stand alert for the
outbreak of epidemics in the wake of the floods, and organize
adequate sterilization work.
</P>
<P>
Supervision of drinking water and food must be enhanced, said
the circular, and health departments at disaster-stricken areas
must help local residents improve their capacity for
self-protection.
</P>
<P>
Flood-stricken areas like Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui
Provinces all have medical teams taking part in this work.
</P>
<P>
Because the water levels in flooded areas have not yet dropped,
and there are certain incubation periods involved in the spread of
epidemics, the task of disease prevention will be even tougher, Li
said.

The Official Receiver, Robin Hearder, said here Wednesday that
among the insolvency cases, there were 326 compulsory company
liquidations and 365 personal bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the current economic downturn for the rise in
insolvency cases, which were caused mainly by cash flow problems
and decline in business.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the bankrupt companies were engaged in restaurant
and canteens, garment and knitting manufacturing, construction and
engineering, and import and export businesses.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the number of winding-up and bankruptcy
orders made by the court in June this year alone was 161 as
compared to the average monthly figure of 106 from January to May.
</P>
<P>
The number of companies that went bankrupt in the first half of
 1998 accounted for less than 0.77 percent of the total number of
incorporated companies.
</P>
<P>
During the same period of 1997, there were 601 court
insolvencies, including 280 compulsory company liquidations and
321 personal bankruptcies.

CAIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The official Jordan Export Development and Commercial
Centers Corporation (JEDCO) announced here late Tuesday evening
that it is making arrangements for Jordan's participation in four
international trade fairs in the coming three months.
</P>
<P>
The trade fairs are in Kenya, Germany, Bosnia and Lebanon,
Basher Khasawneh, a senior JEDCO official, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The participation is aimed at promoting the sales of Jordanian
goods in markets abroad and to help Jordanian exporters to learn
about the needs of foreign markets, he added.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan plans to construct a waste management project
in Ruseifeh, the site of a major garbage dump, to generate
electricity by exploiting methane gas released during waste
emission, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 5.7 million U.S. dollars worth of project near Amman is
also aimed at turning solid waste into fertilizers for
agricultural purposes, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The project is co-sponsored by the Jordan Bio-gas Company and a
private Danish company, it added.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- The government of Dubai has given the green light to
the Emirate's civil aviation department to establish a permanent
center for the biannual Dubai exhibition, which is considered one
of the world's biggest three exhibitions for aviation and outer
space industries.
</P>
<P>
The civil aviation department of the Dubai Emirate said the
projected new center will have two air conditioned halls,
providing a 25,000 square-kilometer-space for the exhibits as well
as numerous utilities to serve the exhibitors, including stands,
offices, information desks and otherwise, Wednesday's Arab daily
"Al Hayat" said.
</P>
<P>
It is due to be completed by September 1999 within the
perimeter of the Dubai international airport. It will host the
"Dubai 2000" for aviation to be organized by the end of the year.

RIYADH -- The volume of domestic consumption of tea in Saudi
Arabia has gone up to 9,346 tonnes a year, whereas, investments in
tea blending and packing have reached some 182 billion Saudi rials
(48.5 billion dollars) with a total production capacity of over
22,000 tonnes a year.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, according to Wednesday's "Alam Al Yom" newspaper,
imports all of its tea as it grows no tea trees.
</P>
<P>
Tea industry in Saudi Arabia is restricted to blending and
packing to maintain high standards of flavor and excellence.
</P>
<P>
The average per capita consumption of tea in Saudi Arabia
stands at approximately one kilogram per capita per year.

<HEADLINE> OIC Calls for Tough Stance Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) Wednesday called on the
Muslim world to take a tough stand against Israel's attempt to
judaize Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ezzidine Laraki made the appeal in an telephone interview with
the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs radio Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Laraki is in Casablanca, Morocco to attend the 17th session of
the OIC's Jerusalem Committee, which is to open later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Terming as "null and void" all Israel's steps to judaize
Jerusalem, Laraki said contacts are under way with various parts
to stop those hostile practices.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem issue will be given top priority at the upcoming
meetings, he said, adding that "I hope the committee will adopt
firm stances against Israel when Israel has diverted the course of
the Mideast peace march to the opposite direction via its policies
aiming at Judaizing this holy city and capturing Arab lands."
</P>
<P>
Israel approved a plan on June 21 to extend Jerusalem municipal
authority to eight settlements in the West Bank, a move that is
banned in signed peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, the fate of the holy city should
be negotiated in the Palestinian-Israeli final status
talks. Before that neither side should change the city's status,
geographic composition and other characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want the Arab East Jerusalem as its future
capital while Israel considers the whole Jerusalem as its
undivided and eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem issue has been one of the thorniest points in
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, which have been deadlocked for
over 16 months due to Israel's high-handed policy in Jewish
settlements expansion in East Jerusalem and Israeli troops
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Laraki accentuated the need to convince the U.S. public opinion
and the European Union of the gravity of Israel's behavior and its
adverse impact on peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
At its last convention in 1997, the Jerusalem Committee
confirmed its support and commitment to the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
It also maintained that Jerusalem is an integral part of the
occupied Palestinian land which was seized by Israel in 1967
Middle East War.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Army Chief Blames Israel for Stalled Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The newly appointed Chief of
Staff of the Syrian Armed Forces Ali Aslan has held Israeli
government responsible for the stalemate in the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Aslan made the remarks in an article published in
Wednesday's Al-Baath daily on the occasion of the Army Day on
August 1.
</P>
<P>
Aslan said the "racist, expansionist and arrogant" Israeli
policy has reached its climax under the extremist (Benjamin)
Netanyahu administration.
</P>
<P>
Aslan noted that the Israeli government has rejected the basics
of just peace, the land-for-peace principle and all international
efforts to advance the peace process, almost driving the peace
march to "a dead end."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the leaders of Israel will be mistaken if
they believe that resorting to force, aggression and occupation of
land will achieve security and peace to them.
</P>
<P>
They'd better not ignore that the peace upheld by Syria and the
international community is one based on a just and comprehensive
approach, safeguarding the rights, security and stability of all,
Aslan said.
</P>
<P>
He further called for a unified Arab stance to confront
Israel's intransigence while urging the Arab countries to exert
efforts in persuading the U.S. to cease its blind bias for Israel,
making Washington be aware that its interests in the region will
be under threat should it continue pursuing biased policy.
</P>
<P>
Aslan, a close ally to Syrian President Hafez Assad, replaced
Gen. Hikmat Al-Shihabi in a major army reshuffle earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks which started in 1992 have been
stalled since 1996 over Israel's refusal to withdraw from the
strategic Golan Heights which Israel captured from Syria in the
1967 Middle East War.

and sponsors on Monday, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
But Becker and his former manager Ion Tiriac denied the
accusations since they were first reported in February last year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Officials Play Heroic Role in Flood Control Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hubei Provincial Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) today decided to posthumously
admit Peng Zhilong into CPC membership, and launched a mass
campaign to study his heroic deeds in flood control fight.
</P>
<P>
Peng served as secretary of the Communist Youth League in Daye
City, Hubei Province, before he was killed while dashing ahead to
rescue stranded people, heedless of his own safety, as very heavy
rains hit the city on July 21.
</P>
<P>
He had saved more than 30 people before he was finally washed
away by the floods. Two days later his body was found 15
kilometers downstream.
</P>
<P>
Wu Tianxiang, deputy head of Wuchang District in this capital
city of central China's Hubei Province, was one of the busiest
men fighting against the summer flooding for the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
He patrolled along the Yangtze River dikes for more than four
hours and organized local people in draining water from Meiyuan
District on Monday night. Soon after Wu returned to his office at
the district government office yesterday morning, he set off to
the flooded areas again.
</P>
<P>
Since Wuhan began being hit by torrential rains in mid-July, Wu
has been busy saving local residents from the flood waters,
sending rice and vegetables to those who were stranded, and
inspecting the river dikes daily.
</P>
<P>
A torrential downpour hit at 5:00 am on July 21, as water
inundated 30 households in Zijin Village to a height of over one
meter. Wu rushed to the village and saved 11 villagers from the
waters. Afterwards, Wu suffered from a high fever and
enterogastritis.

BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- By 2:00 pm today, the water level
at the Hankou Hydrological Station, in Wuhan city of central
China, has risen to 29.02 meters, only 0.71 meters lower than the
record high set in 1954.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the Yangtze River downstream from Wuhan and
at Poyang Lake is still rising at a slow rate, according to
reports released by the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters (SFCDRH).
</P>
<P>
Jiujiang Hydrological Station near Poyang Lake recorded a water
level of 22.88 meters today, 0.68 meters above the previous
all-time high. The water level at the Hukou Hydrological Station
climbed to 22.45 meters, 0.65 meters higher than the old record
height.
</P>
<P>
Though the Yangtze River dikes have so far been saved from
breaches thanks to the concerted efforts of all provinces along
the river, the situation is still grave as the embankments have
been weakened by days of water-logging, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In northeast China, the water level at Nenjiang River continues
to rise, with the height at Jiangqiao Hydrological Station up to
141.16 meters, 0.4 meters above the former record level. Local

<P>
SHENZHEN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Two generating units at the Daya
Bay nuclear power station near Shenzhen City in south China's
Guangdong Province generated and sent into local power grids
50 billion kw/hours of electricity in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
By July 8, the nuclear power station had repaid 2.86 billion
U.S. dollars in loans, which exceeded 50 percent of the station's
total debts.
</P>
<P>
Production indexes for the Daya Bay nuclear power station for
the first half of this year showed the station has been operating
well, with many categories having met international standards.
</P>
<P>
No nuclear or industrial accidents have occurred in reactor
workshops of the two generating units. And the discharge volume of
waste radioactive gas and liquids is far below the state-set
limits, while the volume of solid waste material produced is also
lower than designated level.
</P>
<P>
The station has also been up to international advanced
standards in radiation prevention and has been named by Shenzhen
City as a base for environmental education.
</P>
<P>
In another development, construction of the Ling'ao Nuclear
Power Station, also in Guangdong, has been progressing smoothly as
planned since building began on May 15 last year.
</P>
<P>
Pre-stage projects for the Ling'ao nuclear power station, such as
ground leveling, a reservoir, and tunnels and water diversion
facilities, have all been completed.
</P>
<P>
The first and second generating units at the Ling'ao station
will start commercial operations in 2002 and March of 2003,

<HEADLINE> China Produces First HTS Electric Cable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China has succeeded in producing
the first Bi-based high temperature superconducting (HTS) power
transmission cable, epitomizing that the country has became one of
the few countries with advanced superconducting technology.
</P>
<P>
The superconducting current of the cable reaches 1,200 amperes
and its contact resistance is 0.06 micro-ohms, both of which have
surpassed the designed index, according to the result of an
experiment conducted on July 24.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Based General Research Institute of Non-Ferrous
Metal (GRINM) has provided 132 meters of superconducting tape, or
63 percent of the total superconducting material needed for the
production of the cable, said Yuan Guansen, director of the
superconducting Materials Research Center of the Institute.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the superconducting material was provided by the
Northwest Research Institute of Non-Ferrous Metal; and the
Institute of Electrical Engineering under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences was responsible for the cable design, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the successful production of the Bi-based HTS
cable will promote application of superconducting material in
China.
</P>
<P>
High temperature superconducting material is material which has
no resistance at a temperature of 196 degrees Celsius below zero.
It costs less and can be more easily produced than low temperature
superconducting material, which has no resistance only at a
temperature of 269 degrees Celsius below zero.
</P>
<P>
Major world projects for HTS mostly focus on electric cables
and magnetic levitation devices.
</P>
<P>
Bi-based HTS material is the most popular material for HTS
cable production because of its superior qualities, such as better
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
China started HTS studies in late 1986, and has listed the
project of Bi-based HTS cable as one of the state key hi-tech
projects for the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
GRINM is planning to produce a six-meter Bi-based HTS cable
with the help of other research organizations, Yuan said.

<HEADLINE> Bank Urged to Highlight Efficiency in Accelerated Loan Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Loan efficiency has become a
priority goal for Chinese banks, although they have been urged to
speed up loan extensions to support national economic growth of
eight percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China (BOC), one of the big-four state commercial
banks, has announced its plans for the second half of the year,
giving high priority to the long-term goal of economic reforms and
efficiency while continuing to fully support the immediate
economic growth goal.
</P>
<P>
Bank of China president Wang Xuebing said the bank will
continue to back the economy actively by increasing loans and
adjusting loan direction during the next six months, focusing on
enterprises showing good profits and repayment records and
stepping up support for the infrastructural and housing sectors,
small enterprises, and foreign trade companies.
</P>
<P>
The bank reported a strong growth of 21.065 billion yuan in
outstanding loans during the January-June period, pushing the
total outstanding amount to 575.19 billion yuan. This figure is
15.32 percent, or 76.397 billion yuan, more than that for the
first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructural sector has received a total of 14.85 billion
yuan and 1.95 billion U.S. dollars, registering a six-month growth
of 4.8 billion yuan and 560 million U.S. dollars in outstanding
loans.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xuebing also said the BOC will also explore new sources
for deposits, and pay attention to the creation of new

<HEADLINE> Chinese Enterprises Win Anti-Dumping Lawsuit in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Three Chinese watermeter exporters
recently won an anti-dumping lawsuit in Brazil, clearing a
year-long dispute over alleged Chinese dumping abuse.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in July last year, leading watermeter manufacturers
in Brazil lodged a joint lawsuit accusing Chinese watermeter
firms, namely the Ningbo Watermeter Plant, the China National
Instruments Import and Export Corp. and the Tianjin Instrument
Group Co., of dumping products in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The accusers have long been annoyed by the expanding market
share obtained by Chinese watermeter exporters. The Ningbo plant,
China's largest watermeter producer and exporter, has acquired 15
percent of the market share in Brazil since it began to export its
products there in 1996. Other Chinese companies hold a combined
five-percent share in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The case was filed for investigation by the administration of
industry and commerce, the foreign trade department and the trade
protection department of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The three Chinese companies responded to the inquiry with a
cooperative attitude. They entrusted the Chinese Chamber of Import
and Export of Electrical Machinery to attend to the case and
engaged a renowned anti-dumping solicitor from Britain.
</P>
<P>
A year of investigation finally proved that the Chinese
companies did not fail to sell their products at a profit. Brazil
announced in June that the Chinese firms are innocent of any
suspicion of dumping.
</P>
<P>
This dispute has helped the Ningbo plant earn a high reputation
in Brazil. Soon after the lawsuit, the plant received an order for
45,000 watermeters from Brazilian firms.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Issue Tough Laws against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will soon issue
a new series of tough anti-gang laws to maintain social security
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Local daily the Citizen Wednesday quoted Justice Minister
Dullah Omar as saying that the Organized Crime Bill was due to be
presented to the full cabinet for endorsement on August 12, to be
approved by parliament before the end of September.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which would make it a crime to participate in a
criminal organization, was expected in the long term to reduce
the crime rate throughout South Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new anti-gang laws would be "the most drastic" passed by
the government since 1994, Omar said on being presented with the
bill by a task team responsible for its drafting.
</P>
<P>
A special Organized Crime Unit of police and prosecutors to
fight gangsterism will be set up under the National Director of
Prosecutions Bulelani Ngcukwa, whose appointment is due to be
confirmed Wednesday by the cabinet in Cape Town, the legislative
capital of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Paul Coffey, former dean of Harvard Law School of the
United States, will spend some time in South Africa later this
year to train the local team of specialists.
</P>
<P>
Coffey will bring to this country 15 years of experience in
prosecuting racketeers in the U.S., an unidentified Justice
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the United Nations Development Agency is also
reportedly contributing to the process.

<HEADLINE> 9 Massacred in South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Nine people, including five
children, were massacred near Richmond, Kwazulu-Natal in east
South Africa on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Police said the attack occurred between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m.
(0700 and 0800 GMT) at Simozomeni when a number of gunmen burst
into the rural house and opened fire on the occupants, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The killed were one man, three women and five children, who
were all related. They were attacked when they were asleep in
separate rooms in the house, SAPA quoted police as saying.
</P>
<P>
Police said the attack was probably carried out by the same
people responsible for previous attacks in the area.
</P>
<P>
The style of attack was similar to other killings in the area,
Kwazulu-Natal Midlands spokesman Henry Budhram was quoted as
saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Budhram said spent cartridges of R4 and R5 rifle were found at
the scene.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the house was in an isolated area and was
difficult to reach, other than by four-wheel drive vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Police said, given the terrain and the danger of entering the
area, they had to use armored vehicles to get to the scene.
</P>
<P>
Budhram said the attack indicated that violence appeared to be
spilling into previously peaceful areas like Simozomeni.
</P>
<P>
"Police were not concentrated on the area because there has
been no violence there since the elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that at least 40 people have been killed in
Richmond area this month as violence resurged.
</P>
<P>
With a strong presence of armed forces and police, the area
was relatively calm last week.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue to Slide in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to slide
on Singapore Stock Market Wednesday as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrial Index (STII) lost 6.16 points to close at 1,053.98.
</P>
<P>
Total volume increased to 175.77 million shares worth 192.56
million Singapore dollars (112.61 million U.S. dollars). Falls
outnumbered rises by 224 to 53 while 311 counters remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Newly-listed PanpacMed was the most active stock as it ended on
a turnover of 55.11 million units. It was followed by Mid-Cont
that had 5.97 million counters done. LeekimTu00 was next with 4.63
million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Creative 50 continued to be the top gainer of the day as it
gained 30 cents to close at 19.80 Singapore dollars. Thai Pr rose
by 18 cents to close at 3.20 U.S. dollars. Bukit Sem was up 10
cents to finish at 7.90 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, DUS was the biggest loser as it lost 60 cents
to close at 1.30 Singapore dollars. DBS F, alongside Delifrance,
KhongGuan, Seaview and Venture w99, shed 30 cents to end at 9.70
U.S. dollars. The other four closed at 0.90, 1.80, 3.50 and 3.00
Singapore dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The slippage indicated that the market gave no positive
response to Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's comments that
Singapore registered a 3.8 percent economic growth in the first
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the first-half figures were largely a
foregone conclusion since the number seemed an average of the
first and the second quarter growth.
</P>
<P>
Dealers also said fears of poor interim corporate earnings
gripped the market after Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
said Singapore "is continuing to decelerate".
</P>
<P>
Players also grappled with continuing weakness in Malaysia's
market and the stream of negative developments surrounding the
country's attempts to kick off a recovery.
</P>
<P>
They said sentiment took a knock following recent downgrades on
Malaysia's credit rating and its possible impact on funding for
economic revival plans.

<HEADLINE> Dissolved Nigerian Party Re-emerges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nigeria Congress Party
(UNCP), one of the five Nigerian political parties dissolved by
the new government of General Abdulsalam Abubakar, has become the
first to transform itself into a new party.
</P>
<P>
The new party, with the name of the United Nigeria Peoples
Party (UNPP), was launched Tuesday night in Nigerian capital
Abuja, according to media report.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was chaired by former foreign minister, retired
Major-General Joe Garba, who said the UNPP would be a
people-oriented and humane party with the slogan of peace and
unity.
</P>
<P>
The meeting elected six zonal leaders of the party.
</P>
<P>
UNCP was registered in 1996 together with four other parties
under the transition to civil rule program of late military
leader General Sani Abacha, who died a sudden death on June 8.
</P>
<P>
UNCP, who was accused of having government support, recorded
landslide victories in local government, state and national
assemblies elections held under Abacha's transition program.
</P>
<P>
The five parties were all dissolved early this month by new
leader General Abubakar, who said the transition program of
Abacha was lack of credibility and unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar ordered the registration of new parties for a new
transition program, by which his government will hand over power
to an elected civilian government on May 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Three other parties have emerged before UNPP, namely the
People's Democratic Movement, the New Rivers Forum and the
Democratic Advance Movement.

<HEADLINE> Beijingers Keen on Tours to Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Over the first half of this year,
23,000 Beijing people traveled abroad, 25 percent more than the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Municipal Tourism Bureau show that 84
percent of the tourists traveled to Southeast Asian countries
including Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
A local tourism official attributed the tourist boom to lower
travel costs to these countries brought on by the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The 10-15 percent reduction in travel cost attracted flocks of
Beijingers. For example, a tourist can enjoy a six-day trip to
Thailand for about 3,800 yuan, the same as a similar trip to south
China's Hainan Province.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Look for Local Funds to Combat Haze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 29 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN will look for local
funds instead of relying on foreign contributions in its efforts
to combat the region's haze and forest fire problems, Indonesia's
Assistant Minister for Coordination and Environment Effendy A.
Sumardja said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to mobilize local resources was brought up at the
ninth meeting of ASEAN's Haze Technical Task Force here Wednesday
as ASEAN has yet to receive the foreign contributions as promised,
Effendy, the meeting chairman, said.
</P>
<P>
"We are tired of empty promises. We cannot be overly dependent
on foreign contributions...this time we have to find our own
resources," he said in an interview with Malaysia's national news
agency Bernama here.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would be brought up at the Fifth ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting on Haze here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Several foreign bodies as well as countries have pledged their
contribution to assist ASEAN in tackling the haze problems which,
at its peak late last year and early this year, blanketed major
parts of the region, adversely affecting some 200,000 hectares in
Indonesia alone and also harming the health, livelihood and
education of millions of people, particularly in Brunei, Malaysia
and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Effendy said the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP)
had pledged to contribute some 10 million U.S. dollars to ASEAN
and the United States pledged 6 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP was responsible to handle the contributions from other
countries before disbursing them to ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Effendy said ASEAN had so far received a grant of 30,000 U.S.
dollars from the UNEP which had been used by Indonesia to develop
a standard operating system to fight forest fires at the early
stage.
</P>
<P>
Effendy said ASEAN had not received anything from the U.S.
which promised 6 million U.S. dollars in the haze-combating
efforts.
</P>
<P>
"They (the U.S.) said the Congress had approved the initial 4
million U.S. dollars but we haven't received anything from them.
Even the proposal for the implementation was not given to us," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Effendy said the meeting Wednesday adopted the report by the
Haze Technical Task Force which would be raised at Thursday's
ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to Effendy, among other things to be discussed by
ASEAN's Environment Ministers are preventive measures, regional
monitoring mechanisms and fire-fighting capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting of the Haze Technical Task Force would be held
in Manila by the end of next month.
</P>

Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

should go a long way to fostering improved tourism and business
ties," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Organ Donors in Short Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,000 South
Africans, including many children, are anxiously awaiting kidney,
heart, liver or cornea transplants, according to a recent survey
by the Organ Donor Foundation of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, only one third of the patients will receive a second
chance at life through a transplant because of the critical
shortage of organ donors in the country, the foundation said.
</P>
<P>
There are even more people mainly those suffering from kidney
ailments, who are sent home to die because of lack of resources
and facilities.
</P>
<P>
The need for kidney transplants is higher among black people
in South Africa than the rest of the population, the foundation
said.
</P>
<P>
However, people in black communities are reluctant to donate
organs in comparison with the white, Setsooto Seheri of the
foundation said.
</P>
<P>
Local medical sources said black people were reluctant to
donate their organs because of cultural beliefs. They were told
ancestors would not accept a body with missing parts.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the backward thinking, Sibongile Ndlovu,
transplant coordinator at Garankuwa Hospital, northest of
Pretoria, appealed to the black community not to be fooled by
traditional healers.
</P>
<P>
"Transplants are done only for strict medical reasons and by
donating all organs several lives can be dramatically enhanced or
prolonged for many years," she said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Plans to Eradicate Polio by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- An official from Ethiopia's
Ministry of Health said the nation has plans to eradicate polio
by 2000 with the cooperation of international community, a media
report said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hiwot Mengistu, child health team leader in the family health
department of the ministry, said the ministry of health had
undertaken preparations to administer polio vaccines for over
nine million children under the age of five.
</P>
<P>
A huge public health social mobilization will be carried out
in November and December this year in the country, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, a surveillance team had left for
Amhara, Oromia, Harari and Somalia regions to conduct training
for persons administering the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
At the nationwide immunization days against polio launched in
Ethiopia last year, over 8.5 million children under the age of
five got vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
According to figures announced by the Ministry of Health,
2,000 cases of polio are estimated in Ethiopia per year, which is
about three percent of the cases in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Polio is an infectious disease caused by a virus affecting the
nervous system. The disease causes paralysis, usually of the
legs, and sometimes death. It affects mostly young children,
usually under five years of age.
</P>
<P>
Paralysis begins rapidly in one or two days and is permanent.
There is no treatment now. However, polio can be prevented
through immunization with oral polio vaccine.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization has plans to eradicate the
disease throughout the world by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Flooding on Yangtze Causes Heavy Losses in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The floods now inundating the
middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have caused an
estimated 39.7 billion yuan (4.78 billion US dollars) in economic
losses to Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces, said a report from
the Ministry of Civil Affairs today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 37.444 million people and 2.732
million hectares of farmland in the three provinces have been
affected by the floods which began on June 28. Since then, 228
people have been killed by the floods.
</P>
<P>
Hunan has sustained the heaviest economic losses, which now
stand at 15.15 billion yuan (1.83 billion US dollars), said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The Party and government authorities at various levels in the
flood-hit provinces, as well as Chinese Central Government
leaders, have all placed great emphasis on the importance of
successful flood relief work.
</P>
<P>
The three provinces have aroused a vast number of people, along
with army personnel and police, for around-the-clock patrol on
embankments along the Yangtze, the prompt repair of threatened
places and the protection of major cities and transportation
routes.
</P>
<P>
The three provinces have allocated and raised 158.82 million
yuan for flood relief work, while dispatching flood working groups
and medical teams into their heaviest-hit areas to acquaint
themselves more with the flooding situation and prevent outbreaks
of epidemic diseases.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs has collaborated with the
Ministry of Finance to earmark a total of 176 million yuan for
flood-relief work in the three provinces, and transfer 5,400 tents
from other parts of China to the stricken areas, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said that the third Yangtze River flood crest
this morning smoothly passed Wuhan, the provincial capital of
Hubei.
</P>
<P>
The crest continues to move eastward downstream and neighboring
Jiangxi Province is currently bracing for an onslaught of even
more serious flooding. A steady rise of the water level also has
been recorded at Lake Poyang Lake, near the city of Jiujiang.
</P>
<P>
A state of emergency has been in effect in Jiangxi for the past
three days and the local government has drafted emergency plans
for cases of extreme danger.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen to Change Constitution If Coalition Attempt Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Hun Sen, whose Cambodian
People's Party (CPP) is set to win the multi-party election, said
Wednesday that he would have the constitution changed if he failed
to form a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, making the first public remark after the July 26
election, said partial results showed that his party has won 67
seats in the election, followed by Ranariddh's Funcinpec with 43
seats, and the opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) with 12 seats,
according to Hun Sen's Bayon Radio.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen's assessment was based on information from CPP
observers monitoring the on-going vote counting.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said a coalition with Ranariddh would avoid a change in
the Constitution which requires a party to have a two-thirds
majority, or 82 seats, in the 122-member National Assembly to form
a government.
</P>
<P>
Under the Constitution, a coalition has to be formed if no
party wins the required two-thirds quorum, with the largest party
naming the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said he hoped the CPP and Funcinpec could cooperate
again in the new coalition, with the SRP remaining as the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh has ruled out the possibility of joining a
coalition with Hun Sen. He told Xinhua shortly after the election
that his party, if not becoming the largest one after the
election, would remain active in the National Assembly as an
opposition, but as for himself he would never work as deputy
premier or whatsoever in a government led by Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Bayon Radio quoting Hun Sen as saying that if Ranariddh
rejected his proposal, he would probably lure the SRP into the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said that if the SRP also refused, he had to have the
constitution changed so as to allow a single party with a simple
majority in the National Assembly to form a government.
</P>
<P>
But Hun Sen said he did not want that to happen.
</P>
<P>
The CPP and Funcinpec worked in a coalition with Ranariddh as
first-premier and Hun Sen as co-premier after the 1993
U.N.-organized elections. But Ranariddh was ousted in July last
year, leaving the coalition in shambles.

PARIS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The national employer's association of France signed on
Tuesday with some unions representing 1.8 million workers in
metallurgical and mining fields an agreement on limited working
week time from the year 2,000, which will allow enterprises to
keep extra working schedule in the name of protecting
competitiveness. The move was condemned by two other unions, the
Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT) and CFDT, as aimed at
undermining the 35-hour work week law, also to be implemented
from 2,000.
</P>
<P>
-- Monica Lewinsky is back, and the White House is shivering.
After obtaining an immunity against judicial prosecution from
independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr in exchange for her testimony,
Lewinsky could affirm to investigators that she had sexual relations
with President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- France's employers scored their first victory against the
35-hour work week law made by the Socialist government. The Union
of Mineral and Metallurgical Industries obtained a massive increase
of the contingent working extra hours, which will allow enterprises
to have extra working timetables from the 35-hour work week from the
year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
-- The Ministry of Interior Affairs has opened the door for
70,000 more sans papiers immigrants by softening criteria to
legalize residency for them.

<HEADLINE> Young Chinese Imams Keep Up With Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-year-old imam Suo Chengyu
recently developed a new interest in watching the World Cup, in
addition to playing basketball and table tennis and reading books
on many subjects in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
"Studying Koran is my lifetime pursuit, but the times and
social progress requires knowledge of other fields," said Suo, who
serves as the officiating priest teaching the Koran at a mosque in
Tongxin County in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
A graduate of the Institute of Islamic Theology of Beijing, Suo
systematically studied Islamic theology, Arabic, Chinese, history
and law, and he developed some other interests and hobbies.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia, China's sole provincial-level autonomous region of the
Hui ethnic group, has more than 3,000 mosques and 4,000 imams.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the older generation, many of the young imams,
constituting about 60 percent of those teaching the Koran in
mosques, either finished middle school or graduated from universities.
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather who is also an imam admires us very much for
the opportunity of study," said 29-year-old imam Zhou Junqiang,
who will go to study in Pakistan later this year.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to further study theology, and acquire more knowledge
and widen my field of vision at the same time," he said.
</P>
<P>
At a time when they are expanding their field of knowledge, the
young imams are also actively advocating the reform, and Islamic
theological education.
</P>
<P>
Yang Baofu, an imam in the Yanghe Mosque in Yongning County,
requires his Islamic theology students to read history,
philosophy, social studies and sciences in addition to the
Koran. He also subscribes to newspapers and magazines related to
Islamic study for his students.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the new ideas in the commodity economy, more young
imams are engaged in business activities. Some of them, like Yang
Baofu and Suo Chengyu, led the Muslim people to contract for the
planting of trees and the building of orchards in the previously
barren hilly land. In this way, the income of the Muslims will
grow and the environment will be improved.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Goods, Services Exports Hit Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia's exports of goods and
services hit a record high of 114 billion Australian dollars (69.5
billion U.S. dollars) for the last financial year ending on June
30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented an increase of 8.2 percent over the
financial year of 1996-1997, Australian Deputy Prime Minister and
Trade Minister Tim Fischer said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is all the more praiseworthy because it is a performance
that has been delivered against the odds, and against the
background of the financial crisis of some of our key markets in
Asia," the deputy prime minister said in a statement on foreign
trade figures released Wednesday by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
He said imports were at a "manageable" 118.4 billion
Australian dollars (72.2 billion U.S. dollars) for the last
financial year, although they jumped 14.4 percent from the
previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
"A feature of Australia's exports in the past year has been the
extent to which (Australian) exporters have diversified out of
Asia and into other markets which have been experiencing better
economic growth," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of Australia's exports of goods and services
go to Asia each year.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said merchandise exports to East Asia rose by 5.5
percent to 28.8 billion U.S. dollars for the last financial year,
while exports to other markets rose by 13.8 percent to 25.2
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the United States rose by 40 percent totaling 1.34
billion U.S. dollars and exports to Britain rose by 30 percent,
while exports to Italy rose 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister said exports to the United Arab Emirates rose 60
percent for the fiscal year while sales to Russia grew by a record
119 percent, although both were starting from a small base.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Indonesia have fallen by 17.4 percent and to
Thailand by 17.9 percent, but exports to Japan rose by 14.3
percent.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Export More Sailors Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam plans to export 15,000 to
20,000 sailors to work for other countries this year, Vietnam News
Agency (vna) reported wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But so far about 5,000 sailors have been sent abroad, a
year-on-year reduction of 8 percent, said the Overseas Labor
Management Bureau under Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, War Invalids
and Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The reduction was attributed to the impact of the current
financial crisis in the region and fierce competition in
international labor markets.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Vietnamese sailors have been working on fishing
and transport ships in South Korea, Japan and Singapore over the
past five years. South Korea and Japan are the main host countries
of Vietnamese sailors.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam began to send sailors to work abroad in 1993 with 33
workers. To date the number of sailors abroad reached 7,451
people, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Proposes Change of SAARC Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colombo, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif proposed here Wednesday to change the charter of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) by establishing
a mechanism to deal with the peace and security problems in South
Asia, including bilateral and contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif, in his speech at the opening session of the 10th
SAARC summit, proposed a Peace, Security and Development Initiate
for South Asia, which would have both a bilateral and a regional
framework.
</P>
<P>
"It would focus on bilateral issues and problems between member
states as well as on promoting economic progress in the regional
context," he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the proposal as the peace and security situation
deteriorated in South Asia and tension between India and Pakistan
heightened in the wake of the nuclear tests by the two countries
in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC Charter does not allow the discussion of bilateral
and contentious issues at the summits.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif proposed that under the mechanism, member
countries with bilateral problems like Pakistan and India should
engage in a sincere dialogue to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
He said a high council comprising the foreign ministers of
South Asian countries may be established immediately to examine
the causes of tension that threaten regional peace and harmony.
</P>
<P>
A South Asian Security and Development Conference may be
convened for discussions on issues of peace, security and economic
development, he added.
</P>
<P>
"SAARC cannot and must not remain indifferent to or pretend to
be oblivious of the differences and tensions between its members,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also announced that Pakistan is ready for immediate
resumption of bilateral foreign secretary-level talks on the basis
of understanding reached between Pakistan and India on June 23,
1997.
</P>
<P>
The India-Pakistan talks at the foreign secretary level were
suspended in September last year due to their differences on the
Kashmir issue, the core contention between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is scheduled to have a meeting with his Indian
counterpart here later Wednesday, the first face-to-face-meeting
between the leaders of the two countries since their nuclear tests
in May.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in his speech,
however, played down the recent nuclear tests in India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee described the apprehensions as "misplaced" that recent
developments in South Asia could cause a set-back to the SAARC
process.
</P>
<P>
"Let me say that these apprehensions are misplaced," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee's speech dwelled on the cooperation in the economic
and social fields among the member countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in their respective speeches, Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina expressed their concerns at the impact of the
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan on SAARC cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said sustained regional economic cooperation
requires "a framework of peace and stability in South Asia".
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said it cannot be denied that the atmosphere of
confidence "could be affected by recent developments in South
Asia" and the SAARC should take measures to assuage the situation.
</P>
<P>
She said that although the concerns of the nuclear tests are
not on the agenda of the summit, they cannot be ignored.

GUANGZHOU, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The income level of farmers in
south China's Guangdong Province fell during the first half of

Recent statistics show that the per capita income for farmers

In addition, the per capita consumption of fertilizer fell to

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG to Be Sent to Guinea Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Troops of the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG may soon be drafted into the
troubled Guinea Bissau to bring peace into the war-ravaged
country.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Executive Secretary of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS), Lansana Kouyate, is on tour of
member states compiling a list of countries ready to contribute
troops to the trouble-shooting group.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate is expected to wind up his tour very soon with the
list, ECOWAS chairman, Nigeria's head of state General Abdulsalam
Abubakar made the disclosure Tuesday in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The intervention by ECOMOG into Guinea Bissau was at the
behest of President Joao Bernado Vierra of that country, Abubakar
explained, after a meeting with the chairman of the Organization
of African Unity, President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Loyalist forces backed by the troops from Senegal and Guinea
have been fighting the rebels under General Ansumane Mane since
they rebelled on June 7, a day after he was sacked as army chief
of Guinea Bissau by President Vierra.
</P>
<P>
According to Compaore, the ECOWAS chairman would still
initiate contacts with sub-regional countries "so that we may
have an idea of ECOWAS' involvement towards the restoration of
peace in Guinea Bissau."
</P>
<P>
The Guinea Bissau crisis formed part of the deliberations of some
west African leaders during a mini-summit held last June in Abuja when
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan visited Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Ministers of defense and foreign affairs from ECOWAS member
states earlier this month met in Cote d'Ivoire to work out the
details of ECOMOG's intervention.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ECOWAS executive secretary, insisting Guinea
Bissau is part of west Africa, has refused the warning made by
Portugal asking the trouble-shooters to steer clear of the
troubled country.
</P>
<P>
"If the former colonial master wants to assist in solving the
problems of its former territory, it must do so in concert with
the regional grouping where the territory is currently located,"
Kouyate said.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was established in 1991, principally to restore
normalcy into war-torn Liberia. It also helped restore the Sierra
Leonean government led by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who was
ousted in a coup in May last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Hun Sen, whose Cambodian
People's Party (CPP) is apparent winner in the multi-party
election, said Wednesday that he wants to form a coalition with
his rival prince Norodom Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, making the first public remark after the July 26
election, said his party is set to win the election, with at least
67 seats, followed by Ranariddh's Funcinpec with 43 seats, and the
opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) with 12 seats, according to
Hun Sen's Bayon Radio.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen's assessment was based on information from CPP
observers monitoring the on-going vote counting.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said a coalition with Ranariddh would avoid a change in
the Constitution which requires a party to have two-thirds
majority, or 82 seats, in the 122-member National Assembly to form
a government.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Media, Tech Firms Working to Enhance TV Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.S. media and
technology companies are working on a standard way to enhance TV
programming with Internet content.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement made Tuesday, the companies, including
Microsoft, Intel, Disney and CNN, have formed an organization,
called Advanced Television Enhancement Forum (ATVEF), for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
They will promote the use of standardized technology, allowing
content providers to design interactive content for delivery
through cable, satellite or digital TV platforms, the announcement
said.
</P>
<P>
"Enhanced television offers new entertainment and commerce
opportunities, such as sports events with complementary
information on players and teams, news with additional details and
related stories, and advertisements that allow consumers to order
merchandise with the click of a button," it added.
</P>
<P>
But there must be a standard way of linking TV content with Web
sites. Without it, broadcasters essentially have to place a bet on
the success of one type of receiver.
</P>
<P>
With a standard in place, content providers and distributors
would be able to target delivery methods using a wider variety of
business models such as various combinations of sponsorships,
advertisement revenues and subscription-based services.
</P>
<P>
The ATVEF said it will work with other industry groups. The
final version of the specification, which is currently open for
public comment, is expected to be published in the fourth quarter
this year.
</P>
<P>
TV receivers compliant with the ATVEF standards are expected to
become available in the first half of 1999, it added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Wantong Expressways Co. Ltd. from
Anhui Province, east China, recently purchased a 51 percent stake
in the expressway between Xuanzhou and Guangde for a reported
366.6 million yuan (44.2 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 66.25-km expressway, the first high-grade road in
southeastern Anhui, was completed in September 1997, and now
serves as an important thoroughfare linking Shanghai and Zhejiang
Province in east China with south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The Wantong Company was the first inland highway firm to gain a
listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The company went public
in November 1996 and has since purchased the Tianchang Section of
National Highway 205 and financed the construction of the Anhui
Section of the Shanghai-Chengdu Expressway. The company also
operates the Hefei-Nanjing Expressway.
</P>
<P>
Wantong has invested more than 1.13 billion yuan (136 million

<P>
NAIROBI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
down-size the workforce in its missions abroad by 50 percent,
Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana has announced.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not give the exact number of staff to be
affected by the move, according to a report from Wednesday's
Daily Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Envoys would be expected to manage their missions with the
meager financial resources available "in a prudent and efficient
manner," Godana said at the 12th biennial ambassadors and high
commissioners conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The hard economic times that the country is currently facing
necessitated the introduction of far-reaching cost-cutting
measures in all sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary Mutuma Kathurima added that employees who
will be retained "will be required to assume multiple roles in
the operations of the respective offices."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Godana said none of the 35 Kenyan missions
abroad will be closed down.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has 12 foreign missions in Africa, 10 in Europe, four in
the Middle East, six in Asia and three in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, the most expensive diplomatic missions of
the east African nation were Geneva and Tokyo, which used more
than 100 million Shillings (some 1.7 million U.S. Dollars) a year
each.
</P>
<P>
The country's national external debt is expected to rise to
312 billion Shillings (5.24 billion Dollars), Assistant Minister
for Finance Mathias Keah told the parliament Tuesday.

<P>
WUHAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ganchen, a 56-year-old senior
engineer, has not left his dangerous spot on the Yangtze River
embankment since a one-centimeter hole was discovered there ten
days ago.
</P>
<P>
"If not for timely measurements and 24-hour supervision, the
diameter could expand to one meter within three hours", said Lu,
clad in only a pair of shorts.
</P>
<P>
"A leak of that size would form a whirlpool which could turn
into an 'underground passage' with water flow accelerating to 15
meters per second. If that had happened, the flood-fighting
efforts would have become extremely difficult," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What would be worse, if efforts had been delayed for more
than three hours, it could have possibly led to a tragic sudden
fall of the whole levee," noted Lu, an engineer at the Water
Conservancy Designing Institute of Honghu City, Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Since the leak was spotted at eight o'clock in the morning of
July 19, Lu and five local officials have taken a nearby hut as
their temporary home. Not far away, the water rises about six
meters above the ground level.
</P>
<P>
Shen Huanbing, the city's chief procurator who is now the
flood-fighting commander, said that four perilous cases have
been brought under control since July 19.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be always on our guard since the seeping has sped
up to 4.2 tons from 1.5 tons per hour. We'll not be able to go
back home until the water recedes," said Shen, who has not been
home for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
Lu and Shen are not alone, since the city is sending five
officials to guard each of the 260 danger spots so far pinpointed
in Honghu.

BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai News reported today that
China's investment industry remains on the road to healthy
development.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that China has over 150 investment
companies, including 63 companies which belong to the China
National Investment Association, a quasi-governmental investment
body. Investment companies have pumped over 400 billion yuan into
the country's economic construction over the past decade, with
their combined profit for 1997 hitting five billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A total of 300 small state-owned firms have either been merged,
transferred, leased or declared bankrupt. The association has
provided valuable assistance in recirculating over five billion
yuan stock assets.
</P>
<P>
Investment companies across China have undergone strategic
structural readjustments in recent years. The vast majority of
companies have shifted their emphasis of investment from the power
industry to infrastructure and high-tech industries, both of which
require large investments and involve high risk.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Beijing Municipal Comprehensive Investment
Group has not only invested in a software industrial park, but also is
engaged in development projects in the biochemical, new
materials and environmental protection sectors.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has decided to eliminate
the little yellow taxicabs known as "Miandi" (bread-shaped) within
the next two years because they produce too much pollution.
</P>
<P>
The "Miandi", which account for less than two percent of local
automotive vehicles, produces eight percent of the city's total
vehicle emissions, official tests have shown.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has 22,000 "Miandi" taxis, or one-third of all the
city's taxicabs.
</P>
<P>
Bad safety records is another factor for clearing the "Miandi"
out of the taxi fleet. Many of these mini-buses have already
logged more than 300,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Taxi Management Bureau said that 95
percent of the city's "Miandi" will be eliminated by October 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The "Miandi" has been popular among local citizens because of
its low cost since it first appeared at the end of 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Taxi Management Bureau is discussing the
possibility of reducing taxi fares to meet the needs of local
residents.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Lantian Company, an enterprise
directly administered by the Ministry of Agriculture, today
donated one million yuan for flood-stricken Honghu City in central
China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to finance the flood-fighting effort
being carried out here, said a company executive.
</P>
<P>
Honghu City, with the largest flood diversion/storage projects
on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, plays an important
role in ensuring the safety of the other areas at the middle and
lower reaches of the river during flood seasons.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the Yangtze along the embankments of Honghu
City has been at the danger mark since June 28, and flooding has
become very severe.
</P>
<P>
For the past several days, the city has been hit by major
floods because of the third flood crest and torrential rains,
which have driven the water level of the Yangtze to 34.45 meters,
0.28 meters more than the previous record high.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 100,000 officials and local residents, together
with more than 2,000 army troops, have been patroling the
135-km-long embankments along both sides of the Yangtze around the
clock. They already have found and repaired 260 danger spots in
the embankments.

<HEADLINE> Rizhao Strives to Become Major East China Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Rizhao, a coastal city in east
China's Shandong Province, plans to grow into a major coal,
container and bulk cargo port with a combined annual handling
capacity of 200 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Che Jinhe, one of the city leaders, said his city enjoys ideal
conditions for constructing deep-water berths for more 100,000-dwt
(dead weight tons) ships.
</P>
<P>
Che said the city plans to invest 30 billion yuan in
infrastructure projects during the Ninth Five Year-Plan period
(1996-2000). The city also plans to focus on a group of major
capital construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Rizhao Port, opened in 1986, has two deep-water berths for
100,000-dwt coal ships. The port has successfully raised its
handling capacity by 19.6 percent annually. Rizhao handled 16.5
million tons of cargo last year, ranking as one of China's 10
major ports.
</P>
<P>
The city, the eastern terminus of the New Eurasian Continental
Bridge, has achieved rapid economic development with the support
of Shandong Province and the central government.
</P>
<P>
Rizhao recorded a 15.7-billion-yuan gross domestic product
(GDP) in 1997, twice the level for 1992. The city allocated over
five billion yuan for urban infrastructure projects between 1991
and 1995.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Below Wuhan Rises Slowly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The water level in the Yangtze
River downstream from Wuhan, provincial capital of Hubei, has been
rising slowly, about 0.1 meters a day, said an official with the
State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the flood peak on the main stream of
the Yangtze smoothly passed Wuhan around 4:00 am this morning. And
the water level in the river from Yichang to Wuhan has started to
recede.
</P>
<P>
At 4:00 am this morning, the Hankou Hydrological Station
recorded the water level of the flood crest at 28.96 meters, some
0.77 meters below the 1954 record high, and the second highest
since the station was built in 1865. The water level started to
drop two hours later, and by 8:00 am had fallen to 28.94 meters,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
However, reports from hydrological stations in Jiujiang and
Datong at the lower reaches of the Yangtze said the water level at
the two stations, recorded around 6:00 am, was 0.06 meters and
0.12 meters higher than yesterday's record, respectively. The
water level at the Jiujiang Hydrological Station was 0.66 meters
more than the 1995 record high of 22.2 meters.
</P>
<P>
The water level in Dongting Lake upstream from Wuhan has
continued to drop, while that of Poyang Lake downstream has
kept growing as the flood crest approaches. At 6:00 am
this morning, the water level recorded at the Hukou
Hydrological Station at Poyang Lake was 22.45 meters, 0.1 meters
higher than yesterday's record, and 0.65 meters more than the
1995 record high of 21.8 meters.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the water level in the main stream at the
lower reaches of Nenjiang River in northeast China continues to
climb, and a flood peak occurred on Tao'er River, one of Nenjiang
River's tributaries, around 10:00 pm yesterday.
</P>
<P>
By 2:00 am this morning, the water level recorded at the
Jiangqiao Hydrological Station was 141.05 meters, 0.29 meters
higher than the previous record high.
</P>
<P>
In south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the flood
crest on the main stream of Xijiang River passed Wuzhou City
around 11:00 pm yesterday and is approaching eastward to Zhaoqing
City in neighboring Guangdong Province.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Yangtze Flood Becomes National Concern (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The embankments and dikes that
protect a third of China's 1.2 billion people from floods on the
Yangtze River have become a battle zone, where tens of thousands
of civilians and soldiers are fighting day and night against the
worst flooding since 1954.
</P>
<P>
A third flood crest is passing the city of Wuhan in Hubei
Province today, and water levels on the lower reaches after Hankou
are still rising at alarming rates.
</P>
<P>
Although flood-control efforts have been successful so far,
local governments need to remain on high alert for several more
days, warns Guo Zhizhen, of the Water Resources Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Central Meteorology Station reports that the Chinese will
not be able to rest for at least another week. Although rainfall
along the Yangtze will ease up in the next few days and the
possibility of storms is gone, heavy rains may still be expected
in some areas before August 2, according to Tang Huifang, deputy
director of the Central Meteorology Station.
</P>
<P>
Even light rains can not be ignored since the Yangtze is
already seriously flooded, Tang says, pointing out that
unpredicatable climate changes could take place along the Yangtze
so they will continue to monitor the changes.

<TEXT>
<P>
The flooding has caused concern in the central government, and
President Jiang Zemin has ordered areas along the Yangtze to
fortify dikes and drain off water that has leaked through
dikes. Premier Zhu Rongji visited flooded parts of Jiangxi, Hubei
and Hunan provinces in early July.
</P>
<P>
Large amounts of materials and funds have been appropriated for
emergency relief work and millions of officials and police and
tens of millions of local people have been mobilized to defend
against the swollen waters of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation people say that the flood control work has
gone well this year because of water conservation efforts of the
past forty years, which can be seen from the relatively low death
toll. Figures published by the Ministry of Civil Affairs say that
by July 26 this year, floods and other disasters had claimed the
lives of 2,500, but that is compared with the 34,600 during the
1954 flooding alone.
</P>
<P>
The floods this year have been very serious, with all of the
Yangtze River Valley reporting torrential rainfall and Dongting
Lake and Boyang Lake on the middle reaches could hardly hold any
more water from the upper reaches, according to Hou Yingjie, head
of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the build-up of sediment in the river bed had
helped raised the water level, but dikes have remained basically
sound in spite of high water levels.
</P>
<P>
But, flood-control experts still say that dikes are still in
serious danger and need to be closely watched, and widespread
termite damage needs to be repaired to avoid potential dangers of
any kind.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Further Boosts Ties With ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China has further improved its ties
with countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) through its participation in the ASEAN Regional Forum
(ARF) and dialogue with the ASEAN at the Post Ministerial
Conference (PMC) here.
</P>
<P>
"The friendly exchanges and mutual understanding between China
and ASEAN have continued to deepen," Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan declared at the dialogue between China and ASEAN Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who assumed his present post in March this year,
represented China at the ARF and PMC meetings, held in the
Philippine capital from July 27 to 29, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference at the end of the meetings
Wednesday, Tang declared, "We exchanged views in a profound way on
the regional situation, especially on the East Asian financial
situation and the tension in South Asia."
</P>
<P>
"The meetings reflected the ardent aspirations of the
participants for regional stability and development, expressed
their confidence in promoting cooperation and reviving the Asian
economy and showed their consensus regarding strengthening
dialogue and increasing mutual understanding and trust," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"China is satisfied with the results of the meetings," the
Chinese foreign minister declared.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time for China to participate in the ARF and
PMC meetings, a forum where ASEAN members and dialogue partners
discuss political and security cooperation. China has been an
active participant in the process of dialogue and cooperation with
the ASEAN ever since it became a full dialogue partner in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between China and the ASEAN, which Foreign
Minister Tang said "has achieved satisfactory progress," reached a
new high in 1997 when Chinese President Jiang Zemin joined heads
of state from the nine ASEAN members at an informal summit in
Malaysia, at which the two sides decided to establish a 21st
century-oriented partnership.
</P>
<P>
Both China and ASEAN members, which include Brunei, Indonesia,
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam, are developing countries facing the arduous task of
promoting economic development and raising the living standards of
their peoples.
</P>
<P>
Their cooperation in the political and security fields helps
ensure a peaceful environment conducive to economic growth in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Tang pointed out that China, as ASEAN's dialogue partner, has
done its share in defusing the tension touched off in South Asia
by India's nuclear tests in May, thus contributing to regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, China joined ASEAN members and other
dialogue partners in censuring India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the Indian delegate to the ARF and PMC, Tang
described the tests as "running counter to the trend of the world"
and asked India to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
and join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
</P>
<P>
At the ARF, Tang also pointed out that economic growth and
common prosperity are the material basis for regional and global
security.
</P>
<P>
In view of the East Asian financial crisis, the Chinese foreign
minister at the meeting raised the question of economic security,
which he said "has increasingly become an inseparable part" of
national and regional stability.
</P>
<P>
He noted that after the financial crisis erupted in Southeast
Asia last year, China and the ASEAN have shared weal and woe.
Although it is not a rich country, China has contributed 4 billion
U.S. dollars to the Operational Budget of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to help Thailand and Indonesia, two ASEAN
members most seriously hit by the crisis, and provided export
credit and emergency medical assistance gratis to Indonesia and
others through bilateral channels.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China committed itself not to devalue its
currency, the renminbi, thus making a positive contribution to
stabilizing the regional economy and easing the difficulties of
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese move has won widespread praise. In a statement
issued on July 27 at the end of the ARF meeting, this year's ARF
Chairman and Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Domingo
Siazon said the participants "were encouraged" by Foreign Minister
Tang's assurances that the value of the yuan will be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Tang pledged at the meetings that China will,
as always, take an active part in the dialogue process with the
ASEAN, which he described as "an important way for promoting
regional peace and stability."

NANNING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A project funded in part by the
World Bank has provided an additional 1.5 million rural people in
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region with tap water reaching
government hygiene standards, local official sources said.
</P>
<P>
In June 1992, the World Bank announced it would grant loans
totalling 21 million US dollars for projects to provide potable
water to nine Guangxi counties inhabited the Zhuang ethnic group,
with local governments pledging to provide an additional 170
million yuan (about 20.48 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The goal was to help the estimated nine million rural residents
relying solely on well and pond water, the main sources of
enteritis and parasitic diseases.
</P>
<P>
The nine beneficiary counties were located in areas with water
shortages and high rates of infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
Some 417 water plants currently provide clean tap water to 1.5
million people living in the nine counties.

<HEADLINE> Pippen Has Surgery on Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Bulls star Scottie
Pippen had a back surgery at a Chicago hospital this week, and the
procedure would not threaten his career, his doctor was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Schafer, chairman of Northwestern Memorial
Hospital's department of orthopedic surgery, performed the back
operation Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I was very pleased with the surgery. The operation was
successful, and I expect Mr. Pippen will have no trouble in
resuming his career," Schafer said in a statement Tuesday from
Pippen's agent, Jimmy Sexton.
</P>
<P>
Pippen, a free agent after Chicago Bulls claimed their sixth
title in June, was not available for comment on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Pippen hurt his back in the NBA Finals after
being knocked to the floor several times while drawing charges.
</P>
<P>
Pippen had suffered from foot surgery last November, missing
the first 35 games of the season.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Calls for Speeding Up Free Trade Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Wednesday called for efforts to speed up the process
of creating a free trade zone in South Asia by extending tariff
concessions and removing discriminatory practices and non-tariff
barriers.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the opening of a summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) here, she said the
grouping's goal of establishing such a free trade zone could not
be achieved on schedule unless real progress is made at a new
round of trade negotiations among member states.
</P>
<P>
She said that at the current summit, the leaders of the seven
member countries should make an assessment of what has been
achieved in the process of the SAARC Preferential Trading
Arrangement (SAPTA), created in 1995 as a first step towards
forming the projected free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
SAARC leaders have decided to create a South Asian Free Trade
Area (SAFTA) by the year 2001. Under SAPTA, member countries
exchange tariff concessions in more than 2,000 items.
</P>
<P>
Tariff concessions should be extended to products which are
actively traded, and discriminatory practices, structural
impediments and non-tariff barriers should be removed, Kumaratunga
said.
</P>
<P>
"The success of tariff negotiations depends very much on how
equitable this cooperative process can be made," she said. "A free
trade area would surely recede further into the future unless real
progress can be achieved in the next round of SAPTA negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The leaders from the six other SAARC member countries attending
the three-day summit are Girija Prasad Koirala, the Nepali prime
minister and minister of foreign affairs and defense, Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Maldivian
President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and Jigme Thinley, chairman of
Bhutan's new Council of Ministers and head of government.
</P>
<P>
"It is equally vital that domestic content requirements under
rules of origin be substantially reduced to promote equitable
economic exchanges and productive joint ventures," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan president urged member countries to show
flexibility so as to correct the imbalance in regional trade.
</P>
<P>
Trade restrictions can no longer protect domestic economies
from external competition, she said, adding that the SAPTA process
is not a one-way flow and concessions should be reciprocated.
</P>
<P>
She also called for negotiations on an "appropriate legal
instrument or treaty" for SAFTA "with a view to its signature and
ratification by the year 2001."

<HEADLINE> Seven-year-old Girl Beaten to Death By Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A 7-year-old girl was beaten to
death by her father because she failed to give a proper answer to
a simple question, according to today's Beijing Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the father, Yang Yannan, has been given a 6-year
prison sentence in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The dead Yang Ziye was a retarted child who lived with her
mother after her parents divorced three years ago. Last December,
the sick mother sent the daughter to the father's home.
</P>
<P>
The hot-tempered father often beat the little girl because she
couldn't take care of herself.
</P>
<P>
On February 23, while having supper with his daughter, the
father asked, "Who is the father?" To his surprise, the daughter
answered "I am." The father pushed the little girl angrily and
said, "You are the father, then who am I?"
</P>
<P>
The girl was scared and spit rice and vegetables out of her
mouth, making her father even more angry, and he slapped the girl
in the face.
</P>
<P>
The girl backed up slightly, and then fell. She lay on the
floor silently, without moving. The father was scared and rushed
her to the hospital, where the girl died a few days later.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the hospital found suspicious wounds on the girl
and reported it to the local police.

JERUSALEM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and ruling
coalition Chairman Meir Sheetrit decided Tuesday night that the

</P>
<P>
The two bills call for dissolvement of the Knesset (parliament)

</P>
<P>
Haaretz:

<P>
-- Israeli security source said Tuesday that if Russia stops
providing technological aid to the Iranian missile program, the

He said that yet the Russians seem unimpressed by the moderate
pressure placed on them by the United States to stop helping the
Iranians and there are no signs that they intend to stop.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Jibri Rajoub, head of the Palestinian Preventive Security
Service in the West Bank, said Tuesday that war with Israel is a

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Strives to Become China's Major Power Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province,
China's largest coal producer, plans to either construct or
expand 10 large power plants over the next few years at a cost of
70 billion yuan in order to become the nation's major power
producer.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhensheng, president of the Shanxi Power Corp., said the
province will increase its power generating capacity by 830,000 kw
annually over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi has a power generating capacity of 10 million kw,
produces 54.5 billion kwh of electricity annually, and sells 10
billion kwh of electricity to customers in other provinces
annually.
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the province's total power generating capacity
to top 13.42 million kw by the year 2000, including four million
kw for customers outside Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi's ranks first in the country with verified coal reserves
of 287.3 billion tons, or 33 percent of the national total. The
province produces 300 million tons of coal annually, a quarter
of the nation's total coal output.
</P>
<P>
At present, a group of pit thermal power plants alongside the
existing coal mines and trans-regional long-distance power
transmission lines are under construction, said the official.
</P>
<P>
When all the large thermal power stations are completed, 50
million tons of coal will be transformed into electricity
annually.

<HEADLINE> Dialogue Partners to Help ASEAN Weather Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The ministerial conference between
ASEAN and its 10 dialogue partners ended here Wednesday with the
latter's commitment to helping ASEAN economies restore economic
stability and addressing the negative effects of the current
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Our dialogue partners have expressed their valuable support
and commitment to ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
at this crucial time," Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon
told a press conference after the two-day gathering.
</P>
<P>
Siazon, who is this year's chairman of ASEAN's Post Ministerial
Conference (PMC), said that the PMC provided a venue for
discussions on future approaches to resolve the regional financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"There was a healthy exchange of views on shared
responsibilities, on the need for economic restructuring, on the
necessity of keeping markets open, and on the review of the
international financial architecture," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Siazon, the four major dialogue partners -- the
United States, China, Japan and the European Union -- have
promised to play a role in fighting the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. reaffirmed its full support for strengthening the
capabilities of multilateral financial and development
institutions to restore financial stability in Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
China reiterated its commitment not to devalue the Chinese
currency yuan, Siazon added, while Japan expressed its firm
commitment to implement financial and economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the need to address the negative effects of the
currency crisis, the nine-member ASEAN and its dialogue partners
agreed to set in place programs designed to assist those burdened
by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Australia, Canada, India, Japan and Russia all committed to
sponsoring programs that would enhance human resource development,
science and technology and institutional capacity-building.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue partners and ASEAN also agreed to strengthen
cooperation in addressing environmental problems, such as forest
fires and climate change, and transnational crimes, Siazon said.
</P>
<P>
The PMC, a follow-up of the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM), is
an annual event which also includes a series of separate sessions
between ASEAN and every dialogue partner.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, which will take over from the Philippines as ASEAN's
next chairman, will host in 1999 the AMM and its associated
meetings, including the PMC and the ASEAN Regional Forum.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand and South Korea are also ASEAN dialogue partners.
ASEAN groups the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand,
Brunei, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam and Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Former Minister Voted Uganda's New Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A former minister in the
President's Office, Francis Joash Ayume, was elected new Speaker
of Uganda's Parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He defeated his arch rival, Ben Wacha, by a margin of 58
votes, the New Vision daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ayume, who resigned his ministerial post in preparation for
the Speaker election Monday, got 152 of the 248 votes while Wacha
got only 94. Two votes were invalid.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kintu Musoke, National Political Commissar
(NPC) James Wapakhabulo and state minister for political affairs
Amama Mbabazi hailed the elections as a triumph for democracy.
</P>
<P>
After the elections which took close to two hours,
Wapakhabulo, the former Speaker who was elected the National
Political Commissar at the first national congress of the ruling
National Resistance Movement (NRM) two weeks ago, handed over to
Ayume the instruments of office which include the mace,
Constitution and rules of procedure of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
In his maiden speech as Speaker, Ayume pledged to try his best
to face the challenge and to maintain the independence of the
legislative body without drawing a wedge between the government
and Parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said he would commit himself to the unity of the Parliament
and work towards harmonizing relations between the front
(ministers) and back bench (ordinary MPs).
</P>
<P>
In his farewell speech, Wapakhabulo called on MPs to unite
behind the new Speaker and forget their camps.
</P>
<P>
Since Wapakhabulo was elected NPC, the race for Speakership
has hotted up. Ayume was chosen by the ruling NRM as its
candidate for the number three post in the country's hierarchy.

<P>
NANJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province has
led this nation in terms of per-unit rice output for four years in
a row, provincial sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Situated at the lower reaches of Yangtze River, Jiangsu
Province, one of the economic powerhouses, has a sown rice area of
about 2.33 million hectares each year, accounting for 7.1 percent

In Yangzhong city, some paddy fields even produced as high as 9.3
tons of rice per hectare.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed the stable high rice yield in the
province to improvement of farming conditions and the wide
application of new high-yield rice planting techniques.

<HEADLINE> China Bids Farewell to Commodity Shortage for First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in history,
China has ceased suffering from a shortage of commodity supply.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the State Internal Trade Bureau today
indicate that of the 601 kinds of commodities surveyed, none fell
short of supply during the first half of this year, with many of
them actually being oversupplied.
</P>
<P>
Though China has been gradually turned strong since 1949, it had
never stopped feeling the pinch of commodity shortage under a
rigid highly-planned economy before the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Between the mid 1980s and mid 1990s, the country experienced an
unprecedented economic boom accompanied by overheated construction
activities worsening shortfalls in the supply of commodities.
</P>
<P>
At present, it has been in another economic development cycle
characterized by deflation, market analysts said.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier resports, the retail and consumer prices
fell 2.1 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively, in the
first six months as compared with the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, one of the most well-off provinces in China, reported
price drops in ten consecutive months since last September, with
food price falling 2,4 percent, and that of grain, eggs, and
aquatic products more than 7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Flood Situation Still Serious in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The overall flood situation is still
serious in Bangladesh and has turned "alarming" in the central
parts and the northwestern districts of the country with more
deaths reported.
</P>
<P>
The official death toll rose to 140 as of Tuesday, with 29 more
casualties reported overnight, press reports here said Wednesday.
But unofficial death figure reported from flood-affected areas
would be much higher, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
About 14.8 million Bangladeshi people have become victims of
the flood sweeping 37 out of the country's 64 districts, which has
damaged 126,000 houses, 192,000 acres of crops, 3509 kilometers of
roads, 2622 kilometers of embankments, and 1767 bridges and
culverts since the monsoon season started in the country in early
July.
</P>
<P>
"The situation might deteriorate in Dhaka in the next 72
hours," Director General at the prime minister's secretariat
Badiuzzaman was quoted as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The situation has improved in 12 districts, worsened in 20
districts and remained static in five districts, according to
Badiuzzaman.
</P>
<P>
The government has so far distributed 7.375 million taka in
cash and 4750 tons of rice among the flood-hit people, and has
opened 226 shelters in the flood-stricken areas accommodating more
than 80,000 people temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Flood is very common in Bangladesh during the July-October
monsoon season.

<HEADLINE> Italy Denies "Indulgence" Towards Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini denied charges on Tuesday that Italian and international
policies on the Kosovo crisis are "indulgent" towards Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Writing in La Stampa, a daily in Turin, the minister said Italy
and other Contact Group countries are not "indulgent" towards
Milosevic and have promised to impose "very severe sanctions" on
the Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
Answering charges from some analysts, he pointed out that only
a week ago he sent Milosevic a "severe message", criticizing his
role in the Kosovo tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"We are certainly not defending Italian economic interests,"
said Dini, since Italy would be among those to suffer most from
sanctions on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Dini reiterated Italy's opposition to Kosovo independence, but
noted that Yugoslavia must allow the province to practise
self-rule.
</P>
<P>
"We have always said unhesitatingly that independence is
impracticable," said Dini.
</P>
<P>
"New forms of self-government must be created for which there
is no lack of models in Europe," he added. He was referring to
Italy's own case in the northeastern, German-speaking Alto Adige,
which enjoys bilingualism and extensive autonomy.
</P>
<P>
He said that an attempt had been made to keep Russia anchored
to "joint action, also for considerations extending beyond the
Balkan region."
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, warned Dini, the best foreign policy can do is
"simply to avoid the worst."

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Chinese FM's Speech at China-ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mr. Chairman,
</P>
<P>
China and ASEAN countries are now faced with the common
pressing task and challenge to tide over the East Asian financial
crisis and rejuvenate the Asian economy at an earlier date. As a
member of Asia and a good neighbor, good friend and good partner
of ASEAN countries, China will, as always, share the feelings of
ASEAN countries and weather the storm together with them. To be
specific, the Chinese side is ready to continue to work with ASEAN
in the following areas:
</P>
<P>
First, to work for regional economic stability and development.
Being aware of the responsibility on its shoulder, China will make
vigorous efforts to expand domestic demand and realize this year's
goal of 8 percent growth rate. We are now increasing our input in
the infrastructure construction and in turning high and new
technologies into commercial production and, the proportion of
investment in technological upgrading. China has planned to invest
750 billion U.S. dollars in the next three years, particularly in
infrastructure construction. China will continue unswervingly to
carry out the policy of non-devaluation of its RMB. China will
strive to maintain sustained, rapid and sound economic growth in a
long time to come so as to contribute to the recovery and
development of Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
Second, to expand bilateral trade, mutual investment and areas
of cooperation. The Chinese side is ready to foster new points of
cooperation and increase complementarity with ASEAN countries on
the existing basis. That is to say, while deepening economic
cooperation and trade, China wishes to expand its cooperation with
ASEAN to such areas as the development of natural resources,
agriculture, applicable technologies, medical care and medicine,
human resources development and environmental protection.
Particularly, it is important to increase scientific and
technological cooperation and exchanges of financial and
commercial information so as to promote their respective efforts
in structural readjustment and shift of growth mode. Furthermore,
efforts should be made to build a multi-level cooperation network
and to support and encourage stronger links between
non-governmental entities and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Third, to make concerted efforts to overcome the temporary
difficulties. To this end, the Chinese side will continue to
provide ASEAN countries with assistance as far as it can,
including export credit support for commodities in urgent need,
grain export at concessional prices, and assistance gratis. The
Chinese government has recently decided that it will continue to
support the IMF Operational Budget for assisting Indonesia, and on
top of that, it will provide 300 million U.S. dollars to the
Indonesian government in the form of bilateral loans in support of
the financing program of the international community to assist
Indonesia under the auspices of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, to enhance Asia's ability to guard against and tide
over financial risks. For this purpose, the competent authorities
of China and ASEAN countries may, in due time, study in real
earnest the issue of international financial reform and come up
with ideas and formulas for the reform so as to exert positive
influence on this reform.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, to enhance communication and coordination between the
two sides in regional fora on economic cooperation and security
dialogue, further promote the implementation of the cooperation
project of the Mekong Basin development, and expand cooperation in
subregions and growth regions.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chairman,
</P>
<P>
The partnership of good-neighborliness and mutual trust between
China and ASEAN has a firm foundation and great vitality. Though
the impact of the financial turmoil is still present and the
difficulties we are faced with will continue for a while, we are
fully confident that we will surely tide over the current
difficulties so long as we share weal and woe and advance side by
side. We have full confidence both in the future development of
Asia and in China-ASEAN relations. Let's keep up our courage and
turn pressure into motive forces and challenges into opportunities
to overcome the current difficulties, open up a new chapter of
Asian development and usher in stronger ties between China and
ASEAN with full confidence.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Hopes to Normalize Relations With Arab World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov
said Tuesday his country, neutral on the Middle East conflict,
hoped to normalize economic and trade ties with the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
"The stand of the Bulgarian government is very balanced and
moderate," Kostov said. "In no case is it a stand directed against
any of the conflicting Middle East countries."
</P>
<P>
In early July, Bulgaria abstained in the vote on a United
Nations resolution on upgrading the status of the Palestinian
mission to the world body.
</P>
<P>
Later, ambassadors of Arab countries here voiced their
dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian-Arab economic ties, as described by Kostov, have
almost reached the freezing point and have been privatized by
intermediaries. But "we do not want any intermediary in our
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We want there to be direct contacts between companies and

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka President Calls For Peace, Stability in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colombo, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka President Chandrika
Bandaranaike Kumaratunga Called for peace and stability in South
Asia here Wednesday at the opening ceremony of the 10th summit of
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
Sustained regional economic cooperation requires "a framework
of peace and stability in South Asia", said President Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
She said that SAARC countries should strive to achieve both
economic cooperation and peace and stability through the promotion
of close relations among the member states.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan conducted tit-for-tat nuclear tests in May
this year, deteriorating the peace and security situation in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said it cannot be denied that the atmosphere of
confidence "could be affected by recent developments in South
Asia" and the SAARC should take measures to assuage the situation.
</P>
<P>
She said that although the concerns of the nuclear tests are
not on the agenda of the summit, they cannot be ignored.
</P>
<P>
However, she said such concerns cannot be divorced, or
considered in isolation, from the global security environment, in
particular the nuclear environment, and the "tardy progress in
nuclear disarmament on a global scale".
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter for regret that the declared nuclear powers
have so far failed to move significantly towards total
disarmament," she said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
and The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga took over the chair of SAARC from Maldivian
President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom at the opening ceremony.

<P>
MANILA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan has pledged that China will continue to work for regional
economic stability and development in face of the one-year-old
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the dialogue session Tuesday afternoon between
China and The nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), Tang said China will cooperate with the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries in fighting the current
financial crisis and rejuvenating the Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
"As a member of Asia and a good neighbor, good friend and good
partner of ASEAN countries," he said, "China will, as always,
share the feelings of ASEAN countries and weather the storm
together with them."
</P>
<P>
He said his country will expand bilateral trade, mutual
investment and areas of cooperation with ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
China wishes to expand its cooperation with ASEAN to such areas
as the development of natural resources, agriculture, applicable
technologies, medical care and medicine, human resources
development and environmental protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
It will make concerted efforts with ASEAN to overcome the
temporary difficulties, by continuing to provide ASEAN countries
with assistance as far as it can, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
China will also work to enhance Asia's ability to guard against
and tide over financial risks. For this purpose, the competent
authorities of China and ASEAN countries may, in due time, study
in real earnest the issue of international financial reform and
come up with ideas and formulas for the reform so as to exert
positive influence on this reform, according to the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
China also plans to enhance communication and coordination
between the two sides in regional fora on economic cooperation and
security dialogue, further promote the implementation of the

<HEADLINE> Up to 17 Injured in Power Plant Explosions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Explosions and a subsequent
fire Tuesday at a coal-fired power plant in Indiana, the United
States, injured up to 17 people, four seriously.
</P>
<P>
The incident at Southern Energy Co. plant in Hammond, Indiana,
sent plumes of black smoke towering along the Lake Michigan
shoreline, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
It took six hours to extinguish the fire.
</P>
<P>
Jim Walsko, a local chief fire inspector, said any number of
things could have caused the explosion, such as static
electricity, a spark igniting coal dust, or electrical problems.
</P>
<P>
As the plant had been assigned to supply power to Chicago,
lights flickered across the third largest U.S. city at the moment
of the incident, as backup power systems kicked in.
</P>
<P>
About 25 industrial customers on the city's South Side were
without power for 30 minutes after the explosions, Commonwealth
Edison spokeswoman Jennifer Kennefick said.
</P>
<P>
John Thompson, director of clean air programs for the Illinois
Environmental Council, said it was the third fire this year at a
coal-burning facility owned by Commonwealth Edison or at one that
supplies power to the utility.
</P>
<P>
As many as 17 people were injured, plant manager Tom Newton
said. Many of the injuries were minor, but four people were in
critical condition with burns.

<HEADLINE> Panamanian Cattle Worried by Rapid Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, july 28 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian cattle breeders are
concerned about rapid market liberalization by the Panamanian
government, and are proposing that duties be lowered gradually.
</P>
<P>
The National Cattle Breeders Association (NCBA) says the sharp
lowering of duties on imported products hinders the development of
Panamanian agriculture, as well as national production.
</P>
<P>
The duty reduction negotiated with the World Trade Organization
(WTO) was favorable for dairy products, with an average of 134.4
percent reduction to 98.5 percent over ten years, but the
government lowered it to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Facing this situation, Panamanian cattle breeders urge a
reorientation of the duty program for the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Cattle breeders say a similar situation occurred with meat. The
WTO set them a 40 percent reduction to be reduced to 30 percent in
five years, but the Panamanian government lowered the duty to 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
The NCBA is also worried about negotiations on free trade with
Chile, Mexico and MERCOSUR. It says producers are not given a
chance to participate.
</P>
<P>
Producers are also concerned about the elimination of sanitary
legislation required by law for imported products.
</P>
<P>
The NCBA urges Panamanian Government to follow developed countries which
still provide subsidies to their producers, and day-to-day impose
restraints on imported products.
</P>
<P>
The group cited as an example the Organization for the Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD). Members include the United
States, the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New
Zealand, Japan and South Korea, and these allot 280 million
U.S. dollars to subsidize their products every year.

<HEADLINE> Peruvians in Poverty Down to 50.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian population living under
the poverty line dropped from 57.4 percent in 1991 to 50.7 percent
in 1997, says a survey issued on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of people with incomes below what is needed to
acquire essential products has dropped from 12,161,000 to
12,048,000 over the period, says the survey conducted by the
Cuanto Institute.
</P>
<P>
The poverty line is defined as an average daily expense of 5.21
soles, about 1.8 U.S. dollars, and below.
</P>
<P>
The area where life has been improved most significantly is the
metropolitan area in the capital, where the impoverished has
dropped from 47.6 percent to 35.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The population living under extreme poverty also dropped from
26.8 percent to 14.7 percent in the total population.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the poverty reduction to the expansion of
food delivery programs, the increase of households with water,
electric lighting and sewage, and the increase in family patrimony
which helped to change the quality of lives.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Chinese FM's Speech at China-ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text of
the address delivered Tuesday by Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan at the meeting between China and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), part of the Post Ministerial
Conference (PMC).
</P>
<P>
The Honorable Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi,
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs,
</P>
<P>
Fellow Colleagues,
</P>
<P>
The past year was a year in which Asia experienced big changes
and China and ASEAN countries withstood the tests. And it was also
a year that witnessed significant progress in the bilateral
relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
We are pleased to see all-round cooperation between China and
ASEAN countries under the guidance of the Joint Statement and
steady growth of their good-neighborly relations and friendship
since the historic meeting between President Jiang Zemin and the
leaders of the nine ASEAN countries at the end of last year and
the establishment of the 21st century-oriented partnership of
good-neighborliness and mutual trust during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The friendly exchanges and mutual understanding between China
and ASEAN have continued to deepen. During the ASEM Summit,
Premier Zhu Rongji had an in-depth exchange of views with ASEAN
leaders on regional situation and bilateral relations. I myself
visited ASEAN countries before any other countries after assuming
my new post. The China-ASEAN SOM was held in April, which has
enhanced the common understanding between the two sides. China and
ASEAN have maintained close coordination and cooperation in
international and regional affairs, particularly in ARF, APEC and
ASEM.
</P>
<P>
What is worth particular mentioning is that we both have given
priority to strengthened cooperation in the economic, trade,
scientific and technological fields and that our mutually
beneficial cooperation has, instead of being weakened by the
financial crisis, been enhanced in a way.
</P>
<P>
-- Proceeding from the overall interest of regional economic
stability, China has, despite its own relatively weak economic
strength and in face of the risks and pressure, committed itself
not to devalue its RMB, thus making contribution to the easing off
of the Asian financial crisis and the difficulties facing
countries in this region.
</P>
<P>
-- China has provided, as far as it can, assistance to Thailand
and Indonesia respectively through the Operational Budget of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
-- China has provided export credit and emergency medical
assistance gratis to countries like Indonesia through bilateral
channels and discussed, in a positive manner, flexible cooperation
means such as barter trade with the countries concerned. China has
offered assistance, though limited, with every sincerity and
without attaching any conditions, which is a token of its goodwill
and desire to help its neighbors in distress.
</P>
<P>
-- The visits to Malaysia and Thailand paid by delegations of
China Council for Promotion of International Trade and All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce have added substance to the
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
-- Through mutual support and coordination in regional and
international fora, China and ASEAN have boosted confidence in
Asia's rejuvenation and its bright future and strived for a
favorable external environment for the development of Asia.
</P>
<P>
-- China-ASEAN Joint Cooperation Committee and other such
organizations have been operating effectively, with their
cooperation projects achieving smooth progress and fruitful
results.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chairman,
</P>
<P>
What has commanded China's great admiration is that ASEAN
countries and the ASEAN organization have defied the difficulties
and displayed the commendable spirit of self-improvement through
unity in facing the severe impact of the financial crisis. The
ASEAN countries have made vigorous efforts to promote economic
integration while accelerating readjustment and reform and
remained actively involved in regional multi-lateral cooperation
in an effort to realize the Vision 2020. A united, stable and
ever-developing ASEAN is vital to peace and development in Asia.
We firmly believe that ASEAN countries and the ASEAN organization
will surely be able to weather the storm, survive the challenges
and score fresh progress in overcoming difficulties.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Colombo Summit to Have Repercussions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Decisions to be made by the
leaders of the seven member countries of South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) who arrived here Tuesday night
for deliberations in the next three days could have wide
repercussions on one fifth of the world's population.
</P>
<P>
But the eyes of the world will focus more on the outcome of the
bilateral meeting between the prime ministers of India and
Pakistan to be held against the backdrop of the worsening security
situation in South Asia in the aftermath of the nuclear tests by
the two arch rivals in the region.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC charter does not allow bilateral matters to be taken
up at the grouping's deliberations but they can be discussed
informally on the sidelines of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The 10th SAARC Summit will give the Indian and Pakistani
leaders an opportunity to hold their first face-to-face meeting
since the two countries carried out nuclear tests in May this
year.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the whole region would be endangered
if India and Pakistan bog down in the mire of a nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
The May nuclear explosions have shaken the very foundations of
SAARC, and the real challenge the SAARC leaders face is to ensure
that the regional grouping is not derailed by the newly emerging
tensions in the region, the observers said.
</P>
<P>
The political declaration to be adopted at the summit could
contain a commitment on the part of the leaders to working towards
the reduction of tensions in the region along with identified
confidence-building measures, they said.
</P>
<P>
The observers also believe that the Colombo declaration would
have value only if it is accompanied by a commitment to pursuing
further regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the seven SAARC nations are also due to
deliberate on a wide range of economic, social and institutional
issues.
</P>
<P>
With the theme for this year's summit being the role of SAARC
in a changing world, the main focus would be on South Asia's
collective response to global economic changes, according to the
Sri Lankan government, the host of this year's summit.
</P>
<P>
South Asia is one of the poorest regions in the world. The
seven countries of SAARC -- India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan,
Bangladesh, the Maldives and Sri Lanka -- have a total population
of 1.2 billion, one fifth of the world's population, but its
combined share in global exports and imports is only one percent
and 1.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
There is widespread poverty in South Asia. Nearly 40 percent of
the region's population live below the poverty line, which remains
a stumbling block in the way of regional economic cooperation as
well as development.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, South Asian nations have golden opportunities yet
to be realized and SAARC could well serve as a catalyst to promote
the fulfillment of their dream.
</P>
<P>
It is against such a backdrop that the SAARC leaders will
deliberate measures to increase intra-regional trade and
investment and exchange expertise in areas of science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
They will also seek to promote education in the region.
Agricultural and industrial development, infrastructure
development and tourism are other topics on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
During the past 13 years, cooperation among the SAARC member
countries has been extended in a number of areas. These include
agriculture, poverty alleviation, economic development and trade,
meteorology, health, population activities, child welfare,
prevention of drug trafficking, rural development, science and
technology, tourism, transportation and women in development.
</P>
<P>
The greatest achievement of the SAARC is the establishment of
the SAARC Preferential Trading Agreement (SAPTA) in 1995 under
which more than 2000 items of products are being traded for
preferential treatment in the member states.
</P>
<P>
The next target is the establishment of a South Asian Free
Trade Area (SAFTA) by the year 2001 with the removal of non-tariff
barriers and structural impediments, wider and deeper tariff cuts
and the expansion of the list of products for intra-regional
preferential trade.
</P>
<P>
A strong argument is that the SAARC has been going too slow
since its inception in 1985. Scarcity of natural resources,
environmental problems, social unrest and political instability
common among SAARC countries  are identified as the main causes
for the slow pace of development.
</P>
<P>
It is widely hoped that the 10th SAARC Summit will come up with
decisions in the interest of the development of South Asia and
peace and security in the region.

<HEADLINE> Third Yangtze Flood Crest Passes Wuhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Over seven million people living in
Wuhan breathed a welcome sigh of relief this morning after the
third Yangtze River flood crest passed the city.
</P>
<P>
The Hankou Hydrological Station reported the water level has
dropped since peaking at 28.96 meters, some 0.77 meters below the
1954 record high, around 04:00 hours (Beijing time) this morning.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains over the past several months have caused some
of the most severe flooding in the nation. The water level in the
large industrial center surpassed the 1931 record by climbing to
28.3 meters on July 25. The record fell once again with the water
level rising by yet another 0.5 meters over the next three days.
</P>
<P>
Sections of embankments along the Yangtze often rise as much as
six meters above the level of downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the the Central Meteorological Station are calling
for rainfall in the Yangtze River area to subside over the next
few days, with no threat of torrential rains mentioned in the
short- to medium-term forecasts.
</P>
<P>
However, Tang Huifang, deputy director of the station, warned
of lingering danger. "We must not relax our vigilance since even a
small amount of rain will further exacerbate the already serious
flood situation along the Yangtze," according to Tang.
</P>
<P>
The third flood crest continues to move downstream and
neighboring Jiangxi Province is currently bracing for the
onslaught of even more serious flooding. Late reports indicate
a steady rise in the water level at Lake Boyang, near Jiujiang.
</P>
<P>
A state of emergency has been in effect in Jiangxi for the past
three days and the local government has drafted emergency plans in
cases involving extreme danger.

<P>
Driving licenses can also be used as identity documents.
</P>

Any violation of the law, including failure to apply for an
identity card in due time, unauthorized altering or damaging

WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Tuesday
imposed sanctions on seven Russian enterprises which are alleged
to have helped Iran develop its missile program.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton signed an executive order that bars
assistance to the seven Russian enterprises, as well as exports to
and imports from them.
</P>
<P>
"Today's executive order ... will allow us to respond more
effectively to evidence that foreign entities around the world,
such as these Russian entities, have assisted in the transfer of
dangerous weapons and weapons technologies," Clinton said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed the executive order under increasing pressures
from Congressional Republicans, who said Iran's medium-range
missile test last week jeopardized U.S. security.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority leader Trent
Lott urged Clinton in a letter on Monday to impose sanctions
against nine Russian enterprises. They threatened a veto showdown
with the White House if Clinton failed to issue the sanctions soon.
</P>
<P>
The White House responded that it would impose trade sanctions
on only seven enterprises. They are: the INOR scientific center,
the Grafit and Ployus research institutes, Glavkosmos, the MOSO
company, the Baltic State Technical University and Europalace
2000.

<HEADLINE> Half of Steel Plants Close Down in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's steel industry has shut
down about 50 percent of operations with 5,000 personal being laid
off because of a drastic drop in domestic market demand and no
export potential, according to the Steel Industry Club under the
Federation of Thai Industries.
</P>
<P>
The club's vice chairman Visuth Chirayudh was quoted Wednesday
by The Nation as saying that manufacturers had run into trouble
because they rely mainly on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
he said The economic crisis and the ailing property sector has
sent steel consumption plunging by more than 50 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Steel producers who have survived include hot and cold-rolled
steel sheet plants run by Sahaviriya Steel and NTS Steel because
they remain export oriented. But steel bar producers are facing
difficult conditions because they cannot compete against the
shrinking world market price.
</P>
<P>
However, the remaining steel plants have had to cut production
by half in accordance with falling consumption.
</P>
<P>
Visuth said most closed steel plants produce wire rods, shaped
steel and rolled bars which largely rely on the domestic market
demand. Of the 80 factories producing rolled bars, half have
closed down.
</P>
<P>
The club expected more plants will be closed down. Though, the
Thai government tried to expedite payment to construction
contractors, it was of little help to the industry.

accounted for the vast majority of related visitors to the
well-known birthplace of many overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
However, the local tourism sector has faced difficulties
resulting from the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
For example, the number of tourists from the Philippines fell
16 percent during the first half of the year, with a 13 percent
drop in tourists from Thailand, 14 percent decline from Malaysia
and dramatic 40 percent fall from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The province has attempted to offset losses by developing
overseas tourist markets in Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, as well as
markets in the Americas, Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
The extensive effort attracted 39,200 tourists from Singapore
during the first half of this year, the largest number overseas
from any one country or region.
</P>
<P>
The number of Japanese tourists grew by 6.9 percent to 25,800,
with the number of U.S. tourists growing by 19.5 percent to 11,700
and visitors from Europe up 19.1 percent.

MONTEVIDEO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Montevideo's downtown area has
turned into a garbage dump because of a strike by garbage
collectors.
</P>
<P>
The sanitation workers from the Empresa Sur company, contracted
for cleaning the capital of Uruguay, started their strike on July
24, demanding a 20 percent wage increase. They complained that
their wages had not been increased for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The authorities promised a wage increase of 15 percent to the
lower-ranking employees and a 10 percent increase to the highest
group, from July 1, and another two percent increase for everyone
from October 1.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal was rejected by the workers who decided to
continue the strike until the authorities met their demands.
</P>
<P>
Montevideo produces about 150 tons of garbage a day, of which
100 tons comes from domestic collections and the rest from
commerce and street sweeping.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Chile is likely
to rise to 7 percent by the end of the year, said the National
Statistics Institute (NSI) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase, over the 5.6 percent jobless rate registered in
March through May, was attributed to the impact brought by the
ongoing Asian financial crisis onto this country.
</P>
<P>
From March to May, the latest months that job statistics are
currently available, the highest unemployment rate of 11 percent,
nearly double the national average, was among those aged 20-24.
</P>
<P>
And in the months to come, as there is a gap between the
capacity of the economy to create new jobs and the number of
people entering the labor market, joblessness among youth could
reach 14 percent.

LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- British athlete Solomon Wariso, who
was picked for the 400 meters at the European Championships, might
have a chance to take part in the Commonwealth Games if he could
be cleared by a Commonwealth drug panel.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Wariso was sent home from the European Championships
in Helsinki and was forced to miss the Commonwealth Games a few
weeks later, after he had tested positive for a banned substance.
</P>
<P>
The British Olympic Association (BOA) and the Commonwealth
Games Council for England (CGCE) refuse to select anyone found
guilty of a doping offence.
</P>
<P>
But Wariso told the BOA it was an isolated, minor infringement
and that he was cleared to take part in the 1996 Atlanta Summer
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The British women's athletics team for the Commonwealth Games
was bolstered by the inclusion of Diane Modahl, who returns to the
competition field four years after being sent home from the
Commonwealth Games in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Modahl, the 1990 Commonwealth 800 meters winner in Auckland,
has been protesting her innocence since her expulsion from the

<HEADLINE> Human Cancer Genetics Research Databases to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The University of
California-Irvine (UCI) Medical School has been chosen to develop
and manage two of the most comprehensive human cancer genetics
research databases.
</P>
<P>
Grants from the National Cancer Institute for the two centers
total 6 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The UCI said that the Internet-based informatics systems will
contain data on hundreds of thousands of people who are
genetically predisposed to cancer, as well as data on tissue
samples, educational materials and other resources designed to
increase the world's understanding of the genetic basis of cancer.
</P>
<P>
The two centers will make an unprecedented collaboration among
leading clinicians, basic scientists, epidemiologists, genetic
counselors and community medical organizations.
</P>
<P>
By integrating basic research, clinical research, genetic
counseling and education at both the academic and community
levels, UCI said, the network will help ensure a coherent approach
to understanding and fighting cancer.
</P>
<P>
All cancers are believed to be linked to some weakness in a
person's DNA although 95 percent of them are not inherited.
Researchers hope those whose information on ethnic backgrounds,
family histories and genetic makeups is contained in the systems
will one day tell them why some people get cancer and others do
not.
</P>
<P>
The UCI Medical School will collaborate with the Cancer
Genetics Network, a national coalition of eight medical centers,
in identifying every major human gene that predisposes people to
cancer and using that information to prevent and treat the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The UCI has been known for programs in human cancer genetics
research, which include a comprehensive biospecimen bank, a
genetics informatics system and a consortium of nationally
recognized research laboratories. It also has a history of working
with community medical organizations to integrate new information
into treatment and counseling services for patients.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday urged
the Cambodian authorities to investigate charges of election fraud
leveled by leaders of the country's two opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
"The charges of fraud and irregularities leveled by Prince
(Norodom) Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy are serious allegations," State
Department spokesman James Rubin said. "We are urging the
Cambodian authorities to investigate them thoroughly, to ensure
that the results reflect the will of the Cambodian people."
</P>
<P>
He said Hun Sen's claim of a victory was "premature in the
extreme" because a large percentage of the votes had not been
counted.
</P>
<P>
Full preliminary results of Sunday's vote are not due out until
Saturday but some partial results have already been published
indicating the ruling Cambodian People's Party under Hun Sen had
taken a strong lead.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh and his ally Sam Rainsy have accused Hun Sen's
People's Party of fraud and demanded fresh polls in some areas.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Works to Form Albanian Leadership Team in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States will help
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians form an "all-party executive" for
negotiations with Serbia to end the fighting, the State Department
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, told reporters
that Christopher Hill, U.S. ambassador to Yugoslavia, was working
with the Albanians in Kosovo for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
"There are signs that he will be able to put together an
all-party executive that will have responsibilities to include
negotiations with the Serbs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin enunciated three principles for the executive: it would
be headed by ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who is
considered a moderate; it would be based and run from Kosovo's
capital Pristina rather than by Albanians outside Kosovo; and it
would reflect all viewpoints across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Hill met Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic twice in
the past two days and sent a clear message to him: not let the
situation spin out of control.
</P>
<P>
Clashes in recent days between Yugoslav security forces and
guerrillas of the independence-seeking Kosovo Liberation Army have
forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the number of internally displaced people in Kosovo
could now be as high as 100,000, including some 75,000 trapped by
the fighting.

<HEADLINE> GM, UAW Reach Tentative Agreement to End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- General Motors Corp. and the
United Auto Workers (UAW) tentatively settled disputes Tuesday at
two auto parts plants at Flint, Michigan, according to an AP
report.
</P>
<P>
But negotiators were still working on the final details of a
settlement to a dispute at two brake plants in Dayton, Ohio, union
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The strikes, which began last month, have brought GM's North
American assembly operations to a virtual halt and have cost the
company an estimated 2.2 billion U.S. dollars in lost profits.
</P>
<P>
GM, the nation's largest automaker had insisted that any deal
to end the Flint strikes must also resolve the festering disputes
in Dayton and Indianapolis. GM has said it made no sense to settle
the strikes in Flint and then face the potential of additional
strikes.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the two parts plants in Flint, issues at the Buick
City complex in Flint and a stamping plant in Indianapolis were
tentatively settled, said UAW sources in Flint.
</P>
<P>
The framework for a settlement appeared to be shaping up. One
proposal being discussed would have GM promise not to close the
Delphi Flint East parts plant and two Delphi brake plants in
Dayton, Ohio, for up to five years.
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the UAW would agree to a four-year national
contract in 1999, rather than the traditional three-year pact,
said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. But that
proposal remained under discussion and was still subject to
change, a union source said.
</P>
<P>
About 9,200 workers went on strike from June 5 at the Flint
Metal Center stamping plant, and at Delphi Flint East six days
later. Some 26 plants out of the total 29 GM plants in North
America have been idled as a result of the strike.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Plans to Build New Sugar Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is planning
to construct four new sugar factories and expand the capacity of
the existing ones, a senior official from the Agriculture
Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, there is excess cane available for crushing and
immediate plans are for capacity expansion for most of the sugar
factories as well as construction of new ones," said Agriculture
Permanent Secretary Philemon Mwaisaka.
</P>
<P>
The four new factories to be constructed include the proposed
Busia Sugar Factory and others in Trans Mara, Kericho and
Kakamega districts, southeastern Kenya, he said at the National
Sugar Research Center near Kisumu bordering Lake Victoria,
according to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The Busia Sugar Factory is to have a capacity to crush 4,200
tons of cane per day.
</P>
<P>
On expansion, Migori's Sony Sugar Factory crushing capacity
will be more than doubled from the current 3,000 tons per day to
6,200 tons.
</P>
<P>
National consumption of sugar in Kenya per year stands at
560,000 tons while local total production is about 400,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
However, after the market liberalization since 1990s, Kenya's
sugar industry bore the brunt as so-called transit sugar dumps in
the local market.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, sugar industry officials in the east African country
complained over a marketing crisis facing with leading Kenyan
sugar companies due to flooding of cheap imports.

be the latest in a torrent of multibillion-dollar mergers in the
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
Just two days ago, AT&AMP;T Corp. and British Telecommunications PLC
unveiled a new global venture to combine their international
operations and sell a range of services to large multinational
companies.
</P>
<P>
The merger would combine Bell Atlantic's dominance of local
telephone services from Main to Virginia with GTE's unique offering
of both local and long-distance services to mostly rural and
suburban areas scattered across the nation.
</P>
<P>
GTE is the third-largest local phone service provider in the
United States after Bell Atlantic and SBC with about 21 million
local phone customers in 28 states, mostly in suburban and other
less-populated areas.
</P>
<P>
The addition of GTE would enable Bell Atlantic to crack the
long-distance market but initially only in GTE areas.

<HEADLINE> World Refugees at 22 million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Over 22 million refugees
and other dispossessed people are counting on international
support, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata
said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 1998 session of the U.N. Economic and Social
Council (ECOSOC), she said crucial repatriation and reintegration
programs in many African countries are seriously affected by
underfunding.
</P>
<P>
"There is great concern about declining support for our
general programs," she said.
</P>
<P>
While no major refugee outflow has occurred in the last year,
UNHCR has had to face a very large number of smaller emergencies.
Over 50 emergency missions were dispatched to at least 11
different operations around the world, according to her report.
</P>
<P>
Of the current emergency roster members, 65 percent have been
deployed against only 20 percent in the previous two years.
